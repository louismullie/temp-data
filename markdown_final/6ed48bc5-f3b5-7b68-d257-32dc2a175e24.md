## Question

Elevated liver alkalinity phosphate isoenzyme

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret and manage an elevated "liver alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the abnormality and excluding pre-analytical error. Then, I should verify the hepatic origin of the alkaline phosphatase using GGT or isoenzyme fractionation. Next, I will consider age- and sex-specific reference intervals and physiologic contributors. After that, I should classify the pattern of liver injury and build a prioritized differential. Then, I will outline a staged diagnostic workup, including imaging and serologies. Finally, I will address special populations, define thresholds for biopsy or referral, and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, making sure I double-check each step against guidelines and evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and its magnitude, because I need to ensure we are not reacting to a spurious result. I should repeat the liver panel to verify persistence, review prior results for chronicity, and check for hemolysis or lipemia that could artifactually elevate ALP; I also need to ask about recent meals, fasting status, and sample handling, since these can affect assays and interpretation, and I should remember that ALP is produced by liver, bone, intestine, kidney, and placenta, so an isolated ALP bump demands cautious sourcing before labeling it "liver" disease [^a080bacb] [^584fd32f].

> Wait, let me verify the hepatic origin next, because I should not assume an ALP elevation is liver-related without corroboration. The most efficient next step is to obtain a GGT; if GGT is elevated, that supports a hepatobiliary source, whereas a normal GGT pushes me to consider bone, intestinal, or placental sources, and if uncertainty remains, I can order ALP isoenzyme electrophoresis to separate liver, bone, and intestinal fractions, recognizing that isoenzyme testing is slower and less available in some settings [^c1d63df8] [^584fd32f] [^973bd20c].

> Hold on, I should verify age- and sex-specific reference intervals before I overcall disease. ALP is physiologically higher in children and adolescents due to bone turnover, in pregnancy from placental ALP, and can be modestly higher in older adults; using appropriate reference ranges avoids unnecessary workups, and in pediatrics, I need to consider growth spurts and bone disease when interpreting isolated ALP elevations [^c5c7173a] [^584fd32f].

> I will now examine the pattern of liver injury, because this guides the differential. A cholestatic pattern is defined by a disproportionate ALP elevation relative to AST/ALT, and I should calculate the R ratio (ALT/ULN divided by ALP/ULN) to classify hepatocellular (R ≥ 5), mixed (2 < R < 5), or cholestatic (R ≤ 2) injury; this classification helps prioritize causes and testing, and I should double-check that I am using the correct ULN denominators for the specific lab [^d1ade2b6] [^9f945fab].

> Let me think about the differential for a confirmed hepatic ALP elevation. Extrahepatic obstruction from stones, strictures, or malignancy is common and often shows ductal dilatation on imaging; intrahepatic cholestasis includes primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, drug-induced cholestasis, and infiltrative diseases; I should also keep in mind sarcoidosis, which can present with cholestatic liver tests and granulomas, and I must not forget that NAFLD can occasionally present with isolated ALP elevations, particularly in older women [^c1d63df8] [^bffc0f7b] [^3c389396] [^1a5a2edb].

> Next, I should review a staged diagnostic workup, starting with noninvasive tests. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is first-line to assess for biliary dilatation, masses, or infiltrative disease; if ducts are dilated, I should proceed to MRCP or ERCP for definitive cholangiography, whereas if ducts are normal, I should pivot to intrahepatic causes and order autoimmune serologies including AMA for PBC, and ANA/SMA for autoimmune hepatitis or overlap, plus hepatitis B and C testing, and I should also scrutinize medications and supplements for drug-induced cholestasis, using the R ratio to phenotype the injury pattern [^c1d63df8] [^927019e1] [^6ff95011].

> But wait, what if the ALP is not from liver at all. I should double-check for bone disease when GGT is normal, considering vitamin D deficiency, Paget's disease, metastatic bone disease, or hyperparathyroidism, and I should remember benign familial hyperphosphatasemia, a rare inherited condition with persistent ALP elevation due to intestinal and/or bone isoenzymes that requires no treatment once recognized; in infants and children, I need to ensure I do not misattribute ALP to cholestasis when bone turnover is the driver [^d69fc4a8] [^584fd32f] [^c5c7173a].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, placental ALP elevates from the second trimester and can reach 2–3× ULN without indicating disease; in older adults, I should maintain a low threshold for malignancy and infiltrative disease; in children, I should prioritize congenital biliary disease, metabolic disorders, and bone disease; in COVID-19, ALP elevations are less common than transaminase rises but can occur and correlate with severity; in cystic fibrosis, persistent ALP and GGT elevations warrant surveillance for CF hepatobiliary disease and fibrosis risk [^584fd32f] [^35eba149] [^58349f4a].

> Hold on, I should verify thresholds for escalation. If ALP is persistently greater than 2× ULN with a confirmed hepatic source and noninvasive evaluation is unrevealing, I should consider liver biopsy to clarify diagnosis and stage disease, and if cholestasis remains unexplained beyond 6 months, I should refer to hepatology; conversely, mild, stable ALP elevations between 1–2× ULN with reassuring imaging and serologies can be observed with interval reassessment, but I should not dismiss persistent abnormalities without a plan [^927019e1] [^a080bacb].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. First, confirm the abnormality and its hepatic origin before committing to a liver workup. Second, use age- and sex-specific ranges to avoid overdiagnosis. Third, classify the injury pattern with the R ratio to guide testing. Fourth, start with ultrasound and escalate to MRCP/ERCP or biopsy as indicated. Fifth, tailor the differential to the clinical context and special populations. And sixth, avoid anchoring on a single value; integrate history, medications, and longitudinal trends to reach a safe, cost-effective diagnosis and follow-up plan [^a080bacb] [^d1ade2b6] [^c1d63df8].

An elevated liver alkaline phosphatase (ALP) isoenzyme reflects **cholestatic or infiltrative liver disease** [^c1d63df8] and is confirmed by a concurrent GGT elevation [^a080bacb] or isoenzyme analysis [^584fd32f]. The next step is a **right upper quadrant ultrasound** [^d6a25fc0] to assess for biliary obstruction or mass lesions; if normal, evaluate for intrahepatic causes such as PBC, PSC, sarcoidosis, or drug-induced cholestasis [^bffc0f7b] [^3c389396] [^6ff95011]. Persistent unexplained elevations (> 6 months) warrant **MRCP/ERCP and liver biopsy** [^927019e1] [^a080bacb]. Management targets the underlying cause, with ursodeoxycholic acid for PBC [^notfound] and removal of offending drugs for DILI [^6ff95011].

## Physiological and pathological sources of ALP isoenzymes

ALP is a membrane-bound glycoprotein with **four isoenzymes**: tissue-nonspecific (liver, bone, kidney), intestinal, placental, and germ cell [^55c87246]. The liver isoenzyme is produced by cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, and its elevation reflects biliary epithelial injury or cholestasis [^584fd32f].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated liver ALP isoenzyme

An elevated liver ALP isoenzyme is a marker of **cholestatic or infiltrative liver disease** [^c1d63df8], including:

- **Extrahepatic biliary obstruction**: Choledocholithiasis, strictures, malignancy (pancreatic, cholangiocarcinoma) [^bd82a380].
- **Intrahepatic cholestasis**: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), sarcoidosis, drug-induced cholestasis [^bffc0f7b] [^3c389396] [^6ff95011].
- **Infiltrative diseases**: Malignancy (lymphoma, metastases), granulomatous disease [^c9eba59d].

---

## Diagnostic approach to elevated liver ALP isoenzyme

### Step 1: confirm hepatic origin

Confirm the hepatic origin with **GGT**, which rises with hepatobiliary ALP but not with bone or placental ALP [^b59e34c7]. If GGT is normal, consider bone disease or benign familial hyperphosphatasemia [^d69fc4a8]. Isoenzyme electrophoresis can differentiate liver, bone, intestinal, and placental fractions when the source remains unclear [^584fd32f].

---

### Step 2: initial imaging

Obtain a **right upper quadrant ultrasound** [^d6a25fc0] to assess for biliary dilatation, stones, strictures, or mass lesions [^c1d63df8]. Dilated ducts suggest extrahepatic obstruction; non-dilated ducts suggest intrahepatic cholestasis or infiltrative disease [^c1d63df8].

---

### Step 3: evaluate intrahepatic causes

If ultrasound is normal, evaluate for intrahepatic cholestasis with:

- **Autoimmune markers**: AMA for PBC; ANA, ASMA for autoimmune hepatitis [^bffc0f7b].
- **Cholangiography**: MRCP or ERCP for PSC or small duct disease [^bffc0f7b].
- **Drug history**: Identify hepatotoxic medications or supplements [^6ff95011].
- **Liver biopsy**: Consider if serology and imaging are inconclusive or to stage disease [^a080bacb].

## Clinical conditions associated with elevated liver ALP isoenzyme

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Extrahepatic obstruction | - Choledocholithiasis <br/> - Biliary strictures <br/> - Pancreatic cancer <br/> - Cholangiocarcinoma [^bd82a380] |
| Intrahepatic cholestasis | - Primary biliary cholangitis <br/> - Primary sclerosing cholangitis <br/> - Sarcoidosis <br/> - Drug-induced cholestasis [^bffc0f7b] [^3c389396] [^6ff95011] |
| Infiltrative diseases | - Lymphoma <br/> - Metastatic cancer <br/> - Granulomatous hepatitis [^c9eba59d] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Extrahepatic obstruction**: ERCP with stone extraction or stenting; surgical resection for malignancy [^c1d63df8].
- **PBC**: Ursodeoxycholic acid; obeticholic acid for incomplete responders [^notfound].
- **PSC**: Supportive care; consider ERCP for dominant strictures; liver transplantation for advanced disease [^notfound].
- **Drug-induced cholestasis**: Discontinue offending agent; supportive care [^6ff95011].

---

## Prognostic implications

Persistent ALP elevation is associated with worse outcomes in chronic liver disease, including **higher risks of cirrhosis, liver failure, and mortality** [^notfound]. In PBC, ALP response to therapy is a surrogate for improved survival and reduced transplantation risk [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should track **ALP and GGT** to assess treatment response and disease progression [^notfound]. Persistent unexplained elevations (> 6 months) warrant repeat imaging, MRCP/ERCP, or liver biopsy [^927019e1].

---

An elevated liver ALP isoenzyme signals cholestatic or infiltrative liver disease; confirm the hepatic origin, image the biliary tree, and pursue disease-specific serology and, when needed, biopsy to guide targeted therapy and improve outcomes.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^c1d63df8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^c111ccf7]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### Markers of cholestasis… [^973bd20c]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

It is especially important to remember that in patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, the serum AST level is almost never greater than 500 U per L and the serum ALT value is almost never greater than 300 U per L. The reasons for these limits on AST and ALT elevations are not well understood. In typical viral or toxic liver injury, the serum ALT level rises more than the AST value, reflecting the relative amounts of these enzymes in hepatocytes. However, in alcoholic hepatitis, the ratio of AST to ALT is greater than 1 in 90 percent of patients and is usually greater than 2. 17 The higher the AST-to-ALT ratio, the greater the likelihood that alcohol is contributing to the abnormal LFTs. In the absence of alcohol intake, an increased AST-to-ALT ratio is often found in patients with cirrhosis. The elevated AST-to-ALT ratio in alcoholic liver disease results in part from the depletion of vitamin B.

Markers of Cholestasis Cholestasis results from the blockage of bile ducts or from a disease that impairs bile formation in the liver itself. AP and γ-glutamyltransferase levels typically rise to several times the normal level after several days of bile duct obstruction or intrahepatic cholestasis. The highest liver AP elevations — often greater than 1, 000 U per L, or more than six times the normal value — are found in diffuse infiltrative diseases of the liver such as infiltrating tumors and fungal infections. 22, 23 If the origin of an elevated serum AP level is in doubt, the isoenzymes of AP can be separated by electrophoresis. However, this process is expensive and usually unnecessary because an elevated liver AP value is usually accompanied by an elevated GGT level, an elevated 5′-nucleotidase level and other LFT abnormalities. In one study, 24 isolated AP elevations were evaluated in an unselected group of patients at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

Most mild AP elevations resolved within six months, and almost all greater elevations had an evident cause that was found on routine clinical evaluation. Persistently elevated liver AP values in asymptomatic patients, especially women, can be caused by primary biliary cirrhosis, which is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small bile ducts. Serum antimitochondrial antibody is positive in almost all of these patients.

### Persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase [^ff84e3bc]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old overweight asymptomatic man was found to have a persistently raised serum alkaline phosphatase at 250–300&emsp14; U/l (normal range < 130). Other liver function tests were unremarkable apart from an initial marginally elevated alanine transaminase, which normalised with weight reduction. Abdominal imaging revealed a fatty liver but an extensive serological search for significant hepatobiliary disease was negative. Subsequent isoenzyme electrophoresis revealed normal liver and bone fractions of alkaline phosphatase but a grossly elevated intestinal fraction. Elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase should be considered in the investigation of unexplained alkaline phosphatase, particularly when the usual associated hepatobiliary and bony pathologies are not present. Although an elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase can be linked to significant gastrointestinal pathology, this case report highlights that it can be a benign biochemical finding.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^9f945fab]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^e92205a1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^f4df55e8]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hundreds of drugs are associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI), which has a wide spectrum of clinical and biochemical manifestations, ranging from transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferases (TAEAT) to acute liver failure. Most cases (> 90%) of DILI resolve fully within several weeks after drug discontinuation, although some cases can persist as chronic low-level enzyme elevations for 6 to 12 months despite the drug cessation. Drug adaptation may also occur, defined as the phenomenon whereby an agent fails to cause progressive worsening of DILI beyond what are generally transient, low-level, asymptomatic reversible alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations despite the drug continuation.

Although international working groups have defined threshold levels of ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to distinguish acute DILI from mild elevations, the clinical significance of higher level (ie, grade 3 [G3] and grade 4 [G4]) asymptomatic transient elevations has not been extensively studied, especially in oncology. In addition, there are gaps in the understanding of mechanisms leading to significantly elevated aminotransferase levels, specifically in cases of asymptomatic and transient presentations without clinical signs of hepatocyte damage.

Herein, TAEAT is used to indicate the occurrence of transient asymptomatic G3 and G4 elevations in aminotransferases (ALT and/or AST) without associated elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase or corresponding histologic liver abnormalities. A review of TAEAT in oncology clinical trials and clinical practice is provided. In addition, the gaps in our current understanding of the phenomenon are identified, including those areas where consensus guidelines and practical suggestions for clinicians involved in managing oncology patients with elevated aminotransferases may offer value.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^5b449e9b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^a080bacb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^f8c52eff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Genome-wide association study of serum liver enzymes implicates diverse metabolic and liver pathology [^0af3fc29]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Liver disease and its most serious complications of acute liver failure, cirrhosis, and liver cancer are leading and rising causes of mortality worldwide. Liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are the most commonly-used laboratory indicators of liver disease and are increased in most common liver diseases. ALT and AST are traditionally considered markers of hepatocellular injury and ALP a marker of cholestasis. Liver enzyme elevations have been associated with greater liver-related mortality – and are used in clinical practice guidelines to direct treatment decisions in liver disease –. Beyond liver disease, the presence of elevated liver enzymes has been associated with increased all-cause mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

Liver enzymes are partially genetically-determined, with heritability estimated around 0.5 based on twin studies. Previously-published exome- or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of genetic variants influencing liver enzyme concentrations identified loci in/near genes affecting bile acid transport, lipid/carbohydrate metabolism, glycobiology, and the immune system. A more detailed understanding of genetic risk factors for liver enzymes may identify further mechanisms and pathways to yield deeper insight into the biology of liver diseases as well as identify those at high risk due to their genome. However, the existing studies on this topic utilized relatively small cohorts.

We aimed to further characterize the genetic architecture of liver disease with a GWAS to identify loci associated with ALT, AST, or ALP, using two cohorts with in total almost ten times as many participants than those of previously-published liver enzyme GWAS. In this work, we identify 378 loci associated with ALT, AST, and/or ALP at genome-wide significance. These loci are implicated in diverse metabolic and liver-related pathology, and are expressed in a wide range of cell types within the liver.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^584fd32f]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1-2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

Serum elevations of ALT activity are rarely observed, except in parenchymal liver disease since ALT is a more liver-specific enzyme than aspartate aminotransferase. and increased secretion of mineralocorticosteroids. Hyperkalemia is associated with oliguria, anuria, and urinary obstruction. Low serum chloride values are associated with salt-losing nephritis; Addisonian crisis, prolonged vomiting, and metabolic acidosis caused by excessive production or diminished excretion of acids. High serum chloride values are associated with dehydration and conditions causing decreased renal blood flow, such as congestive heart failure.

The method to measure alkaline phosphatase utilizes a simple reaction wherein ALP acts upon a substrate in the presence of magnesium and zinc activators to form a colored product whose appearance is measured at 450 nm. The rate of p-nitrophenol formation is directly related to the amount of alkaline phosphatase in the specimen. Chloride is measured using an indirect by the instrument prior to analysis) ion-selective electrode method for determination of the serum electrolyte concentrations. Potassium ion concentration is measured by electrolyte activity in solution. This method utilizes an indirect ion-selective electrode method for determination of the serum electrolyte concentrations.

Sodium Total Bilirubin The method to measure total bilirubin is coupled with 3, 5-dichlorophenyl diazonium in the presence of a solubilizing agent in a strongly acidic medium. The intensity of the red azo dye formed is directly proportional to the total bilirubin and can be determined photometrically.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^37f87728]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Alkaline phosphatase: discovery and naming of our favorite enzyme [^2acf770d]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase can be considered "our favorite enzyme" for reasons apparent to those who diagnose and treat metabolic bone diseases or who study skeletal biology. Few might know, however, that alkaline phosphatase likely represents the most frequently assayed enzyme in all of medicine. Elevated activity in the circulation is universally recognized as a marker for skeletal or hepatobiliary disease. Nevertheless, the assay conditions in many ways are nonphysiological. The term alkaline phosphatase emerged when it became necessary to distinguish "bone phosphatase" from the phosphatase in the prostate that features an acidic pH optimum. Beginning in 1948, studies of the inborn-error-of-metabolism hypophosphatasia would identify the natural substrates and establish the physiological role of alkaline phosphatase, including in biomineralization. Here, we recount the discovery in 1923 and then eventual naming of this enzyme that remains paramount in our field. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations — primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is described as "an uncommon chronic liver disease" that "is seen more commonly in women than men", with symptoms such as "fatigue and pruritus". Testing highlights cholestasis and characteristic serology: "Lab testing reveals biochemical evidence of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevation of bilirubin), as well as the serologic hallmark for screening and diagnosis: immunoglobulin M and PBC-specific anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in up to 95% of patients (64)". Histology is selective: "Liver biopsy is not routinely required although may be beneficial in patients with suspected anti-mitochondrial antibody-negative disease and to stage liver fibrosis".

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^6a130be4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### Patient-derived reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase to support appropriate utility for isoenzymes determinations and hypophosphatasia [^c5c7173a]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appropriate age- and sex-specific reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are essential to identify patients with hypophosphatasia (low ALP) and to avoid unnecessary ALP isoenzymes analysis (elevated ALP). This study used patient ALP historical data to statistically derive sex- and age-specific reference intervals.

Methods

The ALP values reported as part of clinical management during an 18 month period (from July 2021 to March 2023) were obtained. Following logarithmic transformation of ALP data and repeated removal of outliers, cumulative frequency plots were generated using a modified Hoffmann approach to derive age- and sex-specific reference intervals.

Results

Age-specific ALP reference intervals ranged from 110 to 250 and 120 to 295 U/L for males and females < 15 days old, 80 to 400 and 90 to 380 U/L for males and females 15 days to 1 year old, 105 to 280 and 90 to 290 U/L for males and females 1 to 10 years old, 75 to 300 and 90 to 300 U/L for males and females 10 to 13 years old, 80 to 300 and 60 to 175 U/L for males and females 13 to 15 years old, 55 to 150 and 60 to 180 U/L for males and females 15 to 18 years old, and 55 to 140 and 60 to 147 U/L for male and female adults, respectively (> 18 years old).

Conclusion

By applying derived ranges, a retrospective review of ALP isoenzymes would eliminate 24.5% of requests. Additionally, 9 neonates would have required investigation for possible hypophosphatasia.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^b59e34c7]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate and pancreas but not in bone; therefore it can be useful in confirming that an elevated ALP is of liver and not bony origin.GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^abd53d51]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^38621a59]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### The liver in COVID-19: prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact on outcomes of liver test abnormalities [^e1c0bd67]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic unprecedented in over a century, with ≈35 million cases, and more than 1 million deaths globally. Though predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest.

Objective

To define prevalence, pattern, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Methods

Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 April 2020. Association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical and biochemical predictors, was examined.

Results

Data were available on 551 patients. Prevalence of any or ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal transaminase elevation on was 61.2 and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1 and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4 and 12.6%, respectively), and at peak (17.7 and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impact on mortality with AST positively, and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs.

Conclusion

LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 are very common, though majority are mild. Admission and peak bilirubin ≥ 1 mg/dl, as well as admission and peak AST:ALT ratio were significant predictors of mortality, along with age, myocardial injury, and chronic medical illness.

### Association between alkaline phosphatase levels and mortality in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases: a retrospective cohort study [^a31ce531]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide, with liver metastasis being the leading cause of mortality. In 2020, approximately 1.9 million new CRC cases and 935,000 deaths were reported globally. In China, the incidence and mortality rates are notably high, with approximately 555,000 new cases and 286,000 deaths in the same year. Liver metastasis occurs in 20%–34% of patients at initial diagnosis, while 50%–60% develop metastases during disease progression. The presence of liver metastases significantly reduces survival rates, with the 5-year survival rate for patients with unresectable disease being less than 5%.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a hydrolase enzyme primarily produced by the liver, bones and placenta, is widely distributed in human tissues. Recent studies highlighted the potential use of ALP as a biomarker for various conditions. Its predictive value extends to non-malignant diseases such as cerebral haemorrhage, orthopaedic disorders and surgical complications. – Notably, elevated ALP levels are correlated with poor prognosis in several malignancies, including lung, liver, prostate and penile cancers, – making ALP an increasingly important tool in cancer prognostication. – Research has also revealed a significant relationship between ALP and carcinoembryonic antigen, which influences the prognosis of liver metastases from CRC. Elevated ALP levels in cases of liver metastasis can signify liver damage caused by invasive tumour cells. Previous single-centre retrospective studies have suggested that serum ALP levels are an independent predictor of overall survival in patients with stage I–IV CRC, excluding those with elevated ALP levels due to liver and kidney diseases. This research gap highlights the need to further investigate the role of ALP in prognostic assessments of patients with CRC and liver metastasis, which may provide a more valuable basis for clinical practice.

Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the association between ALP levels and mortality risk in Chinese patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Our study included 195 patients and considered multiple covariates to provide comprehensive and representative data for the Chinese population. These findings are expected to offer valuable insights for improving the prognostic assessment and personalised treatment strategies for patients with CRLM. The unique aspect of our study design lies in its comprehensive consideration of various clinical and biochemical indicators, aiming to more accurately assess the independent role of ALP in prognostic prediction.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^fdeaf458]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Genome-wide association study of serum liver enzymes implicates diverse metabolic and liver pathology [^fd3b8e47]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Serum liver enzyme concentrations are the most frequently-used laboratory markers of liver disease, a major cause of mortality. We conduct a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of liver enzymes from UK BioBank and BioBank Japan. We identified 160 previously-unreported independent alanine aminotransferase, 190 aspartate aminotransferase, and 199 alkaline phosphatase genome-wide significant associations, with some affecting multiple different enzymes. Associated variants implicate genes that demonstrate diverse liver cell type expression and promote a range of metabolic and liver diseases. These findings provide insight into the pathophysiology of liver and other metabolic diseases that are associated with serum liver enzyme concentrations.

### Prognostic importance of serum alkaline phosphatase in CKD stages 3–4 in a clinical population [^c8a2101c]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated total serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels have been associated with mortality in the general population and in dialysis patients.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting & Participants

28,678 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 and 4 (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 15–59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) were identified using the Cleveland Clinic CKD Registry. CKD was defined as 2 estimated glomerular filtration rate values < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) drawn more than 90 days apart using the CKD-EPI (CKD Epidemiology Collaboration) creatinine equation.

Predictor

ALP levels measured using the calorimetric assay were examined as quartiles (quartile [Q]1, < 66 U/L; Q2, 66–81 U/L; Q3, 82–101 U/L; and Q4, ≥ 102 U/L) and as a continuous measure.

Outcomes & Measurements

All-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were ascertained using the Social Security Death Index and US Renal Data System.

Results

After a median follow-up of 2.2 years, 588 patients progressed to ESRD and 4,755 died. There was a graded increase in risk of mortality with higher ALP quartiles (Q2, Q3, and Q4) compared to the reference quartile (Q1) after adjusting for demographics, comorbid conditions, use of relevant medications, and liver function test results. The highest ALP quartile was associated with an HR for ESRD of 1.38 (95% CI, 1.09–1.76). Each 1-SD (42.7 U/L) higher ALP level was associated with 15% (95% CI, 1.09–1.22) and 16% (95% CI, 1.14–1.18) increased risk of ESRD and mortality, respectively.

Limitations

Single-center observational study; lack of complete data, including parathyroid hormone level, for all study participants, and attrition bias.

Conclusions

Higher serum ALP levels in patients with CKD stages 3–4 were associated independently with all-cause mortality and ESRD.

### Association between elevated liver enzymes and metabolic syndrome among Thai adults [^72ee1263]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2008). Low credibility.

Background

To examine the relation between elevated liver marker concentrations (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], and alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS).

Methods

This cross-sectional study was comprised of 1,391 Thai participants (451 men and 940 women) receiving annual health check-ups. Multivariable logistic regression procedures were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of MetS risk according to quartiles of each liver marker concentration with the lowest quartile specified as the referent group.

Results

Overall, mean concentrations of AST, ALT and ALP increased and mean AST:ALT ratio decreased with increasing presence of metabolic abnormalities (p-value = 0.059 for AST in men, all other p-values < 0.001). After adjusting for confounders, men with ALT concentrations in the extreme quartiles (> 40 units/L), had a 2.77-fold increased risk of MetS (95%CI: 1.18–6.53), as compared with men who had values in the lowest quartile (≤ 21 units/L). The OR for extreme quartiles of ALP concentrations was 3.72 (95%CI: 1.49–9.29). In women, elevated ALT concentrations were also associated with MetS risk. Those with the highest ALT concentrations (> 23 units/L) had a 2.55-fold increased risk of MetS (95%CI: 1.22–5.35) compared to women with concentrations ≤ 13 units/L.

Conclusions

These findings add to an emerging body of literature that suggests elevated liver enzymes may be related with MetS risk. However, prospective studies are needed to more fully determine the practical value of elevated liver enzymes as a clinical risk predictor of MetS and related disorders among Thai adults.

### Benign familial hyperphosphatasemia… [^d69fc4a8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase activity in serum suggests bone or liver disease or a neoplasm but can also indicate pregnancy or another benign condition. A family with benign hyperphosphatasemia was studied to elucidate the genetics and enzyme defect. Serum total alkaline phosphatase activity was greater than the population mean in all six family members, and more than 7 SDs above the mean in two of four offspring. Monoclonal antibodies to three alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes, intestinal, placental, and tissue nonspecific, demonstrated markedly increased intestinal alkaline phosphatase levels in all family members and significantly elevated liver/bone/ kidney activity in the two offspring. Guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of the liver/bone/kidney component showed high alkaline phosphatase activity from liver in both siblings and from bone in one.

The mode of inheritance in this family is obscure, but a complex regulation of the products of two different alkaline phosphatase genes seems likely. Steps toward diagnosis are suggested. Early recognition of this benign biochemical abnormality should help to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests. Siraganian PA, Mulvihill JJ, Mulivor RA, Miller RW. Benign Familial Hyperphosphatasemia.

### The significance of isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in infants and young children [^5098a1e3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance and prognosis of a prolonged isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases without cholestasis (> 3 months) in infants and young children, investigated for a variety of conditions, and to determine a protocol for their follow-up and investigation.

Methods

A combined prospective-retrospective analysis of apparently healthy babies and young children with isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases of at least 1.5 times above the norm for age which persisted for at least 3 months and whose creatine phosphokinase (CK), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels remained normal throughout the study duration. The children underwent the following investigations: abdominal ultrasound and infectious, metabolic and/or immunological investigation depending on the duration of the abnormality.

Results

Six children were eliminated following the finding of positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen in the urine. 72 children were investigated (47 males and 25 females). The duration of serum aminotransferases elevation was 3–36 months (average 12.4, median 11.5 months). The initial, maximal and final alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were 85.5, 140.5 and 39.8 IU/l, respectively. Of seven children who had liver biopsies performed, three (42.8%) were suspected of having a glycogen storage disease which was not confirmed enzymatically. Four biopsies revealed non-specific histological changes.

Conclusions

Isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in healthy looking young children is mostly a benign condition that usually resolves within a year. If no pathology is found during routine investigation, these children can be followed conservatively. Liver biopsy does not contribute much to the diagnosis and is probably unnecessary.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^6ff95011]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Diabetic hepatosclerosis: another diabetes microvascular complication? [^9d03d584]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Liver disease in diabetes is common and is frequently the result of hepatic steatosis. Diabetic hepatosclerosis is a relatively recent description of sinusoidal fibrosis, without steatosis, observed in liver biopsies of people with diabetes presenting with cholestasis. Its association with other microvascular complications suggests it is a form of hepatic diabetic microangiopathy.

Case Report

We report the case of a 50-year-old woman with longstanding Type 1 diabetes, complicated by nephropathy resulting in cadaveric renal transplant, retinopathy, gastroparesis and neuropathy with slowly healing ulceration to her right foot. She was noted to have deranged liver function tests: alanine aminotransferase, 162 IU/l; bilirubin, 44 IU/l; alkaline phosphatase, 5279 IU/l (isoenzymes; bone 1029 IU/l, liver 4250 IU/l); γ-glutamyl transferase, 662 IU/l. A non-invasive liver screen did not reveal the cause of the cholestasis. A liver biopsy demonstrated sinusoidal fibrosis without evidence of steatosis and thus a diagnosis of diabetic hepatosclerosis was made. Comparison with a biopsy performed 11 years previously at a different trust due to elevated alkaline phosphatase levels revealed slow progression of the sinusoidal fibrosis.

Discussion

This case describes the longest reported clinical course of diabetic hepatosclerosis, spanning 11 years, in which time the patient did not develop evidence of cirrhosis or portal hypertension. It is difficult to estimate the clinical relevance of this condition because little is known regarding its clinical course and effect on morbidity and mortality. Identified patients should undergo low-intensity, long-term follow-up to improve understanding of its clinical sequelae and relevance.

### Clinical significance of elevated α-fetoprotein in alaskan native patients with chronic hepatitis C [^0dc1caa4]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is not well defined. We analysed data from a population-based cohort of patients with HCV infection to assess the prevalence of elevated serum AFP, to determine its association with clinical and virologic parameters and with clinical outcomes. We defined a slightly elevated serum AFP level as 8 to < 15 and a high-AFP level as ≥ 15 microg/L. Among 541 HCV-RNA-positive persons, 61 (11%) had a slightly elevated or high AFP at the time of consent. AFP ≥ 8 microg/L was associated with the older age, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio > 1, and higher alkaline phosphatase levels, but not with heavy alcohol use, IV drug use, genotype, viral load or duration of HCV infection. Among 192 persons with an AFP at liver biopsy, 17% had an AFP ≥ 8 microg/L. The sensitivity/specificity of an AFP level ≥ 8 in detecting Ishak 3–6 fibrosis was 39%/95%. Among 372 persons with a minimum of four AFP measurements over 6 years, 5% had persistently elevated AFP > 8 microg/L, 19% had both elevated and normal AFP measurements, and 76% had persistently normal AFP. Elevated AFP at consent was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and end-stage liver disease. Over 6 years of follow-up, persistently elevated AFP was associated with the development of HCC; no person with AFP persistently < 8 microg/mL developed HCC. Serial AFP measurements appear to be useful in identifying persons with advanced fibrosis and help to determine who needs periodic screening with liver ultrasound to detect HCC.

### Genome-wide association study of serum liver enzymes implicates diverse metabolic and liver pathology [^60871303]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

We identified 378 independent loci associated with serum liver enzyme concentrations, of which 160 ALT, 190 AST, and 199 ALP were novel. These loci have diverse pleiotropic effects on human disease, including liver disease, and prioritized genes based on these loci are expressed in all major cell populations in the liver and diverse tissues outside of liver. These findings greatly enhance our understanding of the genetic basis of human liver disease.

Each liver enzyme has a distinct genetic architecture: only 40% of variants associated with more than one liver enzyme at genome-wide significance. ALT and AST were more coheritable than were either ALT and ALP or AST and ALP. Similarly, while only one allele associated with increased ALT and decreased AST at genome-wide significance, there were many more instances where alleles associated with increased ALT or AST were associated with decreased ALP. This is consistent with the idea that elevations in ALT and AST reflect hepatocellular disease while ALP reflects cholestasis. PheWAS and targeted analysis of liver diseases similarly showed distinctions between the different liver enzymes. For example, ALP is in addition to its effects in the liver also important in bone maintenance and intestinal barrier function. Two alleles associated with increased ALP, rs3923-T (SLC17A1 missense mutation) and rs764284-G (near CYP24A1), were associated with mineral metabolism disorders and intestinal malabsorption. SLC17A1 is, among other things, a sodium-phosphate cotransporter that increases phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, which suggests that rs3923-T could affect ALP concentration via phosphate/bone metabolism. CYP24A1 is the primary catabolic enzyme for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and modulation of CYP24A1 may also cause bone disease and contribute to ALP elevations. Similarly, the ALP-associated allele rs2836882-G (near PSMG1, a proteasome assembly chaperone) is associated with ulcerative colitis, which is itself strongly associated with the cholestatic inflammatory liver disease primary sclerosing cholangitis resulting in elevations in alkaline phosphatase. We verified that rs2836882-G is also associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis at genome-wide significance (Fig. 5), suggesting that this association is the most likely mechanism underlying this variant's effect on ALP. Thus, PheWAS may assist in elucidating the disease biology underlying liver enzyme elevation and identifying patterns of associations that mark subtypes of disease.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^47349751]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

How is PBC diagnosed?

Modes and routes of presentation

Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

Figure 1
The BSG/UK-PBC consensus care pathway for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). While care needs always to be personalised to the patient, there are consensus pathways that are important for patients with PBC, which encompass the important 'pillars' of care that are believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

Blood tests

The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (> 95% for both sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart of PBC diagnosis.

Liver biochemistry

PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^b4a7bcd5]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Guidance statements

13 Clinically significant DILI is typically defined as any one of the following: (1) serum AST or ALT > 5× ULN, or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions; (2) total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl along with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP level; or (3) INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP.
14 Most hepatotoxic drugs cause liver injury within the first 6 months of use but occasionally have longer latency intervals or may even present after drug discontinuation (e.g. amoxicillin‐clavulanate). Therefore, evaluation of a patient with suspected DILI should include a detailed medication and HDS history within the 180 days before presentation.
15 Idiosyncratic DILI cases should be categorized by the R value at presentation (R = (ALT/ULN)/(ALP/ULN)) into hepatocellular (R ≥ 5), mixed (2 < R < 5), and cholestatic (R ≤ 2) profiles, which can help guide the evaluation of alternative causes of liver injury.
16 Excluding alternative causes of liver injury is required in all DILI cases, including testing for viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, AIH, and pancreaticobiliary disease.
17 Certain drugs have been associated with specific laboratory and histologic phenotypes, termed signatures which may be useful in causality assessment.
18 We recommend accessing the LiverTox website for a synopsis of the published literature on liver injury due to over 1000 prescription drugs and more than 60 HDS.

Liver biopsy in suspected DILI

Although a liver biopsy is not necessary to diagnose DILI, it can be helpful in excluding other causes of liver disease and in increasing the confidence in a diagnosis of DILI in cases of clinical uncertainty. Certain medications are associated with specific histological patterns of liver injury that can be confirmed on biopsy. Biopsy can also be useful when the liver biochemistries or symptoms do not improve with drug dechallenge or the patient remains jaundiced, and can be used to help assess the severity of liver injury.–Finally, a liver biopsy may help identify other causes of underlying or concomitant diseases that can confound the clinical or biochemical presentation.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease presenting with an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase [^1a5a2edb]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goals

To define a subset of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with isolated elevations in alkaline phophatase.

Background

NAFLD is a common referral to Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists. We have noted a subset of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD who present with an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase instead of the more typical aminotransferase elevations.

Study

A review of the liver biopsy database at Brooke Army Medical Center was performed with the key identifiers of "steatosis" and "steatohepatitis". Patients were separated into 2 groups depending on whether they presented with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (group 1), or more typical aminotransferase elevations (group 2). Multiple variables were analyzed to determine any significant differences between these groups.

Results

A total of 297 liver biopsies were evaluated. Of these, 135 biopsies were included in the study. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients and group 2 had 121 patients. Patients in group 1 were more likely to be older females (P < 0.05). Within group 1, those with steatohepatitis were older than those with steatosis (P < 0.05). When analyzed with regard to histopathology, patients with steatosis in group 1 were more likely female than group 2 patients (P = 0.03). Those with steatohepatitis in group 1 were older than group 2 patients (P = 0.001). Five of the 7 patients with steatohepatitis in group 1 had advanced liver disease at the time of biopsy.

Conclusions

Older female patients with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and risk factors for NAFLD should be evaluated for evidence of significant steatohepatitis.

### Circulating markers of liver function and cardiovascular disease risk [^316990e9]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of serum concentrations of various liver enzymes and other nonenzymatic proteins and metabolites of heme metabolism (eg, bilirubin) is often undertaken in clinical practice. Measurement of these liver function tests is simple, quick, and relatively inexpensive. However, interpreting the liver function test results in patients without evidence of liver disease is often challenging. Concentrations of some of liver enzymes, such as γ-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase, and concentrations of liver-derived metabolites, such as bilirubin, may be influenced by metabolic processes beyond the liver, sometimes making interpretation of the test results difficult. This scenario frequently occurs both in individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease and in patients with known cardiovascular disease, often resulting in the clinicians ignoring the test results. In this brief review, we discuss the evidence for associations between key serum liver function tests and cardiovascular disease risk and where associations are robust; we provide an interpretation for possible mechanistic links between the liver function test and cardiovascular disease.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^a304495c]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

### Guideline review: EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^d3006c51]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

HDS-associated liver toxicity appears to be an emerging determinant of DILI, with wide geographical variability. A prospective study in Iceland purported 16% of DILI related to HDS, while the US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network reported a similar percentage (16%), with an increase from 7% from 2004 to 2005 to 20% in 2013–2014. Further case–control data suggested rates of 4%–5% in studies in Latin Americaand Germany, respectively.

DILI should be classified according to the dominant pattern of liver enzyme derangement; hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed injury (figure 1).

Initially, alanine transferase (ALT) activity (patients ALT/upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (patients ALP/ULN of ALP) is calculated. Then ALT/ALP ratio (R) is determined. Some of the other commonly encountered phenotypes, and characteristic findings and commonly implicated agents are summarised in table 1.

Table 1
Classification of DILI based on liver enzyme derangement

ALT, ALP and bilirubin are the typical indices used to define liver damage, and liver dysfunction in DILI and serial measurements are necessary to portray extent of hepatocellular injury and DILI phase. ALT is sensitive for hepatocyte injury, particularly alongside an elevated bilirubin and this pattern is a reliable biomarker of liver injury in DILI. Elevated aminotransferases do not reflect the extent to which the liver is damaged, particularly in insidious variants of hepatotoxicity such as indolent fibrosis, vascular liver disorders, cirrhosis and microvesicular steatosis secondary to mitochondrial toxicity. Elevated ALP values usually indicate cholestatic damage, which combined with elevated GGT provides evidence the ALP elevation is of hepatic origin. Isolated hyperbilirubinaemia does not qualify as DILI, given possibility of multiple confounding diagnoses. One important consideration is mild transaminase rises that may be apparent in relation to statin therapy, this may simply reflect an adaptive response and does not represent a true DILI. As such, given the benefit of statins in NAFLD(Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and cardiovascular disease such therapies should be continued where feasible.

### Implication of normal liver enzymes in liver disease [^aef209aa]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease is usually asymptomatic until its late stages and also significant hepatic necroinflammation and fibrosis may be present in persistently normal ALT levels HBV, HCV carriers or similarly, in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Given the large number of persons in the general population which may harbor a clinically significant liver disease behind the screen of normal alanine aminotransferase, more attention should be devoted to future research for alternative noninvasive markers of liver damage.

### Transient rise in alkaline phosphatase activity in adults [^a9acd0be]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Benign transient hyperphosphatasia (BTH) is a condition that occurs mainly in infants and children and is characterised by a transient increase of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity up to several fold the adult upper reference limit (URL). The present report concerns BTH in 2 patients, aged 59 and 52 years old, who showed no evidence of bone or liver disease but had an increase in ALP activity up to 20-fold and 13-fold the adult URL, respectively. The diagnosis of BTH in the first case was made retrospectively, and after excluding liver and bone disease. However, in the second case the diagnosis was made early in the course of the disease, by performing an ALP isoenzyme electrophoresis test. Lengthy and extensive investigations were avoided in the second case. These cases highlight the occurrence of this condition in adulthood as well as in infancy and childhood.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: a meta-analysis [^1f310e05]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Aims

The number of cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exceeded seven million worldwide. However, the data describing the global prevalence of liver injury associated with COVID-19 is lacking secondary to the novelty of this ongoing pandemic. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the association between COVID-19 and liver injury.

Methods

A systematic literature search of indexed databases including, PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases from inception to 14 April 2020, was used to identify studies that reported data of liver chemistry in patients diagnosed with COVID 19. The overall prevalence of abnormal liver chemistry and relevant 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the pooled results studies.

Results

Sixty-four studies with 11 245 patients with COVID-19 were included. The pattern of abnormal liver enzymes was notable for higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The overall global prevalence of elevated AST, ALT, total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase was 23.2, 21.2, 9.7, 15.0, and 4.0%, respectively. The prevalence of elevated AST was substantially higher among those with severe cases (45.5%) compared to non-severe cases (15.0%). Co-existing chronic liver disease presented up to 37.6% of patients with COVID-19.

Conclusion

A fourth of COVID-19 patients had elevated liver enzymes and associated with disease severity. Our study may be used as a guide for clinicians and epidemiologists to proactively identify other sources of injury and illness in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Intensive monitoring for liver injury may be needed in cases with severe COVID-19.

### Association between alkaline phosphatase levels and mortality in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases: a retrospective cohort study [^7f1398ff]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The association between ALP and the prognosis of patients with CRC and liver metastases is complex. As an important indicator of liver function, elevated ALP levels are typically associated with liver cell injury and bile stasis. In patients with liver metastasis, metastasis-induced liver cell damage and bile stasis can lead to increased ALP levels. ALP may also directly participate in tumour growth and invasion. In colon cancer cell lines, inhibition of ALP activity results in decreased cell proliferation, colony formation and expression of tumour suppressor genes. ALP may also suppress the function of the immune system, thereby weakening its ability to clear tumours. This suggests that changes in ALP levels may affect the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs, as the action of these drugs partially depends on the function of the immune system. Furthermore, elevated ALP levels may reflect the inflammatory state of the liver, and chronic inflammation is an important factor that promotes tumour progression. ALP is primarily produced in the liver and bones, and malnutrition can affect bone health and liver function. Therefore, changes in the ALP levels may indicate a patient's overall nutritional status. Malnutrition is an important factor affecting cancer prognosis; therefore, there is a connection between ALP and tumour prognosis. These mechanisms may interact with each other and collectively influence the prognosis of patients with CRC with liver metastases.

### Voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [^cb719f77]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Voriconazole, a new antifungal agent, is increasingly being used after HSCT. The hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2C19 plays a significant role in voriconazole metabolism. As CYP2C19 exhibits significant genetic polymorphism, some patients metabolize voriconazole poorly resulting in increased plasma drug levels. The clinical significance of this is unknown, and the utility of monitoring voriconazole levels is unclear. Steady-state trough plasma voriconazole levels were obtained in 25 allogeneic HSCT recipients using an HPLC assay. Patients had drug levels checked once (n = 13), twice (n = 10), or ≥ 3 times (n = 2) 5–18 days (median 10) after starting voriconazole or dose modification. The 41 voriconazole levels were 0.2–6.8 microg/ml (median 1.6); 6 (15%) were < 0.5 (possibly below the in vitro MIC90 for Aspergillus spp.). Voriconazole concentrations correlated with aspartate aminotranferase (AST) (r = 0.5; P = 0.0009) and alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.34; P = 0.03), but not with creatinine, bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Since liver dysfunction is common after HSCT, it was not possible to determine if elevated AST and alkaline phosphatase levels were the cause or the consequence of higher voriconazole levels. We conclude that trough voriconazole levels vary considerably between patients, and suggest monitoring levels in patients receiving voriconazole for confirmed fungal infections, and in those with elevated AST or alkaline phosphatase levels.

In the JUXTAPID clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients treated with JUXTAPID had at least one elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 3× upper limit of normal (ULN). There were no concomitant clinically meaningful elevations of total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), or alkaline phosphatase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

JUXTAPID also increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. The median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID treatment may be a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment and then ALT and AST regularly as recommended. During treatment, adjust the dose of JUXTAPID if the ALT or AST are ≥ 3× ULN. Discontinue JUXTAPID for clinically significant liver toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^e1c41e2e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

### I can feel it in my bones – a case of deranged' liver' function? [^e04544da]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old Asian man was referred to a gastroenterology clinic by his general practitioner following an incidental finding of raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on routine blood testing. His ALP was found to be 198 (NR 35–129) with otherwise normal liver function tests. His past medical history consists of essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes and ischaemic heart disease. He was asymptomatic except for an intermittent ache over his left clavicle, which he had put down to angina. His gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) was normal at 33 (NR 11–50) making bone the most likely source of his raised ALP. Imaging, including x-ray, CT and bone scan, showed an area of abnormality in the left clavicle. The appearances were consistent with fibrous dysplasia. We discuss the interpretation and investigation of deranged 'liver' function tests and suggest a rational and cost-effective diagnostic path to follow.

### Approach to the liver biopsy in the patient with chronic low-level aminotransferase elevations [^ced08fde]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pathologists sometimes encounter a liver biopsy from an asymptomatic patient with unexplained low-level parenchymal liver enzyme elevations. These biopsies often have minor histologic changes but are otherwise almost entirely normal. This can lead to the quandary of whether or not the features are clinically meaningful and how one must formulate a diagnosis from the possibly nonspecific findings of a near-normal biopsy. The following discussion focuses on the histologic changes that can be seen in these biopsies and the practical issues involved in making a diagnosis that provides useful information to the clinician. The literature and textbooks addressing the histologic and clinical features of these cases are reviewed with an emphasis on the clinical implications of finding nonspecific histologic alterations in these patients.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^376f0048]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Bone turnover markers: basic biology to clinical applications [^55c87246]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Bone ALP

Alkaline phosphatases (ALP) are membrane-bound glycoproteins that hydrolyze phosphate monoesters at basic pH. There are 4 isozymes in man; placental, germ cell, intestinal and tissue-nonspecific (liver, bone, and kidney).

The gene for the tissue-nonspecific ALP (TNSALP) (ALPL) is located on chromosome 1. The isoforms for liver, bone, and kidney all have the same amino acid sequence but differ in their posttranslational modification (Fig. 4). Bone ALP is rich in sialic acid residues, unlike the liver isoform (a property that can be used in separation using wheat germ lectin which only binds bone ALP). Bone ALP is a homodimer anchored to the membrane of matrix vesicles and osteoblasts. It is cleaved from the membrane by a phospholipase and then circulates as a soluble homodimer and measured as a marker of bone formation. There are roughly equal amounts of bone and liver ALP in the circulation. Liver ALP shows approximately 20% cross-reactivity in the assay for bone ALP.

Also indicated are the ﬂexible exposed sequence known as the "crown domain"; the N-terminal helix of one subunit that reaches close to the active site of the contralateral subunit; and the location where the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor is attached to the C-terminus of the mature enzyme. © 2015 Millan and Whyte.

The principal substrates for ALP are pyrophosphate (PPi) and pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP). Pyrophosphate is an inhibitor of mineralization. When bone ALP is anchored to the membrane, it hydrolyzes pyrophosphate into phosphate which is the substrate for the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals. Therefore, bone ALP reflects the mineralization phase of bone formation.

Bone ALP has been shown to inactivate osteopontin by dephosphorylation. Osteopontin is a mineralization inhibitor like pyrophosphate and inhibits hydroxyapatite crystal formation and growth, cell adhesion, and migration. The enzyme can also dephosphorylate ATP and lipopolysaccharide, although the significance of these effects is unknown.

### Modest alcohol intake and mortality in individuals with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels: a nationwide cohort study [^f43e40bc]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Liver injury or liver disease is usually asymptomatic until complications of liver failure or portal hypertension develop. Thus, liver function tests, including bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and aminotransferase levels are the mainstay for identifying early liver injury or liver disease. While alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can be produced by organs other than the liver, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is exclusively produced in hepatocytes and widely used as a specific biomarker of liver injury or liver disease. As serum ALT measurement is relatively inexpensive, it is frequently used to screen for or exclude liver disease, and it is common to find asymptomatic individuals with abnormally elevated ALT levels. Subjects with elevated ALT levels are recommended to undergo additional workup to establish the etiology of liver injury. In these subjects, the most common causes of elevated ALT levels are alcohol-associated liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis, and NAFLD. When alcohol-associated liver disease or chronic viral hepatitis are identified as the causes of elevated ALT, current evidence and practice guidelines recommend complete abstinence. In subjects with other causes of elevated ALT levels (mostly subjects with NAFLD), it is controversial if they require complete abstinence and information regarding this issue is limited. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the association of light to moderate alcohol intake on liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality among individuals with elevated ALT levels, but excluding those with excessive alcohol intake or viral hepatitis, using a nationwide population-based cohort.

### Serum alkaline phosphatase elevation as a preoperative sarcopenic biomarker in digestive cancer: a retrospective cohort study [^2e540a88]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Causal inference between serum ALP elevation and sarcopenia in preoperative cancer patients

In this study, an elevated serum ALP level was found to be associated with the development of sarcopenia in preoperative cancer patients. Khan et al. reported that ALP promotes reactions that are directly related to malignant neoplasm metabolism, such as advanced tumor progression and control of apoptosis, but its exact role in physiological functions is unclear. Serum ALP activity is more pronounced in cardiac-metabolic diseases, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease, as well as inflammatory conditions. It is known that patients with cancer are in a chronic inflammatory state induced by various chemical mediators that are released by the malignant cells. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that preoperative elevation of serum ALP levels in patients with cancer is caused by the promotion of inflammation and consequent atrophy of skeletal muscle, leading to sarcopenia. In a previous study involving healthy older adults, an increase in serum ALP levels was found to be a prognostic factor for sarcopenia, which is consistent with our study findings. For ALP, which was the focus of the present study, some studies have demonstrated that its subtype, the intestinal isoenzyme IAP, may act on intestinal immunity, exerting anti-inflammatory effects, and may also play a significant role in regulating the inflammatory processes. Additionally, for the inflammatory response and cells in bone tissues, Cianferotti and Brandi proved that TNF-α is released by bone components. Proinflammatory factors, especially those involved in inhibiting skeletal muscle metabolism as well as those characteristic of malnutrition, immobility, cancer, and endocrine abnormalities, can cause a decrease in bone and muscle mass and result in increased catabolism. The multiple logistic regression analysis in our study excluded any factors of serum ALP elevation, including the presence or absence of hepatic cancer, bone fractures, and liver diseases, such as alcohol fatty liver and jaundice. It is possible that ALP elevation as low-grade inflammation may be involved in the development of sarcopenia in preoperative cancer patients. However, a further analysis examining the interaction between inflammation and elevated ALP levels is necessary.

### Prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19 infection and association with clinical outcomes [^713ebfd3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is now a critical threat to global public health. Although the majority of patients present with respiratory illness, several studies have described multiorgan involvement. This study evaluated the prevailing patterns of liver enzymes in COVID-19 patients on admission and their association with clinical outcomes.

Methods

This was a single-center retrospective analysis of all inpatients with COVID-19. Demographic and clinical factors, and liver enzyme tests, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), were noted on admission. The association of liver enzyme elevation with outcomes such as inpatient death, need for intubation, and vasopressor use was determined using the chi-square test and multivariate regression analysis.

Results

Among 200 patients, AST and ALT elevation was seen in 55% and 20%, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase elevation was seen in 28%. AST elevation was associated with inpatient death (odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.05; P = 0.035), need for vasopressors (OR 1.034, 95%CI 1.015–1.055; P = 0.001), and intubation (OR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01–1.05; P = 0.002). An AST/ALT ratio of 2 or more was seen in 34% of patients and was associated with need for intubation (OR 2.678, 95%CI 1.202–5.963; P = 0.016), and need for vasopressors (OR 3.352, 95%CI 1.495–7.514; P = 0.003).

Conclusion

Serum aminotransferase levels are useful markers of hepatocellular injury. Patients with elevated AST or AST/ALT ratio are at higher risk of severe disease, as evidenced by intubation, vasopressor use, and inpatient death. These patients should be monitored closely given their propensity for severe disease.

### Liver function test abnormalities and their clinical relevance in primary myelofibrosis [^486ddf0c]. Blood Cancer Journal (2017). Low credibility.

After a median follow-up of 3 years, 236 (59%) deaths and 36 (9%) leukemic transformations were documented. In univariate analysis, increased ALP (Figure 1) and AST were associated with inferior survival, both as continuous variables (P = 0.013 and P = 0.04, respectively), and categorical variables with the respective cutoff levels of 287 U/l and 49 U/l (P = 0.03 and P = 0.03, respectively); the significant difference in survival was independent of DIPSS-plus and of driver mutational status for ALP as continuous (P = 0.004) and categorical variable (P = 0.004, hazard ratio 1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.21–2.79), but not for AST (P = 0.11). Increased serum ALP or AST did not affect leukemia-free survival (P = 0.4 and P = 0.5, respectively).

In the current study, we showed that increased level of serum ALP is relatively common in PMF occurring in almost half of the patients at the time of referral, whereas the incidence of elevated serum AST was much less frequent at 9%. The study also shows that the magnitude of the abnormalities were mostly grade 1 for AST, but ⩾grade 2 for ALP in ~7% of the patients. In addition, our study demonstrates significant associations with marked leukocytosis for both ALP and AST. Of note, no other associations were apparent for ALP, but the multiple other associations for AST, which included serum LDH, suggest an indirect effect from the associated leukocytosis. Finally, we demonstrate a DIPSS-plus and driver mutational status independent adverse effect on survival from ALP but not AST. We conclude, therefore, that elevated ALP is frequent in PMF and prognostically relevant when it exceeds 2.5 χ, the upper normal limit. Furthermore, the lack of effect on leukemia-free survival suggests that the adverse prognosis associated with ⩾grade 2 increases in serum ALP might be related to excess deaths from disease comorbidity rather than clonal evolution, but additional studies are needed to validate our observations and provide additional insight in the subject matter.

Table 5 (continued) — Ischemic liver injury and malignant infiltration clinical features and prognosis — Ischemic liver injury presents acutely, often in the setting of congestive heart failure, sepsis, traumatic injury, or major surgery, with a predominantly hepatocellular pattern and marked AST elevation > 10,000 IU/L; bilirubin and INR may worsen despite improving transaminases, and prognosis is favorable with restoration of hemodynamic stability. Malignant infiltration presents acutely, commonly from lymphoma, leukemia, breast cancer, or colon cancer, with abdominal pain, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatomegaly; labs show a mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and marked transaminase elevation approximately 40× ULN; diagnosis often relies on liver or bone marrow biopsy, and prognosis is poor.

### Aging and liver health: liver chemistries and associated factors in community-dwelling older adults [^0ee86dcd]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The literature suggests that there is a dose-dependent relationship between statin and elevation in liver chemistries, with the most common biomarkers affected being ALT, AST, ALP, and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT). In the present study, the majority of participants were on low-intensity statin therapy (48%) and only 10% were on high-intensity statin. This is in keeping with the low cardiovascular risk profile of our cohort, whereby 98% of the study participants had a CCI score of 0, which indicated the absence of cardiovascular disease burden (myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack). In addition, diabetes was one of the exclusion criteria for this study.

There was no evidence of abnormal liver chemistries with statin therapy in our participants, although there was a trend of higher mean ALP levels as the intensity of statin increased from low (60 U/L) or moderate (65 U/L) to high (71 U/L). It is important to highlight that these mean levels are within the normal reference range (32 to 103 U/L). This relationship is unexpected, as the more common liver chemistries to rise as a result of statin therapy are ALT and AST. However, a study on adverse reactions due to statin therapy in Sweden reported that the use of atorvastatin can result in isolated rise in ALP, whereas the use of simvastatin is associated with a rise in ALT and AST in patients with idiosyncratic adverse reaction. Despite its statistical significance, the changes in ALP are unlikely to have clinical significance. These findings can help clinicians address misperceptions of statin use in healthy older patients, thus supporting their adherence to statin therapy and improved rates of prescriptions by clinicians.

### Association of alkaline phosphatase to albumin ratio with all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with cirrhosis: a retrospective study [^85d81029]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis is a type of diffuse liver damage caused by the long-term progression of multiple chronic liver diseases, and its pathohistological manifestations include diffuse fibrosis of the liver parenchyma and pseudofollicular formation. As the end stage of multiple chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis can not only cause a series of serious complications such as portal hypertension (PHT), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and ascites, but also significantly increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and adverse cardiovascular events, which seriously affects patients' quality of life. In addition, critically ill cirrhotic patients have a significantly increased risk of death, and meta-analysis has shown that the 90-days mortality rate of patients with decompensated cirrhosis can be as high as 58% globally. Previous studies commonly use the Child-Pugh score and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) to predict the prognosis of cirrhosis patients. However, these scoring systems involve multiple variables and are relatively cumbersome to apply. Therefore, exploring new and simpler clinical prognostic indicators is of significant importance.

Alkaline phosphatase to albumin ratio (APAR) is a novel indicator combining alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and albumin (ALB), which has been widely used in various conditions, including chronic kidney disease, coronary atherosclerosis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. ALP is a hydrolytic enzyme widely distributed in the liver, biliary tract, bone, and other tissues, and is commonly used clinically to assess hepatobiliary disease, bone disease, and other systemic disorders. Elevated levels are usually indicative of damage to the biliary system or cholestasis and are strongly associated with cirrhosis. Lammers et al. found that, after one year and up to five years of follow-up, a log-linear relationship between ALP levels and the risk of liver transplantation and death was found; higher ALP levels were linked to a worse transplant-free survival. ALB is a major plasma protein synthesized by the liver and plays an important role in maintaining plasma colloid osmotic pressure, transporting substances, and regulating fluid balance. Serum ALB level can reflect the synthetic function of the liver and systemic nutritional status and is an important indicator for assessing the progression and prognosis of cirrhotic patients.

### Elevated liver enzymes and cardiovascular mortality: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of more than one million participants [^63b9be12]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are commonly used liver function markers. We performed a dose-response meta-analysis to investigate the association between liver enzymes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in prospective cohort studies. We conducted a systematic search up to April 2018 in Medline/PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Embase databases. Combined hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model as described by DerSimonian and Laird. Dose-response analysis was also carried out. Twenty-three studies with 1067922 participants reported association between GGT and CVD mortality and were included in our analysis. Pooled results showed a significant association between GGT and risk of CVD mortality (HR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.47–1.78, P = 0.001, P-heterogeneity = 0.001) and it was HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.73–1.07; P = 0.221, P-heterogeneity = 0.028, for ALT. There was a direct association between baseline levels of ALP and AST/ALT ratio with CVD mortality (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.11–1.89; P = 0.005, P-heterogeneity = 0.026, and HR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.60–3.04; P = 0.001, P-heterogeneity = 0.540, respectively). Pooled results did not show any significant association between AST and the risk of CVD mortality (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.83–1.73; P = 0.313, P-heterogeneity = 0.024). Moreover, there was a significant nonlinear association between GGT and ALP levels and the risk of CVD mortality (P = 0.008 and 0.016, respectively). Our dose-response meta-analysis revealed a direct relationship between GGT and ALP levels and the risk of CVD mortality. High levels of GGT, ALP and AST/ALT were associated with an increased CVD mortality rate.

### Liver alkaline phosphatase: a missing link between choleresis and biliary inflammation [^ea262669]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Several lines of evidence show that serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) is not only a signpost of cholestasis but also a surrogate marker of the severity of primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. In the present opinion article, we review and discuss the putative role of liver AP in health and in cholestatic diseases. In inflammatory cholestatic conditions, loss of activity of liver AP (resulting from its relocation from canaliculi and the acidic milieu) might promote hyper-adenosine triphosphate-bilia, lipopolysaccharide overload, and subsequent exacerbation and perpetuation of inflammation. Drugs that can restore the polarity of hepatocytes and canalicular export of bile acids or act as bile alkalinity modifiers are predicted to exert anti-inflammatory effects and to benefit both primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Oral administration of intestinal AP could be a valid therapeutic intervention that deserves further study under experimental conditions as well as in human diseases. Overall, the key role of the liver microenvironment that might shape the different facets of the inflammatory processes in fibrosing cholangiopathies is highlighted.

### Role of fibroblast growth factor-23 as an early marker of metabolic bone disease of prematurity [^3c6c3508]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

In our clinical practice setting, biochemical evaluation is typically performed in at-risk patients at 3–4 weeks of age. However, none of the commonly used markers of bone metabolism, such as calcium, phosphorus, ALP, PTH, and vitamin D, are considered specific for MBDP.

ALP levels physiologically increase during the first 3 weeks of life, peaking at 6–12 weeks. ALP is expressed in multiple tissues (liver, bone, kidney, intestine, brain, etc.), with over 80% derived from bone and liver, making it a good marker of bone turnover. ALP has been widely used as a marker for MBDP, although there is no agreed cutoff value, and it is not specific, as it can be elevated in other common pathologies, such as cholestasis. ALP levels > 500 U/L have been associated with alterations in bone metabolism, and levels > 700 U/L have been associated with bone demineralization. Viswanathan et al. demonstrated that ALP levels > 500 IU/L in preterm newborns < 30 weeks of gestation are associated with MBDP, and Backstrom et al. showed that ALP levels > 900 IU/L in preterm newborns < 33 weeks of gestational age, combined with serum phosphate levels < 5.6 mg/dL, have a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 100%, respectively. In the present study, ALP levels at 3–4 weeks were higher in the MBDP group (601 vs. 323.5 IU/L) but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.118). Even when analyzing the specific bone ALP isoenzyme to exclude confounding factors such as cholestasis, no statistically significant differences were found (222 vs. 138 U/L, p = 0.213). Although neonatal practices have evolved significantly over the years, potentially impacting the relevance of the findings to contemporary medical contexts, the use of B-ALP levels did not improve diagnostic performance, as previously shown in the study by Backstrom et al. Our study demonstrates that although ALP and B-ALP may be markers of MBDP, they are not statistically significant in distinguishing affected individuals in this cohort.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Abnormal Liver Function Tests: Liver function tests (γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT) and bilirubin level should be monitored. Treatment discontinuation should be considered if parameters increase to a level considered clinically significant in patients with stable historical liver function test levels. Caution should be exercised to maintain patients' bile flow. (5.1)
Enteroliths in Patients with Risk for Intestinal Stenosis or Stasis: Monitor for obstructive gastrointestinal symptoms; if symptoms occur, hold ursodiol until a clinical evaluation has been conducted. (5.2)

5.1 Abnormal Liver Function Tests

Liver function tests (γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT) and bilirubin levels should be monitored every month for three months after start of therapy, and every six months thereafter. This monitoring will allow the early detection of a possible deterioration of the hepatic function. Treatment discontinuation should be considered if the above parameters increase to a level considered clinically significant in patients with stable historical liver function test levels.

Caution has to be exercised to maintain the bile flow of the patients taking ursodiol.

5.2 Enteroliths in Patients with Risk for Intestinal Stenosis or Stasis

There have been rare postmarketing reports of ursodiol-treated patients who developed enteroliths (bezoars) resulting in obstructive symptoms that required surgical intervention. These patients had medical conditions that predisposed them to intestinal stenosis or stasis (e.g., surgical enteroanastomoses, Crohn's disease). If a patient presents with obstructive gastrointestinal symptoms, hold ursodiol until a clinical evaluation has been conducted.

Conclusions

Preprocedural GGT is a low‐cost, frequently used laboratory test marker that can be considered a prognostic risk factor predictive of long‐term mortality in patients with complex CAD even after revascularization. In patients with elevated GGT, strong secondary prevention may be required after revascularization and must be studied prospectively. The external validation of our ML model incorporating GGT will prove the predictive value of GGT in the future.

### Cystic fibrosis screening, evaluation, and management of hepatobiliary disease consensus recommendations [^58349f4a]. Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Screening recommendations

S1. The CFF recommends that annual labs [total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), platelet count] should be performed at a time of clinical stability for identification of hepatobiliary involvement in all PwCF starting at CF diagnosis.

CFHBI can manifest in childhood, adolescence, and/or adulthood. Liver test abnormalities may precede imaging abnormalitiesand correlate with fibrosis. Early identification of CFHBI affects care through staging, regular monitoring, and treatment. Common liver test abnormalities in CF may include elevations in serum AST, ALT, GGT, and/or alkaline phosphatase. Elevated conjugated bilirubin may occur in aCFLD or with biliary obstruction. Portal hypertension may also cause an absolute or relative thrombocytopenia if baseline thrombocytosis is present. Prior guidelines recommended further action at 1.5–2x upper limit of normal values for increased specificity. However, this, coupled with the use of high thresholds, can contribute to delayed diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to use age and sex-normative values, and we recommend further evaluation if any abnormalities are persistent (> 3–6 mo). Few studies have evaluated the optimal timing and frequency of lab testing; however, the CFF recommends that these tests be performed on an annual basis beginning at CF diagnosis. Many PwCF have transient elevation of liver enzymes during systemic inflammation or antibiotic treatment; however, CFHBI is characterized by persistent liver test abnormalities, and annual screening should be performed during a time of relative clinical stability (eg, no active treatment for acute pulmonary exacerbation or infection). Calculation of liver fibrosis indices based on routine laboratory tests, including AST-to-Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), fibrosis-4, and GGT-to-Platelet Ratio (GPR) can detect advanced fibrosis and portal hypertension and may be more specific than liver tests alone since they include platelet count. APRI is the most studied in CF and may be useful to identify aCFLD.– GPR may be particularly useful in detecting early biliary disease prior to significant hepatocyte injury. Optimal thresholds have not been broadly accepted in CF for any of the fibrosis indices, and therefore, the utility of these indices in screening PwCF for possible CFHBI or aCFLD is uncertain.

### Liver function predicts survival in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following cardiovascular surgery [^0d3f8f3d]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Generally, elevation of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin is considered as a cholestatic pattern. Cholestasis is defined as a decline of bile flow into the duodenum that may be caused by impaired secretion by hepatocytes or obstruction through intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts. Particularly, adverse effects of medications and systemic sepsis may be the underlying mechanism for elevated cholestatic parameters in the present study cohort. As preoperative bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels were in the upper normal range or only slightly elevated in the present study population, significant cholestasis is not suggested to be the sole organic correlate for poor outcome. The commonality of our study population is the severe cardiovascular disease that may itself affect liver function. The pathophysiology of cardiac hepatopathy is, on one hand, impaired arterial perfusion caused by acute heart failure and, on the other hand, passive congestion resulting from an increased central venous pressure due to elevated right ventricular pressure and right-sided heart failure. Mostly, forward and backward failure coexist and aggravate each other in patients with severe heart failure. Furthermore, hepatic derangements are not necessarily caused by primary liver disease, but may be a consequence of severe illness and may represent a surrogate marker of the generalized stress response.

In line with our results, elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin were identified to predict all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with advanced heart failure. Hemodynamic alterations triggered by heart failure were found to be associated with the development of hypoxic hepatitis. Hypoxic hepatitis is a form of hepatic injury following acute arterial hypoxemia, hypoperfusion with consecutive ischemia, and passive congestion of the liver that significantly affects prognosis and the outcome of critically ill patients. It is tempting to speculate that preoperative determination of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels can detect patients with early-stage hepatocardiac disorders who have a reduced hepatic tolerance to intra- and postoperative hemodynamic changes. Our laboratory findings support this hypothesis, as alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are expected to be increased while transaminases are often normal or only slightly elevated in patients with cardiac hepatopathy as long as cardiac output is not severely compromised.

### Metabolic syndrome and transaminases: systematic review and meta-analysis [^77a061b7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) encompasses several cardiovascular risk factors, including insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, central obesity and hypertension. It is a multifactorial non-communicable disease that significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality and is considered a public health burden worldwide.

In addition to increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), MetS and its risk factors, including obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM), are associated with liver disease. Liver function is essential for glucose and fatty acid metabolism. Hepatic glucose homeostasis influences insulin sensitivity, while peripheral insulin resistance and lipolysis contribute to fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis).

In this regard, MetS has a direct relationship with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), both being predictors of the development of fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinogenesis.

NAFLD affects approximately 25% of the world's population and is a leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation. This disorder, characterised by lipid deposition in hepatocytes, encompasses a group of liver diseases that resemble alcoholic liver disease, ranging from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. These liver diseases have become the leading causes of liver-related morbidity and mortality and a risk factor for DM, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, MetS and CVD.

In this context, early liver impairment detection would help prevent or diagnose other metabolic disorders. According to recent studies, liver function tests, including serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), can be valuable parameters in the assessment of metabolic status, especially in the investigation of cardio-metabolic disorders. Specifically, several authors have explored the associations between liver enzymes, MetS, and CVD in different populations. In this regard, elevated ALT levels have been shown to help predict CVD in prospective studies, and MetS and its components. Although GGT is considered an indicator of the degree of liver disease and alcohol consumption, several studies have shown that the level of this enzyme is also associated with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular mortality independently of liver damage or alcohol consumption. One of the advantages of these parameters is that they are commonly measured in liver function tests and are well-known markers of liver damage.

Therefore, this possible relationship between serum liver enzymes and MetS has recently attracted much attention. Therefore, the main objective of the systematic review and meta-analysis is to provide the best degree of evidence on the association between liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) and MetS, determining the effect size of these biomarkers.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury [^c21dc7bb]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to LFTs, EASL 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain AST as a reliable substitute for ALT in calculating the pattern of injury if ALT is unavailable at DILI recognition, whereas GGT is less reliable as an alanine phosphatase substitute.

### Hypophosphatasia-aetiology, nosology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^2114066b]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia is the inborn error of metabolism characterized by low serum alkaline phosphatase activity (hypophosphatasaemia). This biochemical hallmark reflects loss-of-function mutations within the gene that encodes the tissue-nonspecific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP). TNSALP is a cell-surface homodimeric phosphohydrolase that is richly expressed in the skeleton, liver, kidney and developing teeth. In hypophosphatasia, extracellular accumulation of TNSALP natural substrates includes inorganic pyrophosphate, an inhibitor of mineralization, which explains the dento-osseous and arthritic complications featuring tooth loss, rickets or osteomalacia, and calcific arthopathies. Severely affected infants sometimes also have hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia due to the blocked entry of minerals into the skeleton, and pyridoxine-dependent seizures from insufficient extracellular hydrolysis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, the major circulating form of vitamin B6, required for neurotransmitter synthesis. Autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance from ~300 predominantly missense ALPL (also known as TNSALP) mutations largely accounts for the remarkably broad-ranging expressivity of hypophosphatasia. High serum concentrations of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate represent a sensitive and specific biochemical marker for hypophosphatasia. Also, phosphoethanolamine levels are usually elevated in serum and urine, though less reliably for diagnosis. TNSALP mutation detection is important for recurrence risk assessment and prenatal diagnosis. Diagnosing paediatric hypophosphatasia is aided by pathognomic radiographic changes when the skeletal disease is severe. Hypophosphatasia was the last type of rickets or osteomalacia to await a medical treatment. Now, significant successes for severely affected paediatric patients are recognized using asfotase alfa, a bone-targeted recombinant TNSALP.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^02bc7c99]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — diagnostic entry criteria and initial steps for suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) include biochemical evidence of liver injury meeting one of these criteria: 1) AST or ALT > 5x ULN, or ALP > 2x ULN (or pretreatment baseline if abnormal) on 2 separate occasions, 2) Total serum bilirubin > 2.5mg/dL with elevated AST, ALT or ALP level, or 3) INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT or ALP. DILI suspected based on clinical history, symptoms, and/or physical exam: 1) Assess exposure to all prescription and over the counter medications, HDS products, and toxins, including start and stop dates, especially within the preceding 6 months; 2) Discontinue any non-essential medications and supplements. Determine R ratio R = ALT/ULN ALP/ULN and classify as R ≥ 5: Hepatocellular, R value 2–5: Mixed, or R ≤ 2: Cholestatic.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Liver blood tests

Liver blood tests, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), are frequently tested as part of routine clinical investigation in primary care. Whilst unexplained persistently abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated, normal liver blood tests do not exclude NAFLD or significant fibrosis. In a study of 223 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, ALT more than two times the upper limit of normal (> 70 IU/L) had a sensitivity of just 50% and specificity of 61% for NASH, and sensitivity 40% and specificity 58% for advanced fibrosis. Moreover, the serum ALT level typically falls as liver fibrosis progresses and patients with cirrhosis frequently have a normal range ALT level. Therefore, do not rely on abnormal liver blood tests to prompt consideration of liver disease. However, persistently unexplained abnormal liver blood tests should always be investigated. (Recommendation 3, Table 1)

Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be evaluated in line with national recommendations, with a focussed history eliciting risk factors for chronic liver disease including unhealthy alcohol consumption, the presence of metabolic risk factors and a detailed drug history. Automated systems, such as intelligent liver function tests (iLFT), can streamline the investigation of abnormal liver blood tests giving a full panel of results, suggested diagnosis and advice for further management. This approach increases the diagnosis of liver disease and is highly cost effective.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^3c389396]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

The evidence suggests that liver laboratory abnormalities will be found in 12% of patients with sarcoidosis who undergo routine liver function testing, most of whom have hepatic granulomas. We did not identify a specific pattern of liver function abnormalities indicative of hepatic sarcoidosis, but some studies suggest that liver granulomas are more often associated with increases of alkaline phosphatase and less frequently with rises in transaminases.

The committee discussed reports that immune suppression and ursodeoxycholic acid reduce transaminitis and cholestasis in patients with related symptoms (pruritus), suggesting that treatment is effective in reducing disease activity in patients with symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis. However, according to both the committee's clinical experience and the systematic review, it is uncertain whether these effects can be extrapolated to asymptomatic patients with hepatic sarcoidosis. The systematic review found no difference in resolution or improvement of abnormal liver function tests with treatment; however, it was not designed to estimate the effects of treatment of hepatic sarcoidosis, and, therefore, better evidence about treatment may exist. Treatment decisions should not be undertaken carelessly, because death due to cirrhosis or liver failure is uncommon, yet the risks of chronic treatment, especially immune suppression, are significant. The committee also noted that prednisone treatment may confound the assessment, as it can cause transaminitis. The committee agreed that the evidence is too scarce to conclude whether treatment affects progression to cirrhosis or reduces the need for liver transplantation.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that more than 1 out of every 10 patients with sarcoidosis who undergo liver function testing will be identified as having liver involvement, but the implication on treatment is unclear. The committee concluded that there is value in identifying patients with liver involvement at the time of initial diagnosis, and to screen for liver involvement annually even if the initial screen is negative (Table 5), if for no other reason than to avoid hepatotoxic treatments, and to follow such patients more carefully for the development of symptoms that warrant treatment.

Recommendations

1 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we suggest baseline serum alkaline phosphatase testing to screen for hepatic sarcoidosis (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
2 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we make no recommendation for or against baseline serum transaminase testing.

### Pirfenidone for the treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome related to chronic graft-versus-host disease [^dadd88e6]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, baseline LFTs prior to trial enrollment were elevated, consistent with underlying cGVHD. After 12 months of treatment, we observed a significant decrease in all LFTs, which was sustained in the 10 participants who continued through the 56-month extension. However, the clinical significance of this decrease is uncertain. Liver dysfunction occurs in up to 50% of patients with cGVHD, with the exact mechanism being incompletely understood. Indolent elevations of ALT and ALP are early indicators of hepatic cGVHD, but isolated liver enzyme elevations are not diagnostic of cGVHD and likely reflect systemic cGVHD activity. Although hepatoxicity with pirfenidone is rare, pooled analysis of 3 large trials showed LFT elevations (> 3 times upper limit of normal) in 3.2% of patients. Pirfenidone has nonetheless been shown to improve liver fibrosis biomarkers in patients with advanced liver disease. Given that cGVHD of the liver is thought to be a progressive transforming growth factor-β driven process, a positive effect of pirfenidone is biologically plausible.

### Elevated alkaline phosphatase in infants with parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease reflects bone rather than liver disease [^72dcbfe0]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in infants with intestinal failure (IF) can be due to parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD) or metabolic bone disease (MBD). The purpose of the study was to determine the utility of serum ALP in the diagnostic criteria for PNALD by measuring tissue-specific levels in infants with IF and PNALD.

Methods

A retrospective review of patient data for 15 infants diagnosed with PNALD between December 2012 and August 2013 was performed. PNALD was defined as the presence of 2 consecutive direct bilirubin (DB) levels > 2 mg/dL. Fractionated serum alkaline phosphatase was measured in each patient, while the DB was > 2 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were recorded where available.

Results

In 15 infants with PNALD, elevation in total ALP was due to marked elevations in bone-specific ALP. The median liver-specific ALP remained within the normal range. PTH, vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphate levels were within normal limits.

Conclusion

While elevated ALP can reflect biliary stasis, the ALP elevation observed in infants with IF and PNALD is predominantly of bone rather than hepatic origin. An elevated unfractionated ALP in infants with PNALD should therefore raise suspicion of underlying bone disease, rather than being attributed to liver disease alone.

### Abnormal liver tests in COVID-19: a retrospective observational cohort study of 1, 827 patients in a major U.S. hospital network [^35eba149]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

The coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality attributable to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan failure. Liver injury has been reported as a nonpulmonary manifestation of COVID-19, but characterization of liver test abnormalities and their association with clinical outcomes is incomplete.

Approach and Results

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1,827 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the Yale-New Haven Health System between March 14, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Clinical characteristics, liver tests (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], total bilirubin [TBIL], and albumin) at three time points (preinfection baseline, admission, and peak hospitalization), and hospitalization outcomes (severe COVID-19, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, mechanical ventilation, and death) were analyzed. Abnormal liver tests were commonly observed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, both at admission (AST 66.9%, ALT 41.6%, ALP 13.5%, and TBIL 4.3%) and peak hospitalization (AST 83.4%, ALT 61.6%, ALP 22.7%, and TBIL 16.1%). Most patients with abnormal liver tests at admission had minimal elevations 1–2× the upper limit of normal (ULN; AST 63.7%, ALT 63.5%, ALP 80.0%, and TBIL 75.7%). A significant proportion of these patients had abnormal liver tests prehospitalization (AST 25.9%, ALT 38.0%, ALP 56.8%, and TBIL 44.4%). Multivariate analysis revealed an association between abnormal liver tests and severe COVID-19, including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death; associations with age, male sex, body mass index, and diabetes mellitus were also observed. Medications used in COVID-19 treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and tocilizumab) were associated with peak hospitalization liver transaminase elevations > 5× ULN.

Conclusions

Abnormal liver tests occur in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes.

### Long-term follow-up and complications after cardiac transplantation [^d033d401]. NMDP (1993). Medium credibility.

Liver — evaluation and clinical manifestations in post-transplant care are outlined as follows: evaluation includes patient-reported symptoms and signs (jaundice, malaise, itching, fatigue), clinical examination to assess for hepatomegaly and right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness, and diagnostic testing with total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), GGT (gamma glutamyl transpeptidase), and 5'-NT (5'-nucleotidase); liver biopsy may be needed in the absence of GVHD in another organ. Clinical manifestations include hepatitis and progressive cholestatic features, described respectively as "Rise in serum alanine aminotransferase, > 2x upper limit of normal, with or without jaundice" and "The flow of bile from the liver is blocked; total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase > 2x upper limit of normal; elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, followed by jaundice"; the * notation indicates these are "Common in both acute and chronic GVHD".

### Towards a standardized classification of the hepatobiliary manifestations in cystic fibrosis (CFHBI): a joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN position paper [^abcbdcfe]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in pwCF — associations with disease and predictive performance: In children diagnosed via newborn screening, a persistent elevation of AST or GGT > 1.5 x ULN before the age of 5 was linked to a 6-fold increase in risk of clinically significant liver disease, defined as cirrhosis, portal hypertension (PHT), or stage F3/4 fibrosis. In 244 children with CF, higher mean ALT/AST levels were reported in those with liver ultrasound abnormalities, although levels were mostly within the normal range with significant overlap. Elevated ALT, GGT, or ALP on 2 or more occasions before age 6.5 was linked to higher risk of PHT; elevated ALT had a hazard ratio of 2.7 but only a sensitivity of ~20% and PPV of ~20%. Overall, there is insufficient evidence that changes in ALT and/or AST levels over time can reliably predict development of structural hepatic abnormalities in pwCF.

### Tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase regulates tumour growth, epithelial plasticity and disease-free survival in metastatic prostate cancer [^2b031a6e]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with an estimated 1.1 million men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012 worldwide. Whereas localised prostate cancer has a good prognosis, advanced disease metastasises frequently to the skeleton, and becomes castration resistant. Once prostate cancer has metastasised to distant sites, the disease is ultimately fatal and treatment is purely palliative. The most common metastatic sites are the lymph nodes and the bone, with bone metastases resulting in severe bone pain and fractures. Despite many advances in research, a greater understanding of the metastatic process is required, to identify new therapeutic targets.

Recent evidence suggests that bone-related parameters are the main prognostic factors for overall survival in advanced prostate cancer. These include alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary n -telopepetide, previous skeletal-related events and pain. Alkaline phosphatase, also known as tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) or mesenchymal stem cell antigen 1, is an enzyme that is expressed by a range of tissues including bone, and also the liver. There are four existing isoforms of alkaline phosphatase, and the ALPL gene encodes for TNAP. Alkaline phosphatase is highly expressed by osteoblasts and a key component of osteoblastic activity, acting to hydrolyse inorganic pyrophosphate resulting in mineralisation. The bone lesions associated with prostate cancer are predominantly osteosclerotic, arising because of an increase in osteoblastic activity and uncontrolled formation of new bone. As such, the elevated circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase seen in advanced prostate cancer are thought to reflect the dysregulated bone formation associated with cancer-induced bone disease.
