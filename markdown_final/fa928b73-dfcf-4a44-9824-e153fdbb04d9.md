## Question

What causes a rash after a hematoma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes a rash after a hematoma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the temporal relationship between the hematoma and the rash. Then, I should verify the most likely pathophysiologic mechanisms linking hematoma to subsequent skin changes. Next, I will consider key differentials that can mimic or complicate this picture, including vasculitis, drug-induced purpura, and infectious etiologies. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic approach and management considerations, making sure I check for red flags that warrant urgent action.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a "rash" appearing after a hematoma typically reflects postinflammatory pigment alteration, ecchymotic evolution, or a secondary process such as localized vasculitis or drug-induced purpura, rather than a primary skin disease per se. I need to ensure I'm not missing a dangerous purpuric process that can look similar but behave differently [^111ruAgW] [^113D181r].

> Wait, let me verify the most common mechanism: after blood extravasation into the dermis or subcutis, erythrocyte breakdown liberates hemosiderin and bilirubin, producing predictable color evolution from purple-blue to green-yellow and often leaving transient hyperpigmentation. This is classic postinflammatory pigment alteration and is expected as a hematoma resolves, especially over 1–3 weeks [^111ZfrKx] [^1129XVA8].

> Hold on, I should also consider that the "rash" may simply be the natural progression of ecchymosis itself. Hematomas and ecchymoses evolve through visible color changes that patients may interpret as a new rash, but this is part of normal heme catabolism and not a separate dermatosis, provided there is no expanding pain, new purpura, or systemic signs [^notfound].

> I need to check for a localized inflammatory response around the hematoma. Blood products are irritants and can trigger a low-grade perivascular inflammatory reaction with erythema, edema, and pruritus, which may present as an erythematous plaque or morbilliform-like eruption at the hematoma margins. This is usually self-limited and improves as the hematoma organizes and resorbs [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the "rash" is actually purpuric and nonblanching rather than ecchymotic? I should confirm whether there are petechiae or palpable purpura suggesting a vasculitic process superimposed on or triggered by the hematoma, because that changes management entirely and requires prompt evaluation for small-vessel vasculitis or drug-induced purpura [^113D181r].

> Let me consider drug-induced etiologies next. Anticoagulants such as heparin and warfarin can cause hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis or purpura, often appearing 5–21 days after initiation and sometimes distant from injection sites, with lesions that are painless, hemorrhagic papules or bullae on noninflamed skin. I should double-check medication timing and morphology, and remember that heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can present with skin necrosis and thrombocytopenia, mandating platelet count and HIT testing if suspected [^114fvtKJ] [^116Geqgh] [^117WNs86].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis is only linked to heparin", but I should correct that. Warfarin has also been implicated, albeit less commonly, so I must keep both agents in mind when the morphology is bullous and hemorrhagic and the timeline fits anticoagulant exposure [^1163C2qD].

> I will now examine infectious and systemic mimics. In patients with fever, systemic symptoms, or rapidly progressive purpura, I need to ensure I am not missing meningococcemia, purpura fulminans, or other life-threatening infections, where the purpuric rash reflects microvascular thrombosis and hemorrhage rather than simple hematoma evolution. Urgent labs and empiric therapy may be indicated while confirmatory testing is pending [^1176aEnF] [^113D181r].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach: confirm the hematoma history and timeline, characterize the rash morphology (macular, papular, petechial, palpable purpura, bullous), check for blanching, document distribution, and screen for systemic features such as fever, arthralgia, abdominal pain, mucosal involvement, and neurologic symptoms. If purpura is present, obtain CBC with platelets, PT/INR, aPTT, and consider urinalysis for hematuria. If HIT is suspected, check platelets and use a HIT scoring system. If vasculitis is suspected, consider biopsy and targeted labs based on the differential [^113F39rh] [^117WNs86].

> Let me think about management principles: for uncomplicated post-hematoma pigment alteration or mild ecchymotic evolution, reassurance and supportive care suffice. For suspected drug-induced purpura or bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis, review and adjust anticoagulation when clinically safe and consider dermatology input. For suspected HIT, stop all heparin and initiate a non-heparin anticoagulant. For suspected vasculitis, coordinate early dermatology/rheumatology evaluation and treat according to severity. For any rapidly progressive purpura with systemic toxicity, escalate urgently with sepsis protocols and hematology support [^116Geqgh] [^117WNs86] [^1176aEnF].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent action: expanding nonblanching purpura, severe pain out of proportion, necrosis or bullae formation, fever with systemic symptoms, mucosal bleeding, neurologic changes, or new anticoagulant exposure within days to weeks. These features should trigger expedited labs, imaging if deep hematoma is suspected, and specialty consultation to exclude HIT, vasculitis, or severe infection [^116Geqgh] [^1176aEnF].

> In summary, I need to ensure I distinguish expected post-hematoma pigment alteration and ecchymotic evolution from pathologic purpuric processes. Most post-hematoma rashes reflect hemosiderin deposition and color evolution, but persistent or atypical purpura, bullae, or systemic features should prompt evaluation for drug-induced purpura, vasculitis, or infection, with targeted labs and management to prevent complications [^111ruAgW] [^113D181r].

---

A rash after a hematoma is most often due to **blood breakdown products** (hemosiderin, bilirubin) causing brown/yellow discoloration [^notfound] or **postinflammatory pigment change** [^111ruAgW] as the hematoma resolves. Other causes include **localized inflammation** from tissue injury, **infection** (cellulitis, abscess) [^112yieUU], or **drug reactions** (especially anticoagulants) [^116Geqgh] [^114fvtKJ]. Less commonly, **vasculitis** or **coagulopathies** may present with purpura or petechiae [^113D181r]. Evaluation should include history, exam, and labs (CBC, coagulation profile, infection markers) [^1176aEnF]; management targets the underlying cause, with antibiotics for infection [^1176aEnF], anticoagulant adjustment for drug-induced purpura [^notfound], and supportive care for pigment changes [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** can explain the development of a rash following a hematoma:

- **Blood breakdown products**: As the hematoma resolves, red blood cells break down, releasing hemosiderin and bilirubin. These pigments can cause brown or yellow discoloration of the skin, often mistaken for a rash [^notfound].

- **Postinflammatory pigment alteration**: Hematomas can cause localized inflammation, leading to postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation once the hematoma resolves [^notfound].

- **Localized inflammatory response**: The initial trauma causing the hematoma can trigger a localized inflammatory response, resulting in erythema, edema, and rash-like lesions [^notfound].

- **Infection**: Hematomas can become infected, leading to cellulitis or abscess formation, which presents as a rash with erythema, warmth, and systemic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Drug-induced reactions**: Anticoagulant therapy (e.g. heparin, warfarin) can cause hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis or other drug-induced rashes, particularly in elderly patients [^117DrD6J] [^114fvtKJ].

---

## Clinical presentations

The clinical presentation of a rash following a hematoma **varies** depending on the underlying cause:

| **Cause** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Blood breakdown products | Brown or yellow discoloration, gradual fading over time [^notfound] |
| Postinflammatory pigment alteration | Hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, gradual resolution [^111ruAgW] |
| Localized inflammatory response | Erythema, edema, pruritus, mild discomfort [^113TMoNF] |
| Infection (cellulitis, abscess) | Erythema, warmth, tenderness, systemic symptoms (fever, malaise) [^notfound] |
| Drug-induced reactions | Hemorrhagic bullae, purpura, urticaria, eczematous lesions [^112ABc1M] [^114fvtKJ] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A thorough diagnostic approach is essential to identify the **underlying cause** of the rash:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed history of trauma, anticoagulant use, systemic symptoms, and careful examination of the rash morphology and distribution [^113F39rh].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), coagulation profile (PT, aPTT, INR), inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), and culture if infection is suspected [^116ksWMa].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or MRI may be necessary if deep hematoma or abscess is suspected [^114KQCDY].

---

## Management strategies

Management of a rash following a hematoma **depends on the underlying cause**:

- **Supportive care**: For pigmentary changes or mild inflammatory rashes, supportive care, including topical corticosteroids and emollients, is recommended [^notfound].

- **Antibiotic therapy**: If infection is confirmed, appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated [^1176aEnF].

- **Adjustment of anticoagulant therapy**: If drug-induced rash is suspected, adjustment or discontinuation of the offending anticoagulant may be necessary [^114fvtKJ].

- **Surgical intervention**: In cases of large, persistent hematomas or abscess formation, surgical drainage or evacuation may be required [^11154Hp5].

---

## Potential complications

If left untreated, rashes following hematomas can lead to **chronic hyperpigmentation** [^111ruAgW], **secondary infection** [^116wmEs5], and, rarely, **necrosis** or ulceration, particularly in patients with underlying coagulopathies or those on anticoagulant therapy [^112ABc1M].

---

A rash following a hematoma is most commonly due to **blood breakdown products**, postinflammatory pigment alteration, localized inflammation, infection, or drug-induced reactions. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to prevent complications and ensure optimal patient outcomes.

### Management of acute hematomas and methods to mitigate risk [^11154Hp5]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the most common complications in dermatologic surgery is postoperative bleeding which can result in hematoma formation and suboptimal healing outcomes. Identifying preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors can reduce the risk of bleeding complications. However, despite best risk mitigation practices, hematomas remain a possible outcome of cutaneous surgery. Expanding hematomas causing functional pain and compromise to the surrounding neurovasculature should be evacuated. The authors herein discuss the risks associated with bleeding complications, methods to manage these risks, and a protocol to follow if an acute hematoma were to occur.

Emergency identification in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) — in patients with a history of HIT in the last 3 months, the ASH guideline panel suggests carrying or wearing an emergency identifier (eg, an emergency pendant or bracelet) (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence about effects), and the emergency identifier should include the drug (heparin), the reaction to the drug (HIT), and the date HIT was diagnosed; the risk of HIT recurrence or exacerbation with heparin re-exposure is greatest in the first 3 months after the diagnosis of acute HIT, and for patients with HIT diagnosed less than 3 months ago, there may be at least some potential benefits to wearing an emergency identifier, including a decreased risk of recurrent HIT and a reduction in patient anxiety about the risk of recurrent HIT, although among patients diagnosed with HIT less than 3 months ago, there may be a small risk of inappropriate avoidance of heparin as a result of wearing an emergency identifier, but this risk is uncertain; experience among patients with hemophilia suggests that 3% to 6% experience adverse events from wearing a medical bracelet (rashes and bruising), and emergency identifiers are feasible and acceptable to clinicians.

### A case of bleeding during infection with COVID-19 [^111mkuBE]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Dr. Patrick Lowe: Our case today is that of a 47-year-old woman who was referred to our emergency department (ED) due to bloody urine, dark tarry stools, red spots on her skin, and bruising throughout her body. Fourteen days prior to presentation, she began exhibiting intermittent fevers, headache, shortness of breath, and a dry cough, and she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 pneumonia). Over the 3 days prior to her ED presentation, she experienced a headache that was more intense than the headaches she had been having in the preceding 2 weeks. She reported episodes of both dark urine as well as bright red blood in her urine. In addition, she had multiple dark stools described as tar-like when asked. On the day of her ED presentation, the patient noted a red rash throughout her body. In addition, earlier in the day, she had atraumatic self-limited epistaxis. She denied any falls or head strikes, vision changes, focal weakness or numbness, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, or peripheral swelling.

### The rash with maculopapules and fever in adults [^115o3d1u]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

There is a broad differential diagnosis for the presentation of fever and maculopapular rash in an adult. Although some causative conditions are benign, others are medical emergencies that require prompt diagnosis. We describe various conditions that result in a fever and maculopapular rash in adults. These include infectious processes (meningococcemia, infectious mononucleosis, West Nile virus, zika virus, rubella, primary human immunodeficiency virus, parvovirus B19, ebolavirus), tick-borne illnesses (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis), and hypersensitivity reactions (exanthematous drug reactions). We also provide an algorithm to aid in the diagnosis of the patient with fever and maculopapular rash. Such conditions that can occur in adults but are seen predominantly in children are discussed in the article "Rash with maculopapules and fever in children" of this issue.

### Prepectoral immediate breast reconstruction with polyurethane foam-coated implants: feasibility and early results in risk-reducing and therapeutic mastectomies [^1162bEoZ]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is a renewed interest for prepectoral reconstruction. We aimed to describe the feasibility and the early complications associated with immediate one-stage direct-to-implant (DTI) reconstruction using prepectoral anatomical polyurethane (PU) foam-coated implants alone, for women with breast cancer or mutation carriers undergoing risk-reducing surgery.

Methods

We performed a single-center, retrospective review of 50 patients (mean age of 49 years), who underwent skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) or nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) and immediate prepectoral PU implant-based reconstruction. All procedures were performed by the same senior operator, from July 2018 to March 2020.

Results

A total of 64 mastectomies (25 SSMs and 39 NSMs) with one-stage prepectoral PU foam-coated implant reconstruction were performed. Out of 50 patients, 6 required surgical revision within 30 days, because of hematoma (2), wound dehiscence (2) infection (1), and full thickness nipple-areolar complex (NAC) necrosis (1). Four patients developed a cutaneous rash with spontaneous resolution. Statistical analysis showed a significant influence of hypothyroidism and previous radiotherapy on the risk of complications. The association with prior radiotherapy (pRT) was not significant using binary logistic regression. When excluding oncological reasons and patient's wish for NAC excision, our decision to perform an NSM was influenced by breast cup size, preoperative measurements, and breast weight.

Conclusions

Early experience with immediate prepectoral DTI reconstruction with PU-covered implants alone suggests that it is a reliable procedure. Prior breast irradiation does not increase postoperative complication rates in our series. NAC preservation was decided according to preoperative lower breast measurements.

### The Richmond acute subdural hematoma score: a validated grading scale to predict postoperative mortality [^117D4EFQ]. Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic acute subdural hematomas (aSDHs) are common, life-threatening injuries often requiring emergency surgery.

Objective

To develop and validate the Richmond acute subdural hematoma (RASH) score to stratify patients by risk of mortality after aSDH evacuation.

Methods

The 2016 National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) was queried to identify adult patients with traumatic aSDHs who underwent craniectomy or craniotomy within 4 h of arrival to an emergency department. Multivariate logistic regression modeling identified risk factors independently associated with mortality. The RASH score was developed based on a factor's strength and level of association with mortality. The model was validated using the 2017 NTDB and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

Results

A total of 2516 cases met study criteria. The patients were 69.3% male with a mean age of 55.7 yr and overall mortality rate of 36.4%. Factors associated with mortality included age between 61 and 79 yr (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, P < .001), age ≥ 80 yr (OR = 6.3, P < .001), loss of consciousness (OR = 2.3, P < .001), Glasgow Coma Scale score of ≤ 8 (OR = 2.6, P < .001), unilateral (OR = 2.8, P < .001) or bilateral (OR = 3.9, P < .001) unresponsive pupils, and midline shift > 5 mm (OR = 1.7, P < .001). Using these risk factors, the RASH score predicted progressively increasing mortality ranging from 0% to 94% for scores of 0 to 8, respectively (AUC = 0.72). Application of the RASH score to 3091 cases from 2017 resulted in similar accuracy (AUC = 0.74).

Conclusion

The RASH score is a simple and validated grading scale that uses easily accessible preoperative factors to predict estimated mortality rates in patients with traumatic aSDHs who undergo surgical evacuation.

Cardiovascular reactions: Generalized vasodilation, flushing and venospasm. Occasionally, thrombosis or rarely, thrombophlebitis. Red blood cell clumping and agglutination, crenation and interference in clot formation. Extremely rare cases of disseminated intravascular coagulation resulting in death have been reported. Severe cardiovascular responses include rare cases of hypotensive shock, coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, fibrillation and arrest. These severe reactions are usually reversible with prompt and appropriate management; however, fatalities have occurred.

Endocrine reactions: Hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism.

Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Reactions range from mild (e.g. rash, erythema, pruritus, urticaria and skin discoloration) to severe: [e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)].

Technique reactions: Extravasation with burning pain, hematomas, ecchymosis and tissue necrosis, paresthesia or numbness, vascular constriction due to injection rate, thrombosis and thrombophlebitis.

Neurological reactions: Spasm, convulsions, aphasia, syncope, paresis, paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury and pathology associated with syndrome of transverse myelitis, visual field losses which are usually transient but may be permanent, coma and death.

Other reactions: Headache, trembling, shaking, chills without fever and lightheadedness. Temporary renal shutdown or other nephropathy.

(Adverse reactions to specific procedures receive comment under that procedure.)

### Enoxaparin sodium, isopropyl alcohol (enoxiluv kit) [^117EpKnq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of enoxaparin sodium injection. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

There have been reports of epidural or spinal hematoma formation with concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium injection and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture. The majority of patients had a postoperative indwelling epidural catheter placed for analgesia or received additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs. Many of the epidural or spinal hematomas caused neurologic injury, including long-term or permanent paralysis.

Local reactions at the injection site (e.g. nodules, inflammation, oozing), systemic allergic reactions (e.g. pruritus, urticaria, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions including shock), vesiculobullous rash, cases of hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis, purpura, skin necrosis (occurring at either the injection site or distant from the injection site), thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia with thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] have been reported.

Cases of hyperkalemia have been reported. Most of these reports occurred in patients who also had conditions that tend toward the development of hyperkalemia (e.g., renal dysfunction, concomitant potassium-sparing drugs, administration of potassium, hematoma in body tissues). Very rare cases of hyperlipidemia have also been reported, with one case of hyperlipidemia, with marked hypertriglyceridemia, reported in a diabetic pregnant woman; causality has not been determined.

Cases of headache, hemorrhagic anemia, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and cholestatic liver injury have been reported. Osteoporosis has also been reported following long-term therapy.

A 9-month-old boy presented with multiple hemorrhagic subcutaneous nodules after treatment with oral antibiotics for an upper respiratory tract infection. Excessive bleeding after an incisional biopsy led to a diagnosis of hemophilia A. While this was an unexpected presentation of hemophilia, screening laboratory coagulation studies prior to biopsy would have revealed the etiology. Similar presentations should alert dermatologists to suspect an underlying coagulation defect prior to biopsy, thus averting bleeding complications.

Question 3: What other sport is likely to result in a similar appearance?
A. Running
B. Scuba diving
C. Ping-pong
D. Water polo
E. Wrestling

Answers:
A. Running – Incorrect. Running lacks the high-velocity impact of the skin against a surface, making it unlikely to cause our patient's rash. Skin diseases associated with running include jogger's nipples, jogger's toe, traction alopecia, runner's rump, piezogenic pedal papules, blisters, and tinea pedis.
B. Scuba diving – Incorrect. Scuba diving lacks the high-velocity impact of the skin against a surface, making it unlikely to cause our patient's rash. Skin disease associated with scuba diving includes scuba diver facial dermatitis from masks, diving suit dermatitis from the rubber suit, and purpura goggelorum from goggles.
C. Ping-pong - Correct. A similar phenomenon is seen in high-velocity ball sports such as ping-pong, squash, floorball, racquetball, and paintball. In these activities, a high-velocity ball strikes the skin, resulting in an erythematous ring surrounding central blanching with or without accompanying or the subsequent development of purpura, described by Cohen as the ball SITE (sports-induced targetoid erythema) sign. In diving, the high-velocity impact produces similar lesions briefly mentioned in rare articles as platform purpura.
D. Water polo – Incorrect. Although water poloists also spend time in the pool as our patient did, they do not hit the water with velocities comparable to competitive divers, making it unlikely for this sport to result in a rash like the one in our patient. Skin disease associated with water polo includes swimmer's shoulder caused by repeated rubbing of an unshaven beard against the shoulder, and bikini bottom, which is a deep bacterial folliculitis associated with damp and tight-fitting swimwear.
E. Wrestling – Incorrect. Wrestling lacks the high-velocity impact of the skin against a surface, making it unlikely to cause our patient's rash. Skin disease associated with wrestling includes mat burn as well as herpes gladiatorum, scabies, pediculosis, and impetigo from close skin-to-skin contact between athletes.

### Cerliponase alfa (Brineura) [^115xLDES]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hematoma

Hematoma adverse reactions were reported in 5 of 24 (21%) patients treated with BRINEURA and presented as hematoma, post procedural hematoma, traumatic hematoma and subdural hematoma. Hematomas did not require treatment and did not interfere with BRINEURA infusion.

Hypersensitivity

Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 11 out of 24 patients (46%) treated with BRINEURA during or within 24 hours after completion of the BRINEURA infusion, despite pre-medication with antihistamines with or without antipyretics or corticosteroids. The most common manifestations observed concomitantly with hypersensitivity included pyrexia with vomiting, pleocytosis, or irritability, which are not consistent with classic immune mediated hypersensitivity. Symptoms resolved over time or with administration of antipyretics, antihistamines and/or corticosteroids and no patient discontinued treatment with BRINEURA.

One patient experienced hypoxia (decreased oxygen saturation less than 88% by pulse oximeter), 8 hours after BRINEURA infusion, followed by a low mean arterial pressure at 15 hours post infusion. Symptoms resolved after oxygen administration, airway repositioning and normal saline infusion. One patient reported decreased oxygen saturation (90% by pulse oximeter), 45 minutes after starting BRINEURA with associated low diastolic blood pressures. Hypoxia resolved after oxygen administration. No treatment was administered for the low diastolic blood pressure, which returned to normal while the patient continued to receive BRINEURA infusion without change to the infusion rate or dose.

### Pediatric scurvy case report: a novel presentation with deep vein thrombosis secondary to large bilateral spontaneous iliac subperiosteal hematomas [^114KQCDY]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Scurvy is a disease caused by deficiency of vitamin C. Scurvy is uncommon in developed countries and the clinical manifestations are non-specific and wide ranging, including bleeding, musculoskeletal pain, iron deficiency anaemia and rash. Therefore, vitamin C deficiency is frequently initially misdiagnosed or the diagnosis delayed. We present a case of scurvy in a teenage boy with a background of autism, who presented with a two month history of immobility and acute lower limb swelling due to a deep vein thrombosis. MRI of the pelvis and hips revealed large bilateral subperiosteal iliac hematomas. Further interrogation of the clinical history and examination findings, together with subsequent improvement following vitamin C replacement are consistent with the diagnosis of scurvy.

To the authors knowledge, this is the first reported case of large spontaneous bilateral iliac bone subperiosteal hematomas in scurvy and the first case of deep vein thrombosis caused by pelvic subperiosteal hematoma. Our objective is to highlight this case to musculoskeletal radiologists to improve the awareness of scurvy as a cause of spontaneous bleeding and particularly to emphasize the importance of early clinical suspicion in the context of children or adults with developmental issues, cognitive impairment, or severe dietary restriction for any other reasons.

### Hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis caused by warfarin therapy [^1163C2qD]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis is a blistering eruption associated with heparin therapy. A characteristic report of this entity came from Perrinaud et alin 2006. Interestingly, the pathogenesis of this condition remains poorly understood. Both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin have been implicated, and to our knowledge, as few as 14 cases have been reported in the literature. This is an unusual case of hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis associated with warfarin monotherapy. In cases described with heparin initiation, this entity typically appears within 5 to 21 days and presents as numerous asymptomatic and tense, blood-filled bullae and papules on uninflamed skin. These lesions involve areas distant to the injection site. Laboratory studies are generally within normal limits. Histopathology often shows nonspecific intraepidermal or subcorneal vesicles filled with red blood cells without evidence of vasculitis, capillary thrombosis, or significant inflammatory infiltrate. The condition resolves without sequelae after heparin is discontinued or may spontaneously resolve despite continued heparin use. Heparin skin reactions are normally confined to the site of injection, making the global distribution of hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis particularly unusual. Injection site reactions may be immune mediated or non–immune mediated and include skin necrosis, hematomas, ecchymoses, erythematous plaques, nodules, angioedema, dermatitis, and urticaria. Heparin rarely causes generalized skin reactions, although diffuse necrosis may signify the cutaneous manifestation of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, a serious paradoxical hypercoagulable state.

Cutaneous toxicities associated with warfarin, such as dermatitis and urticaria, are rare. The most dreaded complication, skin necrosis, is seen in about 0.01% to 0.1% of patients. Like heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a paradoxical hypercoagulable reaction, causing occlusive thrombi in cutaneous and subcutaneous venules. It occurs early on in treatment, usually within 3 to 10 days. The condition manifests suddenly as painful, erythematous plaques with predilection for adipose-rich areas such as the buttocks, hips, and breasts but may occur on extremities and the penis. Plaques transform into bullae, which blister and develop into full-thickness skin necrosis. Affected patients often have a history of receiving an initial large loading dose of warfarin. Our patient's recent trial of warfarin raised concern for skin necrosis. However, her history was not consistent with skin necrosis, as she received a prophylactic dose of warfarin, and her skin lesions were painless.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^112mWfNv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of enoxaparin sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

There have been reports of epidural or spinal hematoma formation with concurrent use of enoxaparin sodium and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture. The majority of patients had a postoperative indwelling epidural catheter placed for analgesia or received additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs. Many of the epidural or spinal hematomas caused neurologic injury, including long-term or permanent paralysis.

Local reactions at the injection site (e.g. nodules, inflammation, oozing), systemic allergic reactions (e.g. pruritus, urticaria, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions including shock), vesiculobullous rash, cases of hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis, purpura, skin necrosis (occurring at either the injection site or distant from the injection site), thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia with thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] have been reported.

Cases of hyperkalemia have been reported. Most of these reports occurred in patients who also had conditions that tend toward the development of hyperkalemia (e.g., renal dysfunction, concomitant potassium-sparing drugs, administration of potassium, hematoma in body tissues). Very rare cases of hyperlipidemia have also been reported, with one case of hyperlipidemia, with marked hypertriglyceridemia, reported in a diabetic pregnant woman; causality has not been determined.

Cases of headache, hemorrhagic anemia, eosinophilia, alopecia, hepatocellular and cholestatic liver injury have been reported.

Osteoporosis has also been reported following long-term therapy.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111TDkng]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

COVID‐19 is now known to have varied clinical manifestations and to target multiple organs, including the skin.COVID‐19 rashes may present in many forms and at different stages of the disease.

In our app‐based study, 8.8% of patients who were positive for COVID‐19 via swab tests also reported skin rashes (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.42–1.97). Body rashes were more frequent than acral lesions (6.8% vs. 3.1%), although their predictive value was similar (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.37–1.99 vs. 1.74, 95% CI 1.33–2.28, respectively). Interestingly, the OR for both types of rash was greater than for fever (OR 1.48), a widely used criterion to suggest testing. Reports of cases with both body rashes and acral lesions were rare (1.1%), suggesting different pathogenesis, with the former caused by immunological reactions to the virus, and the latter more likely explained by delayed small thrombotic occlusions or damage to vessel walls.

### The risks and safety of clopidogrel in pediatric arterial ischemic stroke [^1115auR2]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine safety and tolerability of clopidogrel in children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS). Clopidogrel is the alternative antiplatelet medication when aspirin is not tolerated or fails. The possible risks and safety of clopidogrel in children with AIS have not been assessed.

Methods

This is a prospective consecutive cohort study of children with AIS who were started on clopidogrel. Seventeen children were included.

Results

Two children developed subdural hematomas while on clopidogrel in conjunction with aspirin. Two others had headache or hand numbness. No other side effects like rash or gastrointestinal upsets were reported.

Conclusions

We found clopidogrel to be relatively well tolerated in the pediatric population. In combination with aspirin and in the presence of other risk factors, intracranial bleeding may be seen.

### The rash that presents as a red swollen face [^112yieUU]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

A red swollen face can be a skin sign of a potentially life-threatening condition. We present in detail the main clinical presentations, diagnostic tests, and management of some of the most severe conditions that can frequently present as a red and swollen face: acute or recurrent angioedema, mast cell-driven or bradykinin-mediated angioedema, nonhereditary and hereditary angioedema, allergic or photoallergic facial contact dermatitis, contact urticaria, severe adverse drug reactions (particularly drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS]), skin infections (erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis), and autoimmune diseases (dermatomyositis). There are many other conditions that also have to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a red swollen face.

### The rash that leads to eschar formation [^114eJZY4]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

When confronted with an existent or evolving eschar, the history is often the most important factor used to put the lesion into proper context. Determining whether the patient has a past medical history of significance, such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus, exposure to dead or live wildlife, or underwent a recent surgical procedure, can help differentiate between many etiologies of eschars. Similarly, the patient's overall clinical condition and the presence or absence of fever can allow infectious processes to be differentiated from other causes. This contribution is intended to help dermatologists identify and manage these various dermatologic conditions, as well as provide an algorithm that can be utilized when approaching a patient presenting with an eschar.

In the two months prior to this presentation, the patient's parents reported a significant reduction in the variety of his already narrow diet, mostly eating cheese sandwiches and crackers. Prior to this he was eating jam and toast which would have been a source of vitamin C. His admission weight was 36.45 kg, significantly lower than the 45 kg weight recorded at an outpatient clinic visit two months earlier. During this period, the patient had been complaining of 'pain all over' and his mobility had steadily declined from walking to being wheelchair bound. Following subsequent scrutiny of the clinical history, the patient and his family did remember a rash on the lower legs around the hair follicles and some bleeding when brushing his teeth. These features had all resolved by the time of the MRI, probably because the patient had been prescribed a multivitamin on admission, Forceval 1 capsule once daily one hour after food, whichcontains vitamin C.

### Efficacy and safety of asfotase alfa in infants and young children with hypophosphatasia: a phase 2 open-label study [^112xzpCW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety and tolerability

All patients experienced at least one TEAE. Table 2 summarizes the most common TEAEs occurring in ≥ 20% of patients, regardless of the relationship to study drug. Most TEAEs were mild [2125/3052 (70%)] or moderate [728/3052 (24%)] in severity and assessed by the investigator as unrelated to study drug [2409/3052 (79%)]. The most common TEAEs assessed as related to study drug were ISRs [593/643 (92%)] and IARs [11/643 (2%)], which occurred in 43 and six patients, respectively. The most common ISRs were injection-site erythema [33/69 (48%)], discoloration [12/69 (17%)], induration [11/69 (16%)], and hematoma [10/69 (14%)]. IARs consisted of pyrexia [4/69 (6%)], chills [1/69 (1%)], injection-site rash [1/69 (1%)], anaphylactoid reaction [1/69 (1%)], drug hypersensitivity [1/69 (1%)], and papular rash [1/69 (1%)]. The IARs of anaphylactoid reaction (categorized as Stage 1 anaphylactic shock) and drug hypersensitivity were considered serious; neither patient had received pretreatment with medications to manage IARs. Both events resulted in interruption of asfotase alfa administration; the anaphylactoid reaction was treated with an IV electrolyte solution, and no treatment was given for the event of drug hypersensitivity. Both events resolved, and treatment with asfotase alfa was restarted without further occurrences.

### Thalidomide-associated thrombocytopenia [^113c4bv8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report thrombocytopenia in a patient prescribed thalidomide for multiple myeloma (MM).

Case Summary

A 70-year-old woman was diagnosed in 2003 with MM. At diagnosis, melphalan 0.25 mg/kg/day and prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day were started; however, the patient became refractory to therapy. Melphalan and prednisolone were discontinued, and monotherapy with dexamethasone 40 mg for 12 days per month was started. The patient's hematologic condition deteriorated again after about one year; dexamethasone was discontinued, and treatment with oral thalidomide 200 mg/day was initiated. About 2 weeks after thalidomide administration, the woman developed disabling adverse effects (flu-like symptoms, swollen fingers, rash and hematoma on her legs, shortness of breath, dry mouth, multiple petechiae). Laboratory testing showed neutropenia (neutrophils 0.4 × 10⁹/L) and thrombocytopenia (platelets 58 × 10⁹/L). Thalidomide was promptly discontinued; within 3 weeks, the laboratory values returned to pretreatment levels (1.3 × 10⁹/L and 267 × 10⁹/L, respectively) and her symptoms disappeared.

Discussion

Thrombocytopenia is a rarely reported hematologic adverse consequence of thalidomide therapy. A recent report identified 5 patients who developed thrombocytopenia while undergoing monotherapy with thalidomide for MM. According to the Naranjo probability scale, thalidomide was classified as the probable cause of thrombocytopenia in our patient.

Conclusions

Unlike other antineoplastic drugs, thalidomide is rarely reported to cause severe hematologic toxicity. We present this case to increase clinicians' awareness for the potential of thalidomide to adversely affect platelet counts, particularly because its effectiveness in MM will likely result in expansion of its clinical use.

### Back to the future: a 15-year experience with polyurethane foam-covered breast implants using the partial-subfascial technique [^1117jsJk]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Implants with a polyurethane foam cover have been used by plastic surgeons since Ashley described them in 1970. Overwhelming evidence confirms the benefits of these implants, especially the extremely low incidence of capsular contracture (grades 3 and 4, Baker classification). On the other hand, except for a transient and self-limited rash, there is no evidence that polyurethane implants present more complications than texturized or smooth gel implants. Due to concerns of polyurethane-induced cancer, these implants were withdrawn in United States after approximately 110,000 American women had received them. This fact, together with the probability that these implants will be reintroduced in the United States, suggests that continued monitoring of their long-term safety and effectiveness is mandatory.

Methods

A retrospective study analyzed the outcomes of 996 implants inserted during a period of 15 years. The incidence of early and late complications was analyzed as well as the aesthetic outcome.

Results

The complications evaluated included hematoma (0.6%), infection (0.4%), seroma (0.8%), rash (4.3%), wound dehiscence (0%), capsular contracture (0.4%), implant malposition (0.8%), need for revisional surgery (1.2%), implant rupture (0.7%), rippling (1.8%), and polyurethane-related cancer (0%). Regarding the aesthetic outcome, 95% of the patients expressed satisfaction with their final result.

Conclusion

The polyurethane foam-covered implants have been proven safe for use in breast surgery. They provide the lowest rate of capsular contracture (0.4% in the current study) and excellent aesthetic results.

6.2	Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Lovenox. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

There have been reports of epidural or spinal hematoma formation with concurrent use of Lovenox and spinal/epidural anesthesia or spinal puncture. The majority of patients had a postoperative indwelling epidural catheter placed for analgesia or received additional drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs. Many of the epidural or spinal hematomas caused neurologic injury, including long-term or permanent paralysis.

Local reactions at the injection site (e.g. nodules, inflammation, oozing), systemic allergic reactions (e.g. pruritus, urticaria, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions including shock), vesiculobullous rash, cases of hypersensitivity cutaneous vasculitis, purpura, skin necrosis (occurring at either the injection site or distant from the injection site), thrombocytosis, and thrombocytopenia with thrombosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] have been reported.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^114gT6rK]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

### Rocuronium blockade reversal with sugammadex vs. neostigmine: randomized study in Chinese and caucasian subjects [^1173EFNE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Ten Chinese subjects (seven receiving sugammadex and three receiving neostigmine) had AEs considered by the study sponsor to be potentially attributable to drug hypersensitivity (e.g. mild-to-moderate rash, pruritis, facial swelling, facial flushing). All except one of these AEs (moderate rash on chest following sugammadex) were considered by the investigator to be unlikely to be related to the study drug. This subject, who experienced moderate rash on the chest, was treated with diphenhydramine and recovered on the same day. There were no reports consistent with anaphylaxis.

Events considered by the investigator to be likely reflective of bleeding were reported for eight (7%) Chinese subjects treated with sugammadex (five cases of vaginal hemorrhage, plus a case each of incision site hemorrhage, uterine hemorrhage and occult blood stool), and for 12 (11%) Chinese subjects treated with neostigmine (nine cases of vaginal hemorrhage, one case of incision site hemorrhage, and two cases of melaena). One (2%) Caucasian subject had a bleeding event; this patient experienced post-procedural hematoma after lumpectomy surgery, and was treated with neostigmine. None of these events were considered by the investigator to be related to study medication.

In total, PONV events were reported for 16 Chinese (13%) and four Caucasian (14%) subjects who were treated with sugammadex and 19 Chinese (17%) and seven Caucasian (23%) subjects who were treated with neostigmine. Each subject had at least one PONV risk factor with the majority of subjects having three risk factors.

### Heparin-induced bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis: a report of 3 cases [^114fvtKJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Known common adverse reactions to heparin include hematoma, ecchymosis, skin necrosis, urticaria, angioedema, and eczematous dermatitis. Bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis is typically associated with either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, by subcutaneous injection or continuous infusion, and much less commonly warfarin therapy. Although the clinical lesions of bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis can be distinct, the differential diagnoses include leukocytoclastic vasculitis, heparin-induced skin necrosis, and warfarin necrosis. The clinical history and skin biopsy can distinguish between these entities if the diagnosis is in question. A brief review of recent reports of bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis in the English-language literature showed the mean age of patients to be 72 years (range 38 to 90 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 2.6:1. The most frequent sites of lesions were on the extremities alone, followed by the trunk and extremities, lesions on the head and neck being rare. In reports that included size measurements, lesions ranged from 0.2 to 2.0 cm in diameter. The average duration to onset of lesions was 8.7 days, with a range of 1 to 30 days. Lesions usually resolved by 3 to 4 weeks from onset independent of whether heparin therapy was continued, discontinued, or changed to another anticoagulant therapy. Laboratory and coagulation study results were typically unremarkable.,

The duration to onset of bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis in case 1 was 2 weeks, which is consistent with most cases described in the literature. However, the onset of bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis in case 2 was unusual in its relative delay of 4 months after the start of unfractionated heparin therapy. The patient's lesions resolved spontaneously by 3 weeks from presentation despite continuing required heparin therapy. Facial involvement with bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis, as in case 2, is uncommon. The onset of bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis in case 3 was less clear, but the lesions appeared to be in later stages and resolving. The mechanism of bullous hemorrhagic dermatosis remains unknown. Proposed hypotheses have included overanticoagulation, hypersensitivity, and idiosyncratic reaction. However, many patients had normal laboratory study results and were receiving monotherapy anticoagulation, and none demonstrated eosinophils or significant inflammatory infiltrate on biopsy.

### Carbamazepine (Epitol) [^114Kfb8g]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide before taking Epitol.

Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of a potential hematologic problem, as well as dermatologic, hypersensitivity or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. The patient should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use.

Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with Epitol. In the event a skin reaction should occur while taking Epitol, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS).

Patients should be advised that anaphylactic reactions and angioedema may occur during treatment with Epitol (see WARNINGS). Advise patients to immediately report signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their healthcare provider.

### Bruising, hives, and joint pain in a 3-year-old boy [^116dYdoi]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the MOST likely diagnosis?
A. Child abuse
B. Serum sickness
C. Serum-sickness like reaction (SSLR)
D. Urticarial vasculitis (UV)
E. Urticaria multiforme

Answers:
A. Child abuse – Incorrect. Child abuse is unlikely given the child's playful nature and symmetric, generalized arthralgias. Polymorphous shaped lesions are not typical of external trauma.
B. Serum sickness – Incorrect. Serum sickness is an immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction triggered by foreign protein; β-lactam antibiotics are not reported triggers. In addition to classic fever, polyarthritis, and diffuse rash, deposition of immune complexes causes multiorgan involvement and low levels of complement.
C. Serum-sickness like reaction (SSLR) – Correct. SSLR is a hypersensitivity reaction which typically occurs in young children treated with antibiotics. Fever and arthralgias accompany blanchable urticaria-like papules and plaques which persist longer than 24–36 hours. Plaques are often annular or arcuate, becoming polymorphous in appearance as lesions coalesce. Pink plaques may become violaceous but remain blanchable and are not reticulated as seen with vascular injury. The overall reaction lasts days to weeks following withdrawal of the offending medication. Resolving lesions classically develop an ecchymotic-appearance and heal with hyperpigmentation. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are frequently elevated.
D. Urticarial vasculitis (UV) – Incorrect. UV is a rare form of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, typically seen in adults. Urticaria-like lesions last > 24 hours and heal with ecchymotic hyperpigmentation. The process is typically chronic with recurrent episodes. Biopsy is required for diagnosis. Hypocomplementemic and normocomplementemic variants exist. The scenario of a single acute episode in a young child argues against UV as the best answer.
E. Urticaria multiforme – Incorrect. Urticaria multiforme is a unique variant of acute urticaria which typically affects young children. Annular and polycyclic wheals with dusky centers last less than 24 hours and heal without hyperpigmentation. Arthralgias are not typical.

### Development of spontaneous factor VIII inhibitor in association with acute graft-versus-host disease [^114Tcddh]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old female with recurrent AML underwent a T cell-depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) plus TCD and CD34-selected peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant. Eleven weeks post transplantation, the patient developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) manifested by rash and elevated liver enzymes. Concurrently, the patient presented with a bleeding diathesis and a left forearm hematoma due to the development of a spontaneous factor VIII inhibitor. She was treated with human recombinant factor VIII and intravenous methylprednisolone. Subsequently she was managed with a prednisone taper leading to resolution of the GVHD, as well as the spontaneous factor VIII inhibitor. Bone marrow transplant-related spontaneous factor VIII inhibitor has previously been reported in association with one patient with chronic GVHD. To our knowledge this is the first report of spontaneous factor VIII inhibitor associated with acute GVHD.

### The rash that becomes purpuric, petechial, hemorrhagic, or ecchymotic [^113D181r]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhagic rashes are observed in a wide variety of conditions, ranging from harmless to life-threatening. This review offers a stepwise approach, which helps limit the possible differential diagnoses based on the clinical manifestations and the clinical picture. The most common and most important conditions, including infectious, coagulation and embolic disorders, vasculitides, and vasculopathies, are briefly reviewed focusing on morphology. Dermatologists often need to distinguish among infectious, reactive, or autoimmune etiologies of the rash and determine if the condition is dangerous or even life-threatening in order to make the right decision. Dermatologic expertise provides vital input in the diagnosis and care of complex interdisciplinary patients, such as those with sepsis, purpura fulminans, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^113JbXQJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions, and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### The case of a painful blue thumb [^114TezeX]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Raynaud syndrome — Incorrect. Raynaud syndrome is the abnormal vasoconstriction of digital arteries and arterioles because of cold temperatures, emotional stress, or systemic disease. Although it may cause pain, it usually lasts for 15 to 20 minutes and is characterized by multiple discolorations (eg, white, blue, red).
B. Polyarteritis nodosa — Incorrect. Several vasculitides (eg, Takayasu arteritis, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangiitis) may result in digital purpura. However, these vasculitides are often associated with other systemic findings and do not follow a benign cyclical pattern.
C. Arterial embolism — Incorrect. Although an arterial embolus causes acute pain and discoloration, patients typically have subsequent tissue necrosis, rather than spontaneous resolution, without intervention.
D. Achenbach syndrome — Correct. This is a case of Achenbach syndrome, a rare, self-limiting condition of unknown etiology that predominantly affects middle-aged women. The syndrome is characterized by recurrent paroxysmal hematoma in the fingers, often in the left hand. Clinically, patients present with a sudden burning pain and cyanosis in 1 or more digits (usually the index or middle finger, and less commonly the thumb) that may be associated with swelling, pruritus, coldness, and restricted digit movement, followed by spontaneous resolution without treatment. In the absence of concerning history or alarm symptoms and signs (eg, fever, hypertension, nonpalpable pulses, cutaneous necrosis or ulceration), the diagnosis is established clinically and does not require further testing or procedures.
E. Traumatic hematoma — Incorrect. The patient denied history of repeated trauma or conditions that increase vascular fragility such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Recurrent Henoch-Schönlein purpura with bullous rash and pulmonary nodules [^116ksWMa]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 12-year-old girl presented in early October with a one-week history of progressive and painful bullous rash of the distal lower extremities (Fig. 1 a), abdominal pain, nonproductive cough, and pleuritic chest pain. She denied fevers, mucosal lesions, hematemesis, arthralgia, hematuria, melena, or hematochezia. Her medical history was notable for an identical rash that had been diagnosed as HSP four years prior, accompanied by significant abdominal pain, hematuria, and proteinuria; there was no pulmonary involvement noted at that time. She had been treated with a high-dose oral prednisone taper but did not show improvement until several weeks following completion of that treatment course. She was subsequently symptom-free in the interim. She traveled to the Outer Banks of North Carolina in the months preceding her presentation but had no other travel history.

Fig. 1
a. Bullous rash on recurrence presentation. b. Scarring of rash at 3 months after hospitalization for recurrence

On physical exam, the rash on her feet and ankles was bullous and in various stages of healing, with exquisite tenderness to palpation and positive Nikolsky's sign. She had clustered vesicles with erythematous base on the bilateral extensor surfaces of her elbows as well as scattered non-blanching pinpoint erythematous macules at the inferior aspect of her bilateral buttocks. Cardiopulmonary exam was unremarkable except for an intermittent, dry cough. Her chest pain was not reproducible with palpation.

Basic labs were remarkable for elevations in inflammatory markers and a mildly impaired prothrombin time. Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were otherwise normal. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria and mildly elevated protein-to-creatinine ratio. Chest X-ray was concerning for pulmonary infiltrates. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed multiple peripheral pulmonary nodules concerning for a possible fungal infection versus hemorrhagic vasculitic process (Fig. 2). Abdominal ultrasounds throughout the admission were negative for intussusception, a known complication of HSP resulting from submucosal hematoma or edema.

### The troubling rise of scurvy: a review and national analysis of incidence, associated risk factors, and clinical manifestations [^111bgen5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Often thought of as an outdated diagnosis, scurvy is frequently not included on the list of differential diagnoses for pediatric musculoskeletal reports, which results in delayed diagnosis, increased morbidity, and unnecessarily invasive, costly testing. The most common musculoskeletal presenting report of patients with scurvy is generalized lower extremity pain. Upper extremity symptoms have been reported but are less common. These musculoskeletal symptoms have been theorized as sequelae of subperiosteal or soft-tissue hemorrhage and/or hemarthrosis, commonly presenting in the pediatric patient as refusal to walk, inability to bear weight, or an antalgic gait. In infants and young children, lower extremity pain may manifest as a pseudoparalysis. Infants may display the characteristic 'frog leg' position, with externally rotated and flexed hips and knees, while older children may present with flexion contractures at the knee.

Additional musculoskeletal manifestations may include swelling of the knee or ankle joints, which may initially be misdiagnosed as septic arthritis or other joint pathologies. In addition, in advanced disease, skeletal growth abnormalities, delayed bone age, or beading at the costochondral joints, known as the 'scorbutic rosary', may be observed. Spontaneous fracture may occur, and this should raise suspicion for scurvy, particularly when these fractures show inadequate or delayed healing.

Mucocutaneous symptoms, such as gingival bleeding, corkscrew hairs, and petechiae, are commonly associated with scurvy (Figure 1). Perifollicular hemorrhage and follicular hyperkeratosis, particularly of the lower extremity, may occur and are considered pathognomonic. Other potential signs and symptoms include psychomotor restlessness, muscular weakness, irritability, excessive fatigue, and failure to thrive. Thus, a young patient with scurvy may present with chief reports including rash, easy bruising, easy bleeding, fussiness in infant/toddler, generalized weakness/fatigue, or appetite/gastrointestinal disturbances. In addition, physicians should be aware that up to 80% of patients with scurvy may have concomitant iron-deficiency anemia, likely due to associated bleeding and potentially decreased iron absorption. Iron-deficiency anemia may also be a manifestation of a poor diet and other co-occurring nutritional deficiencies.

### Hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis caused by warfarin therapy [^117DrD6J]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis is a rare, generalized skin reaction with unknown pathogenesis, described in association with heparin therapy. Heparin is known to cause injection site reactions and ecchymosis but rarely causes global cutaneous reactions, making hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis an unusual clinical entity. The condition occurs within 5 to 21 days of the initiation of therapy at locations distant to the site of subcutaneous heparin injection. Characteristic lesions are painless, hemorrhagic papules on a background of uninvolved skin. The histologic findings are usually nonspecific but can help rule out thrombosis, vasculitis, or marked inflammatory changes. Skin lesions usually resolve after discontinuation of heparin. We present a case of hemorrhagic bullous dermatosis in an 82-year-old woman recently started on warfarin therapy and briefly review skin effects of anticoagulation.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mpox, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, WHO 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that it can be challenging to differentiate mpox solely based on the clinical presentation, particularly in cases with an atypical presentation, due to the range of conditions causing skin rashes and because clinical presentation may more often be atypical during this outbreak.

### Catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage as a presenting feature of juvenile polyarteritis nodosa [^117BfKJk]. Journal of Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Intracranial hemorrhage has been rarely reported during the course of polyarteritis nodosa. We describe a 6-year-old boy who presented with fever, altered sensorium, skin rash, hypertension, and catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage. After surgical evacuation of the intracranial hematoma, he underwent a computerized tomography angiogram that showed narrowing of the right anterior cerebral artery. Skin biopsy showed small vessel vasculitis. Nerve conduction studies were suggestive of mononeuritis multiplex. He was diagnosed as polyarteritis nodosa and managed with immunosuppressants, to which he responded favorably. The most interesting aspect of the child's presentation was the catastrophic onset of altered sensorium with raised intracranial pressure, which was a diagnostic challenge. The mechanisms of intracranial hemorrhage in polyarteritis nodosa and a review of the literature are discussed. The authors emphasize that it is important to recognize intracranial hemorrhage as a life-threatening complication in children with polyarteritis nodosa to institute timely therapy.

### The generalized rash: part II. diagnostic approach [^113F39rh]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g., travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities; pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching, and the Koebner phenomenon.

### Acquired subgaleal fluid collections in childhood: a case series [^1129XVA8]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

These typical cases of DSFC, which occur in the absence of recent trauma, should not obscure other causes of scalp swelling (Fig 6 and Table I). They occur after natural childbirth, are more frequent and have an earlier onset. Sometimes, they do not resolve spontaneously and require appropriate management:

- Of these, the serosanguineous bump or caput succedaneum is the most common. Caput succedaneum is an effusion between the skin and fascia that develops as a result of increased pressure on the head of a cephalically-presented newborn during labor. A few hours after birth, a bruised serosanguineous infiltration develops, which is not bounded by the cranial sutures. Spontaneous regression within a few days is typical.
- Cephalohematoma is a subperiosteal collection caused by ruptured blood vessels under the periosteum, occurring in the context of assisted vacuum or forceps delivery, but also as a result of an elevated head circumference. This hemorrhage is limited by the cranial sutures, skin-colored, and can be somewhat delayed until a few hours after birth, due to slow bleeding. It resolves in 3 weeks on average, with the possibility of residual calcification disappearing a few months later.
- The second type of subgaleal collection is subgaleal hematoma, which is a blood collection located between the galea and the periosteum due to ruptured veins connecting the dural sinuses and scalp veins. Like subgaleal collection, this collection is not constrained by the cranial sutures. The difference is clinical, indeed subgaleal hematoma is frequently ecchymotic, painful and taut. In neonates, this is a rare entity, but it can lead to serious neurological disorders and even death. Risk factors include forceps or vacuum delivery. However, subgaleal hematomas can occur spontaneously. It can cause hemorrhage of up to a third of the blood volume, leading to hypovolemic shock and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Onset is gradual after birth, and resolution takes 2 to 3 weeks. When treatment is required, surgical evacuation or compression bandaging of the skull is necessary, in addition to measures to prevent hypovolemic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### Safety and feasibility of recombinant factor VIIa for acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^116FrF5Q]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Hematoma growth occurs in 38% of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients scanned by computed tomography (CT) within 3 hours of onset. Activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) promotes hemostasis at sites of vascular injury and may minimize hematoma growth after ICH.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial, 48 subjects with ICH diagnosed within 3 hours of onset were treated with placebo (n = 12) or rFVIIa (10, 20, 40, 80, 120, or 160 microg/kg; n = 6 per group). The primary endpoint was the frequency of adverse events (AEs). Safety assessments included serial electrocardiography (ECG), troponin I and coagulation testing, lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography, and calculation of edema:ICH volume ratios.

Results

Mean age was 61 years (range, 30 to 93) and 57% were male. At admission, mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14 (range, 1 to 26), median Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14 (range, 6 to 15), and mean ICH volume was 21 mL (range, 1 to 151). Mean time from onset to treatment was 181 minutes (range, 120 to 265). Twelve serious AEs occurred, including 5 deaths (mortality 11%). Six AEs were considered possibly treatment-related, including rash, vomiting, fever, ECG T-wave inversion, and 2 cases of deep vein thrombosis (placebo and 20-microg/kg groups). No myocardial ischemia, consumption coagulopathy, or dose-related increase in edema:ICH volume occurred.

Conclusions

This small phase II trial evaluated a wide range of rFVIIa doses in acute ICH and raised no major safety concerns. Larger studies are justified to determine whether rFVIIa can safely and effectively limit ICH growth.

### Heparin-induced skin lesions [^116Geqgh]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Heparins are widely used for prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. Besides bleeding complications, heparin-induced skin lesions are the most frequent unwanted adverse effects of subcutaneous heparin treatment. Evidence suggests that these lesions are more common than previously thought. Lesions are most frequently due to either allergic reactions or to possibly life-threatening heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Early recognition and adequate treatment are highly important, because although both complications initially show a similar clinical picture, their treatment should be fundamentally different. Furthermore, risk factors associated with the patient, drug, and treatment regimen have been identified. We review the clinical range of heparin-induced skin lesions, emphasise evidence and controversies in epidemiology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis, and discuss the management of patients with these skin lesions.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 59-year-old man who initially had a sore throat, a truncal rash, and fever. Two weeks later, arthralgias and abrupt bilateral hearing loss developed. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges. As the clinical course progresses, the differential is refined until a diagnosis is made.

### Infant with a rapidly progressing rash [^115eWAC5]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

An infant presented to the emergency department with sudden onset of rapidly progressing erythematous macules and distal oedema. The rash was striking in appearance, covering most of the body, which raised concern for pressing infectious (eg, meningococcaemia) and other serious aetiologies. Nevertheless, the infant remained playful and was overall stable and posed a diagnostic and management dilemma. After an extensive workup and multispecialty consultations, the patient was eventually diagnosed with acute haemorrhagic oedema of infancy, a benign leucocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient received no treatment and resolution of the rash occurred within 7 days of onset. Recognition of this condition and its benign nature can spare patients from an extensive workup and reduce anxiety for both family members and healthcare providers.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^112THg3C]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal packing: FAQs for patients with nosebleed — packing typically "should be in place for no longer than 5 days", and "if your packing is resorbable, it may not need removal and will go away with time and the use of nasal saline sprays". Bleeding can still occur with packing; "apply pressure to the nose with pinching of the soft area, call your clinician, or go to the emergency department for further management". For nonresorbable packing, using it past the recommended time "can result in possible complications", therefore "strict adherence to follow-up directions is important". Reported risks include infection and pressure-related injury: "There is a low risk of infection spreading to the nose and sinuses or, in extremely rare cases, throughout the body", and pressure "may decrease blood flow to areas of the nose and result in injury". To reduce complications, "oral antibiotics will be used if the risk for infection is high", and "keeping the nose and packing moist with nasal saline (salt water) sprays throughout the day can reduce crusting and help resorbable packing melt away"; "strict adherence to follow-up instructions will allow for appropriate removal of packing when necessary and should make complications less frequent". Activity and medication guidance includes: "you should avoid straining, lifting over 10 pounds, bending over, and exercising", and "avoid over-the-counter pain medications that may increase bleeding, including aspirin and ibuprofen"; "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) does not increase bleeding and can be used", and "you should not try to blow your nose… If you feel the need to sneeze, sneeze with mouth open". Seek care urgently if any warning signs occur: "return of blood from nose or mouth, fever over 101°F, increasing pain, vision changes, shortness of breath or labored breathing, loss of color around the skin of the nose, swelling of the face, or a diffuse skin rash". After removal, "you may initially experience a small amount of bleeding… Keeping the nose humid with saline spray and moisturizing agents will prevent dry crusts and facilitate healing"; if nosebleeds recur, "apply pressure… and consider the use of a vasoconstrictor spray", and "if bleeding continues, call your medical provider, or go to the emergency department for further management".

### Recurrent painful ecchymosis in an adolescent female [^111ZfrKx]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is correct?
A. PP can present after a triggering event such as trauma, emotional distress, surgery, or infection with ecchymosis developing in an unrelated site.
B. PP is a skin manifestation of an underlying coagulation disorder.
C. Psychiatric disease is not a common comorbidity present in patients with PP.
D. Systemic symptoms are not associated with skin lesions in PP.
E. Lesions of PP resolve with low rates of recurrence.

Answers:
A. PP can present after a triggering event such as trauma, emotional distress, surgery, or infection with ecchymosis developing in an unrelated site – Correct. A triggering event can often be identified in patients with PP. Postsurgical procedure is the most common, possibly because of the traumatic and emotional stress of recovering from surgery.
B. PP is a skin manifestation of an underlying coagulation disorder – Incorrect. The diagnosis of PP is made in a patient with no underlying coagulation disorder that could explain the development of ecchymosis. Hematologic laboratory findings are usually normal.
C. Psychiatric disease is not a common comorbidity present in patients with PP – Incorrect. Approximately 50% of patients with PP may have an underlying psychiatric disorder, most commonly depression and personality disorder.
D. Systemic symptoms are not associated with skin lesions in PP – Incorrect. Appearance of new skin lesions in PP may be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, and myalgia. Additionally, gastrointestinal hemorrhages and epistaxis have been reported.
E. Lesions of PP resolve with low rates of recurrence – Incorrect. Lesions of PP resolve within 7 to 10 days. They become less painful and change colors from blue to green and then to yellow before resolving. Unfortunately, lesions do typically recur either in the same location or other parts of the body.

### Safety and efficacy of allogenic human amniotic epithelial cells transplantation via ovarian artery in patients with premature ovarian failure: a single-arm, phase 1 clinical trial [^1148ywui]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Safety

The administration of hAECT was found to be remarkably safe, with no instances of serious adverse event (SAE) associated with the procedure. A total of 16 adverse events (AEs) were reported and are detailed in Table 2. Among the 35 participants, seven (20.00%) developed hematomas at the puncture sites following the transplantations. These hematomas, the most frequently occurring AE, emerged within three days post-hAECT and resolved spontaneously. Vascular complications at the puncture site are common after femoral artery puncture. Studies reported that the incidence of hematoma is usually not higher than 17% in angiography or endovascular interventional therapies. In this study, it was observed that 20.00% of participants developed hematomas at the puncture site after hAECT. The occurrence of hematomas may be primarily associated with the puncture, and there is a possibility of underlying associations with cell therapy or the POF disease itself, which is worth to be further verified.

Table 2
Local and systemic adverse events (AEs) post-hAECT.

Systemic AEs accounted for nine out of the 16 reported AEs (56.25%). These included incidents of pelvic pain, fever, anaphylaxis, and hepatotoxicity. Intraoperative or postoperative pelvic pain was experienced by four subjects (11.43%), which subsided within 4–6 h, which may be associated with vasospasm or uterine contractions induced by the surgical procedure. Two participants (5.71%) had a mild episode of fever (Grade 1) that resolved within 4–8 h. Anaphylactic reactions were documented in two patients (5.71%) who exhibited a red rash with itching after treatment. They were promptly administered antihistamine medication and recovered within seven to ten days. Additionally, one patient displayed an abnormal liver function test after a one-month follow-up without experiencing any discomfort. Notably, all reported AEs occurred in close proximity to the time of cell infusion, which could not be ruled out as related to cell therapy. However, all of them were of Grade 1 severity, and were transient, leaving no lasting effects.

### Unilateral bulge after dermatomal rash [^111Q6MhF]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Case

A 66-year-old male presented with a unilateral flank bulge (Fig 1) for the past 2 weeks in the area of a resolving dermatomal rash after taking valacyclovir 1g three times a day for 7 days. The patient is a martial arts expert. There was loss of sensation overlying the soft, nontender bulge but patient denied fevers, chills, or abdominal pain. Ultrasound was performed and did not show tumor or herniation. A computed tomography scan was ordered but the patient did not receive the test because the nodule was resolving over the next 4 weeks.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Hernia
B. Pseudohernia
C. Lipoma
D. Anetoderma
E. Hematoma

Answers:
A. Hernia – Incorrect. Hernia is the most dangerous entity to rule out in this patient which is the reason for images. Other bedside tests such as auscultation can be done.
B. Pseudohernia – Correct. This complication occurs in 3% to 5% of patients with herpes zoster with a mean time of onset of skin eruption to pseudohernia is 3.5 weeks. It occurs because the inflammation of the nerve is superimposed on a previous pre-existing condition involving a strain on the innervated abdominal musculature such as distention from constipation or strain from excessive abdominal exercises.
C. Lipoma – Incorrect. While this is certainly in the differential, an ultrasound could be able to characterize this lesion and for a lipoma to appear so rapidly is very rare.
D. Anetoderma – Incorrect. This can present as an asymptomatic bulge after an inflammatory insult; however, these lesions do not resolve over time.
E. Hematoma – Incorrect. These subcutaneous nodules are often much smaller and classically painful. These lesions usually grow over a span of months, not weeks.

### Hemorrhagic bullae on bilateral lower extremities [^111CjgCc]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

History

A 33-year-old man newly diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented with worsening hemorrhagic bullae on the extremities that started 4 days earlier as a pink macular rash sparing the trunk. The patient denied any past medical history, medications, allergies, illicit drugs, or trauma over the last year.

On physical exam, the dorsal hands had scattered petechiae and hemorrhagic vesicles. The palms and soles were unaffected. Nonpitting edema and numerous hemorrhagic bullae with erythematous rims mixed with purpuric papules and plaques in a retiform pattern were noted on the lower extremities.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Bullous erythema multiforme
B. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster
C. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura
D. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to syphilis
E. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita

Answers:
A. Bullous erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Bullous erythema multiforme is an immune mediated hypersensitivity reaction that presents with targetoid lesions on the skin and mucosal surfaces.
B. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster – Incorrect. Hemorrhagic herpes zoster is a dermatomal eruption that occurs when the varicella zoster virus is reactivated in the sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion and commonly occurs in association with immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia, and/or anticoagulant use.
C. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura – Incorrect. Hemorrhagic bullous Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a self-limiting rare manifestation of a common vasculitic disease in childhood and is frequently associated with abdominal pain, arthralgias and/or renal involvement.
D. Bullous leukocytoclastic vasculitis secondary to syphilis (Fig 1) – Correct. Bullous LCV is a manifestation of small vessel vasculitis, characterized by immune complex deposition in postcapillary venules leading to destructive inflammatory venulitis (Fig 1, Fig 2 3). Syphilis-induced endothelial cell swelling and endarteritis obliterans have been documented, but cases of LCV, especially with concurrent HIV infection, are rare. The potential mechanisms involve delayed hypersensitivity reactions mediated by antibody-antigen complexes and neutrophil hyperactivation, with HIV-induced immune alterations contributing.
E. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a rare autoimmune blistering condition that arises due to autoantibodies targeting type VII collagen. These bullae typically erupt in sites of trauma and can progress to milia and scarring.

### Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever with acute subdural hematoma, Mauritania, 2012 [^115MkKks]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment with platelet transfusions and supportive therapy was initiated. Fever and epistaxis improved on the third day of admission. On hospitalization day 6, headache and acute encephalopathy developed in the patient. Glasgow Coma Scale score was 13 (Figure, panel A). A computed tomography (CT) scan of his head without contrast showed acute subdural hematoma on the left side. On day 16 of admission, the patient's general condition worsened; he became more obtunded (experienced reduced consciousness), and right-sided upper limb hemiparesis developed. A repeat CT scan of his head showed a subdural hematoma with surrounding edema and midline shift (Figure, panel B).

Our care team considered a conservative management approach. We gave the patient corticosteroids and saline. After 4 weeks, his symptoms had improved markedly and he was discharged in stable condition. A 1-month follow-up CT scan of his head without contrast showed complete resolution of the subdural hematoma (Figure, panel C). Thrombocytopenia could be considered a risk factor for the development of a spontaneous acute subdural hematoma of arterial origin with more rapid and aggressive evolution.

The main vector for CCHF virus transmission appears to be ticks from the genus Hyalomma. CCHF that affects multiple organs is characterized by fever, myalgia, headache, shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, recurrent extensive bleeding, and thrombocytopenia. After 5–6 days of illness, petechial rash, signs of bleeding (e.g. hematemesis and melena), and liver failure occur. CCHF can be diagnosed by using serologic tests to detect IgM and IgG against the virus and by using molecular-based techniques, such as conventional and real-time reverse transcription PCRs, to detect the genome of the virus.

Brain hemorrhage in persons with CCHF is rare. We report a case of acute subdural hematoma secondary to CCHF, where thrombocytopenia was the main cause of cerebral hemorrhage. Management of this case was challenging due to the underlying bleeding tendency of the patient and risk for nosocomial infection. We provided conservative treatment and the patient showed total remission. The patient improved due to the use of corticosteroids and the natural progressive resorption of blood.

Adverse events

AEs were rare and always mild and transient. Neither grade three-four nor serious AE was reported (Table 3). All patients who underwent a procedure on an outpatient basis never required hospitalization due to an AE. Pain (grade 2) during the procedure was recorded in four cases out of 99 procedures (4.0%) and was responsible for the interruption in 3 cases. In all cases, complete pain relief was achieved upon interruption of the procedure, and no drug intervention was required. Importantly, the same technique could be applied again to accomplish the biopsy in 2/3 interruptions (66.7%), without any inconvenience. Hematoma within the biopsy site (grade 1) was documented in three cases (3.0%). This was painless, always asymptomatic, and required no intervention apart from patient monitoring with echosonography for at least 2 h after the procedure. In none of the cases, the hematoma increased in size. Contrast medium extravasation was observed in one case (1.0%), as well as contrast medium-associated cutaneous rash (1.0%). The latter complication was extremely mild and transient (grade 1) and did not require either delay in the procedure or drug intervention.

### Rash decisions: an approach to dangerous rashes based on morphology [^11413nH8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rash is a common complaint in the emergency department. Many causes of rash are benign; however, some patients may have a life-threatening diagnosis.

Objective

This review will present an algorithmic approach to rashes, focusing on life-threatening causes of rash in each category.

Discussion

Rash is common, with a wide range of etiologies. The differential is broad, consisting of many conditions that are self-resolving. However, several conditions associated with rash are life threatening. Several keys can be utilized to rapidly diagnose and manage these deadly rashes. Thorough history and physical examination, followed by consideration of red flags, are essential. This review focuses on four broad categories based on visual and tactile characteristic patterns of rashes: petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. Rashes in each morphologic group will be further categorized based on clinical features such as the presence or absence of fever and distribution of skin lesions.

Conclusions

Rashes can be divided into petechial/purpuric, erythematous, maculopapular, and vesiculobullous. After this differentiation, the presence of fever and systemic signs of illness should be assessed. Through the breakdown of rashes into these classes, emergency providers can ensure deadly conditions are considered.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^114qTLAM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Various infections and autoimmune and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious; nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration in both unexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms to the clinical diagnosis of skin conditions with vesicles and bullae. We focus on several aspects, when assessing a patient with blisters on the skin: age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medications intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters, the characteristics of the peribullous skin, and the presence of mucosal involvement. Emphasis is put on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign self-limiting conditions. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^117WNs86]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Heparin hypersensitivity — manifestations and timing — includes both delayed-type reactions (DHR) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). DHRs can affect up to 7.5% of patients treated and often present with itching, eczematous plaque, or maculopapular eruption that appears after 7 to 10 days of continuous initial treatment, with faster onset on re-exposure. Immediate-type reactions are rare but can include palmoplantar pruritus, urticaria, conjunctivitis, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis. With unfractionated heparin (UFH), mild thrombocytopenia occurs in about 30% to 50% of critically ill patients, while severe HIT occurs in around 1% and usually develops after 5 days of treatment with UFH or low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs); previously sensitized patients with HIT can react on the first dose with fever, flushing, dyspnea, mental status change, and hypertension.

### A randomized comparison of two prophylaxis regimens and a paired comparison of on-demand and prophylaxis treatments in hemophilia A management [^11147EDK]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Safety

Safety was assessed in all 73 treated subjects. A total of 200 AEs were reported by 44 subjects: 186 were non-serious events in 41 subjects, of which 19 were considered related to the treatment, and 14 were serious AEs (SAE) in 11 subjects, of which 1 (0.5%) was considered treatment related. No subject developed a confirmed FVIII inhibitor. There were no deaths or withdrawals as a result of AEs. The reported treatment-related SAE was a case of a possible low-titer FVIII inhibitor (0.4 BU mL⁻¹), which was unconfirmed, unaccompanied by symptoms of inhibitor presence and disappeared at the subject's subsequent test. One previously unreported, treatment-related mild AE involved five episodes of palpitations with dizziness in one subject who had several infusions before and after each event without further symptoms. Other AEs considered treatment-related were hematoma at the venipuncture site, chest discomfort, dyspnea, hyperhidrosis, generalized rash, pyrexia and headache. None of the changes in clinically significant laboratory values or vital sign parameters were considered treatment-related. There were no statistically significant differences in mean (± SD) AE rates between standard and PK-tailored prophylaxis treatments (0.356 ± 2.012 vs. 0.089 ± 0.383, respectively).

With no subjects developing a confirmed FVIII inhibitor in the present study and one in the overall rAHF-PFM clinical program, which includes 270 PTPs who had at least 10 exposure days or at least 120 days of observation, the PTP inhibitor incidence is 0.37% [95% confidence interval: 0.02; 2.13%].

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^113tgzq7]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

AIUM Practice Parameter — screening for general contraindications states that the appropriate medical history should be reviewed and a focused physical examination performed to ensure that there are no contraindications to performing the procedure. Although there are no known contraindications to the appropriate use of ultrasound guidance to perform a procedure, general procedural contraindications apply, with absolute contraindications including known allergy to the injectate, lack of appropriate equipment or skill to complete the procedure, and inability of the patient to cooperate with the procedure. Relative contraindications include coagulopathy or anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, for which bleeding risk can be minimized by using Doppler ultrasound with light transducer pressure to evaluate for regional vasculature before the procedure and by using ultrasound to guide the smallest gauge needle possible toward the target structure (optimally with a single pass) while avoiding adjacent vasculature, and after the procedure, the area can be monitored with ultrasound for postprocedure bleeding and hematoma formation. Other relative contraindications include underlying medical condition that may be affected by the injectate (eg, diabetes mellitus that may be affected by corticosteroids) and local infection, rash, or skin breakdown.

### Rapidly progressive purpuric plaques in an infant [^112mvDwD]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Erythema multiforme minor
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Sweet Syndrome
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura

Answers:
A. Erythema multiforme minor – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme minor, a self-limited immune-mediated reaction to infections, is characterized by the acute onset of target, maculopapular lesions on extremities. It is not associated with edema of the face.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a leukocytoclastic medium-sized vessel vasculitis associated with cutaneous lesions such as livedo, subcutaneous nodules and annular purpura commonly on the arms and legs. Although cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is the most common form in children, no subcutaneous nodules nor livedo were present here.
C. Sweet Syndrome – Incorrect. SS is characterized by acute purple and erythematous plaques on the face and extremities. Constitutional signs such as fever, malaise, arthralgia and leukocytosis, which are minor criteria for SS, were absent in this patient.
D. Acute Hemorrhagic Edema of Infancy – Correct. AHEI is a rare cutaneous vasculitis, seen in children between 4 and 24 months of age. Initially small erythematous papules or macules progress within 48 hours to sharply demarcated, targetoid, indurated purpuric plaques involving the face, the upper and lower extremities and sparing the trunk. The children appear otherwise well. AHEI is associated with facial edema and low-grade fever.
E. Henoch-Schönlein purpura – Incorrect. HSP and AHEI, both small-vessel vasculitis, have clinical and prognostic distinctive features. HSP mainly affects older children from 3 to 6 years of age, the palpable purpura in HSP is distributed on the buttocks and extensor surface of the legs, sparing the face.HSP's diagnostic criteria include this characteristic rash and at least 1 other than skin system involvement; it may be associated with renal and gastrointestinal risks.

### Pediatric scurvy case report: a novel presentation with deep vein thrombosis secondary to large bilateral spontaneous iliac subperiosteal hematomas [^1172XruM]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Vitamin C is an essential nutrient, an important cofactor for the biosynthesis of collagen in blood vessels, skin amongst other tissues. Vitamin C also promotes iron absorption and transport. Humans cannot synthesis or store vitamin C which means we are reliant of minimum daily dietary intake to prevent deficiency.

Vitamin C deficiency (< 11µmol/L) is more common in developed countries than most clinicians would think, with a prevalence of 1–16% Severe deficiency is however much less common, its prevalence < 0.01% and typically seen in patients with severe dietary restriction such as children with autism and older adults with cognitive impairment.

Severe vitamin C deficiency can lead to potentially life-threatening haemodynamic instability but has a diverse clinical presentation, usually with multisystem involvement. The most common clinical findings are bleeding tendencies including a petechial rash, perifollicular hyperkeratosis, iron deficiency anaemia, lower limb pain and reluctance to walk.

In this case, the patient had recognised risk factors for vitamin C deficiency, namely autism and a severely restricted diet. Recognition of these risk factors led to the suspicion of nutritional deficiencies as a cause for his symptoms and appropriate early initiation of multivitamin replacement. Non-specific lower limb pain, reduced mobility, petechial rash as present in this case are all well recognised in vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C deficiency often co-existes with other nutritional deficiencies such as folic acid, vitamin D and vitamin B12. Whilst spontaneous haemorrhage is well recognised manifestation, this is mostly commonly: intra-orbital, subdural or when subperiosteal, in the lower limbs. This is, to the authors knowledge, the first reported case of intra-pelvic subperiosteal hematoma due to scurvy.

### The rash that becomes an erythroderma [^117TVTNh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency with potentially serious consequences. Several diseases with different etiologies characteristically appear as erythroderma. Depending on the age groups, congenital ichthyosiform disorders, infections, preexisting dermatoses, drug eruptions, and internal malignancies commonly present with, or progress to, erythroderma. The course, prognosis, and management strategies also vary depending on the cause of erythroderma; hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential in minimizing associated morbidity and mortality. The generalized erythema and scaling often obscure the classic clinical features of the underlying skin diseases, posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists. Awareness and elicitation of subtle signs and clinical manifestations are crucial. A step-wise approach ensures completeness of clinical evaluation and avoids missing any relevant clinical data. The initial clinical presentation, cutaneous examination findings, and systemic clues reveal important information regarding the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of erythroderma. The age at onset, symptomatology, duration of illness, initial lesions, initial site of onset, clinical course, family history, types of scales, changes in cutaneous integuments and systemic clues will assist in delineating the nature of underlying disease.

### Tovorafenib (Ojemda) [^1147Ud8u]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Hemorrhage

Hemorrhage, including major hemorrhage defined as symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, can occur with OJEMDA. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], hemorrhagic events occurred in 37% of patients, including epistaxis in 26% and intratumoral hemorrhage in 9%. Serious events of bleeding occurred in 5% of patients including Grade 5 tumor hemorrhage in 1 patient (0.6%). OJEMDA was permanently discontinued for hemorrhage in 2% of patients.

Advise patients and caregivers of the risk of hemorrhage during treatment with OJEMDA. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hemorrhage and evaluate as clinically indicated. Withhold and resume at reduced dose upon improvement, or permanently discontinue based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

5.2	Skin Toxicity Including Photosensitivity

OJEMDA can cause rash, including maculopapular rash and photosensitivity. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], rash occurred in 67% of patients treated with OJEMDA, including Grade 3 rash in 12%. Rash resulted in dose interruption in 15% of patients and dose reduction in 7% of patients. OJEMDA was permanently discontinued due to rash in 1% of patients (n = 2). In the pooled safety population, dermatitis acneiform occurred in 26% of patients treated with OJEMDA, including Grade 3 dermatitis acneiform in 0.6% of patients (n = 1). Dose reduction was required in 2% of patients (n = 3) due to dermatitis acneiform.

Monitor for new or worsening skin reactions. Consider dermatologic consultation and initiate supportive care as clinically indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue OJEMDA based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Photosensitivity

In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], photosensitivity occurred in 12% of patients treated with OJEMDA, including Grade 3 events in 0.6% of patients (n = 1). Advise patients to use precautionary measures against ultraviolet exposure such as use of sunscreen, sunglasses, and/or protective clothing during treatment with OJEMDA. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue OJEMDA based on severity of adverse reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Fever and rash [^1176aEnF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.
