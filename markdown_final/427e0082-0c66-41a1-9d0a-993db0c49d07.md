## Question

Splenic cyst management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about splenic cyst management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the cyst and establishing etiology. Then, I should assess symptoms, size, and complications. Next, I will stratify management by size and symptom status, including special populations like pregnancy and pediatrics. After that, I will compare interventional options and their recurrence risks. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight key principles and pitfalls, verifying each step against the cited literature as I go.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because management hinges on whether the cyst is parasitic or nonparasitic, and whether it is primary (true, epithelial-lined) or secondary (pseudocyst). Wait, let me verify the imaging correlates: ultrasound, CT, and MRI can distinguish cystic from solid lesions and suggest parasitic features such as daughter cysts or a calcified rim, but they cannot reliably differentiate true from false cysts on morphology alone, so I should integrate clinical context and, when needed, serology for hydatid disease before committing to intervention [^1158R4M8] [^113LQBN8] [^11219opP].

> I need to check the clinical assessment next: symptoms such as left upper quadrant pain, fullness, or early satiety, signs of rupture or infection, and cyst size are the main drivers. Hold on, I should verify the size thresholds that trigger intervention; most series converge on symptomatic cysts or those larger than about 5 cm as warranting treatment, whereas small asymptomatic cysts can be observed, with the caveat that pediatric cysts may enlarge during puberty and merit closer follow-up [^113Xbz9E] [^112oGaFc] [^115u4hvp].

> For small, asymptomatic cysts under 5 cm, observation is appropriate; let me double-check the follow-up cadence. Ultrasound at 6 to 12 months is reasonable, with extension of intervals if stable, and cessation of surveillance after several years if no change; I should confirm that pediatric patients warrant follow-up until the end of puberty given documented growth spurts in early adolescence, and I must remember that spontaneous regression has been reported in mild congenital cysts, especially in infants [^112oGaFc] [^111kUmHk].

> Now, for cysts 5 to 10 cm, I should weigh spleen-preserving options carefully. Laparoscopic partial splenectomy is my preferred first-line when anatomy allows, because it achieves complete cyst removal with low recurrence and preserves immunologic function; wait, I should verify recurrence data comparing partial resection versus decapsulation. Multiple series show recurrence after simple decapsulation or cystectomy, whereas partial splenectomy has markedly lower recurrence, supporting a resection-first strategy when feasible [^112Eutfj] [^117BtnfT] [^112oGaFc].

> But wait, what if the patient prefers a minimally invasive, nonresectional option or is high risk for surgery? Percutaneous sclerotherapy is reasonable for cysts under about 8 cm, with meta-analytic data showing markedly lower recurrence in smaller cysts and higher recurrence in larger ones; I should counsel that multiple sessions are often needed and that recurrence risk rises with size, which tempers expectations for durable control in larger lesions [^114j5Dpe] [^111UQcme].

> For cysts larger than 10 cm or those with complications, I need to ensure definitive management. Total splenectomy remains appropriate when the cyst is massive, multiloculated, central/hilar, infected, or when most parenchyma is replaced; hold on, I should verify infectious risk mitigation. Preoperative vaccination against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and Hib, plus postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis and patient education about fever, are essential to mitigate OPSI risk, which persists lifelong after total splenectomy [^113mzUV9] [^111LTY8o].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pregnancy. I should confirm that most reports favor deferring definitive surgery until postpartum when possible, using temporizing measures such as serial ultrasound surveillance and, in select cases, percutaneous drainage for symptom control; however, I need to emphasize that aspiration carries risks of reaccumulation and sepsis, and that case-based decisions should be individualized in a tertiary, multidisciplinary setting with maternal–fetal input [^114ezJn5] [^115BQwLG] [^111LTY8o].

> Next, I will examine pediatric patients, where spleen preservation is paramount. Observation is appropriate for small, stable cysts, and partial splenectomy is preferred over total when anatomy permits; hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought sclerotherapy might be broadly equivalent to surgery in children, but I should correct that impression. While sclerotherapy can be effective, especially in smaller cysts, higher recurrence and the need for repeated procedures under anesthesia are notable, and partial splenectomy offers the most durable control with immunologic preservation in appropriately selected cases [^113Xbz9E] [^112oGaFc] [^114j5Dpe].

> I will now examine hydatid cysts separately, because management diverges. I should confirm that for CE1 or CE3a cysts under 5 cm, medical therapy with albendazole alone may suffice, whereas larger or complicated cysts often benefit from PAIR plus albendazole or surgery, with careful protoscolicidal precautions to prevent spillage; hold on, I should verify the perioperative antiparasitic regimen. WHO guidance supports albendazole before and after interventions, and some authors advocate adding praziquantel when spillage is suspected to reduce protoscolex viability, which I should incorporate into the plan when appropriate [^115tLFYf] [^112eKPct] [^11219opP].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against the evidence. Small asymptomatic cysts under 5 cm are observed with interval ultrasound; symptomatic or larger cysts are considered for intervention, with partial splenectomy favored when technically feasible, sclerotherapy as a reasonable alternative for cysts under about 8 cm, and total splenectomy reserved for large, complex, central, or infected lesions; throughout, I need to ensure vaccination and infection prophylaxis protocols are followed when splenectomy is anticipated or performed [^113Xbz9E] [^112Eutfj] [^113mzUV9].

> Key principles I should not overlook include prioritizing spleen preservation whenever safe and oncologically appropriate, recognizing that decapsulation or simple cystectomy carries higher recurrence than formal resection, and individualizing decisions in pregnancy and pediatrics; I should double-check that these align with contemporary series showing low recurrence after partial splenectomy and high recurrence after limited excisions, reinforcing the value of anatomic, definitive cyst removal when possible [^112Eutfj] [^112oGaFc] [^117BtnfT].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up are explicit: record cyst size, location, symptoms, and etiologic suspicion; for observed patients, schedule interval imaging and specify when to stop surveillance; for operated patients, confirm pathology, document splenic remnant percentage if partial splenectomy was done, and arrange vaccination and infection precautions if total splenectomy was performed; hold on, I should verify that pediatric follow-up until puberty is emphasized in the plan to catch late growth or recurrence [^112oGaFc] [^113mzUV9].

Management of splenic cysts depends on **size, symptoms, and etiology** [^1158R4M8]. For **asymptomatic cysts < 5 cm**, observe with ultrasound or MRI every 6–12 months [^112oGaFc]; for **symptomatic or larger cysts**, use spleen-preserving surgery (laparoscopic partial splenectomy or cystectomy) when feasible [^112Eutfj] [^113UeU3E], as it offers low recurrence and preserves immune function [^117BtnfT]. Reserve total splenectomy for large, complex, or recurrent cysts, and give pre-op vaccines if splenectomy is planned [^113mzUV9]. Percutaneous sclerotherapy is an option for high-risk patients or small cysts, but has higher recurrence than surgery [^114j5Dpe] [^113Xbz9E]. In pregnancy, prioritize observation or aspiration; defer surgery to postpartum unless there is rupture or severe symptoms [^115BQwLG].

---

## Classification and diagnostic evaluation

Splenic cysts are classified as **true cysts** (congenital epithelial cysts) or **false cysts** (pseudocysts, often post-traumatic) [^115u4hvp]. Imaging — ultrasound, CT, and MRI — is essential for diagnosis, size assessment, and treatment planning [^114tz3oB] [^1158R4M8]. Serologic testing is indicated when **echinococcal disease** is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Indications for intervention

Intervention is indicated based on **symptoms, size, and complications**:

| **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic cysts (pain, fullness, early satiety) | Intervention recommended [^112Eutfj] |
| Asymptomatic cysts ≥ 5 cm | Consider intervention due to risk of complications [^112oGaFc] |
| Cysts with complications (rupture, infection, hemorrhage) | Immediate intervention required [^notfound] |

---

## Management strategies

### Observation

Observation is appropriate for **asymptomatic cysts < 5 cm**, with ultrasound or MRI every 6–12 months [^112oGaFc]. Most remain stable or regress, and spontaneous resolution is reported in children [^111kUmHk].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is the **gold standard** for symptomatic or large cysts, with a preference for spleen-preserving techniques:

- **Laparoscopic partial splenectomy**: Preferred for peripheral cysts; low recurrence and preserved immune function [^112Eutfj] [^117BtnfT].
- **Laparoscopic cystectomy or decapsulation**: Less invasive but higher recurrence than partial splenectomy [^113wBYbg].
- **Total splenectomy**: Reserved for large, complex, or recurrent cysts; requires preoperative vaccination due to OPSI risk [^113mzUV9].

---

### Percutaneous sclerotherapy

Percutaneous sclerotherapy is a **minimally invasive alternative** for high-risk surgical candidates or small cysts, but it has higher recurrence than surgery, especially for cysts ≥ 8 cm [^114j5Dpe] [^111UQcme].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric patients

In children, **spleen preservation is critical** because of infection risk; partial splenectomy or observation is preferred [^1112Hxem]. Sclerotherapy is effective for small cysts but may require repeat procedures [^111UQcme] [^114Au3yK].

---

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, **observation or aspiration** is preferred; surgery is deferred to postpartum unless there is rupture or severe symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Complications and recurrence

Complications include rupture, infection, hemorrhage, and **overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI)** [^112d6ezP] [^1112Hxem]. Recurrence is lower after partial splenectomy than after cystectomy or sclerotherapy [^112Eutfj] [^114j5Dpe].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

After intervention, **imaging at 6–12 months** is recommended, then annually if stable. Lifelong infection prophylaxis is required after total splenectomy [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Asymptomatic cysts < 5 cm**: Observation with ultrasound or MRI every 6–12 months [^notfound].
- **Symptomatic or larger cysts**: Spleen-preserving surgery (partial splenectomy or cystectomy) [^112Eutfj].
- **Complex or recurrent cysts**: Total splenectomy with preoperative vaccination [^113mzUV9].
- **High-risk patients or small cysts**: Percutaneous sclerotherapy [^114j5Dpe].
- **Pregnancy**: Observation or aspiration; defer surgery to postpartum unless urgent [^111LTY8o].

---

Management of splenic cysts should be **individualized**, balancing symptom control, cyst characteristics, and patient factors, with a preference for spleen-preserving strategies when feasible [^113vuyq1].

### Massive splenic cyst in pregnancy: case report [^117Fq9Su]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

True cysts of the spleen are rare clinical encounters with less than 1000 cases reported worldwide. Clinically, splenic cysts are asymptomatic in the majority of cases, otherwise symptoms are non-specific such as vague abdominal discomfort and distension. The management of splenic cysts remains controversial, however traditionally, a surgical approach is advised for symptomatic cysts greater than 5 cm.

We explore the diagnostic dilemma and treatment challenges of a giant primary splenic mass found in pregnancy, a pairing described in only thirteen cases worldwide. This case provides further insight into the optimal management for large abdominal masses in pregnancy as the timing and choice of surgical management remains contentious amongst surgeons and obstetricians due to the lack of robust evidence in the current body of literature. Our case presents the largest splenic cyst in pregnancy reported thus far in the literature, and was successfully treated in a major tertiary hospital in Australia.

### Splenic cyst and its management in a 21-month-old boy: a rare complication of invasive meningococcal disease [^111srZrQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Splenic complications of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are well recognised, though cyst formation is rare, particularly in paediatric populations. The best approach to their management is not yet established. This case outlines the management of a splenic cyst in a 21-month-old boy following severe IMD. The case took place in the context of an acute emergence of serogroup W prompting significant media attention and subsequent change in vaccination practice at a jurisdictional level in Australia. The patient was critically unwell early in the illness, then later a collection in the left upper quadrant was detected, shown on ultrasound to be a 11.6×7.7cm splenic cyst. In this case, the cyst was managed by ultrasound-guided drainage tube insertion. The residual collection was small and stable on subsequent imaging.

### Management of nonparasitic splenic cysts in children [^113Xbz9E]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The management of nonparasitic splenic cysts in children is unclear. Options include observation, cystectomy, partial or total splenectomy and percutaneous aspiration with and without sclerotherapy. The aim of this study is to assess the outcomes of these interventions at a children's hospital.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of patients aged < 18 y with splenic cysts over 7 y was performed. Demographics, mode of intervention, and outcome data were collected.

Results

Forty-two patients were identified and their initial management was as follows: 32 patients were observed and 10 underwent intervention (four aspiration and sclerotherapy and six resection). Age (y) was higher for intervention patients than observation patients (P = 0.004), as was the cyst size (P < 0.001). Incidental finding was the most common presentation in observation patients (n = 30; 94%) and abdominal pain for intervention groups: aspiration and sclerotherapy (n = 3; 75%) and resection (n = 5; 83%). Two patients failed observation and required aspiration and sclerotherapy due to persistence of symptoms or size increase. Median number of aspiration with and without sclerotherapy interventions was three (range 1–5). All six patients had persistence, with two requiring surgical resection due to symptomatic persistence. Surgical procedures included laparoscopic cystectomy (n = 3), laparoscopic partial (n = 2) or complete splenectomy (n = 1), and/or open splenectomy (n = 2). One laparoscopic cystectomy patient had persistence but the other two had no follow-up imaging. Partial and total splenectomy patients had no recurrence and/or persistence.

Conclusions

Observation is an appropriate management strategy for small asymptomatic splenic cysts. Aspiration with and without sclerotherapy and laparoscopic cystectomy are associated with higher rates of recurrence; thus, partial splenectomy may provide the best balance of recurrence and spleen preservation.

### Long-term outcome after surgical treatment of nonparasitic splenic cysts [^112Eutfj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal treatment for patients with nonparasitic splenic cysts is controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcome of patients treated for a symptomatic splenic cyst, and to define a surgical strategy.

Methods

Spleen-preserving surgery (9 laparotomies and 6 laparoscopies) was performed for a primary cyst in six patients and a secondary cyst in nine patients. The median follow-up time was 37.5 months. Partial splenic resection was performed for eight patients and cyst decapsulation for seven patients.

Results

Cyst recurrence was observed in four patients after decapsulation of a primary splenic cyst, as compared with none after resection. Postoperative complications were encountered only after laparotomy (5/9). The median hospital stay was 3.5 days (range, 2–5 days) after laparoscopy, as compared with 9 days (range, 5–14 days) after laparotomy.

Conclusions

Symptomatic splenic cysts should be treated laparoscopically. For patients with recurrent or suspected primary splenic cysts, laparoscopic partial splenectomy is preferable. For other cases, a laparoscopic decapsulation is advocated.

### Massive splenic cyst in pregnancy: case report [^115BQwLG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

In light of these case reports, there appears to be no clear consensus, nor any guidelines, for the management of splenic cysts in pregnancy, as it remains a balance between minimally-invasive approaches of aspiration with risks of re-accumulation and further surgery, versus, organ-preserving approaches of cystectomy, versus, the definitive approach of total splenectomy with greater operative risk and OPSI. Therefore, in counselling obstetric patients about their treatment options, besides general considerations regarding symptoms, cyst size, intraoperative and postoperative risks, additional attention to their gestation, fetal wellbeing, and preference for vaginal delivery or caesarean section is recommended.

In our case, given the patient was in her second trimester at time of presentation, temporising measures such as serial ascitic drainages provided symptomatic relief as we aimed to prolong the pregnancy to an adequate gestation. The exact etiology of the recurrent accumulation of ascitic fluid remains unclear, however the authors postulate its origin from the splenic cyst, and/or, hepatic venous occlusion from the concealed complete portal vein thrombosis owing to the combined compressive effects of the splenic cyst and enlarging gravid uterus. Due to the size of the mass and its compressive effects on surrounding organs, its origin remained unclear despite the use of multiple imaging modalities throughout her pregnancy. This posed a significant diagnostic dilemma that considerably influenced the mode and timing of delivery, as well as the type of general surgical procedure. Ultimately, a splenic mass of such size required an open total splenectomy.

### Management of nonparasitic splenic cysts in children: a French multicenter review of 100 cases [^112oGaFc]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The management of nonparasitic splenic cysts (NPSC) remains controversial. Surgical resection is indicated for symptomatic or complicated forms, but no guidelines are available for asymptomatic NPSC. The aims of this study were to evaluate the management of NPSC in French hospitals and to analyze the results of management.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective multicenter study from January 2004 to December 2014 in 16 university hospitals in France. Patients with a follow-up less than 6months were excluded. Data were extracted from the medical reports.

Results

One hundred patients were included. Median follow-up was 12.8months. No complications were observed for NPSC smaller than 5cm. The size of NPSC increased significantly between the ages of 10 and 12years. Fifteen patients were under observation; 58.3% of cysts decreased in size and 41.7% remained stable. Among the 85 operated patients, no recurrence occurred in the splenectomy group, while 11 recurrences were observed in the cystectomy group (57.9%), 3 of which required redo surgery.

Conclusions

Observation is a safe treatment option for asymptomatic NPSC smaller than 5cm. Surgery is indicated for symptomatic patients, and can be proposed for asymptomatic NPSC larger than 5cm. Laparoscopic partial splenectomy is the technique of choice. Follow-up must be continued until the end of puberty.

### Algorithmic approach to the splenic lesion based on radiologic-pathologic correlation [^1158R4M8]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

Splenic lesions are commonly discovered incidentally at imaging, without clinical signs or symptoms that may aid in diagnosis. As such, the differential diagnosis and subsequent management are based primarily on imaging characteristics. Much has been written about the myriad pathologic conditions that can occur in the spleen; however, there is little guidance on the approach to an incidental splenic mass. Applying an approach frequently used in imaging to the splenic mass-based on the number and consistency of lesions and refined by supplementary imaging features-allows formulation of a useful differential diagnosis. Solitary cystic masses include true cysts, pseudocysts, and parasitic cysts. When multiple cystic lesions are present, the differential diagnosis expands to include infectious lesions (abscess or microabscesses) and lymphangioma (a benign cystic neoplasm). Hemangioma is the most common solitary solid mass, although other vascular lesions (hamartoma, sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation) and nonvascular lesions (inflammatory pseudotumor, lymphoma) manifest as solitary and solid. When multiple solid masses are present, diffuse inflammatory disease (sarcoidosis), littoral cell angioma, and lymphoma should be considered. Malignancies, such as angiosarcoma or metastasis, can manifest as solitary or multiple and solid or cystic masses but are typically associated with symptoms or widespread primary malignancy. Careful assessment of the multimodality imaging characteristics of splenic lesions based on this approach aids the radiologist faced with the incidental splenic lesion.

### Nonparasitic splenic cysts in children: outcomes after sclerotherapy or surgical resection as initial management [^111UQcme]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of splenic cysts in children remains undefined. Sclerotherapy is an innovative, less invasive treatment. This study examined the safety and preliminary effectiveness of sclerotherapy for splenic cysts in children compared with those of surgical treatment. A retrospective review of pediatric patients treated for nonparasitic splenic cysts from 2007 to 2021 was performed at a single institution. Posttreatment outcomes for patients who underwent either expectant management, sclerotherapy, or surgery were reviewed. Thirty patients aged between 0 and 18 years met the inclusion criteria. Cysts in 3 of 8 patients who underwent sclerotherapy were either unresolved or recurred. Patients who underwent sclerotherapy and required surgery for residual symptomatic cyst had an initial cyst diameter of > 8 cm. Symptoms resolved in 5 of 8 patients who underwent sclerotherapy, with a significantly reduced cyst size compared with that in patients with continued symptoms who underwent sclerotherapy (61.4% vs 7.0%, P = 0.01). Sclerotherapy is an effective treatment for splenic cysts, particularly those measuring < 8 cm. However, surgical excision may be preferable for large cysts.

### Primary epithelial splenic cyst with micro-rupture and raised carbohydrate antigen CA 19–9: a paradigm of management [^1124QWxk]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Epithelial splenic cysts are rare entities which surgeons may not have previously encountered. Their management is based on historical studies. A 21-year-old woman presented with a cyst of the spleen that produced a high serum concentration of carbohydrate antigen CA 19–9. A partial splenectomy with removal of the entire cyst and preservation of the splenic parenchyma by laparotomy was performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery. A microscopic rupture of the wall of the cyst and blood degradation products in the fluid of the cyst were confirmed. A functional splenic parenchyma was documented 18 months after surgery. There was no infection during follow-up. Partial surgical splenectomy with resection of the entire cyst prevents recurrence and preserves splenic function.

### Primary epithelial splenic cyst with micro-rupture and raised carbohydrate antigen CA 19–9: a paradigm of management [^114VHHSh]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Epithelial splenic cysts are rare entities that surgeons might not have previously encountered and their management is based on historical studies. A 21-year-old female presented with a cyst of the spleen that produced a high serum concentration of carbohydrate antigen CA 19–9. A partial splenectomy with the removal of the entire cyst and preservation of splenic parenchyma by laparotomy was performed and the patient made an uneventful recovery. A microscopic rupture of the wall of the cyst and degradation of blood in the fluid of the cyst were confirmed. Eighteen months following surgery a functional splenic parenchyma was documented. There was no episode of infection during this follow-up time. Partial surgical splenectomy with resection of the entire cyst prevents recurrence and preserves splenic function.

### Case report: laparoscopic excision of a primary giant splenic hydatid cyst: literature review [^11219opP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

Management options for CE include surgery, percutaneous management, drug therapy, and observation stage. According to the WHO diagnostic classification, regarding CE with SHD, stage CE-1 and CE-3a cysts have a single compartment. Such cysts that are < 5 cm may be treated with albendazole alone. Cysts that are > 5 cm may be treated with puncture, aspiration, injection, and reaspiration (PAIR) alone or in combination with albendazole. Management for stage CE-2 and CE-3b cysts, which have many compartments, requires either modified catheterization technique or surgery (with adjunctive drug therapy). Stages CE-4 and CE-5 are inactive cysts that can be managed with observation. The optimal choice between these approaches is uncertain because of the low level of evidence. As a traditional therapeutic modality, surgery may be effective in some situations for example, single cyst diameter > 10 cm, superficial cyst at risk of rupture, rupture cyst, cysts compressing vital structures, cysts with secondary infection or hemorrhage, and cysts with many daughter vesicles. The radical surgical options used for the management of SHD > 5 cm are mainly divided into splenectomy and spleen-saving procedures (e.g. partial splenectomy, enucleation, deroofing with omentoplasty, internal drainage with cystojejunostomy, or external drainage). Since the first case of SHD treated by laparoscopy was reported in 1997, several reports have demonstrated the safety of laparoscopy for SHD treatment compared with an open approach. However, sepsis-related mortality rates associated with total splenectomy are 4% and 1.9% in children and adults, respectively. Thus, surgical approaches that preserve the spleen are preferred. Some studies have revealed that no obvious differences were observed in disease recurrence, postoperative hospitalization, or complications when total splenectomy or spleen-saving procedures were implemented. Arikanoglu et al. and Eris et al. stated that spleen-saving surgery for SHD was more appropriate in young patients and those with peripherally located small cysts, and splenectomy was particularly effective in cysts showing multiple, larger, centrally located, and other organ involvement. The goal of surgery is to clear the cyst and eliminate residual cavity. Dervenis et al.pointed that laparoscopy may increase the risk of spillage due to elevated intra-abdominal pressure caused by pneumoperitoneum. To avoid fluid spillage, a protoscolicidal agent such as hypertonic saline, cetrimide–chlorhexidine, or polidocanol should be injected into the cyst, the surgical field should be protected with pads soaked in protoscolicidal agents and the peritoneum should be washed with hypertonic saline if spillage occurs. It has been reported that perioperative adjunctive therapy with albendazole (or mebendazole) can soften the cyst, facilitating removal and reducing the risk of disease recurrence by inactivating protoscolices. – The WHO suggests that albendazole (or mebendazole) therapy should be initiated 4–30 days preoperatively and continued for at least 1 month (albendazole) or 3 months (mebendazole) postoperatively. However, the optimal treatment duration is unclear because of lack of sufficient evidence.

### Splenectomy or partial splenectomy should be preferred treatment for large splenic hydatid cysts [^116HD6Mg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Dear Sir:

The article by Arce and others was helpful. However, in cases of giant splenic hydatid cyst, splenectomy or partial splenectomy is generally considered the preferred treatment rather than removal of the cyst, as reported by Rashid and others. If there is more than one cyst, a large cyst, a cyst in a deep organ location, or an infected cyst, open surgery should be done. I agree with Arce and others that the laparoscopic approach is the preferred treatment for splenic hydatid disease, but only in the case of a small cyst. Also, removal only of the cyst is not the recommended treatment in the literature for splenic hydatidosis, especially for large cysts. Similar recommendations have been made by Eris and others. I agree that preservation of the spleen whenever possible is justified because of its role in protecting against infection. But in the case of large hydatid cysts in an elderly patient, splenectomy or partial splenectomy should be preferred.

### Massive splenic cyst in pregnancy: case report [^114ezJn5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

One of the major strengths in this case presentation is the retrospective analysis of our clinical approach towards diagnosing and managing unusually large abdominal masses in pregnancy. The diagnosis of splenic cyst proved a very unique and unexpected finding for all clinicians involved, hence this case serves as a kind reminder for obstetricians and gynaecologists to consider diagnoses outside of the pelvic region for women presenting with extraordinary abdominal distension. This case presentation not only adds to the limited body of literature on splenic cysts in pregnancy, but also provides insight into an interesting combined case between obstetricians and surgeons where all maternal and fetal treatment options are well considered. The authors advise caution in generalising this rare case report to other more common abdominal masses in pregnancy and acknowledge the advantage of treating such complicated cases in a tertiary hospital where multiple specialties, diagnostic tests and treatment options are readily available.

In conclusion, though epithelial splenic cysts are rare, it ought to be considered as part of the differential diagnoses in young individuals presenting with abdominal distension. We have introduced to the literature the notion of serial ascitic drainages to alleviate patient symptoms and prolong the pregnancy. This case emphasises the reliance on imaging for diagnosis of splenic cysts and serial surveillance of fetal wellbeing. Furthermore, this case highlights the importance of tertiary-level care and implementing a multidisciplinary approach towards complex clinical cases, encouraging good communication between the patient, obstetricians and surgical specialities in exploring all treatment options and optimising maternal and fetal outcomes.

### Laparoscopic management of benign splenic tumors in children [^1112Hxem]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Primary splenic tumors are rare in children, with 60%–76% being benign, whereas splenic cysts and vascular tumors are common. Controversy remains in the diagnosis and management of this disease. Surgical resection is indicated for symptomatic or complicated forms, but no guidelines are available for the standard treatment. Total splenectomy has been considered to be the gold standard for the treatment of splenic tumors. Still, it is associated with a risk of serious infectious complications, especially the infection of encapsulated microorganisms.OPSI is the most serious complication after total splenectomy. It can occur in as many as 4.4% of the patients with splenectomy and carries a mortality risk of approximately 50%~80%. With the increased understanding of the spleen's immunologic function, various parenchyma-preserving procedures are becoming the preferred approach for most pediatric surgeons. However, this approach carries the risk of relatively high tumor recurrence rate.

The primary splenic epithelial cyst is the most common type of splenic cyst observed in children. Most patients are asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed during abdominal imaging or physical examination. Spontaneous resolution of the small splenic cyst has been reported, and conservative management with close observation has been proposed. However, medical intervention is recommended when the cyst is symptomatic or larger than 5 cm. Percutaneous aspiration with and without sclerotherapy has been proposed but requires repeated procedures under general anesthesia; moreover, the recurrence rate remains high. Other reports demonstrated encouraging results for partial cystectomy or deroofing procedures, with short operating times and low complication rates. Nevertheless, the recurrence rate was as high as 60%. In these 12 cyst cases, 2 cases underwent percutaneous ethanol-based sclerosis and 1 case once deroofing, but no obvious reduction or residual cyst enlargement was observed thus resorted to splenectomy. Three cases of cyst deroofing were performed in this group. The cyst wall was removed as much as possible, the fibrous septa were removed, and the endothelium of the cyst was destroyed by argon beam coagulator or electrocautery to achieve adequate drainage while minimizing the risk of recurrence. Sonography demonstrated small residual asymptomatic cysts remained postoperatively, and one of them was slightly increased in size at 1-year follow-up. Therefore, for giant splenic cysts, total splenectomy should be considered when no obvious splenic parenchyma remains. For localized splenic cysts, partial splenectomy should be the most suitable choice; while for cysts located close to the hilum and unsuitable for partial splenectomy, sclerotherapy or partial cystectomy should be considered.

5.2 Is it safe to follow up presumed MCN, which measures < 40 mm?

It is safe to follow up presumed MCN that measure < 40 mm, in the absence of risk features such as a suspicious mural nodule or symptoms (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

For patients with MCN measuring between 30 and 40 mm, clinicians can incorporate other factors such as age, comorbidities, patient's surgical risk, and patient preference. For cysts measuring < 30 mm, it may be difficult to make a definitive diagnosis of an MCN, and smaller MCN may sometimes be difficult to distinguish other cystic lesions. We therefore recommend similar surveillance for MCN and IPMN measuring < 3 cm.

5.3 How should MCN, which is not resected, be followed up?

MCN measuring < 40 mm without a mural nodule or symptoms may undergo surveillance with MRI, EUS, or a combination of both. Surveillance is recommended every 6 months for the first year, then annually if no changes are observed. Patients with an MCN measuring < 40 mm and with no concerning features or symptoms should have lifelong surveillance as long as they are fit for surgery (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

Earlier studies have evaluated features associated with malignant transformation for all mucinous lesions combined. However, IPMNs and MCN may have different rates of growth and malignant transformation and different features predictive of malignancy.

5.4 Is cyst fluid analysis recommended for MCN?

See statement 3.3.

5.5 Which surgical procedure(s) should be performed for an MCN?

To avoid incomplete treatment of invasive carcinoma, a standard oncologic resection (distal pancreatectomy in 90–95% of MCN) with lymph node dissection and splenectomy is indicated for any MCN with imaging features indicating high-grade dysplasia or cancer (GRADE 1B, strong agreement).

MCN without suspect features with a low risk of malignancy can be treated with a non-oncological resection (distal pancreatectomy with splenic preservation with or without preservation of splenic vessels, or PSP) (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

A PSP may be considered in selected patients to decrease the long-term risk of diabetes, provided the anatomical location is favourable (GRADE 2C, strong agreement).

PSP are associated with higher early morbidity and longer hospitalisation. A laparoscopic approach is feasible for MCN. Its benefit over an open approach is comparable to other indications.

### Laparoscopic internal marsupializaton for large nonparasitic splenic cysts: effective organ-preserving technique [^113vuyq1]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Primary splenic cyst is a rare disease, and therefore there is no information regarding its optimal management. Most such cysts are classified as epithelial cysts. During the last few years, the laparoscopic approach has gained increasing acceptance in splenic surgery. We present our experience with the laparoscopic (organ-preserving) management of splenic cysts.

Methods

We managed 11 patients with large symptomatic nonparasitic splenic cysts from 1996 to 2006. All the patients had fullness in the left upper abdomen and a palpable mass. Preoperative diagnosis was established with ultrasonography and computed tomography. All patients were treated with either laparoscopic partial cystectomy or marsupialization.

Results

Seven patients had mesothelial cysts, two had epidermoid cysts, and two had pseudocysts. Nine patients did not have any problems or recurrence during an average follow-up of 29.5 months. Two patients had cyst recurrence after 14 months.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic organ-preserving surgery should be the goal of therapy in most cases. Total splenectomy is reserved for cases in which cyst excision cannot be done or most of the splenic tissue is replaced by the cyst. Plication of the cyst wall edges prevents the cyst walls from adhering and causing recurrence, as well as helping to control hemorrhage. Laparoscopic partial cystectomy/marsupialization is an acceptable procedure for the treatment of splenic cysts; and after short to mid-term follow-up, it seems that a reasonable rate of success is possible.

### Nonparasitic splenic cysts: pathogenesis, classification, and treatment [^115u4hvp]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Nonparasitic splenic cysts (NPSCs) are uncommon lesions of the spleen, many being reported in anecdotal fashion. Early classifications of this disorder have been based on the presence or absence of an epithelial lining, indicating either a congenital or traumatic etiology. This criterion has led to confusion and mistaken reporting because the lining alone is not a reliable criterion.

Study Design

Over a 28-year period, the author has observed and studied 23 patients with NPSC. Special attention has been given to the role of trauma in the history, the nature (or absence) of a cyst lining, the gross pathology, and the preferred method of treatment.

Results

NPSC present as lesions with a very characteristic gross appearance and lining. The trabeculated interior can be lined with epidermoid, transitional, or mesothelial epithelium. Desquamation of the lining can lead to a spurious diagnosis, but careful search usually discloses the lining remnant. Although most NPSC in this series were treated by open partial splenectomy, the more recent approach by laparoscopic techniques offers great promise.

Conclusions

A new classification of NPSC is offered, based on characteristic gross findings. NPSC are of congenital origin, with a lining derived from mesothelium. Trauma does not play a primary role in pathogenesis. Cysts that are symptomatic or over 5 cm in diameter should be removed by partial splenectomy or near-total cystectomy "decapsulation", either by the open or laparoscopic approach.

### Massive splenic cyst in pregnancy: case report [^116xQ7Ea]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary splenic cysts are very rarely diagnosed in pregnancy, with only thirteen cases described in the literature. We examine the approach towards diagnosing and managing uniquely large abdominal masses that significantly complicate obstetric care.

Case presentation

A 37-year-old primigravida woman presented with abdominal distension and discomfort, yet otherwise asymptomatic. On ultrasound, an incidental pregnancy at 25 weeks of gestation and a large pelvic lesion were discovered. MRI defined a 28 × 29 cm lobulated, complex cystic mass in the upper abdomen. The patient underwent two ascitic drainages throughout her pregnancy. At 34 weeks of gestation, she had a classical caesarean section. Then at five-weeks postpartum, she underwent a laparotomy and total splenectomy with 16 L of fluid drained. Histopathological analysis revealed an epithelial cyst of the spleen. Her recovery was complicated by complete portal vein thrombosis.

Conclusion

This case describes the largest splenic cyst ever reported in pregnancy and explores the diagnostic dilemmas and treatment challenges associated. We introduce the utility of serial ascitic drainages in prolonging the pregnancy and emphasise the reliance on imaging for surveillance of splenic size and fetal wellbeing.

### The incidental pancreatic cyst [^117Q7fLe]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The discovery of a pancreatic cyst in an asymptomatic patient presents an immediate challenge to the interpreting radiologist, the clinician who manages the patient, and patients themselves. When a cyst is discovered on imaging in a patient without symptoms directly referable to the pancreas, the following questions are immediately raised: can the lesion be accurately diagnosed or is the appropriate management clear from the examination, is the best management approach to suggest watchful waiting with follow-up imaging, what is the best method for imaging follow-up, and what is the optimal frequency of follow-up? This article recommends an approach to analyzing patients with incidental pancreatic cysts.

### Splenic cyst presenting as severe hydronephrosis in a pediatric patient [^1136einf]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Large cystic abdominal masses can represent a diagnostic dilemma despite advanced diagnostic and imaging techniques.

### Recurrence after laparoscopic excision of nonparasitic splenic cysts [^113wBYbg]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Minimally invasive treatments for nonparasitic splenic cysts are well described. Recent evidence suggests that laparoscopic splenic cystectomy is associated with high recurrence rates in children. Because these cysts are uncommon, no large series is available. We reviewed our clinical data focusing on cyst recurrences and their management.

Methods

All children who underwent laparoscopic excision of a nonparasitic splenic cyst from January 2002 to December 2006 were identified. Medical and surgical records were reviewed for perioperative details, hospital course, and outcome.

Results

Eight children (median age, 13 years; range, 7–16 years) who underwent laparoscopic splenic cystectomy were identified. The most common presenting complaint was left upper quadrant pain or mass (n = 6; 75%). Median cyst size was 13 cm (range, 4–20 cm). There were no conversions to an open technique, completion splenectomies, or perioperative complications. Cysts were identified pathologically as epidermoid (n = 6) or posttraumatic (n = 2). Median hospital stay was 1.5 days. One child required partial splenectomy because of cyst anatomy and remains recurrence-free at 12 months. Cyst recurrence occurred in 7 patients (88%) at a median of 9.4 months (range, 3–18 months) after initial surgery. Median recurrent cyst size was 5.6 cm (range, 3–11 cm). Of 7 recurrences, 4 (57%) were symptomatic. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided cyst drainage and sclerosis were performed in 2 children with symptomatic recurrences, one of whom required 4 separate interventions. There were no complications during management of cyst recurrences. Five children with recurrence (71%) have been followed conservatively and are free of morbidity at a median of 23 months (range, 8–55 months).

Conclusions

Laparoscopic excision of nonparasitic splenic cysts in children is associated with a high recurrence rate and may be insufficient treatment. Partial splenectomy may decrease recurrence rates. Conservative management of splenic cyst recurrence after laparoscopic excision is associated with good short-term outcomes. If necessary, image-guided management of symptomatic recurrences can be performed safely.

### Safety and effectiveness of sclerotherapy for nonparasitic splenic cysts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114j5Dpe]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the reported safety and effectiveness of sclerotherapy for the treatment of nonparasitic splenic cysts through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Materials and Methods

A systematic search of PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library through July 2023 was performed. Studies including at least 5 patients reporting percutaneous sclerotherapy of nonparasitic splenic cysts, initial and posttreatment cyst size, clinical symptoms as well as adverse events (AEs), and recurrence rates were included. A 0–8-point scale for case reports and case series was used to assess bias. Data were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis.

Results

Twenty-three of 833 citations were selected for full-text assessment, and 7 studies were included for a total of 99 patients. The methodological quality of the studies included scored 3–7. Composite analysis demonstrated 38% (95% CI, 23%-55%) rate of recurrence after treatment with significant heterogeneity; however, when assessed for a cyst size of < 8 cm, recurrence dropped to 7% (95% CI, 2%-20%). Residual symptoms after treatment completion were present in 17% (95% CI, 7%-33%). Intraprocedural and postprocedural AE rates were 6% (95% CI, 3%-13%) and 6% (95% CI, 3%-12%) respectively.

Conclusions

Sclerotherapy of splenic cysts seemed to be safe, with a high rate of recurrence for cysts ≥ 8 cm.

### Laparoscopic spleen-preserving dome resection for a giant primary epithelial splenic cyst [^113UeU3E]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Non-parasitic splenic cysts are rare and are seldom diagnosed outside the paediatric surgical practice. Giant true primary epithelial cysts greater than 14 cm in diameter are even rarer. Laparoscopic surgery is preferable; however, bleeding, splenectomy and recurrence are recognised risks. Here, we report a young female patient with a 21cm symptomatic primary splenic cyst. The patient underwent a spleen-preserving laparoscopy and was followed up for 2years when she had an MRI of the abdomen. Surgical, technical and perioperative treatment aspects are discussed here, in the context of the current literature.

### Common incidental findings on MDCT: survey of radiologist recommendations for patient management [^116PjvP1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to evaluate for agreement with respect to how radiologists report incidental findings encountered on CT.

Methods

A multiple-choice survey was designed to query radiologists about how they handle 12 incidental findings on body CT, assuming the patient is a 45-year-old woman with no history of malignancy. Included were a 1-cm thyroid nodule, a 5-mm noncalcified lung nodule, coronary artery calcification, a 2-cm adrenal nodule, a 2-cm pancreatic cyst, a 1-cm enhancing liver lesion, a 2-cm high-density renal cyst, short-segment small bowel intussusception, a 1-cm splenic cyst, focal gallbladder wall calcification, and a 3-cm ovarian cyst in both a premenopausal woman and a postmenopausal woman. Choices ranged from "do not report" to advising interventional procedures tailored to the organ. Surveys were administered to body CT attending radiologists at 3 academic institutions.

Results

Twenty-seven radiologists completed the survey. The mean experience level was 15.7 years after training. Seventy percent or greater agreement on interpretation was identified for only 6 findings: recommend ultrasound for a 1-cm thyroid nodule, recommend ultrasound for a 3-cm cyst in postmenopausal woman, follow Fleischner Society recommendations for a 5-mm lung nodule, describe only coronary calcification, and describe as likely benign both short-segment small bowel intussusception and a 1-cm splenic cyst.

Conclusions

Agreement is lacking, both across institutions and within departments, for the management of 6 commonly encountered incidental findings on body CT. Individual departments should develop internal guidelines to ensure consistent recommendations based on existing evidence.

### Laparoscopic upper pole splenectomy of the simple splenic cyst [^112x9hXS]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Splenic cysts are rare clinic entities. Non-parasitic cysts are the most frequent cystic lesions of the spleen. In the last decade acknowledgment of the importance of the spleen function, along with development of imaging methods and surgery technics, allowed a conservative approach to be increasingly considered as the best approach in splenic cysts treatment. We present the case of a 34-year-old woman with an asymptomatic simple splenic cyst in the upper pole incidentally diagnosed in a thoracic CT. A laparoscopic upper pole splenectomy was performed on the patient, with no complications. Despite the rareness of this procedure and the fact that it was used in a simple splenic cyst, this article emphasises the idea that this approach is safe, reproducible and advantageous for the patient.

### Spontaneous rupture of a non-parasitic splenic cyst [^112d6ezP]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Rupture of a non-parasitic splenic cyst is a rare but possibly dangerous complication with 21 cases described so far. We present a 46-year-old woman who presented with acute abdominal pain and was diagnosed with a spontaneous ruptured splenic cyst that was successfully treated by laparoscopic splenectomy. Histological examination showed characteristics corresponding with a non-parasitic congenital cyst that had lost its epithelial lining. Several treatment options can be considered for splenic cysts, depending on size and location. In case of rupture, the clinical condition of the patient should be taken into account.

### Image-guided percutaneous splenic interventions [^116qhDeA]. Radiographics (2012). Low credibility.

In the spleen, image-guided interventional procedures such as biopsy and catheter drainage have not been widely performed because of the perceived increased risk of complications. The ability of image-guided biopsy to allow tissue diagnosis of a focal splenic mass without the need for splenectomy is the driving force behind use of this procedure in oncology patients. The literature on image-guided splenic biopsy suggests that the highest biopsy yield is achieved with core biopsy and the lowest complication rate is achieved with fine-needle aspiration. Image-guided catheter drainage is an effective alternative to splenectomy for management of infected splenic collections. In clinical practice, image-guided splenic biopsy, fluid aspiration, and catheter drainage have high success rates. Image-guided alcohol ablation is effective in treatment of splenic cysts. The literature on splenic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is sparse; therefore, further studies are needed to determine the role of RFA in management of splenic neoplasms and hypersplenism. Image-guided percutaneous thrombin injection can be used to treat splenic artery pseudoaneurysms. Awareness of the correct interventional techniques and their limitations is important for safe performance of image-guided percutaneous splenic interventions.

### Laparoscopy of a traumatic rupture of a dysontogenetic splenic cyst. A case report [^115J1uZd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

The role of laparoscopy in the stepped approach to the diagnosis and treatment of blunt abdominal trauma has not yet been fully elucidated. Despite the use of a variety of imaging modalities, it can still be difficult to make a proper evaluation in cases where there are questionable abdominal injuries. In particular, when there is a discrepancy between a bland clinical picture and the results of diagnostic imaging procedures, laparoscopy should be given preference over laparotomy, provided the patient's circulatory situation is stable. Herein we describe a case in which laparoscopy allowed the detection and treatment of a traumatic rupture of a dysontogenetic splenic cyst that had mimicked a rupture of the spleen on both the ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) images.

### Massive splenic cyst in pregnancy: case report [^115v7hRj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, there is reasonable utility in investigating tumor markers pre- and post-operatively, as the epithelium lining of some primary splenic cysts may produce CA 19.9, CA 125, and CEA. This relationship of raised tumor markers was noted in our case with raised CA 19.9, and similarly demonstrated in previous cases in the literature. Though, the authors acknowledge the well-known limitations of elevated tumor markers in pregnancy, the determination of these values as part of the investigative work-up in this case provided meaningful information to the overall clinical picture, especially as the gynae-oncology team were involved in the setting of a large undifferentiated abdominal mass with unclear malignant potential.

A wide range of approaches for splenic cysts in non-pregnant patients have been described, often dependent on patient age, symptoms, cyst characteristics and size. Nonoperative measures such as observation and regular serial imaging is recommended for asymptomatic, small (< 5 cm) cysts. However, for splenic cysts larger than 5 cm, or symptomatic cysts, surgical management is warranted; trials of other conservative methods such as percutaneous aspiration or sclerosis (with either ethanol or tetracycline), though cost-effective with less recovery time, often leads to disease recurrence and may complicate subsequent surgical procedures.

### Massive splenic cyst in pregnancy: case report [^111LTY8o]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Classically, the gold standard surgical approach to splenic cysts has been open total splenectomy. However, due to an evolving understanding of the haematological and immunological functions of the spleen, organ-salvaging techniques have since been developed to mitigate the life-threatening risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). Hence, pre-operative vaccinations for Streptococcus pneumonia, Neisseria meningitides and Haemophilus influenza is crucial, as well as stringent postoperative antibiotic coverage for total splenectomies. Today, the optimal treatment options range from cyst fenestration, marsupialisation and partial cystectomy to total cystectomy with partial splenectomy.

In pregnancy, the majority of early case reports of splenic cysts underwent splenectomy either open or laparoscopically. In later years, two case reports have tried percutaneous aspiration; though both cases had vaginal deliveries at term, both also resulted in cystic fluid re-accumulation and required further intervention. Rotas et al. performed an aspiration for a patient diagnosed with a 17 cm symptomatic splenic cyst in the first trimester, followed by bi-weekly sonographic scans until second trimester. The second cystic aspiration was complicated by sepsis and consequently necessitated laparoscopic fenestration and omentopexy. Likewise, after a conservative approach of iron supplementation, analgesia and antibiotics, Mahran et al. performed a percutaneous aspiration in the second trimester for a 20 cm splenic cyst. However, there were complications of septicaemia and anaemia requiring blood transfusions. Her cystic re-accumulation was noted in the third trimester, but not re-aspirated until six weeks postpartum.

Since then, five more cases of splenic cysts in pregnancy have been reported, of which, four returned to traditional methods of total splenectomy in the second trimester with success. Dabrowski et al. and Forouzesh et al. both describe removal of splenic cysts, measuring 10 cm and 14 cm respectively, via open splenectomy, reporting favourable neonatal outcomes, no postoperative complications and complete resolution of the patient symptoms (pain, anorexia, fever and fullness). Moreover, Majesky et al. and Varban et al. both managed splenic cysts via laparoscopic splenectomy, which also resulted in no postoperative complications and healthy newborns delivered at term. The most recently published case report by Kapp et al. successfully performed a minimally-invasive, organ-preserving procedure of laparoscopic cystectomy for a 15 cm primary splenic epithelial cyst in pregnancy.

### The management and outcome of paediatric splenic injuries in the Netherlands [^1162QEGt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that non-operative management is still the best management option for patients with splenic injuries that are haemodynamically stable. However, operative treatment may be necessary, especially in patients who are haemodynamically unstable, which is usually apparent on admission or within 12 h of injury. In accordance with the bedrest and hospitalisation periods deemed safe by the APSA guidelines, shorter periods of bedrest can be applied in our hospital as per the results of this study.

Management

This study shows no crossover between initial NOM to OM regardless of injury grade, thus giving a 100% success rate for NOM for both low-grade and high-grade splenic injuries; this is better than international splenic salvage rates reaching a maximum of 99% for isolated injuries in the last 30 years. Non-operative treatment has proven to be associated with minimal risk of short- and long-term complications such as haemorrhages, abscesses, pseudo-aneurysms and (pseudo-) cysts. In our cohort, no splenic complications occurred during the follow-up time of a maximum of 8 weeks. Managing a paediatric patient non-operatively spares the additional risk of overwhelming infections associated with asplenic patients and gives them better quality of life measurements compared to those who undergo splenectomy.

The success of NOM increases with splenic artery embolisation even in high-grade injuries in 3.8% of cases (all high-grade BSI). Recent research in the paediatric population shows that embolisation can be a viable alternative to splenectomy when non-operative treatment fails. It has been demonstrated that immune function after splenic artery embolisation is similar to patients who have not been embolised. Splenic artery embolisation has been possible since 2009 in our hospital; as such this treatment option was not accessible to a portion of our cohort.

A relatively low percentage of patients who underwent a splenectomy (6.2%) was found in relation to comparable international studies (Supplementary Table 3) and studies performed in the Netherlands, in which 17.4% and 21.3% of patients underwent a splenectomy, respectively. This study supports that unstable haemodynamics is an independent risk factor for splenectomy in children, possibly in combination with the presence of an active blush on the CT scan. Post-splenectomy protocol has also altered in recent years, and now post-operative vaccination is routinely implemented.

### Partial splenectomy in the management of nonparasitic splenic cysts [^117BtnfT]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Recognition of the importance of the spleen in immunological function and the potential threat of severe postsplenectomy complications have led to the development of parenchyma-preserving surgical procedures. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of open splenic partial resection on the management of splenic cysts.

Patients and Methods

From April 2003 to June 2007, 11 patients with splenic cysts were evaluated. All patients fulfilled the criteria for surgical resection. Ten of the patients (6 women and 4 men) 15–42 years of age (mean: 26.4 years) were subjected to open partial splenectomy. In one patient, a centrally located splenic cyst was considered unsuitable for partial splenectomy, and the patient therefore underwent total spleen excision. Patients with splenic cysts constituted 3.8% of all 290 patients subjected to splenectomy during the study period. Spleen parenchyma was cut with the aid of a LigaSure instrument. Bleeding from the transected splenic parenchyma was secured with argon plasma coagulation and absorbable tape sutures or oxidized cellulose.

Results

Nine of the ten patients underwent successful partial splenectomy. In one patient, insufficient arterial supply to the preserved splenic remnant after excision of the upper cyst-containing splenic pole led to total splenectomy. The mean operative time was 98 min (range: 85–160 min), and mean blood loss was 106 mL (55–200 ml). The mean cyst diameter was 9.1 cm (range: 7–17 cm) and weight was 738 g (range: 230–2,420 g). The postoperative course was uneventful in all cases. Pathological examination showed an epithelial cyst in 8 patients and a pseudocyst in 2. After a mean follow-up of 26.4 months, the size of the splenic remnant constituted, on average, 71% of preoperative spleen size. Moreover, normal splenic vein flow was observed. Platelet counts remained within the normal range, and no cyst recurrence was observed. There were no infections documented during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

Open partial splenectomy is a safe and effective method in the management of nonparasitic splenic cysts. It ensures complete cyst removal, lack of cyst recurrence, and preservation of the spleen functions.

### Age and trauma center-specific disparities in splenectomy rates for pediatric trauma patients [^1137n9v3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The spleen is the most commonly injured organ after blunt abdominal trauma, and in children older than 1 year of age, abdominal trauma is the leading cause of death. In 2000, the American Pediatric Surgical Association published guidelines for management of blunt splenic injury (BSI) in children, establishing the target of care as non-operative management (NOM). Splenic artery embolization (SAE), first developed in the 1970s, has also been increasingly used as an alternative to splenectomy in select patients.

The advent of NOM for BSI in pediatrics originated in 1968 at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. This approach, though initially criticized for its presumed higher mortality and transfusion rates, became more widely accepted as the risks of overwhelming post-splenectomy syndrome in children, as well as the morbidity and mortality of the operation itself, were recognized. This was further supported by pediatric surgeons' observations that on laparotomy for children with BSI, transverse splenic fractures were largely hemostatic.

In adults, NOM of BSI — first proposed in the 1980s — has been adopted more slowly due to the differential mechanisms and severity of injuries in adults. Surgeons were concerned that spontaneous hemostasis was less likely in adults than in children and that delayed rupture of the spleen or a post-traumatic cyst may ensue. These factors, taken together with the relatively lower risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy syndrome in adults, delayed adaptation of NOM for adult BSI. However, it is now the established standard of care for adult trauma.

The guidelines established by the American Pediatric Surgical Association maximize patient safety and outcomes with the aim of splenic preservation. However, in practice, children treated at adult trauma centers (ATCs) rather than pediatric trauma centers (PTCs) have experienced a higher rate of splenectomy with a lower adherence to the established NOM criteria. Given the differences in management and outcomes based on historical and institutional standards, we examined modern trends in managing BSI at ATCs and dual trauma centers (DTCs) versus PTCs to see if the management gap has improved over time.

### Percutaneous treatment of congenital splenic cysts: drainage and sclerotherapy with polidocanol [^114nXwqj]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital "true" splenic cysts are rare lesions. Therapeutic methods for the management of these lesions have been based on preserving splenic function due to the immunologic role of spleen. We report three different cases of congenital splenic cysts treated by percutaneous drainage and polidocanol sclerotherapy. This less invasive treatment appears to be safe and effective after 6 to 36 months of follow-up.

Figure 6.
Flow diagram of studies selection process. SHD, splenic hydatid cyst.

Table 1
Clinical data of patients with splenic hydatid cyst treated by laparoscopic surgery

In our case, according to the medical history and imaging findings, which were even though different from the typical CE features described in most previous studies and WHO classification of CE-1 ("snow flake sign" in USG), the diagnosis of SHD has been established. Thus, we did not conduct serologic tests as they were not considered to be necessary. In terms of management options, because the cyst was giant, superficially located in the upper pole of spleen, and accompanied with high risk of rupture that may cause severe complications (i.e. anaphylactic reactions, shock, or even death), laparoscopic splenectomy was initially performed, which was further supported by intraoperative examination of the old ruptured cyst. Ultimately, pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of SHD. After surgery, albendazole therapy (400 mg per day) was administered for 3 months in accordance with the WHO recommendations, and the patient had no specific complaints. Postoperative follow-up were regularly performed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The patient was symptoms free and had no signs of disease recurrence. Overall, based on previous literature, WHO guidelines, and this case, we suggest a spleen-saving surgery by laparoscopy or other minimally invasive technologies (e.g. PAIR) for SHD < 5 cm, and ≥ 5 cm with a single compartment or daughter vesicles, or located in the spleen periphery in younger cases. In addition, laparoscopic splenectomy is suitable for SHD > 5 cm, particularly > 10 cm, with superficial cyst at risk of rupture or located in the central segment of the spleen, or cyst compressing vital structures or with secondary infection or hemorrhage and multiple cysts due to inoculation or via secondary spread from other organs.

### Pancreatic pseudocysts complicated by splenic parenchymal involvement: results of operative and percutaneous management [^113BLE8X]. Pancreas (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common finding in acute and chronic pancreatitis, but most are small and uncomplicated, and do not require treatment. Pseudocysts with splenic parenchymal involvement are uncommon but have the potential for massive hemorrhage. Data on the clinical presentation and optimal treatment of this unusual complication of pseudocysts are lacking. The purpose of this review was to identify the clinical features of pancreatic pseudocysts complicated by splenic parenchymal involvement and to determine the outcome with nonoperative and operative therapy.

Methods

A retrospective review of the medical records of all patients with pancreatic pseudocysts from December 1984 to January 1999 revealed 238 patients, of whom 14 (6%) had splenic parenchymal involvement. These medical records were reviewed in detail and all pertinent radiographs were reviewed by the authors to confirm splenic parenchymal involvement by a pancreatic pseudocyst.

Results

Initial treatment included observation (n = 2), percutaneous drainage (n = 8), and surgery (n = 4). Of the eight patients treated by percutaneous drainage, one died, three required repeated percutaneous drainage, and three required surgical intervention. None of the patients treated primarily by surgery required additional therapy for the pseudocyst. Overall, 11 patients had complications of the primary therapy, and 25% of patients treated by surgery had significant hemorrhage. Complications included infection (n = 5), pseudocyst persistence (n = 4), bleeding (n = 2), multisystem organ failure (n = 2), gastric outlet obstruction (n = 1), and splenic rupture (n = 2).

Conclusions

Pancreatic pseudocysts complicated by splenic parenchymal involvement may have life-threatening clinical presentations and respond poorly to percutaneous drainage. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy are effective, but the complication rate is high.

### Endoscopic ultrasound-guided ablation of pancreatic cystic neoplasms: ready for prime time? [^111YMg1b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided ablation

EUS has evolved as a therapeutic modality in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic diseases. EUS-guided ablation of pancreatic cysts provides a potentially less invasive treatment option in appropriately selected patients, with less morbidity and mortality compared with surgery (Fig. 3). Additionally, pancreatic cyst ablation, if successful, could potentially lengthen surveillance intervals or reduce the need for periodic surveillance. EUS-guided approaches enable real-time imaging of the pancreatic lesions and would allow endoscopists to approach less accessible cystic lesions.

Figure 3
Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration needle in a septated mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. The needle could be used to both aspirate the cyst contents and inject an ablative agent

Potential drawbacks to the use of EUS-guided cyst ablation include adverse events associated with endoscopic ablation, from either the endoscopy or the injection of ablative agents. Some adverse events noted in the literature include pancreatitis, abdominal pain, intra-cystic bleeding and thrombosis of the portal venous system, and rarely splenic vein thrombosis. After ablation, some epithelium may remain untreated and therefore could continue to harbor malignant potential. Patients with IPMNs are at increased risk of pancreatic cancer at a site separate from the cyst and will require ongoing surveillance despite ablation, limiting its role in IPMN.

### Benign splenic lesions in BAP1-tumor predisposition syndrome: a case series [^115nqcfj]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend cross-sectional abdominal imaging every 2 years for patients with BAP1-TPDS. The knowledge that benign vascular splenic lesions are part of the BAP1-TPDS spectrum could have important implications for clinical management. It could lead to more conservative management of these lesions and avoidance of splenectomy, which can lead to serious complications such as increased risk of severe infections. Although these are relatively rare procedures in the population, in our cohort, four (11%) individuals had undergone splenectomies, with benign findings, underscoring the potential clinical benefit in the BAP1-TPDS population of conservative management. A limitation of our study is its observational nature and lack of control group to clarify the rate of benign splenic lesions in patients without a genetic predisposition. Furthermore, even if there is this increased incidence, it is still unclear whether the BAP1 germline mutation is a direct cause, or whether it may be another association with cancer or its treatment. As more patients are diagnosed and screened for BAP1-TPDS, these findings will need to be confirmed in other cohorts.

In summary, the novel description of benign splenic lesions in a significant proportion of our BAP1-TPDS cohort, exceeding the expected prevalence in the general population, highlights the importance of further investigation of the BAP1-TPDS. Understanding these splenic lesions' prevalence, characteristics, and potential etiology is crucial for establishing appropriate surveillance protocols and clinical management strategies for individuals with BAP1-TPDS.

### Pancreatic cysts-part 1: using the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines for the management of pancreatic cysts – A practical approach [^116gccvy]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

The recent publication of evidence-based guidelines by the American Gastroenterological Association for the management of the incidental pancreatic cyst has stimulated considerable discussion among clinicians and researchers. The guidelines examined the evidence in an accompanying technical review defining current diagnostic approaches, as well as cyst natural history. Recognizing that the risk of malignant degeneration of these cystic neoplasms has been overestimated, the guidelines boldly increased thresholds for endoscopic ultrasound imaging and cyst fluid sampling, as well as proposing a reduced frequency of surveillance compared with previous expert consensus recommendations. A practical approach to using these guidelines in daily clinical practice is discussed, emphasizing that an individualized approach is often required for this diverse and common clinical problem.

### Splenic incidentalomas [^111FnLMX]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Compared with other intraabdominal organs, there is a paucity of scientific investigation involving the spleen; in particular, little has been published in the radiology literature regarding the detection and characterization of splenic disease conditions. Splenic lesions are common in a busy radiology practice. Technical advancements in computed tomography (CT) allow unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution; unexpected splenic lesions are commonly detected on CT examinations of the abdomen and chest and often pose a diagnostic challenge to both the radiologist and clinician. This article discusses incidental splenic lesions detected on CT and explores potential management strategies.

### MDCT findings of splenic pathology [^114tz3oB]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The delineation and characterization of splenic lesions and other abnormalities can be challenging on computed tomography. Many splenic lesions are incidentally found, imaging features tend to overlap, and without the appropriate clinical context, differentials can range from benign to malignant. Radiologists should be familiar with the wide variety of pathologies seen on computed tomography as it is often the first imaging modality a splenic lesion is seen. The purpose of this MDCT-focused review is to understand normal splenic anatomy and its variants, to illustrate and describe typical and atypical imaging patters of inflammatory, infectious, vascular, traumatic, benign, and malignant tumors of the spleen and provide clues in reaching the appropriate differential diagnosis and management.

### Laparoscopic decapsulation of congenital splenic cysts: a step forward in splenic preservation [^114CcM1w]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of laparoscopic decapsulation in the management of congenital splenic cysts in children.

Methods

Patients who presented over the last decade with congenital splenic cysts and were treated with laparoscopic decapsulation were reviewed retrospectively. The authors performed 4 procedures in 3 patients aged 10, 11 (and later 13), and 13 years. In all cases there was progressive enlargement of a single cyst, which lay in the upper pole of the spleen in 3 instances and in the lower pole in the fourth. Pneumoperitoneum was induced using the Veress needle technique, and 3 or 4 ports were utilized. Cysts were aspirated initially before marsupialization with excision of around two thirds of the cyst wall. Both endoshears and the harmonic scalpel were used with good hemostatic effect.

Results

All patients had a good outcome with cyst resolution on long-term follow-up using serial ultrasound scanning. The first patient (in 1993) remained 3 days as an in patient postoperatively, and the others stayed overnight only. One patient had a new cyst near the first 30 months after the initial procedure. This again was dealt with laparoscopically, with patient discharge the following day. There were no complications in the short or long term. Histology in all cases confirmed a simple epithelial cyst. Median follow-up was 2 years (range, 6 months to 8 years).

Conclusions

Our experience shows that laparoscopic decapsulation is an effective means of managing congenital splenic cysts and that both harmonic scalpel and endoshears are satisfactory dissecting instruments. Extensive marsupialization is probably unnecessary in these larger cysts, because long-term follow-up has shown no increased risk of recurrence after leaving a significant proportion of the cyst wall behind. This approach helps avoid major surgery in these cases.

### Improving diagnosis of atraumatic splenic lesions, part III: malignant lesions [^112iyW2u]. Clinical Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Focal atraumatic splenic lesions often pose a diagnostic challenge on cross-sectional imaging. They can be categorized based on etiology, as nonneoplastic, benign neoplastic, and malignant neoplastic (discussed in Part III) lesions, or on prevalence, as common, uncommon, and rare lesions. Familiarity with pertinent clinical parameters, etiology, pathology, prevalence, and ancillary features such as splenomegaly, concomitant hepatic involvement, and extrasplenic findings, in addition to knowledge of imaging spectra of the lesions, can improve diagnostic confidence. Consideration of these factors together can arm the radiologist with the necessary tools to render a more confident diagnosis and thus better aid management.

### Sclerotherapy for splenic cysts in children [^114Au3yK]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Sclerotherapy has been described as a treatment option for nonparasitic pediatric splenic cysts; however, there are limited data on its long-term effectiveness.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review and prospective follow-up imaging study of children treated for nonparasitic splenic cysts at our institution during 2006–2015. Included patients had International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code 289.59 or 759.0 and underwent either sclerotherapy or a partial splenic operation (partial splenectomy, cyst excision, or marsupialization). Charts were reviewed for demographics, imaging, treatments, and complications. Identified patients were contacted and asked to return for splenic ultrasonography.

Results

Six surgical patients and 19 sclerotherapy patients were identified. Sclerotherapy patients underwent a median of four treatments with a decrease in the size of the cyst or complete ablation in 89.5% (17/19). Of the two patients who underwent unsuccessful sclerotherapy, one patient had sclerotherapy with sotradecol and ethanol for eight treatments, developed infection, and underwent total splenectomy. The other patient did not improve with sclerotherapy and underwent partial splenectomy. Nine patients (eight patients treated with sclerotherapy and one patient treated with partial splenectomy) were successfully contacted and underwent follow-up imaging at a median follow-up of 2.4 y since last treatment. Of the eight patients treated with sclerotherapy, four patients remained cyst-free, three had small residual asymptomatic cysts stable in size, and one developed a recurrent small asymptomatic cyst; the patient treated with surgery had no recurrence.

Conclusions

Sclerotherapy appears to be an effective and durable alternative treatment for children with splenic cysts.

### Endoscopic management of splenic pseudocysts associated with acute and chronic pancreatitis [^115WfTnx]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually located in peri-pancreatic area but can occasionally occur at atypical locations like liver, spleen, mediastinum, pelvis, and kidney. Pseudocysts in these atypical locations are rare and pose difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Splenic pseudocysts (SP) are rare and have been previously reported as case reports with most of them being treated with surgery. Literature supporting endoscopic drainage of SP is scant.

In this study, we describe clinical and radiological characteristics of SP in 11 patients (4 of whom had been earlier published as case reports or their data had been included in a paper published earlier) as well as our experience with endoscopic drainage and clinical outcome in these patients.

### Ultrasound-guided percutaneous sclerosis of congenital splenic cysts using ethyl alcohol 96% and minocycline hydrochloride 10%: a pediatric series [^112KfZbQ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The management of congenital splenic cysts continues to evolve. In the past the standard treatment was splenectomy, but increased knowledge about the spleen's immunologic function has led most pediatric surgeons to preserve splenic tissue. A great number of studies using sclerosing substances have been published, but to date reports in children have been limited. Our study concerns a group of 15 children with congenital splenic cysts treated with percutaneous drainage and sclerosis with alcohol. We performed the procedure under general anesthesia and checked radiologically for possible leakage.

Methods

In 2000 our group started managing pediatric patients with splenic cysts. During the first eight years surgery was the treatment of choice. From April 2008 to December 2014, a prospective study was conducted on 15 consecutive patients treated with percutaneous sclerotherapy. The outcomes regarding cystic dimensional variations before and after treatment were analyzed.

Results

In 20% of patients complete disappearance of the cystic lesion was achieved. In 67% of the patients the maximum diameter of the cyst was reduced to below 50mm.

Conclusion

Our results should encourage the use of this treatment because it is a valid and safe option in childhood. The high success rate achieved with percutaneous drainage and sclerotherapy of cystic lesions supports our results.

### Computed tomography of the spleen: how to interpret the hypodense lesion [^113LQBN8]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Cysts

Splenic cysts can be divided into true (i.e. primary) and false (i.e. secondary) cysts. True splenic cysts can be further divided into parasitic and non-parasitic (i.e. congenital and neoplastic) cysts. While true cysts have epithelial lined walls, the borders of false cysts are composed of dense, fibrous tissue without an epithelial lining. It is impossible to differentiate between true and false splenic cysts by the CT imaging appearance itself. However, in clinical routine this differentiation is usually not relevant, because cysts without inherent solid components, wall-thickening or contrast-enhancement can be safely considered benign. However, it is important to note that cysts may cause complications, including infection, rupture and haemorrhage, and thus may cause clinical symptoms such as fever, upper left quadrant pain or jaundice.

### Case report: laparoscopic excision of a primary giant splenic hydatid cyst: literature review [^116Zfobm]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

We searched the PubMed database from the inception through February 20, 2019, using the following keywords "splenic hydatid cyst", "hydatidosis", "echinococcosis", "spleen", and their synonyms to identify studies in which SHD was treated by laparoscopy and summarize the characteristics of the clinical data. The search strategy initially generated 803 relevant articles. After reading the titles and abstracts, 756 articles were excluded. A total of 47 full-text articles were reviewed in detail. Finally, 15 articles. were included in the analysis, of which 11 articles reported primary isolated SHD and four articles reported spleen and other organs involvement. Figure 6 shows the selection process for the studies. The clinical data of the 15 SHD patients included in the analysis is shown in Table 1. Among the patients (female/male, 8, 53.3%/7, 46.7%; children < 18 years/ adults, 4, 26.7%/11, 73.3%; age range, 6–75 years; mean age, 38.27 years), 11 (73.3%) presented with abdominal pain, among whom seven had pain in the left upper abdomen. All patients underwent preoperative diagnosis by abdominal USG, CT alone, or the combination, and among whom eight were supplemented by serologic tests, with four positive and four negative results. The imaging findings revealed an anechoic (hypodense) unilocular cystic lesion with a calcified wall, with or without daughter vesicles in the organs. Total splenectomy by laparoscopy was performed in six patients (one child and five adults; cysts location, three patients in central segment of spleen, one near the hilar region in the upper pole of spleen, one in the upper pole with the left ovary involvement, and one not mentioned; cysts sizes range: 3.2–16.5 cm) and spleen-saving surgery was performed in nine patients (three children and six adults; cyst location; in the upper pole of the spleen in three patients, in the lower pole in two patients, in the peripheral of the spleen in one patient, and in the upper pole with liver involvement in three patients; cyst sizes range: 3.5–18 cm). There were no significant differences in cysts sizes between the two surgical approaches. All patients, except one, suffered from hemorrhage and intra-abdominal abscess, but no complications were reported. Eleven cases reported perioperative treatment with albendazole, with huge variation in the duration of use. No recurrences were observed in all cases during the 3 months to 8 years follow-up, of which only one study reported a positive IHA test.

### Splenic cyst in a wandering spleen: laparoscopic treatment with preservation of splenic function [^117WqFY4]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Wandering spleen and splenic cyst are rare benign congenital conditions that can both cause severe complications related to torsion or trauma.

Case Report

A 14-year-old girl presented a mobile 10-cm-long abdominal mass in the left lower quadrant associated with mild abdominal pain. The diagnosis of an 8-cm-long nonparasitic cyst in a wandering spleen was confirmed by computerized tomography and negative serum indirect hemagglutination titer for hydatid disease. Laparoscopic unroofing of the cyst and splenopexy in a vycril mesh was performed.

Results

No problems were encountered during laparoscopic surgery. Postoperative course was uneventful, and at a 1-year follow-up, the spleen is viable and maintains a normal position in the phrenorenal angle.

Conclusions

In the child, treatment of wandering spleen associated with a cyst should aim at the prevention of vascular accidents and at conservation of the spleen. We achieved these goals with unroofing and splenopexy through laparoscopic surgery.

### Fine needle sclerotherapy as a new effective therapeutic approach for nonparasitic splenic cysts: a case series [^112xeSN1]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nonparasitic splenic cysts are rare. Until now, surgical intervention has been the standard therapy of symptomatic splenic cysts.

Aims

We herein present a retrospective analysis of an approach using percutaneous ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration and sclerotherapy.

Methods

Out of 88,151 ultrasound reports, we identified 138 patients who presented with splenic cysts. A single splenic cyst was found in 88% (mean size 28.9 mm). Twelve patients underwent percutaneous therapy of symptomatic splenic cysts. They were younger, had larger splenic cysts and more often cyst internal echoes than the 126 untreated patients (all p < 0.0001).

Results

Initial sclerotherapy was performed with polidocanol 1% in 9 patients and with NaCl 10% in 2 patients. One hemorrhagic cyst was only purged. Serious adverse events were not noted. Eight patients had to undergo 1–11 further percutaneous cyst therapies. 15 of these 30 reinterventions were cyst aspiration therapies, only, and 11 of them were sclerotherapies with NaCl 10%. Four patients were readmitted to hospital for cyst retreatment. After 57 ± 43 months of follow-up, cyst size significantly decreased (p < 0.0001). Only two patients had a complicated course of cyst therapy.

Conclusions

Percutaneous ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy is a new approach for symptomatic splenic cysts. In most patients, cyst size and symptoms can be significantly reduced during one hospital stay.

### Congenital and hereditary cystic diseases of the abdomen [^113idcRG]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Congenital and hereditary cystic lesions of the abdomen are relatively rare. They may be diagnosed incidentally or may give rise to symptoms which prompt their diagnosis. Correct diagnosis is critical as they may simulate several other benign and malignant acquired diseases of the abdomen, all of which have very different treatment approaches and prognostic implications. With the correct and appropriate use of imaging, with relevant clinical information and patient history, diagnosis may be relatively straightforward and clinical management may be implemented appropriately.

### Laparoscopic subtotal splenectomy: a feasible option in the treatment of splenic metastasis [^113aHJAn]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Total splenectomy has become the preferred method for treating various splenic diseases; however, this surgery is known to be associated with complications arising from infectious or embolic processes, such as subphrenic abscess formation, portal thrombosis, pulmonary hypertension, thrombocytosis, thromboembolism, and post-splenic sepsis. Infectious complications are the most common and usually begin postoperatively, with an incidence of up to 40%, and the risk persists throughout life, as severe post-splenectomy sepsis syndrome may occur in 5–7% of cases. Surgical removal of the spleen results in impaired clearance of both intracellular and extracellular antigens from the bloodstream, reduced macrophage function, and altered immunoglobulin (Ig) M production. This leads to a diminished specific response to polysaccharide antigens, resulting in both specific and non-specific immune deficiencies, and a heightened susceptibility to severe bacteremia caused by encapsulated agents.

Although performed infrequently, partial splenectomy might help to avoid the previously mentioned consequences of asplenia. Given the spleen's crucial role and functionality, it has been identified as beneficial for certain indications and patient conditions, such as cystic/hydatid lesions, benign tumors, hematological diseases, partial splenic rupture, and even malignant lesions.– This approach has been suggested to help preserve some spleen function while reducing postoperative hospital stay and morbidity, as described in the systematic review published by Liu et al. The aim of this multimedia article was to provide a comprehensive overview of the laparoscopic subtotal splenectomy (LSS) surgical technique, emphasizing key steps to avoid postoperative bleeding and complications.

### Endoscopic management of splenic pseudocysts associated with acute and chronic pancreatitis [^116CRvrj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In spite of close proximity of the spleen to the pancreatic tail, SP are rare complication of both acute as well as chronic pancreatitis with majority of them occurring in adult patients with alcohol-induced pancreatitis. A large series of 500 patients with chronic pancreatitis, reported only 5 (1%) patients with SP. Similarly, another study of 238 patients with pseudocysts, reported splenic involvement in 5.9% patients only. SP have been very rarely reported in acute pancreatitis. A study of 100 patients with acute pancreatitis who were studied with CECT reported no patient with SP. The SP result either from dissection of the splenic parenchyma by pseudocyst or tracking of pancreatic fluid into the spleen along the course of splenic vessels.

SP usually do not have any specific signs and symptoms with majority of patients presenting with abdominal pain. Presence of left upper quadrant heaviness or left pleural effusion may suggest splenic involvement as was seen in 45% and 55% of our patients. Because of lack of specific symptoms and signs, CECT and MRCP play an important role in diagnosis and follow up of patients. MRCP can also delineate ductal anatomy and also occasionally demonstrate communication of SP with PD. EUS is also a useful investigational modality for evaluating pseudocysts because by determining solid necrotic debris it helps in planning optimal therapy.

Because of rarity, ideal management of SP is not clear and surgery in the form of splenectomy with or without distal pancreatectomy, cyst resection or drainage has been commonly used as therapeutic modality. There are few reports of successful treatment by percutaneous radiological drainage but risk of external pancreatic fistula especially in patients with PD abnormality limits its use.

While endoscopic transmural and/or transpapillary drainage has been successfully used in patients with abdominal pseudocysts, there is paucity of endoscopic data in patients with SP. We have previously published case reports of successful resolution of SP with endoscopic transpapillary drainage using NPD or stent or combination of EUS-guided transmural aspiration with transpapillary drainage. In this study also, 8/11 (73%) patients with SP who underwent endoscopic intervention had resolution of all the pseudocysts within 8 weeks.

Pancreatic cyst surveillance — discontinuation and age-related considerations: Surveillance should be discontinued if a patient is no longer a surgical candidate (Strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). It is reasonable to assess the utility of ongoing surveillance in those aged > 75 years. An individualized approach for those aged 76–85 years should be considered including an informed discussion about surgery (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). The American Gastroenterological Association guidelines are the only guideline that recommends stopping surveillance of pancreatic cysts (3). They recommend that surveillance should stop after 5 years if there are no high-risk features, and size of the cyst is stable. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support discontinuing surveillance after 5 years in patients who are still surgically fit.

Results

General clinical data

Totally, 24 children (12 boys and 12 girls) were diagnosed with a benign splenic tumor in our department. The patient's age ranged from 6.25 to 14.50 years (mean 10.21 ± 2.59 years). Among them, 9 cases were diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonic examination due to intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, backache or abdominal mass; 2 cases were found during hospitalization because of 'erythrocytosis' and 'precocious puberty'; the remaining 13 cases were asymptomatic, found accidentally during outpatient ultrasonography. No obvious hematological disorder, such as anemia or thrombocytopenia, was found. However, the masses gradually increased in size during the observation period. In one case of splenic cyst complicated with infection, percutaneous drainage and antibiotics treatment were performed initially and laparoscopic splenectomy was postponed for 6 months later. Two cases of splenic cyst underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous ethanol perfusion; no obvious regression was obtained, and they resorted to surgery.

### Monitoring of the intraoperative analgesia by pupillometry during laparoscopic splenectomy for splenic hydatid cyst [^115ScbSQ]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Echinococcosis causes a hydatid cyst, a worldwide disease. Human beings are intermediate hosts, but dogs complete the life cycle of the cestode. The most common presentation sites are the liver and lungs. We present an unusual case of a primary splenic hydatid cyst. Open splenectomy has traditionally been the treatment of choice for splenic hydatid cysts. In recent years, minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery has been used in appropriate cases. A healthy 48-year-old woman was scheduled for laparoscopic splenectomy. We controlled the intraoperative analgesia using pupillometry. We used it as a method to evaluate the depth of analgesia and to guide opioid administration based on the pupillary dilation reflex. This is regulated by the autonomous sympathetic system. It appears to be more sensitive and reliable than using simple variations in heart rate and blood pressure. It is an easy and safe to use method that might allow a reduction in postoperative analgesic requirements.

### Laparoscopic management of benign splenic tumors in children [^115J2odh]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The splenic tumor is relatively rare in children. However, diagnosing and managing this disease remain controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and pathological features of benign splenic tumors and to explore the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic splenectomy in children.

Methods

The clinical data of all patients who were diagnosed with benign splenic tumors and admitted to our center between January 2014 and December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Factors that were documented included demographic criteria, clinical manifestations, preoperative examinations, surgical methods, histopathological characteristics, postoperative complications and outcomes.

Results

Totally, 24 consecutive patients with a mean age of 10.21 ± 2.59 years were operated laparoscopically. Nine patients presented with recurrent abdominal pain, vomiting or backache. The remaining 15 cases were asymptomatic and were identified incidentally. Laparoscopic total splenectomy (LTS) was performed in 12 cases, laparoscopic partial splenectomy (LPS) in 9 cases and deroofing of splenic cyst in 3 cases. No significant differences were observed in operation time, intraoperative bleeding and postoperative abdominal drainage between the LTS and LPS groups. Histopathology examination reported 12 cases of splenic epithelial cyst, 5 cases of splenic lymphangioma or lymphatic malformation, 3 cases of splenic hamartoma, 3 cases of splenic littoral cell angioma and 1 case of splenic hemangioma. No postoperative complications and tumor recurrence were observed.

Conclusions

It is still difficult to precisely diagnose the splenic tumor preoperatively. Laparoscopic splenectomy is safe and feasible in treating the benign splenic tumors, and partial splenectomy is of great significance in preserving the immune function in children.

### Incidental splenic findings on cross-sectional imaging [^116J6vAR]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Incidental splenic focal findings are commonly encountered in clinical practice and frequently represent a diagnostic dilemma due to nonspecific imaging features. Most are benign, particularly in patients without a history of malignancy and without symptoms of fever, weight loss, or left upper quadrant or epigastric pain. Incidental malignant splenic processes are exceedingly rare. This article reviews imaging characteristics of incidental focal splenic findings, and proposes a practical approach for management of such findings, which can prevent unnecessary workup and its related drawbacks in clinical practice.

### Unusual pseudocyst in a wandering spleen [^113PGA5P]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Pseudocysts of the spleen are rare, generally asymptomatic lesions developing secondary to trauma, infection or infarction. When symptomatic, they typically present as non-specific pain in the left hypochondrium, with or without a palpable lump on clinical examination. However, these conventions fail when they occur in a wandering spleen, making imaging critically important. This report describes an unusual case of a 50-year-old who presented with a large cystic mass in a pelvic spleen; imaging facilitated a successful splenectomy and subsequent histopathology revealed a pseudocyst in a wandering spleen.

### Laparoscopic splenopexy and cystectomy for an enlarged wandering spleen and splenic cyst [^1138ZRfr]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Wandering spleen is an uncommon condition, which can present emergently in children. Similarly, nonparasitic splenic cysts are also rarely encountered. In this report, we describe a massive wandering spleen (22 cm in longitudinal dimension) with a pseudocyst (4.6 x 2 cm) in the inferior pole in an asymptomatic 16-year-old adolescent. Only 4 similar cases have been reported in the literature; 2 of them have been in the pediatric age group. These 2 conditions were diagnosed while she was being evaluated for dysmenorrhea, and she was referred for surgical consultation. The cyst was excised laparoscopically, and the spleen was placed into an extraperitoneal pouch. To date, there are no other reports describing laparoscopic cystectomy and splenopexy in a teenager.

### Endoscopic management of splenic pseudocysts associated with acute and chronic pancreatitis [^117KWBA1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Of eleven patients, 10 patients had partial disruption which could be bridged in all and 8 (80%) patients had successful outcome. It has been earlier demonstrated that patients with partial disruption respond better to endoscopic treatment than those with complete disruption. In our study, 3 patients with echogenic contents in SP on EUS did not respond to transpapillary drainage alone. One of these could be successfully treated with combined transpapillary and transmural drainage, whereas other two required surgery. This observation is in accordance with previously published reports that have shown that endoscopic transpapillary drainage alone has poor results in fluid collections with solid debris.

In conclusion, SP is rare complication of both acute as well as chronic pancreatitis and endoscopic transpapillary drainage is safe and effective modality for its treatment especially when it is non-infected with clear contents and is associated with partial ductal disruption that can be bridged by an endoprosthesis.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually located in peri-pancreatic area
Occasionally occur at atypical locations like liver, spleen, mediastinum, pelvis, and kidney
Splenic pseudocysts are rare and are usually treated with surgery

What the new findings are:

Endoscopic transpapillary drainage is a safe and effective modality for treatment of splenic pseudocysts especially when they are not infected, there is partial ductal disruption, there is no solid necrotic debris, and the disruption can be bridged by an endoprosthesis

Discussion

Benefits

LSS is a rarely used technique but can provide significant advantages beyond those typical of laparoscopic procedures. These advantages include the preservation of immune function, which requires retaining more than 25% of the spleen to prevent post-splenectomy sepsis, as well as the prevention of post-splenectomy splenic vein thrombosis (PSVT). As noted by Lee et al.PSVT can occur in up to 45% of cases following total splenectomy, potentially leading to serious long-term complications such as the development of prehepatic portal hypertension. This condition increases the risk of variceal bleeding and other related sequelae, which can significantly affect patient outcomes. Recent insights by Huettl and Langunderscore the importance of minimally invasive techniques in managing splenic metastases, with emphasis on the balance between oncologic safety and the preservation of splenic function.

Risks

Nevertheless, subtotal splenectomy has some pitfalls, including technical difficulties, particularly with transection of the splenic parenchyma. It is not applicable to central cysts with hilar involvement or very large cysts. Additionally, there is a risk of recurrence in hematological diseases and a theoretical increase in morbidity due to intraoperative complications, especially hemorrhagic complications, although not all series report such outcomes. Therefore, there is a need for advanced hemostatic technology, such as a radiofrequency device. COOLINGBIS © is a valuable instrument for controlling hemostasis and managing bleeding from the spleen during surgery. Presurgical preparation is crucial, involving the identification of the vascular pedicle on a CT scan and the use of indocyanine green to visualize spleen vascularization and delimit ischemic zones.

### Laparoscopic excision of a giant splenic vascular tumor [^112fZVbs]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The splenic vascular tumor referred to as a hemangioma is rare and typically presents as a small asymptomatic lesion. We report a case of a giant splenic cyst in a 13-year-old boy with abdominal distension. He underwent laparoscopic excision of the splenic cyst without complication. Pathology revealed a vascular tumor. At 15 months of follow-up, he continued to be asymptomatic, and abdominal ultrasound showed no recurrence of his disease. Laparoscopic excision of giant splenic cysts is a viable option in children, allowing for preservation of normal splenic tissue.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® pancreatic cyst [^1151q34o]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Incidental pancreatic cysts are increasingly detected on imaging studies performed for unrelated indications and may be incompletely characterized on these studies. Adequate morphological characterization is critical due to the small risk of malignant degeneration associated with neoplastic pancreatic cysts, as well as the risk of associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For all pancreatic cysts, both size and morphology determine management. Specifically, imaging detection of features, such as pancreatic ductal communication and presence or absence of worrisome features or high-risk stigmata, have important management implications. The recommendations in this publication determine the appropriate initial imaging study to further evaluate a pancreatic cyst that was incidentally detected on a nondedicated imaging study. The recommendations are designed to maximize the yield of diagnostic information in order to better risk-stratify pancreatic cysts and assist in guiding future management. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts [^1172dZxP]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline on asymptomatic neoplastic pancreatic cysts focuses on adult patients with cysts detected by radiology and uses the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework phrased in the population, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) format. The scope pertains only to asymptomatic pancreatic neoplastic cysts, does not evaluate the impact of symptoms, and excludes solid papillary neoplasms, cystic degeneration of adenocarcinomas, neuroendocrine tumors, and main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) without side branch involvement. Incidental identification is common with modern imaging, and subsequent evaluations and interventions can be invasive, expensive, and harmful. Management emphasizes identifying the small minority of cysts with early invasive cancer or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) so that appropriately timed surgical resection can reduce mortality, while acknowledging that surgery is associated with significant morbidity and some mortality. Common diagnostic tools — including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology — have suboptimal sensitivities and specificities for identifying patients at highest risk. For each PICO statement, both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation are provided, with quality described on a 4-point scale from high to very low.

### Epidermoid splenic cysts… [^111VsxRr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Five young women were treated by splenectomy for epidermoid cysts of the spleen. They all had vague abdominal symptoms, and had a mass palpable in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The hematologic indices were unremarkable. The diagnosis was suggested by routine radiologic examinations. It was confirmed in one patient by gray-scale ultrasonography, and in another by selective splenic arteriography. Of the true cysts of the spleen, the epidermoid cyst is the rarest, representing 10% of the benign, nonparasitic cysts. The symptoms are completely relieved by splenectomy, and this remains the treatment of choice. Ross ME, Ellwood R, Yang SS, Lucas RJ. Epidermoid Splenic Cysts. Arch Surg. 1977; 112: 596–599. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.1977.01370050056009

### Splenomegaly: diagnosis and management in adults… [^113mzUV9]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Management Management of splenomegaly involves treating the underlying disease process. Depending on the level of experience of each physician, hepatology or hematology referrals may be warranted for definitive diagnosis and management. With guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or infectious disease consultants, many of the infectious causes of splenomegaly can be managed by family physicians. 8 Spleen reduction therapies and splenectomy are occasionally used for painful splenomegaly or in malignancies. Splenectomy can be performed to control esophageal varices in liver disease or to control pain and other symptoms caused by massive splenomegaly. 24, 25 Fevers are particularly concerning in these patients because progression to sepsis occurs more rapidly compared with individuals who have functioning spleens. Febrile patients with impaired splenic function should receive empiric antibiotic therapy.

Daily antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated for one to two years after splenectomy, before respiratory tract procedures, and in any asplenic patient who has developed sepsis. Oral penicillin twice daily is typically used for antibiotic therapy after splenectomy and before procedures. If an asplenic patient develops a fever but does not appear ill, immediate administration of ceftriaxone is recommended. Patients who appear ill or who have laboratory results consistent with infection should be treated with cefepime and vancomycin. Asplenic patients should be prescribed an emergency oral dose of antibiotics to take in the case of a fever if they are unable to get to a medical facility that can administer intravenous antibiotics within two hours. Amoxicillin or levofloxacin are the preferred agents.

25 Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and influenza virus lowers the risk of infections. 24 A dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine eight weeks later, H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccination, and MenACWY should be given at least two weeks before planned splenectomy if the patient has not been previously vaccinated with an age-appropriate regimen.

Morgenstern L, Shapiro SJ. Techniques of Splenic Conservation. Arch Surg. 1979; 114: 449–454. doi: 10.1001/archsurg.1979.01370280103015
- The scope of surgical procedures on the spleen has undergone a dramatic change in the past few years. Efforts directed toward splenic preservation have intensified with the emerging realization that sepsis is a sequela not to be ignored in asplenic subjects. Successful operations on splenic parenchyma require modified techniques of exposure and mobilization of the spleen. The segmental vasculature of the spleen makes possible controlled resection of traumatized or diseased segments of parenchyma. Hemostatic measures include the use of metal clips, ligation of small intrasplenic vessels, and application of topical agents for residual surface bleeding. With the use of such techniques, conservative splenic surgery is possible in minor and major splenic trauma, splenic cysts, and selected pathologic states in the spleen.

### Calcified cyst in the spleen… [^115qPcqF]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

A man in his mid-50s was referred to our hospital because he had a cystic mass in his spleen that was discovered incidentally during a routine physical examination. He had no history of abdominal trauma, infection, or surgery. A physical examination revealed mild tenderness over the posterior left upper quadrant. A precontrast computed tomographic scan revealed a large, well-defined, cystic mass with mural calcification in the spleen, and the cyst was not enhanced in the arterial phase. The laboratory test results, including carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 levels, were all within normal ranges, except for a mild increase in the carbohydrate antigen 72–4 level, which was 11. 89 U/mL.

### Preoperative diagnosis of splenic cysts… [^1125ohRe]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Nonparasitic solitary splenic cystic lesions occurred in four patients. Selective arteriography was successful in each instance in determining the correct preoperative diagnosis of splenic cyst. Subsequent histologic examination classified two lesions as false cysts, one as a true cyst, and one as a chronic cystic hematoma. There appeared to be no difference in the arteriographic pattern between true and false splenic cysts, or between these cysts and chronic splenic hematomas. The presence of active infection within the splenic cyst was suspected in one patient from the arteriographic demonstration of a thickened cyst wall. Bron KM, Hoffman WJ. Preoperative Diagnosis of Splenic Cysts. Arch Surg. 1971; 102: 459–461.
