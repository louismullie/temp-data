## Question

What is the recommended dosing for an inhaled DOAC in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosing for an inhaled direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and more broadly whether such an inhaled formulation exists or would be clinically appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the approved routes and formulations of DOACs from regulatory labeling. Then, I should verify evidence-based management principles for DAH, especially guidance on continuing versus stopping anticoagulation during active pulmonary bleeding. Next, I will check whether any clinical guideline, label, or study in the provided set even mentions an inhaled DOAC. Finally, I will synthesize the therapeutic implications and outline the standard-of-care approach if DAH occurs in a patient receiving a DOAC, cross-referencing reversal guidance and supportive measures.

> Let me first confirm the formulation question. I need to ensure whether any DOAC exists in an inhaled form, because if none does, dosing is moot. The FDA labels for rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis) unambiguously describe oral administration with oral pharmacokinetics and do not reference any inhaled formulations or pulmonary delivery routes, which strongly suggests DOACs are only available as oral products in current practice [^114VLNv1] [^112cYXvg]. Hold on, I should verify across independent sources: the Cochrane review on DOACs for pulmonary embolism and emergency management reviews similarly characterize these agents as oral therapies without mention of inhaled delivery, reinforcing that there is no inhaled DOAC in clinical use or labeling in this dataset [^114Q8wix].

> Next, I need to establish the clinical context of DAH. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is a life-threatening pulmonary bleeding syndrome often requiring ICU-level care, with diagnosis frequently confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage due to non-specific symptoms and imaging, and it carries high short-term mortality in many series, underscoring the urgency of hemostasis-focused management rather than anticoagulation escalation [^113tzMNH] [^111kFXtU]. Wait, let me verify how anticoagulants are handled during active bleeding: both apixaban and rivaroxaban labels direct discontinuation in the setting of active pathological hemorrhage, which squarely applies to DAH, and this aligns with standard bleeding management principles [^112cYXvg] [^114VLNv1].

> I will now examine reversal and supportive strategies because if a patient with DAH is on a DOAC, immediate actions matter. The updated ISTH guidance and contemporary reviews indicate that specific reversal agents — idarucizumab for dabigatran and andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors — are indicated for life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, with PCCs considered when specific antidotes are unavailable, alongside general supportive measures [^113tzMNH] [^1127MrCP] [^112WLAQr]. Let me think about adjunctive pulmonary-specific support: case experience in DAH has included high-dose corticosteroids, maintenance of platelet counts above 50,000/mm³, and in select refractory cases, recombinant factor VIIa, although these data are limited and not DOAC-specific, emphasizing individualized risk–benefit assessment in critical care settings [^111X5WuL] [^111kFXtU].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any clinical context in the provided materials mentions inhaled DOACs for any indication, let alone DAH. Scanning across the regulatory labels, reversal guidelines, emergency care reviews, and DAH-focused reports within the provided set, there are zero mentions of inhaled DOAC formulations, dosing, or investigational use by pulmonary delivery, which strongly implies that no such product is approved, studied here, or endorsed by guidelines in this dataset [^114VLNv1] [^112cYXvg] [^113tzMNH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check whether any bleeding management protocols or overdose sections suggest alternative routes; again, the labels and guidance are explicit about oral administration and reversal pathways, with no reference to inhalation as a therapeutic route, confirming the absence of inhaled DOACs in this evidence set [^111cVvde] [^1127MrCP].

> But wait, what if someone proposed inhaled anticoagulant delivery during DAH as a theoretical local therapy? Let me reconsider the pathophysiology: DAH is bleeding into the alveolar spaces from the alveolar-capillary interface, so administering an anticoagulant — especially directly into the lungs — would be mechanistically counterproductive when the clinical objective is to restore hemostasis and stop hemorrhage, not to promote further anticoagulation [^111xtKau]. I should confirm contraindications conceptually aligned with this: systemic heparin is contraindicated in uncontrolled active bleeding, and DOAC labels direct discontinuation in active hemorrhage, both reinforcing that initiation or continuation of anticoagulants during DAH is inappropriate, regardless of route, and that hemostatic interventions are the priority [^116fk9X6] [^114VLNv1] [^112cYXvg].

> Let me now translate this into a practical, evidence-aligned approach for a patient on a DOAC who develops DAH. I need to ensure the correct initial steps: immediately discontinue the DOAC, promptly assess severity, and initiate reversal when indicated — andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban, or idarucizumab for dabigatran — with consideration of PCCs if specific agents are unavailable, alongside supportive critical care and pulmonary-directed management, as outlined by ISTH guidance and prescribing information [^113tzMNH] [^112cYXvg] [^111cVvde] [^1127MrCP]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions on adjuncts; while some reports describe corticosteroids, platelet targets, and occasional rFVIIa use in DAH, these are context-dependent decisions in consultation with critical care and hematology, not substitutes for anticoagulant discontinuation and reversal in life-threatening bleeds [^111X5WuL] [^111kFXtU].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no recommended dosing for an inhaled DOAC in DAH because no inhaled DOAC formulation exists in the provided evidence set, and such a therapy would contradict the core management principles of DAH, which require cessation and reversal of anticoagulation with supportive hemostatic care, not administration of additional anticoagulant by any route [^114VLNv1] [^112cYXvg] [^113tzMNH] [^111xtKau]. Therefore, if DAH occurs in a patient receiving a DOAC, the standard of care is to stop the DOAC, consider appropriate reversal, and provide intensive supportive management, rather than to contemplate inhaled anticoagulant dosing, which has neither evidentiary nor physiological support here [^1127MrCP] [^112WLAQr].

---

There is **no evidence or guideline support** for using inhaled direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) [^111xtKau]. DOACs are systemic agents and are **contraindicated in active bleeding**, including DAH [^112cYXvg], including DAH [^114VLNv1]. If a patient on a DOAC develops DAH, the DOAC should be stopped immediately and specific reversal agents (idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors) [^113tzMNH] or 4-factor PCC used if needed [^1127MrCP]. There is no clinical rationale or published data for inhaled DOACs in DAH, and their use would likely worsen bleeding [^114VLNv1].

---

## Pharmacological considerations of DOACs in DAH

DOACs are systemic anticoagulants with predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that do not require routine laboratory monitoring [^115zT2yG]; however, they are associated with **bleeding risks**, including major [^112cYXvg] and potentially fatal hemorrhages [^114VLNv1]. Use in patients with active bleeding, such as DAH, is **contraindicated** because of the risk of exacerbating hemorrhage [^114FEJAq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **advise against** anticoagulant use, including DOACs, in patients with active bleeding, such as DAH [^113tzMNH]. Instead, recommended management for DAH includes:

- **Immediate discontinuation** of anticoagulant therapy [^112cYXvg].
- **Administration of specific reversal agents** (idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors) [^113tzMNH] or non-specific reversal agents (4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate) [^112WLAQr] if specific agents are unavailable [^1127MrCP].
- **Supportive care** measures, including oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation if necessary [^111kFXtU], and correction of underlying coagulopathies [^111xtKau].

---

## Risks associated with DOAC use in DAH

Using DOACs in patients with DAH poses **significant risks**, including:

- **Exacerbation of bleeding**: DOACs [^112cYXvg] can significantly worsen hemorrhagic conditions, leading to increased morbidity and mortality [^11292h97].
- **Lack of clinical evidence**: There is no clinical evidence or published literature supporting the use of DOACs, inhaled or otherwise, in the management of DAH [^111xtKau].
- **Contraindications**: DOACs are explicitly contraindicated [^114VLNv1] in patients with active pathological hemorrhage [^112cYXvg], including DAH.

---

## Alternative anticoagulation strategies

When anticoagulation is necessary for underlying thrombotic conditions, alternatives such as unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be considered [^113wFFzA]. These agents have **shorter half-lives and reversible effects**, allowing more controlled management of bleeding risk [^116fk9X6]. However, use must be carefully balanced against the risk of exacerbating DAH and individualized based on patient-specific factors.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for using inhaled DOACs to manage diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^111xtKau]. DOACs are systemic anticoagulants and are contraindicated in active bleeding, such as DAH, because of the significant risk of exacerbating hemorrhage [^114VLNv1]. Current clinical guidelines recommend immediate discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy, administration of reversal agents, and supportive care measures for patients with DAH [^113tzMNH]. Therefore, inhaled DOACs **should not be used** in patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

### Xarelto [^114VLNv1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Xarelto increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious or fatal bleeding. In deciding whether to prescribe Xarelto to patients at increased risk of bleeding, the risk of thrombotic events should be weighed against the risk of bleeding. Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss and consider the need for blood replacement. Discontinue Xarelto in patients with active pathological hemorrhage. The terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy subjects aged 20 to 45 years.

Concomitant use of other drugs that impair hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin, P2Y12 platelet inhibitors, dual antiplatelet therapy, other antithrombotic agents, fibrinolytic therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.4)], selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Concomitant use of drugs that are known combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitors increases rivaroxaban exposure and may increase bleeding risk [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Risk of hemorrhage in acutely ill medical patients at high risk of bleeding**: Acutely ill medical patients with the following conditions are at increased risk of bleeding with the use of Xarelto for primary VTE prophylaxis: history of bronchiectasis, pulmonary cavitation, or pulmonary hemorrhage; active cancer (i.e. undergoing acute, in-hospital cancer treatment); active gastroduodenal ulcer in the three months prior to treatment; history of bleeding in the three months prior to treatment.

### Reversal of direct oral anticoagulants: Guidance from the SSC of the ISTH [^113tzMNH]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). High credibility.

The currently approved direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in clinical practice. Although serious bleeding risks are lower with DOACs than with vitamin K antagonists, bleeding remains the most frequent side effect. Andexanet alfa and idarucizumab are the currently approved specific reversal agents for oral factor (F)Xa inhibitors and dabigatran, respectively. Our prior guidance document was published in 2016, but with more information available on the utility and increased use of these reversal agents and other bleeding management strategies, we have updated this International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis guidance document on DOAC reversal.

In this narrative review, we compare the mechanism of action of specific and nonspecific reversal agents, review the clinical data supporting their use, and provide guidance on when reversal is indicated. In addition, we briefly discuss the reversal of oral FXIa inhibitors, a new class of DOACs currently under clinical development.

### Clinical guideline on reversal of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with life threatening bleeding [^1127MrCP]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation is essential for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. Guidelines recommend direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) over vitamin K antagonists in DOAC-eligible patients. The major complication of anticoagulation is serious or life-threatening hemorrhage, which may necessitate prompt hemostatic intervention. Reversal of DOACs may also be required for patients in need of urgent invasive procedures. This guideline from the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) aims to provide evidence-based recommendations and suggestions on managing patients on DOACs undergoing urgent or emergency procedures, including the treatment of DOAC-induced bleeding.

- **Design**: A systematic literature search was performed, examining four drug comparators (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) and clinical scenarios ranging from planned to emergency surgery with the outcomes of mortality, hematoma growth, and thromboembolic complications. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Consensus on the wording of the recommendations was achieved by a Delphi process.

- **Results**: So far, no results from prospective randomized trials comparing two active comparators (e.g. a direct reversal agent and an unspecific hemostatic agent such as prothrombin complex concentrate: PCC) have been published, and the majority of publications were uncontrolled and observational studies. Thus, the certainty of evidence was limited.

### Eliquis [^112cYXvg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Bleeding**: Eliquis increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue Eliquis in patients with active pathological hemorrhage.

- **Reversal of anticoagulant effect**: An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available. The pharmacodynamic effect of Eliquis can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose, i.e. for about two drug half-lives. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate, or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered, but have not been evaluated in clinical studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When PCCs are used, monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of apixaban using a clotting test (PT, INR, or aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is not useful and is not recommended. Activated oral charcoal reduces absorption of apixaban, thereby lowering apixaban plasma concentration [see Overdosage (10)]. Hemodialysis does not appear to have a substantial impact on apixaban exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Treatment of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage after allogeneic bone marrow transplant with recombinant factor VIIa [^111X5WuL]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a potentially life-threatening pulmonary toxicity that occurs in 1–21% of patients following bone marrow transplantation. The syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate, and treatment options are limited. Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven) has recently been approved for the treatment of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A/B with inhibitors. A greater understanding of the mechanism by which rFVIIa restores hemostasis has recently become available, with in vitro evidence supporting that the thrombin burst achieved by rFVIIa is independent of the presence or binding to tissue factor. This insight has suggested a range of other potential clinical uses for the drug, including the setting of pulmonary hemorrhage.

We review our experience with using rFVIIa for treatment of DAH in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia following a matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplant. Boluses of 90 microg/kg rFVIIa were given every 3 hours, 4 doses per day, concurrently with high-dose corticosteroids and maintenance of a platelet count greater than 50,000/mm³. Rapid clinical and radiological improvement was noted within several doses of rFVIIa, with discontinuation of the drug after eight doses. However, the patient's clinical condition began to rapidly deteriorate following cessation of rFVIIa, resulting in reinstitution of therapy 24 hours later. The patient again exhibited rapid clinical improvement, and rFVIIa was continued for an additional 16 doses with no further evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage noted. No toxicity or adverse events were observed.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios - is there a general consensus [^115gA9VY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

While Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have traditionally been the mainstay for anticoagulation, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) represent a major development in treating and preventing venous thromboembolic disease and in suppressing stroke risk in atrial fibrillation. Interest in DOAC therapy has increased significantly over time, with prescription claims rising from 15.4% to 31.0% of all oral anticoagulant claims between 2013 and 2015, according to US Medicare data. Google Trend data also indicate an increasing global interest in DOAC therapy; the greatest number of searches for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban between 2012 and 2017 were conducted in North America, Central/Eastern Europe, and Australia. Interest in edoxaban was less pronounced and restricted to Germany, Japan, and the United States. In contrast, interest in warfarin therapy has decreased significantly over time.

- **Guideline relevance**: A key issue with guidelines is that they become out of date as soon as they are published, due to the continuous publication of new clinical data. This is especially relevant for DOAC reversal, with several guidelines published prior to the approval of andexanet alfa. Attempts are being made to update guidelines to address the use of this agent. Recent clinical data support the use of four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC) in VKA reversal and also in DOAC reversal if specific agents are not available. Currently available clinical data on idarucizumab as well as andexanet alfa support their use in specific DOAC reversal. It is likely that anticoagulation reversal guidelines will continue to evolve, particularly in the case of specific DOAC reversals.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^115GWqZC]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Assessing anticoagulant activity is often crucial when a patient presents in the emergency department and is known or suspected to be on oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy. This assessment is particularly helpful in several situations:

- **Unintentional or intentional overdose**: The patient may have overdosed on the OAC without presenting symptoms. For instance, a patient on warfarin could have an overly elevated INR value due to an overdose or a pharmacological interaction.

- **Bleeding episodes**: The patient might be experiencing or suspected of experiencing spontaneous external or internal bleeding.

- **Injury-related bleeding**: If the patient has suffered an injury causing external or internal bleeding, knowing the anticoagulation level can be crucial.

- **Urgent procedures**: In cases where an urgent surgical or invasive procedure is necessary due to trauma or acute illness, it is essential for the surgical team to be aware of the patient's anticoagulation level.

### An unexpected case of recurrence of pulmonary embolism in a patient recovered from COVID-19 in full regimen dose of direct oral anticoagulant drug [^116D4m8k]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Reports of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) associated with COVID-19 have been increasingly documented in the literature. The frequency of PE during the COVID-19 era seems to be significantly higher than during the same period in 2019. Nearly 20% of COVID-19 patients present with severe coagulation abnormalities, which can occur in almost all critically ill cases and adversely affect prognosis. It has been reported that markedly elevated D-dimer levels, fibrinogen degradation products, and prothrombin are very common in COVID-19-related deaths.

Mini autopsies have demonstrated microthrombi in the lungs, liver, and throughout the vascular system. This suggests that severe endothelial dysfunction, driven by the cytokine storm and induced by hypoxemia, leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation, causing thromboembolic complications. However, in the early post-COVID-19 era, there is no data regarding the likelihood of recurrent PE (rePE) in recovered COVID-19 patients who are already on treatment dose anticoagulant therapy.

Currently, it is suggested that in all severe COVID-19 patients and those suspected of venous thromboembolism (VTE), if there are no contraindications to anticoagulation, curative anticoagulant therapy should be initiated. The first-line treatment involves parenteral anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) administered by venous infusion in cases of severe renal impairment, with regular monitoring for anticoagulation dose adjustment. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an option only after the acute phase when the patient is more stable, has no treatment interference with CYP3A4, and no major comorbidities.

### Novel oral anticoagulants: Efficacy, laboratory measurement, and approaches to emergent reversal [^112EiJjk]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Warfarin, the most commonly used of the vitamin K antagonists, has been a mainstay of oral anticoagulation for decades. However, its usage is limited by morbidity and mortality secondary to bleeding as well as a cumbersome therapeutic monitoring process. In recent years, several competing novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed, each aspiring to match or exceed warfarin's effectiveness while mitigating bleeding risk and eliminating therapeutic monitoring requirements.

Currently, one oral direct thrombin inhibitor and two direct factor Xa inhibitors are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. We compare the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of these new drugs. Additionally, we explore various laboratory assays that may be useful to measure these drugs in certain clinical circumstances. Finally, we discuss emerging strategies to reverse these agents in an emergency.

The purpose of this article is to provide a framework for practicing pathologists to advise clinicians on NOAC laboratory measurement and management of NOAC-associated bleeding.

### An unexpected case of recurrence of pulmonary embolism in a patient recovered from COVID-19 in full regimen dose of direct oral anticoagulant drug [^115H5NsZ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic affecting all countries in the world. Italy has been particularly afflicted by the health emergency, and since the peak phase has passed, major concern regarding medium to long-term complications due to COVID-19 is arising. Little is known in literature regarding thromboembolic complications once healed after COVID-19.

- **Case presentation**: A 51-year-old patient recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by pulmonary embolism (PE) came to the hospital for palpitations and chest pain. Although he was on treatment dose of direct oral anticoagulation (DOAC), massive rePE was diagnosed.

- **Conclusion**: In the early post-COVID-19 era, the question remains regarding the efficacy of DOACs in COVID-19 patients.

### Jantoven [^111RtpwT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The dosage and administration of Jantoven must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

- **Recommended target INR ranges and durations for individual indications**: An INR greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

	- **Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism)**: Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

		- For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
		- For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
		- For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. Periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage: a rare complication of clopidogrel use [^116UDKTb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) has been reported as a rare complication of clopidogrel use and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. We describe the case of an 88-year-old Native American woman who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure. A CT scan of the chest showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities. She had been on clopidogrel for 6 months for a carotid artery stent. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies revealed DAH. Infectious and autoimmune work-up were all negative. Clopidogrel was stopped and high-dose steroids were started. Her symptoms gradually improved until she was discharged from the hospital. The differential diagnosis for DAH is broad; anticoagulant-induced DAH should be part of the differential diagnosis and is usually a diagnosis of exclusion.

### Anticoagulant impact on clinical outcomes of pulmonary embolism compared with thrombolytic therapy; meta-analysis [^1128ZbiK]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Low credibility.

Assessing the precise likelihood of significant hemorrhage based on available literature is hindered by various complexities. Various thrombolytic drugs and dose regimens are used in individual research, each with its own distinct dangers. Sample sizes frequently lack sufficient magnitude to evaluate the risk associated with a specific treatment plan. There is inconsistency in the definitions of substantial bleeding across different research. Early studies sometimes reported bleeding issues associated with the vascular access sites used for pulmonary angiography, which often required blood transfusions.

The rates of PE diagnostic tests may be lower in modern practice using noninvasive methods. A prior investigation showed the potential hazards of significant bleeding in patients who underwent therapy for PE using a dosage of 100 mg of alteplase at a solitary medical facility. The analysis identified several significant risk factors. These included having undergone major surgery within the past 3 weeks (OR 9.00, 95% CI 1.01−79.99), having an international normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.7 (OR 13.20, 95% CI 1.54−113.52), weighing less than 100 kg (OR 1.18 for every 10 kg below 100 kg, 95% CI 1.01−1.37), and having at least one of the following characteristics (OR 5.02, 95% CI 1.78−18.55): internal bleeding in the previous 4 weeks, hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, positive stool occult test, presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump, African American race, gastrointestinal bleeding in the previous 3 months, aortic dissection, acute pancreatitis, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

### The safety of oral anticoagulants registry (SOAR): A national, ED-based study of the evaluation and management of bleeding and bleeding concerns due to the use of oral anticoagulants [^112T8qTP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The Safety of Oral Anticoagulants Registry (SOAR) was designed to describe the evaluation and management of patients with oral anticoagulant (OAC)-related major bleeding or bleeding concerns who present to the emergency department (ED) with acute illness or injury. Patients in the ED are increasingly taking anticoagulants, which can cause bleeding-related complications as well as impact the acute management of related or unrelated clinical issues that prompt presentation. Modifications of emergency evaluation and management due to anticoagulation have not previously been studied.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter observational in-hospital study of patients who were judged to be experiencing an active OAC effect and had either (a) an obvious bleeding event or (b) were deemed at risk for serious bleeding spontaneously, after injury, or during an indicated invasive procedure. Diagnostic testing, therapies employed, and clinical outcomes were collected.

- **Results**: Thirty-one US hospitals contributed data to SOAR. Of 1513 subjects, acute hemorrhage (AH) qualified 78%, while 22% had a bleeding concern (BC). Warfarin was the index OAC in 37.3%, dabigatran in 13.3%, and an anti-Factor Xa in 49.4%. The most common sites of AH were gastrointestinal (51.0%) and intracranial (26.8%). In warfarin-treated patients, the mean (IQR) presenting INR was 3.1 (2.2, 4.8) in AH patients and 3.9 (2.4, 7.2) in BC patients. Three-fifths of SOAR patients were treated with factor repletion or specific reversal agents, and those patients had a longer length of stay. In addition, seven (0.76%) of the…

- **Search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria**: Two investigators (DJS and MBG) independently searched pubmed.gov/MEDLINE for relevant publications on 31 October 2018 and on 14 November 2018. We used the following search terms: [(oral anticoagulants OR Vitamin K antagonists OR novel oral anticoagulants OR direct oral anticoagulants OR non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants) AND (ICH) AND (mortality OR volume)], including different spellings and common abbreviations (i.e. VKA, NOAC, DOAC, ICH).

	- **Inclusion criteria**:
		- Original studies published in English
		- Comparing OAC-ICH (either VKA-ICH or NOAC-ICH or both) with non-OAC ICH
		- Recruiting patients from the same population (hospital-based or population-based studies)
		- Reporting at least one of the following outcomes for both types of ICH (OAC-ICH and non-OAC ICH): mortality, haematoma volume, or HE

	- **Exclusion criteria**:
		- Studies with less than 10 participants with OAC-ICH
		- Studies reporting matched cohorts rather than consecutive patients

- **Data collection**: Two authors (DJS and MBG) independently performed the literature research and screened all titles and abstracts for eligibility. We read the full text of articles potentially eligible for inclusion and independently extracted data on study design, demographics, and outcomes. Disagreements were resolved by collaboration.

### Cablivi [^112WsyJi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hemorrhage is a serious risk associated with Cablivi use, and fatal bleeding can occur. The risk is elevated in patients with underlying coagulopathies or those on concomitant antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. If clinically significant bleeding occurs, treatment should be interrupted. Cablivi should be withheld for 7 days prior to elective surgery, dental procedures, or other invasive interventions.

- **Hemorrhage**: Cablivi increases the risk of bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In clinical studies, severe bleeding adverse reactions such as epistaxis, gingival bleeding, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and metrorrhagia were reported in 1% of subjects. Overall, bleeding events occurred in approximately 58% of patients on Cablivi versus 43% of patients on placebo. In the postmarketing setting, cases of life-threatening and fatal bleeding have been reported in patients receiving Cablivi.

The risk of bleeding is particularly heightened in patients with underlying coagulopathies (e.g. hemophilia, other coagulation factor deficiencies) and with concomitant use of Cablivi with drugs affecting hemostasis and coagulation [see Drug Interactions (7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is advised to avoid concomitant use of Cablivi with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. Treatment with Cablivi should be interrupted if clinically significant bleeding occurs. If needed, von Willebrand factor concentrate may be administered to rapidly correct hemostasis. Should treatment with Cablivi be restarted, patients must be monitored closely for any signs of bleeding.

### Guidance for diagnosis and treatment of DIC from harmonization of the recommendations from three guidelines [^113wFFzA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). High credibility.

Regarding inpatient care for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), more specifically with respect to thromboprophylaxis, the ISTH 2013 guidelines recommend administering prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) with prophylactic doses of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in critically ill, non-bleeding patients with DIC. This recommendation acknowledges the absence of direct evidence on the effects of anticoagulants on DIC.

### New oral anticoagulants and the risk of intracranial hemorrhage: Traditional and Bayesian meta-analysis and mixed treatment comparison of randomized trials of new oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation [^1152kT1b]. JAMA Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Randomized studies have shown a decreased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) with the use of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs); however, it is unclear whether the magnitude of benefit is similar for all NOACs currently available.

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the rates of ICH within the framework of both conventional and Bayesian statistics.

The data sources included the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and EBSCO databases, supplemented with conference abstracts, searched up to December 1, 2012, with no language restriction.

The study selection focused on randomized trials comparing NOACs vs. a comparator and reporting on ICH events.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: The NOACs were pooled to perform a comparison with all comparators and among themselves in both traditional frequentist and Bayesian random-effects models using vague priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation with Gibbs sampling. This allowed the calculation of pooled odds ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals as well as numbers needed to treat and 95% credible intervals for the Bayesian analysis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Intracranial hemorrhage events associated with NOACs in comparison with comparators were expressed as odds ratios.

The results included six studies (1 administering dabigatran etexilate mesylate, 2 administering rivaroxaban, and 3 administering apixaban) enrolling a total of 57,491 patients. The NOACs significantly reduced the risk of ICH against all comparators (odds ratio = 0.49; 95% CI, 0.36–0.65). Each of the three drugs reduced the risk of ICH.

### New oral anticoagulants: Which one should my patient use [^113GEt11]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacologic and clinical features that distinguish them from warfarin.

- **Comparison of pharmacology**: This paper compares the pharmacology of the new oral anticoagulants with that of warfarin.
- **Class effects and differentiating features**: It identifies the class effects of these drugs and their differentiating features.
- **Indications**: The review covers the indications of the new oral anticoagulants.
- **Informed decision-making**: This information aids clinicians in making informed decisions regarding the choice of the right anticoagulant for the right patient.

### Select drug-drug interactions with direct oral anticoagulants: JACC review topic of the week [^111UcWtA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Millions of individuals in the United States require long-term treatment with an oral anticoagulant. For decades, vitamin K antagonists were the only oral option available; however, they have a number of well-known limitations. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has long been considered a major therapeutic advance, largely because they lack the need for therapeutic monitoring. Despite this, DOACs, like vitamin K antagonists, can still cause major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, even when used appropriately. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving the DOACs represent an important contributor to increased bleeding risk. Awareness of these DDIs and how best to address them is of critical importance in optimizing management while mitigating bleeding risk. This review provides an overview of DOAC metabolism, the most common drugs likely to contribute to DOAC DDIs, their underlying mechanisms, and how best to address them.

### Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage may be associated with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in a patient with systemic risk factors [^117KxtEt]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

The authors present a rare case where acute respiratory failure occurred after the intravitreal bevacizumab injection for a branch retinal vein occlusion. Chest CT scan showed ground-glass opacity in the bilateral lung fields. The finding of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed alveolar haemorrhage. Corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of respiratory failure. This report suggests that intravitreal injection of bevacizumab may be associated with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and acute lung injury.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios - is there a general consensus [^114gFXMj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation is key to the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic events. The primary complication of anticoagulation is serious or life-threatening hemorrhage, which may necessitate prompt anticoagulation reversal. This could also be required for nonbleeding patients requiring urgent or emergent invasive procedures. The decision to reverse anticoagulation should weigh the benefit-risk ratio of supporting hemostasis versus post-reversal thrombosis.

We appraise the available guidelines and recommendations for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) reversal in the management of major bleeding, and also assess recent clinical data that may not yet be reflected in official guidance. In general, available guidelines are consistent in their recommendations, advocating administration of vitamin K and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCCs) rather than fresh frozen plasma to patients with VKA-associated intracranial hemorrhage and life-threatening bleeding, and specific reversal agents as essential therapy for DOAC reversal in those same severe conditions.

However, guidelines also recommend off-label use of PCCs for DOAC reversal when specific reversal agents are unavailable. Limited recent evidence generally supports the latter recommendation, but guidelines are likely to evolve as more data become available.

### Direct oral anticoagulant dose selection: Challenging cases [^1165bg7H]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring of their anticoagulant effect based on the results of pivotal phase III trials. In some of these trials, patients were randomly allocated to receive a higher or lower dose of a DOAC, whereas in others, most patients were given a standard dose and only a subset deemed to be at risk of drug accumulation was given a lower dose. Treatment guidelines recommend dosing DOACs according to the way that they were tested in the trials, but for some patients, the optimal dosing remains uncertain. For example, patients with atrial fibrillation who are thought to have an unacceptably high risk of bleeding may not meet the guideline criteria for dose reduction. Similarly, patients with venous thromboembolism who have completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation are eligible for extended treatment with a standard or reduced dose of DOAC. In this review, we present a case-based approach to DOAC dose selection in these two settings.

### Effects of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112kjRN8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

We conducted further analyses to explore substantial heterogeneity in major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage endpoints among atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). Apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran versus warfarin reduced major bleeding (HR: 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69–0.91; P = 0.85 for heterogeneity; I² = 0%) among patients with VHD, whereas rivaroxaban versus warfarin increased major bleeding (HR: 1.56; 95% CI, 1.20–2.04). For patients with VHD, apixaban, edoxaban, and dabigatran versus warfarin reduced intracranial hemorrhage (HR: 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25–0.45; P = 0.63 for heterogeneity; I² = 0%), whereas rivaroxaban versus warfarin did not show a difference in intracranial hemorrhage (HR: 1.27; 95% CI, 0.77–2.10).

- **Effect of different non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants**:
	- Dabigatran and apixaban versus rivaroxaban in atrial fibrillation patients with valvular heart disease for safety endpoints.
	- **Major bleeding**:
		- In patients, apixaban 5 mg was taken twice daily.
		- Edoxaban 60 mg was administered once daily.
		- Dabigatran 150 mg was taken twice daily.
	- **Intracranial hemorrhage**:
		- Patients received rivaroxaban 20 or 15 mg once daily.

ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation), ENGAGE AF (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation), non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), and ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) were included in the study protocols.

### Current strategies for the management of bleeding associated with direct oral anticoagulants and a review of investigational reversal agents [^112WLAQr]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The management of life-threatening bleeding in patients who are receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is a serious medical concern. This review provides a concise, balanced overview of the current and future approaches for reversing the anticoagulant effects of DOACs, particularly factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors.

- **Discussion**: The anticoagulant activity of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran can be reversed by idarucizumab; however, until recently, options for the management of major bleeding in patients receiving FXa inhibitors were limited to nonspecific strategies. These strategies included supplementation of clotting factors with prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or activated PCCs to attenuate anticoagulation effects. These options appear as treatment strategies in many hospital guidelines despite lacking approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and without rigorous medical evidence supporting their use in this setting. The development of specific reversal agents may provide improved strategies for the management of bleeding. Andexanet alfa, a modified FXa molecule, has been approved in the United States to reverse the anticoagulant effects of FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban and apixaban) in patients with life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Ciraparantag is a small-molecule inhibitor of multiple anticoagulants that has been investigated in healthy subjects.

The guidelines for the management of DOAC-associated bleeding are being updated to reflect the availability of a reversal agent for rivaroxaban and apixaban.

### Treatment and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^112bxPYQ]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter on the recognition, treatment, and prevention of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is part of the "Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th edition)". Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient values may lead to different choices.

- **Platelet count monitoring**: For patients receiving heparin, where the clinician considers the risk of HIT to be greater than 1%, we recommend platelet count monitoring over no monitoring (Grade 1C).

- **Investigation for HIT diagnosis**: For patients who are receiving heparin or have received it within the previous two weeks, we recommend investigating for a diagnosis of HIT if the platelet count falls by at least 50%, and/or a thrombotic event occurs between days 5 and 14 following the initiation of heparin, even if the patient is no longer receiving heparin therapy when thrombosis or thrombocytopenia occurs (Grade 1C).

- **Use of alternative anticoagulants**: For patients with strongly suspected (or confirmed) HIT, whether or not complicated by thrombosis, we recommend the use of an alternative, nonheparin anticoagulant such as danaparoid (Grade 1B), lepirudin (Grade 1C), argatroban (Grade 1C), fondaparinux (Grade 2C), or bivalirudin (Grade 2C) over further use of unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or the initiation/continuation of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) (Grade 1B).

The guidelines include specific recommendations for further management steps.

### An unexpected case of recurrence of pulmonary embolism in a patient recovered from COVID-19 in full regimen dose of direct oral anticoagulant drug [^114RzAQ5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Laboratory investigation revealed an increase of high-sensitive troponin (90 ng/L, normal range < 54 ng/L), an elevated D-dimer (3499 ng/ml), an increase in the white blood cell count (26,000), and a normal C-reactive protein (0.2 mg/L). Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates with accentuation of the vascular plot, in the absence of pleural effusion. Arterial blood gas at the time of the onset of dyspnea showed a pH of 7.38, PaCO₂ of 22 mmHg, PaO₂ of 48 mmHg, and bicarbonate of 20 mmol/L. A reservoir at 15 L/min was placed. On 70% FiO₂, arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.44, PaCO₂ of 37.8 mmHg, PaO₂ of 151 mmHg, and bicarbonate of 16 mmol/L.

An ECG showed tachycardia, with a new onset right bundle branch block, S1, and Q3. At the transthoracic echocardiography, right-sided chambers were severely dilated. Due to the sudden clinical deterioration, thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was immediately performed with the suspicion of recurrent pulmonary embolism (rePE). The patient had a rapid beneficial effect with restoration of stable hemodynamic parameters.

- **Figure 1**: Chest X-ray showing bilateral interstitial infiltrates with accentuation of the vascular plot, in the absence of pleural effusion.

After the infusion of tPA, a computed tomography angiogram was performed, which documented a marked defect of endoluminal filling of the right and left pulmonary artery with extension to their main branches, referable to acute pulmonary embolism, more extensive than the previous one. The patient was then admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, and unfractionated heparin (UFH) was started intravenously. During the in-hospital stay, the…

### Amiodarone-induced diffuse alveolar haemorrhage: a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of a commonly prescribed medication [^114pxAHM]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent commonly used in clinical practice. It is associated with many side effects, the most common being pulmonary manifestations. Interstitial pneumonitis is one of the most frequent complications; however, rarely, amiodarone can also cause diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH). We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath and haemoptysis four days after starting amiodarone. She was diagnosed with amiodarone-induced DAH based on imaging and bronchoalveolar lavage. She was treated with intravenous and then oral steroids, and amiodarone was discontinued. The patient made a significant clinical and radiological recovery and was discharged 10 days after her presentation. This case highlights a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of a commonly used medication.

### Renal function and direct oral anticoagulant treatment for venous thromboembolism [^116bkiRK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Because differences in renal function can affect the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants, prescribing an appropriate dose based on renal function is critical, especially in patient populations with a high incidence of renal impairment. In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and mild or moderate renal impairment, direct oral anticoagulants are associated with a better risk-benefit profile compared with warfarin. However, less is known regarding outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism and renal impairment. The efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with venous thromboembolism and renal impairment are primarily derived from prespecified subgroup analyses of the phase 3 clinical trials. We summarize the available data on direct oral anticoagulant use in patients with venous thromboembolism and renal impairment. Clinicians are encouraged to follow study inclusion/exclusion criteria and perform renal dose adjustments based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation using actual body weight when indicated to avoid adverse events.

### Safe and effective anticoagulation use: Case studies in anticoagulation stewardship [^113odKgA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Low credibility.

Anticoagulant use is prevalent and associated with significant potential for harm. Anticoagulation stewardship practice has emerged to address care gaps and promote safe, effective, and cost-conscious anticoagulation use across health care systems.

We present four patient cases describing common challenges in anticoagulation management: inappropriate dosing of direct oral anticoagulants, the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, periprocedural anticoagulation management, and heavy menstrual bleeding on anticoagulation. We discuss available examples of successful stewardship programs that can address the challenges of each case, demonstrating how an investment in anticoagulation stewardship can improve patient outcomes.

### Low-, medium- and high-dose steroids with or without aminocaproic acid in adult hematopoietic SCT patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^116S9UdN]. Bone marrow transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a poorly understood complication of transplantation, carrying a high mortality rate. Patients commonly deteriorate and require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment with high-dose steroids and aminocaproic acid (ACA) has been suggested. The study examined 119 critically ill adult hematopoietic transplant patients treated for DAH. Patients were subdivided into low-, medium-, and high-dose steroid groups, with or without ACA. All groups had similar baseline characteristics and severity of illness scores. The primary objectives were 30, 60, 100-day ICU and hospital mortality. Overall mortality (n = 119) on day 100 was high at 85%.

In the steroids and ACA cohort (n = 82), there were no significant differences in 30, 60, 100-day ICU and hospital mortality between the dosing groups. In the steroids-only cohort (n = 37), the low-dose steroid group had a lower ICU and hospital mortality (P = 0.02). Adjunctive treatment with ACA did not produce differences in outcomes. In the multivariate analysis, medium- and high-dose steroids were associated with a higher ICU mortality (P = 0.01) as compared with the low-dose group. Our data suggest that treatment strategies may need to be reanalyzed to avoid potentially unnecessary and potentially harmful therapies.

### Recommendations for research assessing outcomes for patients with anticoagulant-related intracerebral bleeds [^112Zpykq]. Stroke (2021). Low credibility.

Intracerebral bleeds related to anticoagulant use have a poor prognosis and substantial risk of disability and death. Recent publications evaluating replacement or reversal therapies for anticoagulants lack consistency in controlling for key factors that significantly influence outcomes. In an effort to guide future research by providing a framework to improve consistency and reduce the potential for confounding in this dynamic and highly time-dependent brain insult, we provide here a brief overview of variables we consider critical in studies evaluating the risk and the reversal of anticoagulant therapies in anticoagulant-related intracerebral bleeds.

Hematoma expansion stands out as one of the few potentially modifiable risk factors, and its early control could mitigate secondary brain injury; it, therefore, requires careful categorization. In addition to the baseline demographic, clinical, and radiological predictors of hematoma expansion, we specifically highlight time-dependent factors such as the time from the last dose, time from symptom onset, time to treatment, the computed tomography angiography spot sign, and the limitation of early care as especially critical predictors of outcomes in anticoagulant-related intracerebral bleeds.

Intracerebral hemorrhage is a condition that requires fast diagnosis and treatment, especially when associated with anticoagulants. The advent of therapies with rapid reversal of anticoagulation opens the opportunity to assess the scale to which faster reversal of anticoagulation modifies hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes.

### Practical considerations in emergency management of bleeding in the setting of target-specific oral anticoagulants [^115yJwRc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The recent arrival of the target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs) offers potential advantages in the field of anticoagulation. However, there are no rapid, accurate, and routinely available laboratory assays to evaluate their contribution to clinical bleeding. With the expanding clinical indications for the TSOACs and the arrival of newer reversal agents on the market, the emergency clinician will need to be familiar with drug specifics as well as methods for anticoagulation reversal. This review offers a summary of the literature and some practical strategies for the approach to the patient taking TSOACs and the management of bleeding in these cases.

### Spontaneous epiglottic hematoma secondary to direct oral anticoagulant [^117WXLds]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Spontaneous hemorrhage is a known risk for patients on anticoagulation therapy. Most previous cases of spontaneous airway hemorrhage involve warfarin, and of the few that involved a direct oral anticoagulant, none involved the epiglottis. This case describes a spontaneous epiglottic hematoma in a patient one week after starting a direct oral anticoagulant. An 85-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute onset of neck swelling, odynophagia, and sublingual ecchymosis.

Evaluation in the emergency department included advanced imaging of the neck and consultation with otolaryngology. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy showed a markedly enlarged and ecchymotic epiglottis. The patient received medical management, including rivaroxaban reversal, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, but no airway management was deemed necessary. After close monitoring, the patient was discharged on hospital day two.

Further research and risk profiling could benefit patients and emergency clinicians when considering spontaneous hemorrhage in the airway in patients taking a direct oral anticoagulant.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^112zc5WW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Very limited data exist on the role of NOACs in other hypercoagulable states such as inherited coagulopathies (homozygous factor V Leiden mutation, protein C or S deficiency, elevated levels of factors VII–XII) or the nephrotic syndrome. Individuals with these conditions were significantly underrepresented in the trials. Dabigatran was prescribed to a 21-year-old woman with recurrent venous thromboembolisms (reVTEs) caused by protein C deficiency, complicated by warfarin-induced skin necrosis and an inability to maintain anticoagulation on low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The patient did not experience any VTE recurrence in 6 months of follow-up. Rivaroxaban was prescribed to a 30-year-old woman who had homozygosity of the factor V Leiden mutation and who sustained an ovarian vein thrombosis with proximal extension to the renal vein. The patient remained free of symptoms without recurrence of thrombi or bleeding complications.

Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been used for secondary prophylaxis in a few patients with nephrotic syndrome. Anticoagulation in these patients has been traditionally achieved with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or heparins.

### Is there a role for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic-guided dosing for novel oral anticoagulants [^115zT2yG]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The novel direct oral anticoagulants (NOACs) represent a major advance in oral anticoagulant therapy and are replacing vitamin K antagonists as the preferred options for many indications. Given in fixed doses without routine laboratory monitoring, they have been shown to be at least as effective in reducing thromboembolic stroke as dose-adjusted warfarin in phase 3 randomized trials and less likely to cause hemorrhagic stroke.

Pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic subanalyses of the major NOAC trials in patients with atrial fibrillation have established relationships between clinical characteristics and drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic responses with both efficacy and safety. Based on these analyses, pharmaceutical manufacturers and regulatory authorities have provided contraindications and dosing recommendations based on clinical characteristics that are associated with drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic responses, stroke reduction, and bleeding risk to optimize the risk-benefit profile of the NOACs in the real world.

The fixed-dosing strategy of NOACs has triggered discussions about the potential value of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment in customizing drug exposure to further improve the safety and efficacy of the NOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation. As there is neither high-quality evidence nor consensus about the potential role of laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment for the NOACs, a Cardiac Research Safety Consortium "Think Tank" meeting was held at the American College of Cardiology Heart House in December 2015 to discuss these issues.

### Anticoagulation or inferior vena cava filter placement for patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage developing venous thromboembolism [^113TReZv]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage developing clinically apparent proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) require treatment with either anticoagulants or inferior vena cava filter insertion. Although the latter probably reduces the immediate risk of incident DVT or PE and addresses the undefined risk of re-intracranial bleeding with anticoagulation, it does not prevent further thrombus propagation and poses short- and long-term risks, including a greater incidence of recurrent DVT.

There are no data from randomized trials to clarify the optimum treatment in these patients; indeed, the feasibility of such studies is questionable. Hence, treatment decisions continue to be made on an individualized basis and should include the assimilation of information on key factors such as time elapsed post-stroke and the lobar versus deep hemispheric location of the index event. Natural history studies demonstrate a two-fold risk of re-intracerebral hemorrhage in the former subgroup.

In patients selected for anticoagulation, data from non-stroke patients suggest that a 5- to 10-day course of full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin followed by 3 months of lower-dose low-molecular-weight heparin is at least as effective as warfarin and may be associated with fewer hemorrhagic complications.

### Anticoagulant treatment regimens in patients with Covid-19: A meta-analysis [^112n6B96]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis comprises 10 trials involving over 5,000 patients, comparing higher-dose with prophylactic-dose anticoagulation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

In the overall study population, higher-dose anticoagulation was not associated with lower mortality compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation. This key finding is consistent with existing guidelines, which do not recommend the routine administration of more than prophylactic doses of anticoagulation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Similarly, a recently published meta-analysis including seven trials showed no survival benefit with higher-dose anticoagulation. Our analysis included three additional trials and confirmed previous findings.

- **Venous thromboembolism and bleeding risk**: Higher-dose anticoagulation decreased the risk of venous thromboembolism but increased the risk of major bleeding to a similar extent. These counteracting effects appear to cancel each other out in terms of all-cause death.

Of note, these results apply largely to a population that excluded patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy or those with an increased risk of bleeding. All trials, except for the HESACOVID and XCOVID-19 trials, explicitly excluded patients with a low platelet count (< 50,000 or < 100,000/µL). The net benefit of higher-dose anticoagulation in these relevant groups remains unknown.

- **Summary of outcomes**: Net adverse clinical events are a composite of death, venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding.

### Xarelto [^111cVvde]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Overdosage**: Overdose of Xarelto may lead to hemorrhage. Discontinue Xarelto and initiate appropriate therapy if bleeding complications associated with overdosage occur. Rivaroxaban systemic exposure is not further increased at single doses greater than 50 mg due to limited absorption. The use of activated charcoal to reduce absorption in case of Xarelto overdose may be considered. Due to the high plasma protein binding, rivaroxaban is not dialyzable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Partial reversal of laboratory anticoagulation parameters may be achieved with use of plasma products. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of rivaroxaban is available.

### High neutrophils and low lymphocytes percentages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are prognostic factors of higher in-hospital mortality in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^113hdRd6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The prognostic influence of antithrombotic therapy (AT) on diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the numbers of patients and their etiological diseases in complicated DAH-AT, simple DAH, and DAH-NAT. In-hospital mortality was not significantly different between DAH-AT and DAH-NAT. However, in-hospital mortality was significantly worse in complicated DAH-AT compared to simple DAH-AT. Regarding the BALF cell pattern, the percentage of neutrophils was significantly higher in complicated DAH-AT than in simple DAH-AT.

- **Figure 2**: Etiological diseases of complicated DAH-AT, simple DAH-AT, and DAH-NAT. Complicated DAH-AT refers to DAH that occurred during AT with causes other than AT. Simple DAH-AT refers to DAH that occurred during AT without other causes. DAH-NAT refers to DAH occurring without AT. DAH = diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, AT = antithrombotic therapy.

- **Complication**: An 80-year-old woman experienced a stroke as a complication following the discontinuation of AT. She had been administered aspirin for angina pectoris and warfarin for atrial fibrillation. These medications were discontinued on the day of her admission, and she was diagnosed with an insular cortex stroke 15 days after discontinuation, resulting in higher brain dysfunction, though it was not critical.

### Heparin sodium [^116fk9X6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Heparin sodium should not be used in patients with the following conditions:

- **Severe thrombocytopenia**: This condition contraindicates the use of heparin sodium.
- **Inability to perform suitable blood coagulation tests**: When tests such as whole blood clotting time or partial thromboplastin time cannot be performed at appropriate intervals, full-dose heparin is contraindicated. Note that monitoring coagulation parameters is typically unnecessary for patients receiving low-dose heparin.
- **Uncontrolled active bleeding state**: Heparin sodium should not be used unless the bleeding is due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (see Warnings).

### Emergency care of patients receiving non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^114FEJAq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), have been introduced for several clinical indications. Although NOACs have a favorable benefit-risk profile and can be used without routine laboratory monitoring, they are associated — as with any anticoagulant — with a risk of bleeding.

In addition, treatment may need to be interrupted in patients who need surgery or other procedures. The objective of this article, developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts in thrombosis and haemostasis, is to provide an update on the management of NOAC-treated patients who experience a bleeding episode or require an urgent procedure. Recent advances in the development of targeted reversal agents are expected to help streamline the management of NOAC-treated patients in whom rapid reversal of anticoagulation is required.

### Comparison of fatal or irreversible events with extended-duration betrixaban versus standard dose enoxaparin in acutely ill medical patients: An APEX trial substudy [^111EYxvG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Therapeutic interventions are associated with both efficacy benefits and safety hazards. The net clinical outcome of an intervention can be assessed by combining measures of efficacy and safety. Some events may be transient and reversible, resulting in no permanent harm, which makes them challenging to weigh against each other. One way to ensure that the clinical impact of the efficacy and safety events being compared is similar is to include only those events that are either fatal or result in irreversible cell death or harm to the patient.

The present study is a post hoc analysis of the APEX trial (Acute Medically Ill VTE Prevention With Extended Duration Betrixaban Study), which evaluates net clinical outcomes by comparing a composite of fatal or irreversible efficacy and safety events. Patients are treated with extended-duration betrixaban versus standard dosing enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prevention among acute medically ill hospitalized patients. This article expands on the primary results of APEX, which assessed efficacy and safety endpoints independently. Additionally, the endpoint evaluated in this study includes only symptomatic events and therefore could be assessed in the modified intent‐to‐treat population, as opposed to the primary efficacy outcome population, which was used for the primary results.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^114Q8wix]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition in which a clot can travel from the deep veins, most commonly in the leg, up to the lungs. Previously, pulmonary embolism was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. Recently, however, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors. These new drugs have characteristics that may be favorable over conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect without the need for frequent monitoring or re-dosing, and few known drug interactions. At the time of writing, no Cochrane review has measured the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the long-term treatment (minimum duration of three months) of pulmonary embolism.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors for the long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Vascular Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched January 2015) and the Cochrane Register of Studies (last searched January 2015). Clinical trials databases were also searched for details of ongoing or unpublished studies. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles retrieved by electronic searches for additional citations.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials in which patients with a pulmonary embolism confirmed by standard imaging techniques were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor for the long-term.

### The 2023 WSES guidelines on the management of trauma in elderly and frail patients [^1138kd8Y]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Treatment options for the reversal of warfarin anticoagulation effects include withholding warfarin, administering vitamin K1 (phytomenadione), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). FFP is prepared from whole blood and plasma apheresis donations and contains both pro-coagulant and anticoagulant proteins. It is indicated for coagulation factor replacement in patients with multiple coagulation factor deficiencies, including vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency due to warfarin therapy. Administration of FFP requires ABO blood group compatibility testing, thawing, and infusion. The adverse effects of FFP include allergic reactions, acute lung injury, transmitted diseases, circulatory overload, and thromboembolic events.

PCC is a concentrated vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor product (factors II, VII, IX, and X) derived from large donor pooled plasma that is stored as a lyophilized powder. PCCs are available as 3-factor (3F-PCCs) (factors II, IX, X) or 4-factor (4F-PCCs) (factors II, VII, IX, X) concentrates. Three-factor PCCs have small amounts of natural anticoagulants (protein C and S), but 4F-PCCs have concentrated amounts of protein C and S and small amounts of heparin.

Guidelines suggest that in patients with major or life-threatening VKA-associated bleeding, all anticoagulants must be discontinued, and reversal agents must be administered if available. Major bleeding, as defined by the Control of Anticoagulation Subcommittee, refers to either bleeding with hemodynamic compromise.

### Comparison of different direct oral anticoagulant regimens in atrial fibrillation patients with high bleeding risk [^113KwxPz]. Heart Rhythm (2024). Low credibility.

The optimal dose of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to prevent ischemic stroke (IS) and systemic thromboembolism (STE) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients with a predisposing bleeding risk remains unclear.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of different DOAC dosage regimens in AF patients with high bleeding risk but low thrombosis risk.

- **Methods**: This retrospective observational study was conducted using the National Health Insurance claims database in Taiwan. It included AF patients aged 20 to 75 years, under DOAC therapy, with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 1 for males and 2 for females, and a HAS-BLED score ≥ 3. The standard-dose regimen was defined as dabigatran 300 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg, apixaban 10 mg, or edoxaban 60 mg per day. Any lower-dose regimens were defined as the low-dose regimen. The primary outcomes were IS and major bleeding (MB). The secondary outcomes were STE, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and cardiovascular death.

- **Results**: A total of 964 patients were included (52.1% standard-dose regimen). Median HAS-BLED score was 3 [interquartile range 3–3]. Compared with the standard-dose group, patients in the low-dose group had a significantly increased risk of IS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 5.13; 95% confidence interval 1.37–19.22) and STE (aHR 3.14 [1.05–9.37]) but similar risk of MB (aHR 0.45 [0.12–1.67]). The risks of other hemorrhages and cardiovascular death were similar between the two dose groups.

- **Conclusion**: Among patients with a predominant bleeding risk but relatively low thrombosis risk, the low-dose regimen was associated with a higher risk of ischemic complications without reducing major bleeding incidence compared to the standard-dose regimen.

### Clinical practice guideline: Nosebleed (epistaxis) [^114zvTFN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for epistaxis, particularly in patients on anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, the AAO-HNSF 2020 guidelines recommend initiating first-line treatments before considering transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications in the absence of life-threatening bleeding.

### Management of haemarthrosis in patients on oral anticoagulants [^114ui6Qn]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

Use of oral anticoagulation therapy continues to increase. Anticoagulants are crucial in both the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolic complications. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which inhibit thrombin or activated factor X, are licensed for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, treatment of venous thromboembolism, and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following orthopaedic surgery.

The incidence of haemarthrosis associated with warfarin and NOACs ranges from 0 to 1.5% of patients. The incidence is low, but as the use of NOACs and warfarin continues to rise, it is likely to increase in the future.

Management of haemarthrosis in this patient group is challenging. Several questions confront the clinician: when should the anticoagulants be held? What is the role of joint aspiration? What adjunctive therapies are available? The literature available to guide practice is limited to case reports and small case series. According to recommendations, a single episode of acute haemarthrosis associated with oral anticoagulants should be managed by rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) principles, temporary cessation of anticoagulation where possible, and potential aspiration of the joint.

Our aim was to investigate the approach to these patients in the orthopaedic department at a central London District General Hospital over four years and highlight the outcomes of different management strategies.

### Intraocular bleeding in patients managed with novel oral anticoagulation and traditional anticoagulation: A network meta-analysis and systematic review [^1139UiTG]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

To clarify the nature of the relationship between novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and traditional anticoagulation with respect to intraocular bleeding, a comprehensive literature search was conducted up to October 2017, yielding 12 randomized controlled trials. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis was employed to investigate the relationship across multiple trials with varying NOACs. Random effects (informative priors) odds ratios were applied for the risk of intraocular bleeding due to various treatment measures. Mantel-Haenszel pairwise analyses were also performed. In total, 102,617 participants from 12 different randomized controlled trials were included: 11,746 received apixaban, 16,074 received dabigatran, 18,132 received edoxaban, 11,893 received rivaroxaban, and 44,764 received warfarin.

Edoxaban was significantly associated with a reduced risk of intraocular bleeding in comparison to warfarin (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.98). All other findings were non-significant; however, apixaban was the only NOAC to trend with an increased event rate against warfarin. The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo modelling indicated that edoxaban had the greatest chance of producing the lowest rate of bleeding (surface under the cumulative ranking curve 0.8642). Pooled pairwise analysis supported the network analysis results favoring edoxaban against warfarin (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.90; p = 0.02), as well as subgroup analysis of low-dose edoxaban versus warfarin (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.78).

The analysis suggests that edoxaban may be the paramount agent in reducing intraocular bleeding risk compared to other anticoagulants studied.

### An unexpected case of recurrence of pulmonary embolism in a patient recovered from COVID-19 in full regimen dose of direct oral anticoagulant drug [^11139J91]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused by COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting all countries worldwide. Bergamo, Italy, has been particularly afflicted by this pandemic, earning the record of the city with the highest mortality rate globally. Fortunately, the peak phase has passed, and we are almost back to normality. While it is reassuring that new cases are decreasing and patient recoveries are clearly increasing, it is concerning to witness unexpected medium-term complications.

### Dabigatran bleed risk with closed head injuries: Are we prepared [^111UXFpb]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran has recently been approved in the US as an alternative to warfarin. The lack of guidelines, protocols, and an established specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran potentially increases the rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with closed head injury (CHI). Confronted with this new problem, the authors reviewed their initial clinical experience.

- **Methods**: The authors retrospectively reviewed all cases of adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) who sustained CHI secondary to ground-level falls and presented to the authors' provisional regional Level I trauma center between February 2011 and May 2011. The authors divided these patients into three groups based on anticoagulant therapy: dabigatran, warfarin, and no anticoagulants.

- **Results**: Between February 2011 and May 2011, CHIs from ground-level falls were sustained by five patients while on dabigatran, by 15 patients on warfarin, and by 25 patients who were not on anticoagulants. The treatment of the patients on dabigatran at the authors' institution had great diversity. Repeat CT scans obtained during reversal showed four of five patients with new or expanded hemorrhages in the dabigatran group, whereas the warfarin group had three of 15 (p = 0.03). The overall mortality rate for patients sustaining CHI on dabigatran was two (40%) of five, whereas that of the warfarin group was 0 (0%) of 15 (p = 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: It is critical for physicians involved in the care of patients with CHI on dabigatran to be aware of an elevated mortality rate if no treatment protocol is established.

### Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with oral anticoagulants: Population based retrospective cohort study [^1155UGPj]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the insights that these trials provide, the real-world safety of these novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin from limited observational studies is less clear. Such safety may diverge from the trial results for several reasons, including trials' selective inclusion criteria as well as the limited duration of these investigations. Information on findings related to gastrointestinal safety will allow clinicians to weigh the risks and benefits of these agents. Gastrointestinal bleeding carries substantial morbidity and mortality. In the United States in 2009, an estimated 140,000 or more hospital admissions had the principal diagnoses of gastrointestinal bleeding and their aggregate costs reached $1.15 billion (£0.77 billion; €1.06 billion). The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the United Kingdom was 103 cases per 100,000 adults per year. Among patients admitted to hospital with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the United Kingdom in 2007, the overall mortality rate was 10%. Among UK patients with atrial fibrillation with warfarin-induced gastrointestinal bleeding, 6% of such bleeds are fatal.

Post-marketing reports have noted instances of major bleeding associated with dabigatran among older patients, those at the extremes of body weight, and those with impaired renal function. Such patients have been largely excluded from the trials. Approximately 25% of the bleeding events in post-marketing reports were associated with prescribing and dosing errors. The concomitant use of antiplatelet drugs with dabigatran increases the risk of bleeding. The proportion of patients taking these medications who experience bleeding is significant and warrants careful consideration by healthcare providers.

### What we have learned about direct oral anticoagulant reversal [^116BxmED]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

Bleeding is the main complication of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, with major bleeds occurring in about 2% to 4% of OAC-treated patients per year. Although direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) reduce the risk of major, fatal, and intracranial hemorrhage, major DOAC-related bleeding is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, with case-fatality rates of 8% to 15% reported. Specific reversal agents for dabigatran (idarucizumab) and factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet) correct laboratory indices of anticoagulant effect. Clinical studies suggest that the majority of patients receiving these agents for DOAC-associated major bleeds experience clinical hemostasis. However, uncertainty remains regarding the incremental benefit of these agents and prothrombin complex concentrates over supportive measures alone, based on cohort studies that lacked control groups. Similar methodological limitations preclude firm conclusions regarding the harms associated with the use of these agents. Importantly, patients with DOAC-related major bleeding have substantial short-term risks of thrombosis and mortality, emphasizing the need for individualized patient assessment and protocolized bleed management strategies that include assessment of candidacy for safe resumption of OACs. With expanding indications and increasing prevalence of DOAC-eligible patients, bleeding complications and their management represent an ever-greater major health problem.

### High neutrophils and low lymphocytes percentages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are prognostic factors of higher in-hospital mortality in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^111kFXtU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). High credibility.

During the study period, 147 patients were suspected of having diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). However, 79 patients were excluded for the following reasons: bronchoscopy was not performed (n = 59), hemorrhage from a bronchial origin was responsible for the symptoms (n = 3), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) findings were not compatible with DAH (n = 2), and the data of the BALF cell pattern were not obtained (n = 15). Consequently, 68 patients were included in our analysis. The patients' backgrounds are as follows: the median age was 75 years (interquartile range 72–80), and 49 patients (72%) were male. Forty-eight patients (71%) were receiving antithrombotic therapy (AT); 7 (10%) received antiplatelet therapy alone, 23 (34%) received anticoagulant therapy alone, and 18 (26%) received both antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies.

The etiological diseases of DAH were immune disease (8.8%), infection (13%), drug-induced pneumonitis (5.9%), heart failure (4.4%), other diseases (13%), and idiopathic causes (54%). No variable was significantly different between the survival and death groups. The clinical characteristics of patients on admission included that 47 patients (69%) received invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and 56 patients (82%) were administered corticosteroids. Neutrophils, lymphocytes percentages in BALF, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were significantly different between the survival and death groups.

### Assessing bleeding risk in patients with intentional overdoses of novel antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications [^1172kUAD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

In recent years, the use of novel anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents has become widespread. Little is known about the toxicity and bleeding risk of these agents after acute overdose. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the relative risk of all bleeding and major bleeding in patients with an acute overdose of novel antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study examines acute ingestion of apixaban, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, dabigatran, edoxaban, prasugrel, rivaroxaban, and ticagrelor reported to seven poison control centers across four states over a 10-year span. The prevalence of bleeding for each agent was calculated, with hemorrhage classified as trivial, minor, or major.

- **Results**: A total of 322 acute overdoses were identified, with the majority of cases involving clopidogrel (260; 80.7%). Hemorrhage occurred in 16 cases (4.9%), including seven cases of clopidogrel, six cases of rivaroxaban, two cases of dabigatran, and one case of apixaban. Most cases of hemorrhage were classified as major (n = 9). Comparing the novel anticoagulants with the P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, the relative risk for any bleeding with a novel anticoagulant was 6.68 (95% confidence interval 2.63 to 17.1); the relative risk of major bleeding was 18.1 (95% confidence interval 3.85 to 85.0).

- **Conclusion**: Acute overdose of novel anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents is associated with a small risk of significant hemorrhage. The risk is greater with the factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors than with the P2Y12 receptor antagonists.

### Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage [^111xtKau]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is often a catastrophic clinical syndrome causing respiratory failure. Recognition of DAH often requires bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as symptoms are nonspecific; hemoptysis is absent in up to one-third of patients, and radiographic imaging is also nonspecific and similar to other acute alveolar filling processes. Once the diagnosis is established, the underlying cause must be determined in order to initiate treatment. This review discusses the diagnosis of the underlying histologies and the clinical entities responsible for DAH, as well as treatment options.

### A three-year prospective study of the presentation and clinical outcomes of major bleeding episodes associated with oral anticoagulant use in the UK (ORANGE study) [^11292h97]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The outcomes of patients developing major bleeding while on oral anticoagulants remain largely unquantified. This study aimed to describe the burden of major hemorrhage associated with all available oral anticoagulants in terms of the proportion of bleeds that are intracranial hemorrhages, in-hospital mortality, and duration of hospitalization following major bleeding. Additionally, it aimed to identify risk factors for mortality and compare the characteristics of major hemorrhage between cases treated with warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants for subgroups of patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism.

This was a multicenter, three-year prospective cohort study of patients aged ≥ 18 years on oral anticoagulants who developed major hemorrhage leading to hospitalization. Patients were followed up for 30 days or until discharge or death, whichever occurred first. In total, 2,192 patients (47% female, 81% on warfarin, median age 80 years) were reported between October 2013 and August 2016 from 32 hospitals in the UK. Bleeding sites were intracranial (44%), gastrointestinal (33%), and other (24%). The in-hospital mortality was 21% (95% CI: 19%-23%) overall, and 33% (95% CI: 30%-36%) for patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Intracranial hemorrhage, advanced age, spontaneous bleeding, liver failure, and cancer were risk factors for death. Compared to warfarin-treated patients, those treated with direct oral anticoagulants were older and had lower odds of subdural/epidural, subarachnoid, and intracerebral bleeding.
