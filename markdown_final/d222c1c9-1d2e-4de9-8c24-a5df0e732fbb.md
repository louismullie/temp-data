## Question

Can a patient be on an alph blocker and articholenergic at same time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a patient can be on an alpha-blocker and an anticholinergic at the same time, and how to approach that safely. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic rationale and whether the mechanisms conflict. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about combination therapy. Next, I will review randomized trials and meta-analyses for efficacy and safety signals, especially urinary retention and post-void residual changes. After that, I need to check special populations and precautions, including older adults, baseline retention risk, and neurogenic bladder. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise prescribing and monitoring plan with alternatives if anticholinergics are contraindicated or poorly tolerated.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale. Alpha-1 blockers reduce outlet resistance at the prostate/bladder neck, improving voiding, while antimuscarinics suppress detrusor overactivity, improving storage symptoms. Mechanistically, they target different pathways and can be complementary rather than antagonistic, which supports cautious combination use in appropriately selected patients [^11475k8g] [^1123Gdyw].

> Next, I should review guideline positions. The AUA BPH guideline amendment advises that anticholinergics may be offered alone or with an alpha-blocker for moderate to severe predominant storage LUTS, as a conditional recommendation with Grade C evidence, and it notes mixed symptom benefits and variable adverse events across trials, which means shared decision-making is essential [^114JU6PB] [^114SzRZh]. The AUA/SUFU OAB guideline similarly supports offering combination therapy with an alpha-blocker plus an antimuscarinic or beta-3 agonist in men with BPH and OAB, again as a conditional recommendation, reinforcing that this is an accepted strategy in selected patients [^114a4iU1] [^112K6FiQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the magnitude and consistency of benefit from trials. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews show modest but real improvements in storage symptoms and quality of life when antimuscarinics are added to alpha-blockers, with small mean differences in IPSS and reductions in frequency/urgency, though some analyses judge the overall symptom score benefits as small or uncertain, reflecting heterogeneity and short follow-up durations [^117Tf6W9] [^1135ZsZr] [^1168toB2]. Specific trials, such as solifenacin plus tamsulosin, demonstrate improvements in storage subscores and quality of life, albeit with higher adverse events in some studies, which aligns with the guideline's cautionary stance [^115NGbZy] [^1172iung].

> I need to ensure I weigh safety carefully. The most critical risk is acute urinary retention; pooled analyses suggest a low absolute risk, with estimates around 1% over 12 weeks in selected men with baseline PVR under 200 mL, and a number needed to harm for retention near 100 in some datasets, though one meta-analysis reported a higher relative risk signal, underscoring the need for careful selection and monitoring [^1135ZsZr] [^1168toB2] [^115NGbZy]. Anticholinergics also increase dry mouth and constipation, and combination therapy may slightly increase adverse events versus placebo, while alpha-blockers carry orthostatic hypotension and fall risk, particularly at initiation, so counseling and dose timing matter [^117Tf6W9] [^1168toB2] [^114vMZ5Q].

> Let me consider special populations and precautions. In older adults, I should confirm baseline PVR and avoid anticholinergics if PVR is high or if there is significant cognitive impairment, given associations between anticholinergic burden and dementia risk. If anticholinergics are used, prefer agents with lower CNS penetration and use the lowest effective dose with close follow-up [^1128oxah] [^115ejF6e] [^111h2734]. For patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, expert guidance supports considering alpha-blockers with anticholinergics to improve capacity and compliance, but again, careful selection and monitoring are required [^116RVmoP]. In men with acute urinary retention managed with catheterization, I should remember to initiate or resume alpha-blockers for at least 3 days before a voiding trial to optimize success and reduce recurrence risk [^111o98K1].

> I should double-check baseline risk factors before combining. A practical threshold is to avoid adding an antimuscarinic if PVR exceeds roughly 200 mL or if there is clinical suspicion of poor detrusor contractility. If PVR is borderline, I can start low, reassess early, and stop if retention emerges, consistent with trial populations and expert reviews [^113MsBgZ] [^117JtjED]. Wait, let me verify the monitoring cadence. Guidelines advise reassessment 4–12 weeks after initiation, with IPSS, QoL, and PVR to track response and safety, which fits well with the early risk window for retention and adverse effects [^112biMaF].

> Now, I will outline a stepwise approach. First, optimize alpha-blocker monotherapy and document baseline IPSS, QoL, and PVR. Second, if storage symptoms persist and PVR is under 200 mL, add a low-dose antimuscarinic such as solifenacin 5 mg or tolterodine 4 mg, counsel on dry mouth and constipation mitigation, and arrange follow-up in 4–6 weeks. Third, at follow-up, reassess IPSS, QoL, and PVR, and discontinue the antimuscarinic if PVR rises substantially or if retention occurs, adjusting the plan accordingly [^112biMaF] [^114SzRZh] [^115NGbZy]. If anticholinergics are contraindicated or not tolerated, I should consider a beta-3 agonist such as mirabegron, which has comparable efficacy to antimuscarinics when combined with alpha-blockers and may have a more favorable safety profile in some patients, though shared decision-making remains key [^111cSb49] [^114a4iU1].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on multiple anticholinergics or has high anticholinergic burden from other medications? I need to check for additive anticholinergic effects and cognitive risk, and if possible, deprescribe nonessential anticholinergics before layering a bladder antimuscarinic, to reduce overall burden and adverse effects [^111FxrCt] [^111z6zFY]. I should also screen for narrow-angle glaucoma, impaired gastric emptying, and prior urinary retention before initiating antimuscarinics, and document informed consent regarding retention risk and cognitive concerns in older adults [^1115Uu3s] [^1128oxah].

> In summary, yes, a patient can be on an alpha-blocker and an anticholinergic concurrently when storage symptoms persist despite alpha-blocker therapy, baseline PVR is not high, and there are no contraindications. The combination is guideline-supported with conditional recommendations, offers modest improvements in storage symptoms and quality of life, and carries a low but real risk of urinary retention that can be mitigated by careful selection, low starting doses, and early follow-up with symptom scores and PVR measurement [^114JU6PB] [^114a4iU1] [^1135ZsZr] [^112biMaF].

Yes, **alpha-blockers and anticholinergics can be combined** for patients with mixed storage and voiding LUTS, but use caution in older adults and those with high post-void residual or cognitive risk. The combination is guideline-supported [^114JU6PB] and improves storage symptoms with a low risk of urinary retention when PVR is < 200 mL [^117JtjED]; monitor for dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, and cognitive effects, and reassess at 4–12 weeks [^112biMaF].

---

## Clinical rationale for combination therapy

Alpha-blockers relax smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, improving flow and reducing voiding symptoms [^113GrsQA]; anticholinergics suppress detrusor overactivity, reducing frequency, urgency, and incontinence [^112qdqSw]. Together, they target both **obstructive and storage symptoms** for a more complete symptom response [^1123Gdyw].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show that adding an **anticholinergic** to an **alpha-blocker** improves storage symptoms and quality of life with minimal impact on flow or retention [^1135ZsZr]. A meta-analysis of 7 trials found significant improvements in storage subscores and frequency versus alpha-blocker alone, with a small increase in PVR and a **low retention risk (NNH ~101)** [^1135ZsZr]. AUA guidance supports offering anticholinergics with alpha-blockers for moderate-to-severe storage LUTS, with conditional recommendations and Grade C evidence [^114JU6PB] [^1155szG2].

---

## Potential benefits of combination therapy

- **Improved storage symptoms**: Reduced frequency, urgency, and incontinence versus alpha-blocker alone [^1123Gdyw].
- **Enhanced quality of life**: Greater QoL improvements with combination therapy [^1172iung].
- **Minimal impact on voiding**: Little effect on Qmax or PVR in appropriately selected patients [^1135ZsZr].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Urinary retention**: Risk is low but higher than alpha-blocker alone; avoid if PVR > 200 mL [^1135ZsZr] [^117JtjED].
- **Anticholinergic side effects**: Dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, cognitive effects, especially in older adults [^111z6zFY].
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Dizziness and falls, particularly with nonselective alpha-blockers [^114vMZ5Q].

---

## Patient selection criteria

- **Moderate-to-severe storage symptoms**: Persistent urgency, frequency, or incontinence despite alpha-blocker therapy [^113MsBgZ].
- **Low post-void residual**: PVR < 200 mL to minimize retention risk [^117JtjED].
- **Absence of cognitive impairment**: Use caution in older adults due to cognitive risks [^1128oxah].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Initial follow-up**: 4–12 weeks after starting combination therapy to assess efficacy and adverse effects [^112biMaF].
- **Assessment tools**: IPSS, PVR measurement, and patient-reported outcomes [^112biMaF].
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Regular reassessment of symptoms, adverse effects, and PVR [^112biMaF].

---

## Alternative pharmacological options

Beta-3 agonists (e.g. mirabegron) can be used with alpha-blockers for storage symptoms and may have fewer cognitive effects than anticholinergics [^111h2734] [^117Xbbp5]. For prostates > 30 g, a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor plus alpha-blocker reduces progression and retention risk [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

AUA recommends anticholinergics with alpha-blockers for moderate-to-severe storage LUTS, with conditional recommendations and Grade C evidence [^114JU6PB] [^1155szG2]. EAU supports combination therapy for persistent storage symptoms after alpha-blocker therapy, with attention to PVR and cognitive risk [^114ddgfD] [^1128oxah].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Evidence supporting combination therapy** |
|-|-|
| Storage symptom improvement | Strong (multiple RCTs, meta-analyses) [^1135ZsZr] |
| Quality of life improvement | Moderate (RCTs, meta-analyses) [^1172iung] |
| Urinary retention risk | Low (NNH ~101) [^1135ZsZr] |
| Anticholinergic side effects | Moderate (RCTs, observational studies) [^111z6zFY] |
| Orthostatic hypotension | Moderate (RCTs, observational studies) [^114vMZ5Q] |

---

Alpha-blockers and anticholinergics can be combined for mixed storage/voiding LUTS, with the best results in patients with low PVR and no cognitive risk; monitor closely for retention and anticholinergic effects, and consider beta-3 agonists or 5-ARI combinations when appropriate [^114JU6PB] [^116wxP7R].

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment — goals, medications, and procedural indications/classification are outlined as follows: Traditionally, the primary goal of treatment has been to alleviate bothersome LUTS that result from BPO, and more recently treatment has also focused on the prevention of disease progression and complications such as AUR; pharmacologic classes used to treat LUTS/BPH include alpha-adrenergic antagonists (alpha blockers), 5-ARIs, PDE5, and anticholinergics, which may be utilized alone or in combination to take advantage of their different mechanisms of action, and an additional class of agent that may be considered in combination with alpha blockers is beta-3 agonists; there exist clinical scenarios in which conservative or pharmacological management are either inadequate or inappropriate and long-term use of medications for LUTS/BPH have been implicated in cognitive issues and depression, and these situations merit consideration of one of the many invasive procedures available for the treatment of LUTS/BPH; indications include a desire by the patient to avoid taking a daily medication, failure of medical therapy to sufficiently ameliorate bothersome LUTS, intolerance to pharmaceutical side effects, and conditions for which medical therapy is insufficient such as acute and/or chronic renal insufficiency, refractory urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, recurrent bladder stones, and recalcitrant gross hematuria; acute and chronic adverse events associated with each class of medical therapy can include cardiovascular and sexual effects; surgical treatment of symptomatic BPH may be classified into three general types: 1. MIST; 2. Simple prostatectomy; and 3. Transurethral surgery, with transurethral surgery involving removal of the obstructing adenomatous tissue via the transurethral route, classically with monopolar electrocautery TURP, and alternatives developed including bipolar TURP and various laser-based therapies to achieve similar clinical efficacy while reducing the risks of perioperative bleeding and short- and long-term complications; in appropriate patients for whom the physical size of the prostate cannot be addressed due to the expertise of the surgeon via a safe or efficacious transurethral approach, simple prostatectomy (i.e., adenoma enucleation) may be considered.

### Beta2-agonist and anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of lung disease [^113oWM5Y]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2005). Low credibility.

The lungs are innervated by both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which entails the activation of adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, respectively. Both the adrenergic and muscarinic receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, and they share many similar signal transduction molecules. These receptors are widely expressed in the lung and the specific receptor expression can vary among the species. The location and the subtype of receptor expressed are important in the regulation of normal airway function. Acetylcholine released from the parasympathetic fibers activates the M3 muscarinic receptors located on the airway smooth muscle, causing bronchoconstriction. To counter this activity, M2 muscarinic receptors located on the parasympathetic nerves inhibit release of acetylcholine. Beta2-adrenergic receptors are expressed on the airway smooth muscle where activation causes bronchodilation. Adrenergic receptors are also on the autonomic nerves where they can modulate neurotransmitter release. The crosstalk between these G-protein-coupled receptors and downstream pathways ensures normal airway function. The prejunctional and postjunctional muscarinic and adrenergic receptors control autonomic tone and any imbalance or selective blockade of the receptors can compromise the system and cause the airways to become hyperreactive. The location, function, and crosstalk of the adrenergic and muscarinic receptors must be considered in the design, development, and use of drugs to combat airway diseases.

### Systematic review of combination drug therapy for non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms [^117JtjED]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Several drugs are approved for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men, but these are mostly used by clinicians as monotherapies. The combination of different compounds, each of which targets a different aspect of LUTS, seems appealing. However, only few clinical trials have evaluated the effects of combination therapies.

Objective

This systematic review analyzes the efficacy and adverse events of combination therapies for male LUTS.

Evidence Acquisition

PubMed and Cochrane databases were used to identify clinical trials and meta-analyses on male LUTS combination therapy. The search was restricted to studies of level of evidence ≥ 1b. A total of 49 papers published between January 1988 and March 2012 were identified.

Evidence Synthesis

The α1-adrenoceptor antagonist (α1-blocker)/5α-reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) combination provides the most data. This combination seems to be more efficacious in terms of several outcome variables in patients whose prostate volume is between 30 mL and 40 mL when treatment is maintained for > 1 yr; when given for < 1 yr, α1-blockers alone are just as effective. The combination of α1-blocker/5-ARI shows a slightly increased rate of adverse events. It remains unknown whether its safety and superiority over either drug as monotherapy are sustained after > 6 yr. The α1-blocker/muscarinic receptor antagonist (antimuscarinic) combination was most frequently assessed as an add-on therapy to already existing α1-blocker therapy. Inconsistent data derive from heterogeneous study populations and different study designs. Currently, the α1-blocker/antimuscarinic combination appears to be a second-line add-on for patients with insufficient symptom relief after monotherapy. The combination seems to be safe in men with postvoid residual < 200 ml. However, there are no trials > 4 mo concerning safety and efficacy of this combination. The α1-blocker/phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor combination is a new treatment option with only preliminary reports. More studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

Conclusions

An α1-blocker/5-ARI combination is beneficial for patients whose prostate volume is between 30 mL and 40 mL when medical treatment is intended for > 1 yr. Based on short-term follow-up studies, add-on of antimuscarinics to α1-blockers is an option when postvoid residual is < 200 ml.

### The efficacy of mirabegron additional therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms after treatment with α ₁-adrenergic receptor blocker monotherapy: prospective analysis of elderly men [^116Qf3fx]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as a condition with characteristic symptoms of urinary urgency that is usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency incontinence. It is particularly burdensome to older people because of its higher prevalence, and because the impact of its symptoms may be more pronounced due to the increased burden of chronic comorbidities. The symptoms caused by OAB decrease patients' quality of life (QOL), and OAB can lead to various pathological conditions such as increases in the fracture rate, sleep disturbances, and depressive feelings). Anti-muscarinic agents are often used as first-line therapy for patients with OAB. However, unfortunately, about a third quarter of patients cannot continue taking these drugs due to unsatisfactory efficacy and various adverse events.

In addition, mainly due to the adverse effects of anti-muscarinic drugs, Japanese clinical guidelines for both male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia recommend physicians to use α1-adrenergic blockers as the first choice drug for male LUTS patients regardless of the presence or absence of OAB symptoms.

Regarding medical management for overactive bladder, more specifically with respect to anticholinergics and beta-3 agonists, indications, EAU/EAUN 2025 guidelines recommend to consider increasing the dose, switching to an alternative anticholinergic formulation, or offering mirabegron (alone or in combination with an anticholinergic) if anticholinergic therapy is ineffective.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^113WWJKe]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

ESC Guidelines — alpha-agonist vasoconstrictors for reflex syncope show mixed evidence: etilefrine showed no difference versus placebo in acute tilt and during follow-up with 25 mg twice daily, while a single dose of midodrine 1 h before tilt testing significantly reduced syncope during tilt; midodrine has been tested in three small open label randomized trials in patients with very frequent 'hypotensive' symptoms (> 1 syncope/month), but frequent dosing limits long-term compliance and caution is needed in older males due to urinary outflow effects; overall, chronic treatment with α-agonists alone may be of little use and long-term treatment cannot be advised for occasional symptoms, though a self-administered single dose 'pill-in the pocket' strategy at least 1 h before a typical trigger may be useful in selected patients.

### Increased risk of incident dementia following use of anticholinergic agents: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^111h2734]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Medium credibility.

Cumulative exposure modified the increased risk presented by anticholinergics in the current analysis, with greater increases at higher exposure categories. The strength of anticholinergic activity, which could not be assessed in our analysis, has been found to play a role in the risk of negative effects on cognition. 29, 33, 34 One study estimated the adjusted hazard ratio for incident dementia in patients with a total ACB score ≥ 3 versus < 3 to be as high as 4.18 (95% CI: 1.43–12.21). 34 This is particularly relevant to certain populations, such as OAB, as anticholinergic medications for treating OAB (e.g. tolterodine, oxybutynin, darifenacin, fesoterodine, and solifenacin) have the highest anticholinergic burden score. 8, 29 Further, when compared to β‐3 agonists — a nonantimuscarinic OAB treatment — anticholinergic medications increased the risk of incident dementia (HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.12–1.35). 35 It is not yet established whether the use of anticholinergic agents is a reversible risk factor for cognitive impairment or dementia, particularly with regard to specific patient segments and duration of exposure or strength of anticholinergic activity.

Beyond dementia, anticholinergic agents may pose additional risks. In retrospective studies, high anticholinergic exposure was associated with a 40% 36, 37 or a 31% 36, 37 increased risk of falls or fractures and a 36% increased rate of all‐cause mortality, 36, 37 potentially leading to increased healthcare resource use. 38, 39 Anticholinergic agents can also cause delirium, constipation, and urinary retention. 39 Despite these risks, the prescribing of anticholinergics remains high. Estimates suggest that in older adults, the prevalence of anticholinergic use ranges from 9% to 56%, depending on the anticholinergic scale used. 38, 40, 41, 42 Gray et al. 13 reported an increased risk of incident dementia across all anticholinergic agents, noting that bladder antimuscarinics represented 10.5% of all TSDDs, the third‐highest following antidepressants (63.1%) and antihistamines (17.2%). 13

### Risks associated with continuation of potentially inappropriate antihypertensive medications in older adults receiving hemodialysis [^116CnvEX]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a nationally representative cohort of older adults initiating hemodialysis, we found antihypertensive PIM claims were present in 19% prior to dialysis initiation. In a sub-cohort of older adults who had an active antihypertensive PIM at the time of dialysis initiation and survived 120 days after dialysis initiation, the majority (65%) continued an antihypertensive PIM after dialysis initiation. While those who continued had fewer comorbidities and were less likely to have functional impairment than those who discontinued, adjusted analyses did not demonstrate clear evidence of an association of continuing PIMs with risk of hospitalization or mortality. Although not definitive, these findings suggest that central alpha agonists and alpha blockers are not PIMs to prioritize for deprescribing in older adults receiving hemodialysis.

Our findings on antihypertensive PIM use are consistent with prior evidence, demonstrating approximately 1 in 5 older adults had antihypertensive PIMs before dialysis initiation, and this proportion declined after dialysis initiation. There is minimal evidence on the efficacy of central alpha agonists and alpha blockers for hypertension in advanced chronic kidney disease and dialysis patients yet these medications are likely added for patients having difficult to control hypertension while taking multiple antihypertensive medications. Over time after dialysis initiation, there was a lower point prevalence of both central alpha agonists and alpha blockers. This finding could be explained by: (1) cohort effects (i.e. death events, modality switch, or hospice) or (2) improved blood pressure control and serum potassium levels after dialysis initiation allowing use of only other antihypertensives, such as beta blockers and renin angiotensin system medications, which are more commonly prescribed in dialysis patients and for which clinical trials support their use. Our outcome analyses do not suggest antihypertensive PIMs increase risk of hospitalization or mortality, but there may still be adverse outcomes associated with prescribing PIMs in older adults receiving dialysis. It remains that antihypertensive PIMs may increase risk of falls, cognitive impairment, or patient reported outcomes, such as fatigue and dizziness, which also should be considered in prescribing decisions. There are additional AGS Beers Criteria PIMs, such as anticholinergic antidepressants, that may individually (or in combination with antihypertensive PIMs) associate with hospitalization and mortality. Therefore, the pursuit to identify specific PIMs that are modifiable risk factors for poor prognosis in older adults receiving dialysis remains needed. Because physical well-being is highly valued by dialysis patients, additional studies are needed to determine an association between antihypertensive PIMs and risk of frailty and/or functional impairment. Such evidence would substantiate clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of deprescribing on clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population.

### Anticholinergic drugs in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and lower urinary tract symptoms: a systematic review [^1158KVPk]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the available evidence concerning the use of anticholinergic drugs, alone or in combination with alpha-blockers, in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and concomitant overactive bladder syndrome, to assess whether the currently available evidence suggests a role for antimuscarinic drugs in patients with BPH.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature was performed using Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science through a complex search strategy including "free text" and "MeSH" protocols. Moreover, the Cochrane database of systematic review was browsed for records regarding BPH and the abstract books of the American Urological Association, European Association of Urology, and International Continence Society annual meetings from 2000 to 2005 were hand-searched for studies concerning the topic of the review.

Results

From the literature search, we identified four randomised controlled trials (RCTs), two prospective case series, and a few congress abstracts. For methodologic issues, the best RCT was based on urodynamic data, but did not provide any clinical insight on the patients' symptoms. The other papers were affected by significant methodologic or clinical drawbacks.

Conclusion

The available data may be considered promising in terms of safety and efficacy. The evidence of the limited number of RCTs available, considering their methodologic or clinical shortcomings, is not sufficient to support the clinical use of combination therapy with alpha-blockers and anticholinergic drugs in patients with associated storage and voiding symptoms. Well-designed, large, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term RCTs are needed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of antimuscarinic drugs, alone or in combination with alpha-blockers, in this category of patients.

### Combination treatment with an α-blocker plus an anticholinergic for bladder outlet obstruction: a prospective, randomized, controlled study [^112uYTCz]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluate the effect of tolterodine combined with tamsulosin on quality of life in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and concomitant detrusor instability.

Materials and Methods

The study included 50 consecutive patients with urodynamically proven mild or moderate bladder outlet obstruction and concomitant detrusor instability. All patients were initially treated with 0.4 mg. tamsulosin orally once a day. A week later the patients were randomly allocated into group 1–25 who continued treatment with tamsulosin only and, group 2–25 who also received 2 mg. tolterodine orally twice daily. Reevaluation with a quality of life questionnaire and urodynamic study was performed after 3 months.

Results

Two patients from group 2 stopped tolterodine while 1 patient from each group stopped tamsulosin because of hypotension. Analysis revealed statistically significant improvement in quality of life scores only in group 2 patients (mean score 525.0 and 628.4 before and after treatment, respectively, 2-sided t test p = 0.0003). A significant difference was noted in both groups after treatment for maximum flow rate and volume at first contraction. Additionally, in group 2, a statistically significant difference was observed for maximum detrusor pressure and maximum unstable contraction pressure after treatment.

Conclusions

Combination treatment with an alpha-blocker (tamsulosin) plus an anticholinergic (tolterodine) improves quality of life in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and concomitant detrusor instability. Interestingly, no acute urinary retention was observed and tolterodine did not affect the quality of urine flow or residual urine volume. The proposed combination appears to be an effective and relatively safe treatment option in patients with bladder outlet obstruction and detrusor instability.

### Interventions for reducing anticholinergic medication burden in older adults-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111FxrCt]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Synthesis methods

Where required, we converted outcome data to an appropriate format for meta-analysis using established methods and contacted study authors for additional information if this was not possible.

We synthesised data for meta-analysis, calculating pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes to create summary forest plots using Mantel–Haenszel random-effects methods. We calculated pooled mean differences with 95% confidence intervals for continuous outcomes using generic inverse variance random-effects modelling. Where we identified unit of analysis issues, we calculated standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. In cases where the standard deviation for a study's point estimate was missing, where this represented a small proportion of the pooled estimates, these were imputed. If available data or clear trial heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis, a narrative evidence synthesis was provided. We assessed for the proportion of total variability due to between-study heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic with values approaching 25%, 50% and 75% representing low, moderate and high levels, respectively. Since fewer than 10 studies were identified to provide data for each outcome, assessment for publication bias with funnel plots was not appropriate.

### Tadalafil [^114n3qkA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Alpha-blockers and Antihypertensives

Physicians should discuss with patients the potential for tadalafil tablets to augment the blood-pressure-lowering effect of alpha-blockers and antihypertensive medications [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil tablets, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which may lead to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., fainting). Consideration should be given to the following:

ED

Patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating a PDE5 inhibitor. Patients who demonstrate hemodynamic instability on alpha-blocker therapy alone are at increased risk of symptomatic hypotension with concomitant use of PDE5 inhibitors.
In those patients who are stable on alpha-blocker therapy, PDE5 inhibitors should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose.
In those patients already taking an optimized dose of PDE5 inhibitor, alpha-blocker therapy should be initiated at the lowest dose. Stepwise increase in alpha-blocker dose may be associated with further lowering of blood pressure when taking a PDE5 inhibitor.
Safety of combined use of PDE5 inhibitors and alpha-blockers may be affected by other variables, including intravascular volume depletion and other antihypertensive drugs.
[see Dosage and Administration (2.7) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

BPH

The efficacy of the coadministration of an alpha-blocker and tadalafil tablets for the treatment of BPH has not been adequately studied, and due to the potential vasodilatory effects of combined use resulting in blood pressure lowering, the combination of tadalafil tablets and alpha-blockers is not recommended for the treatment of BPH [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2 .)].
Patients on alpha-blocker therapy for BPH should discontinue their alpha-blocker at least one day prior to starting tadalafil tablets for once daily use for the treatment of BPH.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^114vMZ5Q]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

A study in the US Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system used data mining strategies of spontaneous reports to assess potential safety signals with α adrenergic antagonists. Concern for dizziness or vertigo and orthostatic hypotension were raised for tamsulosin in addition to alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin. A recent Cochrane review also found higher rates of dizziness with larger tamsulosin dosages (0.8 mg, 17% dizziness; 0.4 mg, 9%; 0.2 mg, 3%), suggesting a dose dependent effect.

In a prospective cohort study of 5872 participants, Parsons and colleagues found a significantly increased risk of falls at one year in community dwelling men aged 65 years and older with moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms, based on the validated American Urological Association symptom index. But they did not find any difference when stratifying patients on the basis of use of urological drug treatments. However, all urological drugs were grouped together in the analysis (α blockers, 5ARIs, anticholinergics), and more importantly, drug use was only collected at baseline — therefore, a first dose phenomenon could not be assessed. The population based case-control study by Jacobsen and colleagues found an increased risk of hip fractures among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia taking α blockers but not 5ARIs. Notably, this risk was only observed in men initiating treatment with an α blocker within 30 days (odds ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.49). Our study suggests that this increased risk of hip fractures with α blockers use could be secondary to falls as a result of severe hypotensive events at initiation.

### Clinical consensus statement: association of anticholinergic medication use and cognition in women with overactive bladder [^111Asv9Q]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) management and anticholinergic use — cognitive risk guidance: First-line treatment of overactive bladder includes behavioral therapies, which may be combined with pharmacologic management as indicated. Anticholinergic medications and β-3 agonists are often used as initial pharmacologic therapy, but caution should be taken in prescribing anticholinergic medications in frail or cognitively impaired patients. Given evidence of significant associations between anticholinergic medication use and increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia, providers should counsel on the associated risks, prescribe the lowest effective dose, and consider alternative medications in patients at risk. The American Urogynecologic Society's "Choose Wisely" campaign recommends the avoidance of anticholinergic medications to treat OAB in women older than 70 years.

### Safety and efficacy of an α-blocker plus mirabegron compared with an α-blocker plus antimuscarinic in men with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia and overactive bladder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111cSb49]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Antimuscarinics and the β3-adrenoreceptor agonist, mirabegron, are commonly used for treating patients with overactive bladder (OAB) and α 1 -adrenoreceptor antagonists (α 1 -blockers) are the main pharmacological agents used for treating lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As these conditions commonly occur together, the aim of this systematic review was to identify publications that compared the use of an α 1 -blocker plus mirabegron with an α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic in men with LUTS secondary to BPH and OAB. A meta-analysis was subsequently conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of these combinations.

Methods

Included records had to be from a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial that was ≥ 8 weeks in duration. Participants were male with LUTS secondary to BPH and OAB. The indirect analyses that were identified compared an α 1 -blocker plus OAB agent with an α 1 -blocker plus placebo. The PubMed/Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, the Excerpta Medica Database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched for relevant records up until March 5, 2020. Safety outcomes included incidences of overall treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and urinary retention, postvoid residual volume, and maximum urinary flow (Q max). Primary efficacy outcomes were micturitions/day, incontinence episodes/day, and urgency episodes/day, and secondary outcomes were Overactive Bladder Symptom Score and International Prostate Symptom Score. A Bayesian network meta-analysis approach was used for the meta-analysis.

Results

Out of a total of 1039 records identified, 24 were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between the α 1 -blocker plus mirabegron and α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic groups in terms of the comparisons identified for all the safety and efficacy analyses conducted. Numerically superior results were frequently observed for the α 1 -blocker plus mirabegron group compared with the α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic group for the safety parameters, including TEAEs, urinary retention, and Q max. For some of the efficacy parameters, most notably micturitions/day, numerically superior results were noted for the α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic group. Inconsistency in reporting and study variability were noted in the included records, which hindered data interpretation.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that an α 1 -blocker plus mirabegron and an α 1 -blocker plus antimuscarinic have similar safety and efficacy profiles in male patients with LUTS secondary to BPH and OAB. Patients may, therefore, benefit from the use of either combination within the clinical setting.

### Comparison of add-on medications for persistent storage symptoms after α-blocker treatment in BPH patients-a network meta-analysis [^114ddgfD]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in the elderly male population, occurring in nearly 70% of men aged > 60 years, and increasing with age. BPH can cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS/BPH) by obstructing the bladder neck, which may be bothersome and have a detrimental impact on the quality of life (QoL). LUTS/BPH has been found to affect 50%-75% of men aged > 50 years, increasing to 80% of men aged > 70 years. For men with moderate-to-severe or bothersome LUTS/BPH, α-blockers are prescribed as first-line pharmacological agents that target the prostate and bladder outlets. Nonetheless, some men with LUTS/BPH fail to respond to α-blockers, particularly those with storage symptoms.

According to the 2022 International Continence Society (ICS) committee, overactive bladder (OAB) is a complex of storage symptoms defined as urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia. The coexistence of OAB and BPH (OAB/BPH) has been widely identified, and storage symptoms are more bothersome than voiding symptoms. Although α-blockers are administered as the initial treatment for BPH patients with moderate-to-severe LUTS, a subset of patients still experience persistent OAB symptoms of varying degrees of severity, which may be caused by urodynamic detrusor overactivity (DO) or bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) secondary to BPH. The efficacy of different classes of medication added to α-blockers for OAB/BPH has been demonstrated in previous studies. Antimuscarinics were suggested to be added if patients with moderate-to-severe BPH still have residual storage symptoms suggestive of OAB after α-blocker administration, based on the 2018 European Association of Urology Guidelines. β3-agonists such as mirabegron were found to be effective as add-on treatments for OAB symptoms caused by BPH following α-blocker treatment. Desmopressin, an antidiuretic agent, added to α-blockers was confirmed as an active therapy in reducing the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and nocturia episodes in patients not satisfied with α-blocker monotherapy for persistent nocturia.

### Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults [^114gx7qm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium bromide are sometimes used in the treatment of chronic asthma. They effect bronchodilation and have also been used in combination with beta2-agonists in the management of chronic asthma.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of anticholinergic agents versus placebo and in comparison with beta2-agonists or as adjunctive therapy to beta2-agonists.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group asthma and wheeze database was searched with a pre-defined search strategy. Searches were current as of August 2003. Reference lists of articles were also examined.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials or quasi-randomised trials were considered for inclusion. Studies assessing an anticholinergic agent versus placebo or in combination/comparison with beta2-agonists were included. In practice, all beta2-agonists were short acting. Short-term (less than 24 hours duration) and longer-term studies were separated; the latter are reported in this review and the former in the review, "Anticholinergic agents for chronic asthma in adults short term".

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed abstracts for retrieval of full text articles. Papers were then assessed for suitability for inclusion in the review. Data from included studies were extracted by two reviewers and entered into the software package (RevMan 4.2). We contacted authors for missing data and some responded. Adverse effect data were analysed if reported in the included studies.

Main Results

The studies analysed were in two groups: those comparing anticholinergics with placebo and those comparing the combination of anticholinergics with short acting beta2-agonists versus short acting beta2-agonists alone. The former group had 13 studies involving 205 participants included in this review, and the latter 9 studies involving 440 patients. Generally methodological quality was poorly reported, and there were some reservations with respect to the quality of the studies. Despite the limited number of studies that could be combined, anticholinergic agents in comparison with placebo resulted in more favourable symptom scores particularly in respect of daytime dyspnoea (WMD -0.09 (95%CI -0.14, -0.04, 3 studies, 59 patients). Daily peak flow measurements also showed a statistically significant improvement for the anticholinergic (e.g. morning PEF: WMD = 14.38 litres/min (95%CI 7.69, 21.08; 3 studies, 59 patients). However the clinical significance is small and in terms of peak flow measurements equates to approximately a 7% increase over placebo. The more clinically relevant comparison of a combination of anticholinergic plus short acting beta2-agonist versus short acting beta2-agonist alone gave no evidence in respect of symptom scores or peak flow rates of any significant differences between the two regimes. Again there are reservations with respect to the quality of the information from which these conclusions are drawn.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Overall this review provides no justification for routinely introducing anticholinergics as part of add-on treatment for patients whose asthma is not well controlled on standard therapies. This does not exclude the possibility that there may be a sub-group of patients who derive some benefit and a trial of treatment in individual patients may still be justified. The role of long term anticholinergics such as tiotropium bromide has yet to be established in patients with asthma and any future trials might draw on the messages derived from this review.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^1162HahK]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Older adult considerations — Given the higher prevalence of chronic urinary retention in older adults and the association between blunt trauma with a distended bladder and intraperitoneal injury, geriatric patients are at higher risk for bladder rupture following lower-force traumas compared to younger patients. Mechanisms of injury include falls from standing or lower heights, as well as low-speed motor vehicle collisions with associated seatbelt injuries or airbag deployment. Maintain a high index of suspicion for geriatric patients with abdominal exam findings out of proportion to their external injuries, follow standardized guidelines for evaluation, and consider urinalysis and cystography for unexplained signs or symptoms. It is necessary to determine baseline voiding status before catheter removal in geriatric trauma patients, identify patients with chronic catheterization, and transition them back to their baseline bladder management. A best practice is to restart alpha-adrenergic blockers at least 24–72 hours before catheter removal for patients who take these medications chronically, ensure urologic follow-up for geriatric patients who fail a voiding trial, monitor geriatric patients for cognitive side effects when placed on anticholinergic medications, and discuss the risks of dementia specific to this cohort with the patient and family before long-term continuation.

### How would you manage this patient with benign prostatic hyperplasia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^116pYjr5]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are common in older patients assigned male sex at birth, regardless of gender identity, and treatment of these symptoms is therefore common in primary care practice. In 2021, the American Urological Association published guidelines for management of BPH. They recommend using a standardized scoring system such as the International Prostate Symptom Score to help establish a diagnosis and to monitor the efficacy of interventions, α-blockers as the first-choice pharmacotherapy option, and 5α-reductase inhibitors for patients with prostate size estimated to be at least 30 cc. Tadalafil is another option regardless of erectile dysfunction. Combination therapies with α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors, anticholinergic agents, or β 3 -agonists are effective options. A surgical referral is warranted if the BPH results in chronic kidney disease, refractory urinary retention, or recurrent urinary tract infections; if there is concern for bladder or prostate cancer; or if symptoms do not respond to medical therapy. In this article, a general internal medicine physician and a urologist discuss the treatment options and how they would apply their recommendations to a patient who wishes to learn more about his options.

### The efficacy and safety of combined therapy with α-blockers and anticholinergics for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a meta-analysis [^1135ZsZr]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We performed a meta-analysis to compare treatment with α-blockers and anticholinergics (ie combination therapy) to α-blocker monotherapy to clarify the efficacy and safety of this treatment approach among men with storage urinary symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

We searched for trials of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms that were randomized to combination treatment or α-blockers alone. We pooled data from 7 placebo controlled trials meeting inclusion criteria. Primary outcomes of interest included changes in International Prostate Symptom Score (storage subscores) and urinary frequency. We also assessed post-void residual volume, maximal flow rate and the incidence of urinary retention. Data were pooled using random effects models for continuous outcomes and the Peto method to generate odds ratios for acute urinary retention.

Results

Combination therapy had a significantly greater reduction in International Prostate Symptom Score storage subscores (Δ -0.73, 95% CI -1.09 - -0.37) and voiding frequency (Δ -0.69 voids, 95% CI -0.97 - -0.41). There was also a greater reduction in maximal urinary flow rate (Δ -0.59 mL per second, 95% CI -1.04 - -0.14) and increase in post-void residual urine volume (Δ 11.60 ml, 95% CI 8.50–14.70) with combination therapy. The number needed to treat with combination therapy to cause 1 acute urinary retention episode was 101 (95% CI 60–267).

Conclusions

Combination treatment with α-blockers and anticholinergics significantly improved storage voiding parameters compared to men treated with α-blocker therapy alone. This treatment approach is safe with a minimal risk of increased post-void residual urine volume, decreased maximal urinary flow rate or acute urinary retention.

### Acute urinary retention rates in the general male population and in adult men with lower urinary tract symptoms participating in pharmacotherapy trials: a literature review [^1136W5bn]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite proven efficacy, antimuscarinics are not frequently used for treating lower urinary tract symptoms in adult men, due to the perception of an increased risk of acute urinary retention (AUR). Men treated with α-blockers, 5α-reductase inhibitors, or their combinations have lower AUR incidence rates than the general symptomatic population. In the selected study population in this review (men with post-void residuals ≤ 200 mL), the risk of AUR with antimuscarinics with and/or without α-blockers may be increased during short-term treatment, but if patients do not develop AUR in the first 3 months, their subsequent risk is lower than in the untreated, symptomatic population.

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^115idXB6]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatments

Many pharmacological options exist for treating UUI and OAB, including anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium chloride, darifenacin, solifenacin, and ER fesoterodine. These agents inhibit detrusor overactivity and may inhibit voiding ability. Anticholinergic agents are usually used in patients who do not improve with other more conservative treatments because of their side effects and the relatively high discontinuation rates.β 3 -adrenergic agonists are a newer class of drugs, which act at the level of myogenic detrusor reflex (instead of the neurogenic reflex), inhibiting not only detrusor contractions but may also interfere with filling. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox ®) inhibits involuntary contractions of the detrusor and therefore leads to improved continence.

More than 70% of patients report at least a 50% reduction in symptoms after treatment, suggesting that Botox is relatively effective. However, there remain questions regarding the length and durability of the treatment, as well as the location of administration (i.e. trigone vs. outside the trigone). Last, with Botox there remain questions about how much damage the toxin has on muscles, whether the toxin accumulates over the life span, or whether multiple concurrent uses (cosmetic and urologic, for instance) can have long-lasting effects that have not yet been observed.

There are currently very few or no pharmacological treatments for SUI or UAB. For example, bethanechol is a muscarinic agonist used to treat UAB, but there is no level 1 evidence for the use of this agent. Because of this, treatment of UAB is primarily limited to bladder catheterization. SUI can be treated with α-adrenergic agonists (pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine) that contract the bladder neck or SNRI antidepressants (duloxetine) that act centrally on the pudendal motor neuron, which contracts the EUS. These agents may have serious side effects and should be considered carefully in a risk–benefit analysis.

A number of options exist for treatment of IC/PBS, including oral pentosan polysulfate, which presumably restores the glycosaminoglycan layer, which has been described to be a protective layer over the apical urothelial cell. Antihistamines have also been used to prevent mast cell degranulation. Antidepressants and opioid pain medicines are also administered to reduce the symptoms of IC/PBS.

### Can α-blocker therapy be an alternative to biofeedback for dysfunctional voiding and urinary retention? A prospective study [^113K5QHn]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Traditional treatment of dysfunctional voiding in children with urinary retention involves retraining the pelvic floor muscles using biofeedback. Alpha-blockers are reported to also be effective in children with urinary retention and dysfunctional voiding. We compared the efficacy of biofeedback and alpha-blockers for dysfunctional voiding and urinary retention in terms of residual urine volume and urge incontinence episodes, mean flow rates and urinary tract infections.

Materials and Methods

A total of 28 patients with a mean age of 6.25 years (range 4 to 10) presented with symptoms of urinary incontinence, urgency and urinary tract infections without anatomic and neurogenic causes of urinary retention. All patients had increased post-void residual (PVR) urine volume (mean 59 ml, 32% of age expected capacity [AEC]). The biofeedback group consisted of 16 children (mean age 6.5 years) and the alpha-blocker group consisted of 12 children (mean age 5.9 years). Both groups were also on continued timed voiding, constipation treatment and anticholinergics, which had been used for at least the last 6 months. Biofeedback (median 10, range 6 to 16 sessions) and doxazosin (0.5 to 2 mg) were administered. At 3 and 6 months incontinence episodes, urinary tract infections, mean urinary flow rates, PVR and parental satisfaction grades (1 to 10) were reevaluated. Six refractory cases were started on alpha-blockers and biofeedback, and reevaluated after 1 month and 3 months.

Results

Pretreatment mean PVR was 54 mL (30% of AEC), and mean posttreatment PVR was 21 mL (12% of AEC) and 9 mL (5% of AEC) at 3 and 6 months in the biofeedback group (p < 0.05). Pretreatment mean PVR was 64 mL (38% of AEC), and posttreatment mean PVR was 17 mL (12% of AEC) and 13 mL (8% of AEC) at 3 and 6 months in the alpha-blocker group (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference in posttreatment PVR between the 2 groups (p > 0.05). High PVR persisted in 4 (25%) biofeedback cases and in 2 (16%) alpha-blocker cases. Complete improvement in urge incontinence episodes occurred in 10 (62.5%) and 7 (70%) children in the biofeedback and alpha-blocker groups, respectively. In therapy responsive children parental satisfaction was higher with alpha-blocker than with biofeedback (9.2 vs 7.9, p < 0.05). Refractory high PVR decreased significantly after combination treatment with biofeedback and alpha-blocker in 5 of 6 children (mean 80 ml, 35% of AEC vs mean 15 ml, 7% of AEC). No drug related side effect was reported in the alpha-blocker group.

Conclusions

Alpha-blocker therapy seems to be a viable alternative to biofeedback in dysfunctional voiding in children with urinary retention to improve bladder emptying. Combination treatment (biofeedback and alpha-blockers) can be used as additional therapy in refractory cases.

### The use of mono-and combination drug therapy in men and women with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in the UK: a retrospective observational study [^115viG7y]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

In men with LUTS suggestive of BPO, the main treatment options include alpha-blockers for rapid symptomatic relief and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) to delay progression of BPO and help manage symptoms over the long term in men at risk of disease progression. Alpha-blockers are usually used as first-line treatment, but the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines recommend combined alpha-blocker and 5-ARI treatment in men with moderate-to-severe LUTS and an increased risk of disease progression. However, many men with LUTS (approximately 50%) experience mixed symptoms suggestive of both OAB and BPO. Only one-third of these men with mixed symptoms will achieve adequate symptom control with an alpha-blocker alone, with the remainder requiring additional pharmacotherapy to manage residual storage LUTS. Clinical trials in men on alpha-blocker monotherapy who still have bothersome storage LUTS have shown that adding an OAB drug can significantly reduce storage symptoms and improve quality of life. The addition of an antimuscarinic agent or beta-3-agonist if storage symptoms are not relieved by alpha-blocker monotherapy is a recommended treatment strategy in clinical guidelines.

Patterns of real-world LUTS drug use, especially combination drug therapy, have not been studied extensively in the UK. Our study investigated the recent landscape of pharmacotherapy for men and women with LUTS in UK clinical practice, including the types and extent of combination therapies used, and persistence with treatment.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) follow-up evaluation — patients should be evaluated by their providers 4–12 weeks after initiating treatment (provided adverse events do not require earlier consultation) to assess response to therapy, and reevaluation should include the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS); further evaluation may include a post-void residual (PVR) and uroflowmetry (Clinical Principle). For shorter duration of onset drugs such as alpha blockers, beta-3 agonists, PDE5s and anticholinergics the first follow-up visit can be as early as four weeks, whereas for longer acting drugs such as 5-ARIs, the first follow-up visit may be within three to six months if adverse events do not necessitate an earlier visit. During the follow-up visits, patients should be queried regarding the occurrence of typical adverse events of the medication taken, the IPSS and quality of life (QoL) score should be re-administered, and uroflowmetry and residual urine determination is advised. There are no thresholds in the literature for monitoring changes in PVR to help guide therapy, and there are no thresholds in the literature for monitoring changes in Qmax to help guide therapy; on average, an improvement between 1 and 5 mL/s may be expected, while other patients may experience no changes or even a minor deterioration. There are also no thresholds in the literature for monitoring changes in the IPSS/QoL to help guide therapy.

### CYCLOBENZAPRINE HYDROCHLORIDE capsule, extended… [^1113QwrY]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

A maximal limb-lead QRS duration of 0. 10 seconds may be the best indication of the severity of the overdose. Serum alkalinization, to a pH of 7. 45 to
7. 55, using intravenous sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation, should be instituted for patients with dysrhythmias and/or QRS widening.
12. 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following single-dose administration of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 15 mg and 30 mg in healthy adult subjects, C max, AUC 0–168hand AUC 0-∞increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner from 15 mg to 30 mg. The time to peak plasma cyclobenzaprine concentration was 7 to 8 hours for both doses of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules.

A food effect study conducted in healthy adult subjects utilizing a single dose of AMRIX 30 mg demonstrated a statistically significant increase in bioavailability when cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules 30 mg was given with food relative to the fasted state. There was a 35% increase in peak plasma cyclobenzaprine concentration and a 20% increase in exposure in the presence of food. Cyclobenzaprine is extensively metabolized and is excreted primarily as glucuronides via the kidney. Cytochromes P-450 3A4, 1A2, and, to a lesser extent, 2D6, mediate N-demethylation, one of the oxidative pathways for cyclobenzaprine. Cyclobenzaprine has an elimination half-life of 32 hours; plasma clearance is 0. 7 L/min following single-dose administration of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules.

Special Populations Elderly Although there were no notable differences in C maxor T max, cyclobenzaprine plasma AUC is increased by 40% and the plasma half-life of cyclobenzaprine is prolonged in elderly subjects greater than 65 years of age aft.

### Recommendations of apex health bodies remain localized: not in conformity with international implementation policy for urological disorders [^111z6zFY]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Disputed use of selective alpha-1-blockers

The prevalence of BPH has been reported to increase with age, from 14.8% (in younger males aged 40) to 36.8% (in males aged 80 and above). Selective alpha-1-blockers are used to treat BPH and essential hypertension in older adults. Tachycardia and tremulousness are less common with the selective alpha-1-blockers; however it can cause first-dose hypotension, syncope, dizziness, and headache in the older people and increase the risk of falls. AUA being silent, EAU recommends it as the first line medical treatment of BPH whereas STOPP/START criteria recommends to avoid it in patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension/micturition syncope.

Drugs with anti-muscarinic and anti-cholinergic properties

Anti-muscarinic drugs

The incidence of anti-muscarinic drugs use has been reported to increase with age. Various muscarinic receptor antagonists like darifenacin/fesoterodine/oxybutynin/propiverine/solifenacin/tolterodine etc. are licensed for treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. Some drugs like antipsychotics, antidepressants, anti-histaminics etc. have anticholinergic properties and have non-life-threatening side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, dry/itchy eyes, blurred vision, dyspepsia, UTI, urinary retention and impaired cognitive function. Rarely, life-threatening side effects such as arrhythmias have been reported.

The concurrent use of other anti-cholinergic medications may potentiate the side effects of the anti-muscarinic OAB medications. These drugs should therefore be prescribed with caution, and regular evaluation of IPSS and PVR urine is advised. Men should be advised to discontinue medication if worsening voiding LUTS or urinary stream is noted after initiation of therapy. In patients of dementia, anti-muscarinics should be used with extreme caution or may be contraindicated entirely depending on the level of cognitive impairment. As per Beer criteria, these medications should be avoided in older adults except a few selective drugs for the treatment of urinary incontinence. AUA recommends their use with caution in frail older adult patients with OAB and those using anticholinergic drugs concomitantly. However, EAU recommends to avoid their use in older adults or use with caution if volume of post void residual urine > 150 ml. STOPP/START guidelines recommends avoiding its use in older adults with dementia, narrow angle glaucoma and chronic prostatism and avoid concomitant use of two or more such drugs.

### Initial combined treatment with anticholinergics and α-blockers for men with lower urinary tract symptoms related to BPH and overactive bladder: a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^1172iung]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination treatment using anticholinergics with α-blocker for initial treatment of both overactive bladder (OAB) and other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), secondary to BPH. A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at four urology clinics in Korea, involving men, aged 50 years or older, with LUTS related to BPH and OAB. A total of 176 patients were randomly assigned to receive doxazosin (4 mg) plus placebo or doxazosin (4 mg) plus tolterodine SR (4 mg), once a day for 12 weeks. Changes from baseline in total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), bladder diary variables, patient perception of bladder condition (PPBC), uroflowmetry, postvoid residual volume and IPSS subscores (voiding and storage) were analyzed. Of the 176 enrolled patients, 91 had doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) and placebo, and 85 had combined medication with doxazosin GITS and tolterodine SR. Compared with the doxazosin plus placebo group, the doxazosin plus tolterodine group showed significant reductions in IPSS storage subscore and improvement in the quality of life item, urgency episodes, as well as in micturition frequency at weeks 4 and 12. However, it failed to improve PPBC at week 4 as well as at week 12. Earlier intervention with anticholinergics plus α-blocker was tolerated well, including the questions about urinary retention (n = 1) and dry mouth (n = 2). Initial combination treatment of anticholinergics plus α-blocker showed positive results for men with LUTS related to BPH and OAB symptoms and did not increase the risk of urinary retention.

4 DISCUSSION

BPH is the histological terminology, and in itself does not require treatment and is not the target of therapeutic intervention. Although we are not sure that the term, "BPH/LUTS" is scientifically correct or not, this term is accepted terminology for the treatment of male LUTS by AUA. For the treatment of "LUTS/BPH", α‐blockers and/or PDE5‐inhibitors have been used as the first line of treatment. These drugs may improve storage symptoms, including OAB, as well as voiding symptoms. 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15 However, OAB symptoms may remain despite these drugs. 5 In these patients, several combinations or add‐on therapies have been reported to be effective. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13

The most frequently used combination was α‐blocker and anticholinergic drugs, and these combinations can be effective for the treatment of "BPH/OAB" symptoms. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, addition of anticholinergics may cause several side effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and voiding difficulty. Although rarely, these combinations may cause increase in PVR, and urinary retention may occur in about 1%‐3% of patients. 1, 5, 6

For the treatment of "LUTS/BPH" with large prostate (prostate volume > 30 mL), the combination of an α‐blocker and a 5α‐reductase inhibitor (dutasteride) has been reported to be more effective, even in the storage symptoms, compared to each monotherapy. 16, 17 However, the combination of α‐blocker, dutasteride, and anticholinergic drug has been reported to be more effective than the combination of α‐blocker plus dutasteride for the treatment of "BPH/OAB" with large prostate (DIrecT study). 18, 19

### Cumulative use of therapeutic bladder anticholinergics and the risk of dementia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms: a nationwide 12-year cohort study [^112gzDqd]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, we have shown that high cumulative exposure of therapeutic bladder anticholinergics can increase the risk of dementia in people with LUTS. Therefore, anticholinergics should be used with caution in patients with LUTS. Physicians should review and weigh the need for anticholinergics in clinical practice. Behavioral therapy or other medications such as beta-3-agonists could be considered as alternative options. Future work should focus on the properties of various anticholinergic agents, to discover whether they have a differential impact on cognitive function.

### Resource utilization and costs associated with the addition of an antimuscarinic in patients treated with an α-blocker for the treatment of urinary symptoms linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114dSszB]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Table 3
Description and persistence of the treatment administered from the series studied (CI 95%)

Values expressed as mean (SD: standard deviation) or percentage, P: percentiles

a Persistence was defined as the time, measured in months, without the patient dropping out of the initial treatment or without switching to another medication at least 30 days after the initial prescription. A patient was classified as being persistent if they had no treatment discontinuation or switch to another medication during the 12-month follow-up period. CI: Confident Interval

The comparison of pre-treatment (AAB alone) and combination treatment (AAB + AM) healthcare resource use and costs per patient per year is shown in Table 4. Use of resources was lower after initiation of AM + AAB vs pre-treatment (AAB alone) period for medical visits in general (13.4 (4.6) vs 15.4 (4.4) p < 0.010), primary care (10.6 (7.3) vs 12.1 (7.5) and hospital emergency visits (0.4 (0.8) vs 0.7 (0.7)) (p < 0.010 both). Concomitant medication (13.3% vs 19.1%) and use of pads (9.7% vs 13.4%) present a numerical (not statistically significant) reduction in use of resources with AAB + AM versus AAB alone. During the combination treatment period (AAB + AM), 84.3% of the total cost was healthcare related vs 80.2% on the pre-treatment period (AAB alone) and 15.7% was non-healthcare related vs 19.8% on the pre-treatment period (AAB alone). During the pre-treatment period (AAB alone), the total cost per patient per year was €2399 versus €2011 in the treatment period, despite including the cost of the AM. However, this numerical difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.135). A reduction in cost was also shown from the pre-treatment (AAB alone) to the treatment period (AAB + AM) for medical visits (from €645 to €546 (p < 0.01)) and concomitant medication (from €181 to €101 (p < 0.001)). Differences in mean costs are shown in Fig. 2.

### Increased risk of incident dementia following use of anticholinergic agents: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^111PoMny]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The healthcare cost of dementia is substantial, estimated at $290 billion in the United States in 2019 alone. 1 The prevalence of dementia doubles every 5 years after the age of 65 and reaches 30% or more among those over the age of 80. 2 This trend is expected to continue, with the prevalence of dementia estimated to double by 2030. 3 In addition to dementia, approximately 22% of people in the United States over the age of 70 have cognitive impairment without dementia. 4

Anticholinergic drugs are prescribed for various indications, including those occurring in patients at high risk for cognitive impairment or dementia, such as those over the age of 65. There is growing evidence that long‐term treatment with anticholinergic drugs or those with anticholinergic properties increases the risk of dementia, 5, 6, 7, 8 which has led to recommendations to limit the use of these agents. 9, 10 Further, drugs with higher anticholinergic activity, such as the antimuscarinic agent oxybutynin, include precautions in their prescribing information regarding central nervous system anticholinergic effects. The oxybutynin label recommends caution in patients with pre‐existing dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors because it can exacerbate symptoms. 11 Results of a recent meta‐analysis, however, suggest that the link between anticholinergics and cognitive impairment/dementia has not been fully established. 12 That review was limited by short average follow‐up time (12 weeks) and few studies available to assess the outcome of dementia. Other studies have shown that the risk with these agents is greater with longer cumulative exposure time. 13 This could be due to increased Alzheimer‐like pathology over time, as a study conducted in Parkinson's patients reported 2.5‐fold greater amyloid plaque densities, as well as increased neurofibrillary tangle densities in patients treated with antimuscarinic medications for ≥ 2 years compared with untreated patients or shorter exposures. 14

This systematic literature review assessed the impact of ≥ 3 months of anticholinergic use on the risk of incident dementia (multiple subtypes), incident mild cognitive impairment, and change in cognitive function. A meta‐analysis was performed for incident dementia. In addition, the impact of agents used specifically for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) was evaluated.

### Does benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment with α-blockers affect prostate cancer risk? [^11764c81]. Current Opinion in Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To determine whether alpha-blockers, commonly used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, are associated with prostate cancer risk.

Recent Findings

Alpha-blockers have been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer aggressiveness in some observational studies and an increased risk in other studies. However, this relationship is complex as different alpha-blockers have divergent effects in laboratory studies and there are many confounders in daily practice such as differential screening practices.

Summary

Both benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are common conditions in the aging male population, such that an interaction between alpha-blockers and prostate cancer risk is clinically relevant. Prospective evidence is necessary to establish a definitive link.

### Is there a place for combination medical therapy? [^112t36hd]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Medical therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia with either alpha adrenergic receptor blockers or 5alpha-reductase inhibitors has become the most common treatment choice over the past 10 years, replacing transurethral resection of the prostate as the standard intervention. Both classes of drugs have demonstrated efficacy and safety in numerous randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials. Because of the two different mechanisms of action proposed for these two classes of drugs, the idea of utilizing both to enhance efficacy appears logical and promising. However, few well-conducted trials are available to address the issue of combination medical therapy for lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia, the majority of the data available coming from trials with significant design flaws. Two prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have been conducted comparing the safety and efficacy of an alpha blocker-finasteride combination versus placebo in large numbers of patients. Neither one of the two trials suggests superior efficacy of the combination therapy, whereas some of the less well-controlled studies do. Recent evidence suggests superior efficacy of finasteride in men with large glands and higher serum prostate-specific antigen levels in terms of symptoms and outcome prevention. A trial addressing this specific patient population, in whom theoretically the most benefit might be gained from combining both classes of drugs to address symptoms and prevent outcomes, would be a welcome addition to our knowledge base.

### Resource utilization and costs associated with the addition of an antimuscarinic in patients treated with an α-blocker for the treatment of urinary symptoms linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111v5ynz]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition and a major source of morbidity in older men. Its prevalence increases with age, and it presents in more than 50% of men above 50 years old and in up to 80% of males above 90 years old. The International Continence Society proposed the term Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) to describe symptoms associated with the storage and voiding phases of the urinary cycle. Male LUTS have traditionally been attributed to the prostate, but breakthroughs in the knowledge of bladder dysfunction and its physiopathology have led to the understanding that the storage symptoms of male LUTS may be due to co-existing overactive bladder or bladder malfunction secondary to bladder outlet obstruction of prostatic origin.

The insufficient response in alleviating LUTS related to BPH in some cases, together with the increasing recognition of the complexity of the pathophysiology of the lower urinary tract as a functional unit, has helped to shift the focus of attention from the prostate to the bladder as a possible cause of LUTS, thus making it an additional therapeutic target. This change of perspective, acknowledging the multifactorial etiology of male LUTS, and accepting that not all of the symptoms are necessarily related to the prostate, is mirrored in the current guidelines of Scientific Societies. The main treatment objectives are to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and prevent the development of complications. In this regard, and as a step prior to treatment selection, the severity of symptoms should be assessed with the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Drug treatment is indicated in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms who do not present an absolute indication for surgery, and the combination of an antimuscarinic with an alpha-blocker is justified in patients with BPH and LUTS compatible with co-existing overactive bladder. There are several reasons that have led to this treatment rationale, particularly: a) the profile of patients with mixed storage and voiding LUTS with an important storage symptom component; b) the recommendations of the EAU guidelines; and c) the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of alpha-blocker and antimuscarinic combination in this patient population. However, there is limited data on the impact these treatments have on resource utilization and costs.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — anticholinergic plus alpha blocker combinations show mixed symptom benefits and variable adverse events: Trials of tolterodine 4 mg with an alpha blocker versus alpha blocker alone improved the proportion with > 3-point IPSS decrease, but mean IPSS change was -5.9 versus -5.6 and withdrawals due to adverse events were slightly higher. In a 12-week add-on study of fesoterodine 4 or 8 mg plus alpha blocker versus placebo plus alpha blocker in patients with moderate LUTS (baseline IPSS 19; PVR < 200 mL), IPSS change was -4.4 for both groups with higher adverse-event–related withdrawals for fesoterodine. An older 12-week double-blind RCT of oxybutynin 10 mg + tamsulosin 0.4 mg versus tamsulosin + placebo reported baseline IPSS 20; response defined as ≥ 3 point reduction was 75% versus 65%, mean IPSS change -6.9 versus -5.2, and no difference in adverse events or withdrawals. Since there are increased adverse events, one can consider initially starting with alpha blocker alone and adding anticholinergics in selected cases.

Results

Overall 36 articles were selected for the quantitative synthesis and divided in two topics: LUTS/BPO medical treatment: unmet needs and Patient centered medicine in LUTS/BPO management.

LUTS/BPO medical treatment: unmet needs

LUTS can be divided into storage, voiding and post-micturition symptoms. LUTS are highly prevalent, cause bother and impact on QoL. LUTS are strongly associated with ageing processes; therefore associated costs and burden are likely to increase with future demographic changes. Most elderly men suffer at least of one LUTS. LUTS evolve dynamically: for some patients LUTS persist and progress over long time periods, and for others they remit. Six pharmacological classes [alpha blockers (ABs), 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARIs), phytotherapeutics, antimuscarinics (AMs), beta-3 agonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors] are available alone or in combination for the treatment of male LUTS. However, notwithstanding all these different therapeutic options, medical treatment of LUTS/BPO is far from the ideal situation and different unmet needs remain in this area.

Despite most of the European countries adopt the same guidelines for the management of patients with LUTS/BPO, different prescription strategies exist between European countries. The overall prescription index is three times more important in southern countries than in northern countries. In addition, when three classes of medications are compared, alpha-blockers are continuously widely used, 5-ARI prescriptions are variable (highest in Poland and Italy), and the prescription of plants is strictly country dependent (significantly higher in France and Hungary).

Fourcarde et al. in a cross-sectional observational study, described the profile and management of patients receiving medical therapy for BPH in primary care-centres in France. Half of the BPO patients medically treated report unsatisfactory outcomes and only 60% of patients received a stable treatment without modifications over a year time. Moreover, only 17.3% of the patients start with combination treatment and curiously the most prescribed combination therapy was alpha blockers + plant extract (49.7%), non-considered as a recommended combination treatment in the current guidelines, highlighting that only a small number of physicians adhere to guidelines and algorithms.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^1178rz33]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) — When prescribing an alpha blocker for the treatment of LUTS/BPH, the choice of alpha blocker should be based on patient age and comorbidities, and different adverse event profiles (e.g., ejaculatory dysfunction [EjD], changes in blood pressure). (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A).

### Does anticholinergic medication have a role for men with lower urinary tract symptoms / benign prostatic hyperplasia either alone or in combination with other agents? [^1135R5Ts]. Current Opinion in Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A substantial proportion of men with lower urinary tract symptoms have a combination of both 'storage' and 'voiding' symptoms, suggesting possible coexisting bladder outlet obstruction and bladder overactivity. Bladder overactivity is traditionally treated with anticholinergic drugs. However, guidelines from the European Association of Urologists make no mention of the possible therapeutic role of anticholinergic drugs for treating storage symptoms in such patients. It is a common perception that using an anticholinergic drug in men with bladder outlet obstruction runs the risk of inducing acute urinary retention, because of the inhibitory effect of anticholinergics on bladder contraction in the presence of outlet obstruction. This review focuses on recent data determining the efficacy of anticholinergic medication in men with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia and the associated risk of acute urinary retention.

Recent Findings

One recent study in men with urodynamically confirmed obstruction supports the assertion that anticholinergic drugs are safe in men with bladder outlet obstruction. Safety data from larger studies using anticholinergics in patients with overactive bladders supports these findings.

Summary

Efficacy and safety studies of anticholinergic medication in men with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia are few and far between, but preliminary data suggests they are not associated with a substantial risk of urinary retention nor with a substantial increase in residual urine volume.

### Combined inhaled β-agonist and anticholinergic agents for emergency management in adults with asthma [^115KrAkG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled short-acting anticholinergics (SAAC) and short-acting beta₂-agonists (SABA) are effective therapies for adult patients with acute asthma who present to the emergency department (ED). It is unclear, however, whether the combination of SAAC and SABA treatment is more effective in reducing hospitalisations compared to treatment with SABA alone.

Objectives

To conduct an up-to-date systematic search and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC + SABA agents) vs. SABA alone to reduce hospitalisations in adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS, LILACS, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global and evidence-based medicine (EBM) databases using controlled vocabulary, natural language terms, and a variety of specific and general terms for inhaled SAAC and SABA drugs. The search spanned from 1946 to July 2015. The Cochrane Airways Group provided search results from the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials which was most recently conducted in July 2016. An extensive search of the grey literature was completed to identify any other potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

Included studies were randomised or controlled clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of combined inhaled therapy (SAAC and SABA) to SABA treatment alone to prevent hospitalisations in adults with acute asthma in the emergency department. Two independent review authors assessed studies for inclusion using pre-determined criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated individual and pooled statistics as risk ratios (RR) or odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a random-effects model and reporting heterogeneity (I²). For continuous outcomes, we reported individual trial results using mean differences (MD) and pooled results as weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs using a random-effects model.

Main Results

We included 23 studies that involved a total of 2724 enrolled participants. Most studies were rated at unclear or high risk of bias. Overall, participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were less likely to be hospitalised (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.87; participants = 2120; studies = 16; I² = 12%; moderate quality of evidence). An estimated 65 fewer patients per 1000 would require hospitalisation after receiving combination therapy (95% 30 to 95), compared to 231 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone. Although combination inhaled therapy was more effective than SABA treatment alone in reducing hospitalisation in participants with severe asthma exacerbations, this was not found for participants with mild or moderate exacerbations (test for difference between subgroups P = 0.02). Participants receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) (MD 0.25 L, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.48; participants = 687; studies = 6; I² = 70%; low quality of evidence), peak expiratory flow (PEF) (MD 36.58 L/min, 95% CI 23.07 to 50.09; participants = 1056; studies = 12; I² = 25%; very low quality of evidence), increased percent change in PEF from baseline (MD 24.88, 95% CI 14.83 to 34.93; participants = 551; studies = 7; I² = 23%; moderate quality of evidence), and were less likely to return to the ED for additional care (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.98; participants = 1180; studies = 5; I² = 0%; moderate quality of evidence) than participants receiving SABA alone. Participants receiving combination inhaled therapy were more likely to experience adverse events than those treated with SABA agents alone (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.20; participants = 1392; studies = 11; I² = 14%; moderate quality of evidence). Among patients receiving combination therapy, 103 per 1000 were likely to report adverse events (95% 31 to 195 more) compared to 131 per 1000 patients receiving SABA alone.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, combination inhaled therapy with SAAC and SABA reduced hospitalisation and improved pulmonary function in adults presenting to the ED with acute asthma. In particular, combination inhaled therapy was more effective in preventing hospitalisation in adults with severe asthma exacerbations who are at increased risk of hospitalisation, compared to those with mild-moderate exacerbations, who were at a lower risk to be hospitalised. A single dose of combination therapy and multiple doses both showed reductions in the risk of hospitalisation among adults with acute asthma. However, adults receiving combination therapy were more likely to experience adverse events, such as tremor, agitation, and palpitations, compared to patients receiving SABA alone.

### Alpha blockers to speed ureteral stone passage… [^1131pqSM]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Do alpha blockers safely speed passage of subcentimeter ureteral stones. Evidence-Based Answer Compared with patients receiving standard therapy, placebo, or calcium channel blockers, patients receiving alpha blockers had about three fewer days to ureteral stone expulsion and were less likely to be hospitalized. Adverse effects of alpha blocker therapy are generally tolerable. The majority of studies ran two to four weeks and compared alpha-blocker therapy plus standard therapy with standard therapy plus placebo. Others compared alpha blockers with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine or the antimuscarinic tolterodine.

The overall stone expulsion time was three days shorter with alpha blockers than with standard therapy, with a mean expulsion time of seven rather than 10 days. A Chinese RCT of 3, 189 patients accounted for most of the latter findings; the study was appropriately masked and considered at low risk of bias. 2 The benefits of alpha blockers were robust, irrespective of whether the stone was smaller than 5 mm or was 5 to 10 mm in diameter. Alpha blockers greatly reduced the need to hospitalize and, to a more modest degree, reduced the number of pain episodes and amount of pain medication used. Only five studies reported adverse effects. In these studies, about 10% of participants experienced dizziness, palpitations, headache, rhinitis, retrograde ejaculation, fatigue and weakness, cutaneous reaction, or postural hypotension. Most adverse effects were mild and did not lead to cessation of therapy.

Specialty guidelines published in 2007 recommend use of alpha blockers to help pass subcentimeter ureteral stones in otherwise stable patients. 3 Duration of treatment is not specified by the guidelines, but this Cochrane review suggests that passage should occur within one month, if not two weeks. Family physicians should consider alpha blockers as first-line therapy for patients with otherwise uncomplicated subcentimeter ureteral stones.

### Are all α-blockers created equal? An update [^112GgYAt]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

alpha-Receptor blockers, used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms, exert effects on areas of the body other than the prostate where alpha-receptors are located, including the blood vessels and the central nervous system. alpha-Receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system may be involved in bladder activation. alpha(1a)-Receptors are the appropriate target in men with obstructive symptoms, although alpha(1d)-receptors may also be important in patients with irritative symptoms. There is conflicting evidence about the selectivity of alpha-blockers. Clinical trials of these agents do not necessarily reflect results observed in animal and laboratory studies on uroselectivity. The few published comparator studies of alpha-blockers indicate similar efficacies, although side-effect profiles differ somewhat. Randomized, controlled studies of different alpha-blockers with sufficient power to detect differences in side effects between agents are needed.

### The fall risk with alpha blockers given initiaL dose or elderly status (FRAGILE) study [^115JcU3y]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: α-1 adrenergic antagonists are commonly prescribed, but there is question regarding their safety in patients at increased fall risk. Objective: The purpose of the FRAGILE study was to determine the risk for developing adverse drug events (ADEs) in veterans prescribed α-1 blockers. Methods: A single-center, retrospective, observational cohort analysis was conducted of veterans newly initiated on α-1 antagonists. Veterans were categorized into at-risk (patients who met at least 1 of 2 criteria: age 65 or older or high initial dose of α blockade) or control (veterans without either risk factor) groups. The primary outcome was the composite all-cause ADEs, including hospitalizations or emergency department (ED) visits. Secondary outcomes included number of fall-related ADEs and medication discontinuation rates with follow-up for 12 months. Results: A total of 300 veterans were evaluated. There was no significant difference in the composite outcome of all-cause ED visits between at-risk (n = 169) versus control (n = 131) groups (0.81 vs 1.17, P = 0.09) or all-cause hospitalizations (0.28 vs 0.39, P = 0.25). Seventy-three veterans in the at-risk group experienced an all-cause ADE versus 64 in the control group (P = 0.36). No significant differences in secondary outcomes were found. Fall-related side effects occurred in 8% of the total cohort. Conclusion and Relevance: Rates of all-cause or fall-related ADEs were not significantly different. An 8% discontinuation rate resulting from fall-related ADEs and high rates of coadministered medications that could increase fall risk. Pharmacists can play a key role in optimizing α-1 blocker administration.

### Addition of antimuscarinics to α-blockers for treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in men: a meta-analysis [^112Z3v5m]. Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Alpha-blockers and antimuscarinics combination therapy has been commonly used for treatment of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). We conducted a meta-analysis aimed to access the relative efficacy and safety of combination therapy. We systematically searched Medline, Cochrane, and Embase for eligible studies. Fifteen randomized studies with 4556 patients were included. Overall, combination therapy significantly improved the urgency, voiding frequency, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) total scores, and IPSS storage subscores. Addition of antimuscarinics had little effect on urinary function. The incidences of adverse events were acceptably low. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that the combination therapy was a safe, well-tolerated, and effective treatment for male LUTS.

### Combination treatment for male lower urinary tract symptoms with anticholinergic and α-blockers [^1123Gdyw]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although alpha-adrenergic antagonists (α-blockers) are effective for relieving voiding lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men, storage symptoms often persist. The aim of this manuscript is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination therapy with α-blockers and muscarinic receptor antagonists (anticholinergics).

Recent Findings

High-quality evidence confirms that the addition of an anticholinergic improves micturition diary parameters, such as daytime and nocturnal frequency and urgency incontinence episodes, as well as total and storage subset scores on the International Prostate Symptom Score. Most studies demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over α-blocker monotherapy. Both, incidence of urinary retention and study withdrawal because of treatment-related adverse events with combination therapy, are low. Urodynamic indices, such as maximum flow rate and postvoid residual volume, are also minimally impacted by combination therapy. Outcomes on validated questionnaires and quality-of-life (QoL) indices also indicate a significant improvement.

Summary

The addition of an anticholinergic to an α-blocker in men with storage and voiding LUTS is an effective practice in reducing both categories of symptoms. The addition of anticholinergic is associated with a low rate of urinary retention and the impact on efficient bladder emptying is minimal. Not unexpectedly, QoL is improved.

### A systematic review of medical therapy to facilitate passage of ureteral calculi [^1122y9b2]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Acute renal colic is a common presenting complaint to the emergency department. Recently, medical expulsive therapy using alpha-antagonists or calcium channel blockers has been shown to augment stone passage rates of moderately sized, distal, ureteral stones. Herein is a systematic evaluation of the use of medical expulsive therapy to facilitate ureteral stone expulsion.

Methods

We searched the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Additional sources included key urologic journals and bibliographies of selected articles. We included studies that incorporated a randomized or controlled clinical trial design, patients older than 18 years, treatment in which an alpha-antagonist or calcium channel blocker was compared to a standard therapy group, and studies that reported stone expulsion rates. A random effects model was used to obtain summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for stone expulsion rate.

Results

A pooled analysis of 16 studies using an alpha-antagonist and 9 studies using a calcium channel blocker suggested that the addition of these agents compared to standard therapy significantly improved spontaneous stone expulsion (alpha-antagonist RR 1.59; 95% CI 1.44 to 1.75; number needed to treat 3.3 [95% CI 2.1 to 4.5]; calcium channel blocker RR 1.50; 95% CI 1.34 to 1.68; number needed to treat 3.9 [95% CI 3.2 to 4.6]) in patients with distal ureteral stones. Subgroup analysis of trials using concomitant medications (ie, low-dose steroids, antibiotics, and elimination of trials using an anticholinergic agent) yielded a similar improvement in stone expulsion rate. Adverse effects were noted in 4% of patients receiving alpha-antagonist and in 15.2% of patients receiving calcium channel blockers.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that "medical expulsive therapy", using either alpha-antagonists or calcium channel blockers, augments the stone expulsion rate compared to standard therapy for moderately sized distal ureteral stones.

### Clinical consensus statement: association of anticholinergic medication use and cognition in women with overactive bladder [^115ejF6e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Overactive bladder/detrusor overactivity recommendations — when behavioral therapies fail and pharmacologic treatment for OAB/DO is considered, providers should counsel on the associated risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer disease associated with anticholinergic medications in comparison with the potential benefits related to improvement in quality of life or overall health of the individual patient. To reduce overall anticholinergic burden, the lowest effective dose should be prescribed, and consideration should be given to alternative medications such as β-3 agonists. Consideration should be given to changing or decreasing the dosage of other anticholinergic medications that a patient may be taking. As recommended by the American Urogynecologic Society's "Choosing Wisely" campaign, use of anticholinergic medications to treat OAB in women older than 70 years should be avoided. When anticholinergic medications have to be used in elderly patients, consideration should be given to those that have low potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, recognizing that there are limited clinical data. Third-line therapies such as intradetrusor onabotulinum toxin A or neuromodulation should also be considered in patients not desiring to use medications for OAB/DO because of their adverse effects.

### Role of antimuscarinics combined with alpha-blockers in the management of urinary storage symptoms in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1168toB2]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining antimuscarinics with alpha-blockers to treat storage symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

Searches were carried out on PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases to identify randomized, placebo-controlled trials published before February 15, 2022, assessing the efficacy or safety of antimuscarinics in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia treated with alpha-blockers. Further meta-analyses were performed using standardized mean difference and risk ratio.

Results

A total of 12 randomized trials were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis showed no impact of antimuscarinics on the number of urgencies per day (SMD -0.23 [95%CI: -0.64; -0.17]; p = 0.21). However, the use of antimuscarinics was associated with a small reduction of micturition episodes per day (SMD -0.19 [95%CI: -0.37; -0.01]; p = 0.045). With regard to side effects, post-void residual increased slightly in patients treated with antimuscarinics (SMD 0.26 [95%CI: 0.15; 0.37]; P < .01). In addition, there was a higher risk of acute urinary retention (RR 3.26 [95%CI: 1.35; 7.86]; p = 0.02), dry mouth (RR 3.43 [95%CI: 1.86; 6.32]; P < .001), and constipation (RR 2.92 [95%CI: 1.48; 5.73]; P < .001) with the use of antimuscarinics. Finally, the risk of treatment interruption due to adverse events was higher for the patients treated with antimuscarinics (RR 1.74 [95%CI: 1.27; 2.38]; P < .01).

Conclusions

The addition of antimuscarinics to alpha-blockers was not associated with a substantial reduction in urgencies and micturition episodes in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with storage symptoms. In addition, the toxicity profile was not in favor of antimuscarinic use in these patients.

### Anticholinergics combined with α-blockers for treating lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic obstruction [^117Tf6W9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) represent one of the most common clinical complaints in men. Alpha-blockers are widely used as first-line therapy for men with LUTS secondary to BPO, but up to one third of men report no improvement in their LUTS after taking alpha-blockers. Anticholinergics used in addition to alpha-blockers may help improve symptoms but it is uncertain how effective they are. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of combination therapy with anticholinergics and alpha-blockers in men with LUTS related to BPO.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of medical literature, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registries, with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search was 7 August 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with LUTS secondary to BPO, ages 40 years or older, and a total International Prostate Symptom Score of 8 or greater. We excluded trials of men with a known neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or central nervous system disease, and those examining medical therapy for men who were treated with surgery for BPO. We performed three comparisons: combination therapy versus placebo, combination therapy versus alpha-blockers monotherapy, and combination therapy versus anticholinergics monotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted data according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 23 studies with 6285 randomized men across three comparisons. The mean age of participants ranged from 54.4 years to 73.9 years (overall mean age 65.7 years). Of the included studies, 12 were conducted with a single-center setting, while 11 used a multi-center setting. We only found short-term effect (12 weeks to 12 months) of combination therapy based on available evidence. Combination therapy versus placebo: based on five studies with 2369 randomized participants, combination therapy may result in little or no difference in urologic symptom scores (mean difference (MD) -2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.55 to 0.08; low-certainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of combination therapy on quality of life (QoL) (MD -0.97, 95% CI -2.11 to 0.16; very low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy likely increases adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.47; moderate-certainty evidence); based on 252 adverse events per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 61 more adverse events (95% CI 10 more to 119 more) per 1000 participants treated with combination therapy. Combination therapy versus alpha-blockers alone: based on 22 studies with 4904 randomized participants, we are very uncertain about the effect of combination therapy on urologic symptom scores (MD -2.04, 95% CI -3.56 to -0.52; very low-certainty evidence) and QoL (MD -0.71, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.38; very low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy may result in little or no difference in adverse events rate (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; low-certainty evidence); based on 228 adverse events per 1000 participants in the alpha-blocker group, this corresponds to 23 more adverse events (95% CI 23 fewer to 78 more) per 1000 participants treated with combination therapy. Combination therapy compared to anticholinergics alone: based on three studies with 1218 randomized participants, we are very uncertain about the effect of combination therapy on urologic symptom scores (MD -3.71, 95% CI -9.41 to 1.98; very low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy may result in an improvement in QoL (MD -1.49, 95% CI -1.88 to -1.11; low-certainty evidence). Combination therapy likely results in little to no difference in adverse events (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.95; moderate-certainty evidence); based on 115 adverse events per 1000 participants in the anticholinergic alone group, this corresponds to 4 fewer adverse events (95% CI 7 fewer to 13 more) per 1000 participants treated with combination therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the findings of the review, combination therapy with anticholinergics and alpha-blockers are associated with little or uncertain effects on urologic symptom scores compared to placebo, alpha-blockers, or anticholinergics monotherapy. However, combination therapy may result in an improvement in quality of life compared to anticholinergics monotherapy, but an uncertain effect compared to placebo, or alpha-blockers. Combination therapy likely increases adverse events compared to placebo, but not compared to alpha-blockers or anticholinergics monotherapy. The findings of this review were limited by study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision. We were unable to conduct any of the predefined subgroup analyses.

### Alpha blocker therapy for children with dysfunctional voiding and urinary retention [^111xP1Ld]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Alpha blocker therapy has been successfully used to decrease residual urine in children with complex neuropathic and nonneuropathic voiding dysfunction. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of using selective alpha blocker therapy for children with uncomplicated voiding dysfunction and underlying poor bladder emptying.

Materials and Methods

A total of 55 patients with a mean age of 7.9 years presented with symptoms of urinary incontinence, urgency and urinary tract infection. All patients had increased post-void residual (PVR) on bladder ultrasound, with a mean residual volume of 65 mL (22% of age expected capacity). All patients were treated with doxazosin, a selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, at dosages of 0.5 mg to 2.0 mg daily. Of the patients 38 were treated at presentation with a regimen of anticholinergics, timed voiding and antibiotic prophylaxis before initiating alpha blocker therapy. Patients were reevaluated with post-void ultrasound of the bladder 6 weeks after initiating alpha blocker therapy.

Results

After starting doxazosin average PVR decreased to 8 mL (p < 0.0001), representing an 88% reduction in residual urine (or reduction to only 2.7% of age expected bladder capacity). Medication was discontinued in 2 patients due to minor side effects.

Conclusions

Selective alpha blocker therapy appears to be effective for improving bladder emptying in children with an overactive bladder, wetting, recurrent infection and increased PVR urine. This therapy may be used as either a replacement or in addition to biofeedback in patients with urinary retention. Further investigation, including a prospective randomized trial of alpha blocker therapy in children with urinary tract dysfunction, is warranted based on the findings of our study.

### Antimuscarinics in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia [^113MsBgZ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will provide an update on the use of antimuscarinics, in combination with an alpha-blocker, in men with an overactive bladder and summarize the efficacy and safety of these drugs in this patient population.

Recent Findings

Studies have included a number of antimuscarinic agents (tolterodine, oxybutynin, propiverine, and solifenacin), with or without an alpha-blocker. These studies suggest that in men with persistent storage symptoms (overactive bladder symptoms), clinically meaningful improvements can be achieved by addition of an antimuscarinic therapy to an alpha-blocker. Monotherapy with an antimuscarinic therapy alone in this patient group has proven to be disappointing. Voiding difficulty and acute urinary retention are infrequently reported across all studies, but several trials demonstrated an increase in postvoid residual volume with anticholinergic therapy. It must, however, be borne in mind that reported trials are of short duration (6–12 weeks) and include only men with low postvoid residual volumes at baseline, and the results are, therefore, difficult to unreservedly extrapolate to real-life clinical practice.

Summary

In a situation in which there are persistent urinary storage symptoms (overactive bladder) following therapy with an alpha-blocker, the addition of an antimuscarinic therapy is worth considering. A postvoid residual volume should be measured prior to commencing antimuscarinic therapy to rule out baseline retention suggestive of poor detrusor function, and patients should be kept under careful review, particularly, in the early stages of having commenced therapy.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113gt1ZW]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for overactive bladder, more specifically with respect to anticholinergics and beta-3 agonists, indications, AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering combination therapy with a medication from a different class in patients with overactive bladder not achieving adequate improvement with a single medication.

Introduction

Overactive bladder (OAB) in men is a topic that is gaining increasing attention as there is a wider understanding that OAB is not a female condition. There are several treatments; however, data in male populations are lacking compared to female cohorts. The high likelihood of concomitant benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) adds to the complexity of the treatment algorithm. The overlap in urinary storage symptoms also makes the interpretation of the literature challenging.

Methods

Articles that evaluated men with OAB and men with OAB and BPH/BPO were evaluated and assessed.

Results

Behavioral interventions can offer a significant benefit to male patients with OAB. Medical therapies that have been studied in men with OAB include anticholinergics, beta-3 agonists, and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibits. These agents can be offered in addition to alpha-blockers for men with coexisting BPH/BPO. The literature on Onabotulinumtoxin-A and neuromodulation modulation in the male population is growing and shows promising results.

Conclusion

Male OAB is complex; however, there is a growing body of literature to help guide treatments. Many treatments are available and they have shown considerable success.
