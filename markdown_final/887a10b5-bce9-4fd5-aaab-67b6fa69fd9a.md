## Question

Well demarcated hypopigmentation anogenital

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about well-demarcated hypopigmentation in the anogenital region. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise terminology and why the anogenital site matters. Then, I should build a prioritized differential diagnosis and map key discriminators. Next, I will outline bedside and laboratory diagnostics, including when to biopsy. After that, I will consider management pathways for the leading diagnoses. Finally, I will address special populations and red flags that warrant urgent action, anchoring each step to the best available references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misframe the problem: "well-demarcated" implies a sharp border, "hypopigmentation" reflects decreased melanin rather than complete depigmentation, and "anogenital" specifies vulvar, perineal, perianal, scrotal, penile, and inguinal skin, which is thinner, often moist, and prone to friction and contactants, all of which shape the differential and exam technique.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should prioritize the differential by likelihood and potential harm. The leading considerations in adults with well-demarcated anogenital hypopigmentation are lichen sclerosus, vitiligo, postinflammatory hypopigmentation, and neoplastic mimics such as extramammary Paget disease, with lichen sclerosus and vitiligo dominating the landscape in this anatomic niche [^112K2CaB].

> I will now examine lichen sclerosus as the top priority because it is common in the anogenital region, often presents with pruritus, dyspareunia, or architectural distortion, and carries a nontrivial risk of squamous cell carcinoma if untreated. In patients with skin of color, depigmentation can be striking and may mimic vitiligo, so I need to check carefully for sclerosis, atrophy, fissures, and textural change, and remember the "figure-of-eight" vulvar/perianal pattern in females and sclerotic rings or phimosis in males [^1129wFYe] [^11317Cb1] [^111Dr6er] [^113iKHrD].

> Wait, let me verify the vitiligo features so I don't overcall lichen sclerosus. Vitiligo classically shows well-demarcated depigmented macules or patches with perifollicular pigment retention and accentuation under Wood's lamp. It is typically asymptomatic and nonscarring, and in genital-limited disease, I should confirm absence of sclerosis or erosions and consider autoimmune associations and stability assessment per guidelines [^115CpBrk] [^111VuiTu] [^116ypkw5].

> Next, I should review postinflammatory hypopigmentation, which follows inflammatory dermatoses or procedures. Borders are often less crisp than in vitiligo or lichen sclerosus, and I need to check for a history of eczema, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, infections, or laser procedures, keeping in mind that pigment may recover slowly or incompletely if melanocytes are damaged [^113E6zwL] [^112K2CaB].

> But wait, what if this is a neoplastic mimic masquerading as hypopigmentation? Extramammary Paget disease can rarely present as a subtle hypopigmented patch in older adults and mandates a low threshold for biopsy when the story is atypical or symptoms persist; I should double-check for subtle erosions, induration, or treatment resistance that would heighten suspicion [^116zcMQ2].

> Let me consider other entities so I don't anchor prematurely. Tinea versicolor is uncommon in the anogenital area but can cause hypopigmented macules with fine scale and KOH positivity; lichen planus may produce hypopigmented atrophic or erosive plaques and can overlap with lichen sclerosus; vitiligoid lichen sclerosus in darker skin types can be depigmented and minimally sclerotic, requiring histology to distinguish from vitiligo; and in children, nevus depigmentosus or pigmentary mosaicism should be considered if lesions are congenital or patterned [^114Q1THa] [^111zKMoH] [^114Kqifm] [^112bKqnC].

> I need to ensure my bedside approach is systematic. Under adequate lighting, I should inspect for atrophy, sclerosis, fissures, erosions, telangiectasias, and architectural change suggestive of lichen sclerosus. Use Wood's lamp to look for accentuated depigmentation and perifollicular pigment retention favoring vitiligo. And perform a gentle anogenital exam with attention to the figure-of-eight pattern, clitoral hood, interlabial sulci, scrotum, and perianal skin, documenting morphology and distribution carefully [^111VuiTu] [^1129wFYe] [^112K2CaB].

> Hold on, I should verify when to biopsy because clinical overlap is common. Indications include diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, treatment failure, or concern for neoplasia. Histology of lichen sclerosus shows hyperkeratosis, dermal homogenization/sclerosis, and a lichenoid infiltrate, whereas vitiligo shows melanocyte loss without sclerosis. If EMPD is suspected, I should request appropriate immunohistochemistry and consider mapping biopsies for multifocal disease [^111zKMoH] [^115CpBrk] [^116zcMQ2].

> Next, I should review adjunctive tests judiciously. KOH scraping can exclude tinea versicolor when scale is present. Patch testing is reasonable if there is a history suggesting allergic contact dermatitis from wipes, medications, fragrances, or preservatives. And in refractory or systemic-symptom cases, I should consider screening for autoimmune associations, especially thyroid disease, guided by history and exam [^114Q1THa] [^114g8qQA] [^114Bdydb] [^116ypkw5].

> If lichen sclerosus is likely, I should confirm first-line therapy and safety. Ultrapotent topical corticosteroids such as clobetasol 0.05% ointment are standard, with induction regimens like nightly for 4 weeks, then alternate nights for 4 weeks, then twice weekly for 4 weeks, followed by maintenance. Ointments are generally better tolerated in the anogenital area, and long-term follow-up is essential given malignancy risk and recurrence. Calcineurin inhibitors are alternatives or adjuncts, particularly in pediatric patients or when steroids are contraindicated [^115NPJpF] [^113KWdTB] [^111jUSjt].

> If vitiligo is diagnosed, I should double-check stability and patient preferences before initiating therapy. Options include intermittent potent or very potent topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy, with counseling that genital skin is thin and may respond more slowly. Documentation with photographs and BSA tracking helps monitor response and guide expectations [^114hf543] [^11675B7N] [^114onEu7].

> For postinflammatory hypopigmentation, I need to ensure the inciting inflammation is controlled and then manage expectations, as pigment may recover slowly. Emollients, anti-inflammatory strategies, and sun protection can support recovery, and I should avoid over-treating with steroids that could induce atrophy in this delicate area [^113E6zwL].

> Let me consider special populations so I don't miss nuances. In children, lichen sclerosus is not rare and may present with constipation or urinary symptoms. Misdiagnosis as abuse can occur, so I should document carefully and screen for autoimmune associations. In patients with skin of color, vitiligoid lichen sclerosus is underrecognized and may be mislabeled as vitiligo, so I should maintain a low threshold for biopsy when symptoms or sclerosis are present. In older adults with persistent hypopigmented patches, I should keep EMPD in mind and escalate to biopsy if atypical or refractory [^113iKHrD] [^111Dr6er] [^116zcMQ2].

> I should confirm red flags that mandate urgent action. Any hyperkeratotic, eroded, indurated, or treatment-resistant area in the setting of longstanding anogenital lichen sclerosus warrants biopsy to exclude squamous cell carcinoma; rapidly changing, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions likewise require expedited biopsy and possible oncologic referral, given the malignancy risk in chronic anogenital dermatoses [^111zKMoH].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, morphology-driven approach: distinguish inflammatory sclerosis and pruritus favoring lichen sclerosus from nonscarring, asymptomatic depigmentation favoring vitiligo, and from neoplastic or infectious mimics. Use Wood's lamp, targeted KOH or patch testing when indicated, and biopsy when uncertain or atypical. Then tailor therapy with ultrapotent steroids for lichen sclerosus, topical immunomodulators or phototherapy for vitiligo, and source control for postinflammatory change, all while maintaining vigilance for malignancy and autoimmune comorbidity [^112K2CaB] [^111VuiTu] [^111zKMoH] [^11675B7N].

Well-demarcated anogenital hypopigmentation most often reflects **lichen sclerosus** or **vitiligo**, with lichen sclerosus typically presenting as pruritic, atrophic, ivory-white plaques with a "figure-of-eight" pattern and vitiligo as non-pruritic, depigmented patches with sharp borders [^1129wFYe] [^113QeMKp]. Other causes include postinflammatory hypopigmentation, tinea versicolor, and neoplastic mimics such as extramammary Paget disease or Bowen disease, so **biopsy is indicated for atypical, persistent, or refractory lesions** [^111VuiTu] [^116zcMQ2]. Diagnosis is clinical but may require histopathology or Wood's lamp to distinguish lichen sclerosus from vitiligo or mimics [^111zKMoH] [^111VuiTu]. Management is etiology-specific: ultrapotent topical corticosteroids for lichen sclerosus [^115NPJpF], topical calcineurin inhibitors or phototherapy for vitiligo [^114hf543], and antifungals for tinea; long-term follow-up is essential for lichen sclerosus due to scarring and malignancy risk [^111jUSjt].

## Diagnostic approach

- **History**: onset, duration, symptoms, trauma, infections, autoimmune disease, family history [^116ypkw5].
- **Examination**: morphology, distribution, atrophy, scarring, erythema, scale, lesions elsewhere [^111V9LhC].
- **Wood's lamp**: accentuates vitiligo; lichen sclerosus may appear more prominent [^114Q1THa].
- **Biopsy**: indicated for atypical, persistent, or refractory lesions to exclude neoplasia or confirm diagnosis [^111zKMoH].

---

## Management strategies

- **Lichen sclerosus**: ultrapotent topical corticosteroids (e.g. clobetasol) [^115NPJpF]; calcineurin inhibitors for maintenance or steroid intolerance; long-term follow-up for scarring and malignancy risk [^111jUSjt].
- **Vitiligo**: topical calcineurin inhibitors [^114hf543], topical corticosteroids, phototherapy (NB-UVB) [^11675B7N]; surgical options for stable disease.
- **Postinflammatory hypopigmentation**: treat underlying inflammation; topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors may help.
- **Tinea versicolor**: topical or systemic antifungals [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **scarring and architectural distortion** with lichen sclerosus [^1129wFYe], and a **malignancy risk** of squamous cell carcinoma in chronic lichen sclerosus [^111jUSjt]. Psychological distress is common with vitiligo and chronic hypopigmentation [^114kmkqT], and sexual dysfunction may occur with lichen sclerosus due to scarring and dyspareunia [^111Dr6er].

---

Well-demarcated anogenital hypopigmentation most often reflects lichen sclerosus or vitiligo, but **biopsy is indicated for atypical, persistent, or refractory lesions** to exclude neoplasia or confirm diagnosis. Management is etiology-specific, and long-term follow-up is essential for lichen sclerosus due to scarring and malignancy risk [^111zKMoH] [^111jUSjt].

QUESTION

A 45-year-old African American man with history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented to the office complaining of a rash in his right groin for the past 7 weeks. He had a history of nonadherence to his combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and at a previous visit, his HIV-1 load was noted to be > 10 000 000 copies/mL. After that visit, the patient became adherent with his cART regimen. He presented to his primary care physician's office 3 weeks later, reporting a lesion in his right groin, and was treated with doxycycline for possible skin and soft-tissue infection. Blood work performed 2 weeks later showed an HIV-1 viral load of 1604 copies/mL. The patient was seen in the infectious disease clinic and reported that the rash had only gotten worse. He described it as "itchy but not painful". He denied fevers, chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

At physical examination, the patient appeared well developed and well nourished. No oropharyngeal thrush was seen at oral examination. Findings of neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examination were also unremarkable. Skin examination revealed multiple exophytic masses in the right inguinal and perineal areas, the largest measuring about 3 cm in diameter, and areas of hypopigmentation (Figure 1). There was no associated erythema or tenderness to palpation. The CD4 + cell count was 59/μL, and the HIV load, 733 copies/mL. The patient was referred to dermatology for biopsy. What is your diagnosis?

### Depigmented patches in a child [^111XkEsz]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

A two-year-old girl presented for evaluation of asymptomatic congenital white patches in addition to new white patches that had appeared over the past few months. She had bilateral congenital sensorineural hearing loss and mild gross motor delays. Family history was negative for similar lesions. Physical examination demonstrated depigmented patches on the lower extremities with poorly circumscribed, feathered edges (Figs 1 and 2). Eye examination was significant for heterochromia iridis and normal placement of the inner canthi (Fig 3). There were no other abnormalities on examination.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Vitiligo
B. Piebaldism
C. Pigmentary mosaicism
D. Waardenburg syndrome
E. Tuberous sclerosis complex

Answers:
A. Vitiligo – Incorrect. Although vitiligo presents with depigmented lesions, they are typically not present at birth and are acquired later in life. The existence of true congenital vitiligo is controversial.
B. Piebaldism – Incorrect. Although piebaldism may present with depigmented patches in infants and young children, auditory and facial developmental anomalies, such as heterochromia iridis, are absent in piebaldism.
C. Pigmentary mosaicism – Incorrect. Pigmentary mosaicism encompasses a heterogenous group of conditions characterized by varied patterns of hypopigmented or hyperpigmented lesions.
D. Waardenburg syndrome – Correct. The diagnosis of Waardenburg syndrome (WS) was made based on the Waardenburg Consortium criteria, which requires 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria. The patient met 2 major criteria (congenital sensorineural deafness, pigmentary abnormalities of the iris). In addition, she met one minor criteria (depigmented macules or patches).
E. Tuberous sclerosis complex – Incorrect. Tuberous sclerosis presents with hypopigmented, rather than depigmented, macules in addition to other cutaneous abnormalities as well as neurologic, cardiac, renal, and pulmonary disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitiligo, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, BAD 2022 guidelines recommend to elicit a full history in patients with vitiligo including the site and type of vitiligo (segmental, nonsegmental), disease extent (affected body surface area), disease stability, speed of onset, trigger factors, QoL, psychological and psychosocial impact, and personal and family history of associated thyroid dysfunction or other autoimmune disease.

### Basal cell carcinoma masquerading as vitiligo in a young woman [^113QMMPS]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition that presents with irregular patches of depigmentation commonly affecting individuals in their first few decades of life. In contrast, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) typically presents as a pink, pearly papule with telangiectasias and rarely affects younger individuals. This case emphasizes the importance of histologic evaluation in a patient with clinically diagnosed vitiligo refractory to treatment and raises suspicion when a patient with seemingly few risk factors for skin malignancy is evaluated.

3.2 Clinical features

In girls with LS, 94.6% present with anogenital lesions. The remaining 5.4% either have extragenital lesions only or have genital and extragenital involvement. The most common symptoms in girls are pruritus, pain, dysuria, and a burning sensation in the anogenital area. In 58–89% of the cases, constipation and gastrointestinal complaints are reported. Clinical signs are hypopigmentation, erythema, fissures, hyperpigmentation, atrophy, ecchymosis, and/or keratotic papules. Often a "figure‐of‐8" pattern is reported affecting the labia minora, clitoris, and perianal region. Erosions and can be present, often due to scratching. Vascular lesions such as angiokeratomas and telangiectasias are occasionally described and are usually asymptomatic. In a later stage, anatomic changes can be seen, such as labial fusion. Genital LS may be mistaken for sexual abuse. However, LS and sexual abuse are not mutually exclusive and, if suspected, abuse should be investigated.

The referral diagnoses for boys with LS are mostly clinical features such as phimosis (52%), balanitis (13%), or buried penis (10%), regardless of whether or not the LS has been recognized. The incidence of LS in non‐circumcised boys with phimosis ranges from 2 to 95%, the largest cohort studies reporting 10–50%. Boys with an acquired phimosis may have a greater risk of having LS than boys with congenital phimosis. Frequent symptoms subsequent to phimosis include urine retention, ballooning of the foreskin, dysuria, other urinary tract symptoms, and erectile pain. Hypopigmentation of the distal portion of the prepuce, seen as a white (sclerotic) ring, mostly results in progressive phimosis. Furthermore, erythema, pigmentary changes, telangiectasia, purpura, and scarring may be present. We found no mention of scrotal skin being affected. The perianal region of boys is rarely affected. Therefore, secondary constipation is uncommon. Extragenital LS is present in 0.4–6% of boys with LS.

### Genital warts: rapid evidence review [^114CHrs2]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for anogenital warts, more specifically with respect to biopsy, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose genital warts based on clinical assessment. Perform a biopsy in cases of uncertain diagnosis, lack of response to standard therapy, worsening of the condition during therapy, or presence of atypical lesions such as pigmented, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions.

### Hypochromic vitiligo: delineation of a new entity [^116Nn6K3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypochromic vitiligo is a rare entity that has been reported only twice under the term 'vitiligo minor', with an absence of clear delineation.

Objectives

To delineate hypochromic vitiligo through a case series of patients with typical bilateral hypopigmented lesions affecting the face and trunk.

Methods

This is a retrospective multicentric evaluation study conducted in eight departments of dermatology in France, Belgium, Senegal and Saudi Arabia.

Results

Twenty-four cases of hypochromic vitiligo were identified. Fourteen were men and 10 women. The mean age at diagnosis was 35.4 years (range 8–66). Strikingly, all patients were dark skinned, with skin types V and VI. The pattern of distribution was highly similar in most of the patients (18 of 24), with involvement of the face and neck area predominating on seborrhoeic areas associated with multiple isolated hypopigmented macules involving predominantly the scalp. The retrospective nature of this study is its main limitation.

Conclusions

Hypochromic vitiligo is not yet part of a conventional classification. The disease seems to be limited to individuals with dark skin types. Hypopigmented seborrhoeic face and neck involvement associated with hypopigmented macules of the trunk and scalp is the hallmark of the disease.

### NASPAG clinical opinion: diagnosis and management of lichen sclerosis in pediatric and adolescent patients [^114ge26Q]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

This Clinical Opinion replaces the NASPAG Clinical Recommendation: Pediatric Lichen Sclerosus published in 2014. The objective of this document is to provide guidance in the diagnosis and management of vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) in the pediatric and adolescent patient in order to treat patient symptoms and reduce long-term sequelae. LS is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the anogenital region that may present in the prepubertal or adolescent patient. Clinical presentations include significant pruritus, loss of pigmentation and vulvar adhesions with loss of normal vulvar architecture. Management includes topical agents for induction and maintenance therapy, as well as long-term follow-up for identification and treatment of recurrence and sequelae. This document is intended for use by both primary and specialty pediatric and adolescent gynecology (PAG) providers, including specialists in pediatrics, gynecology, adolescent medicine, and dermatology.

### Features of common skin disorders in pediatric patients with skin of color [^112VntUV]. Dermatologic Clinics (2022). Medium credibility.

Many dermatologic conditions common in the pediatric population may have unique presentations in skin of color or occur with greater incidence. This may be due to ethnic origin, socioeconomic factors, or other influences. Awareness of the potential variations in skin of color may enhance prompt diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and/or reassurance as indicated.

Figure 3.

HSV is commonly transmitted by different routes and can affect various areas of the body, most frequently the orofacial and genital regions. The prevalence of HSV-2 serotype is even higher among individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly those living in North America. Genital infections typically present with grouped, shallow vesicles that cause significant pain and discomfort. They often last 8–10 days before spontaneously regressing. In persons living with HIV, the clinical presentation of HSV infections can vary widely. Depending on the patient's immune status, HSV infections may last even longer and manifest more aggressively than they would in an immunocompetent patient.

A subset of HSV- and HIV-coinfected patients develop verrucous growths, and the pathophysiology of these lesions is not completely understood. The papillomatous lesions seen in our patient is a representative case of such atypical manifestations. It may be secondary to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after the initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). In another proposed mechanism, HIV infection causes dendritic cells to produce antiapoptotic cytokines that create an environment favorable to tissue proliferation.

### Lichen sclerosus: a review and practical approach [^111jUSjt]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic dermatitis predominantly found in the anogenital area. It can be found in patients of any age group, sex, or race, but is most commonly present in Caucasian peri- or postmenopausal women. Although the etiology of LS remains uncertain, an autoimmune process is believed to underlie this condition. With many cases going unreported, its incidence is still unknown. There is no cure for LS, but treatment offers control of the condition. They are three reasons for treating LS: relief of symptoms and discomfort; prevention of any or further anatomical changes; and a theoretical prevention of malignant transformation. Although many treatments have been suggested to treat LS over the years, only potent or ultra-potent corticosteroids remain as the treatment of choice. After initial therapy, some patients might only use corticosteroids as needed, while others may require a twice-weekly maintenance therapy. There is no place for surgery in uncomplicated LS. Surgery should be limited exclusively to patients with malignancy and to correct scarring secondary to the disease. Lichen sclerosus is associated with a 4–6% risk of squamous cell carcinoma, making long-term follow-up essential in these patients.

### Guidelines of care for the management of basal cell carcinoma [^112exvE1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Basal cell carcinoma research gaps — The expert work group acknowledges that much has yet to be learned regarding the optimal management of patients with BCC, identifying significant gaps that include the use and value of dermoscopy and other imaging modalities in diagnosis and the clinical and prognostic value of biomarkers that may aid in identifying tumors susceptible to targeted systemic therapy. Additional gaps include noninvasive treatment modalities with recurrence rates comparable to surgery and the optimal use of currently available systemic inhibitors of the hedgehog pathway, as well as identification of novel therapies able to achieve high response rates with a more tolerable side effect profile. Because recommendations are occasionally based on consensus rather than high-level evidence, management of BCC should therefore always be tailored to meet individual patients' needs.

### Genital vitiligo in children: factors associated with generalized, non-segmental vitiligo [^114XRsgy]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

It remains uncertain as to whether genital vitiligo of childhood is segmental or a forme fruste of non-segmental disease. This type of vitiligo is sometimes termed figure-of-eight disease due to female predominance and perineal and perianal hypopigmentation or depigmentation around two orifices, the anal and vaginal introitus. The objective of this series was to categorize the features of genital-limited vitiligo of childhood including comorbidities, family history, and long-term course.

Methods

IRB-approved retrospective chart review of vitiligo cases.

Results

Eight cases of vitiligo that began in childhood in the genital area were identified, including clinical course and comorbidities. Involvement of the contiguous skin, including inner thighs, buttocks, and scrotum, was noted in all males. In females, only 1 patient had other sites of vitiligo, which was a solitary lesion on the chest. Therapeutic response to topical corticosteroids for perianal skin was seen in five of six children and topical calcineurin inhibitors with or without calcipotriene in four out of four patients.

Conclusions

Segmental disease limited to the genitalia was more common in females than males, suggesting that perhaps intervention and work-up for comorbid autoimmune diseases may be required for males with genital-limited vitiligo at onset, but may be deferred in females and added if observation of spread is noted. Differentiation from lichen sclerosus et atrophicus may require biopsy.

### Diagnosing disorders of hypopigmentation and depigmentation in patients with skin of color [^111VuiTu]. Dermatologic Clinics (2023). Medium credibility.

Skin hypopigmentation and depigmentation disorders are a top concern for patients with skin of color seeking care from a dermatologist. The visual contrast between involved and uninvolved skin in these disorders makes them particularly burdensome for patients with skin of color. These disorders may have a wide differential of diagnosis, as patients with skin of color may present differently or more frequently than White patients for certain conditions. Clues from a comprehensive history and physical examination with standard lighting and a Wood's light are essential for clinching the diagnosis, although a biopsy may be warranted in special cases.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Cutaneous CD
B. Eruptive syringomas
C. Fox-Fordyce disease
D. Hidradenoma papilliferum (HPAP)
E. Steatocystoma multiplex (SM)

Answers:
A. Cutaneous CD – Incorrect. Cutaneous CD, previously referred to as metastatic CD, is characterized by well-formed granulomatous infiltrates of the skin, discontinuous from the affected gastrointestinal tract. Lesions typically present as ulcers, fistulae, fissures, or abscesses in perianal and orofacial areas.
B. Eruptive syringomas – Correct. Syringomas are benign adnexal tumors of the intradermal portion of the eccrine sweat duct. A wedge-shaped dermal mass of sweat glands within a noninflamed sclerotic stroma as seen in this case is diagnostic. Eruptive syringomas are a rare variant. Syringomas usually affect the periorbital area of middle-aged women and rarely the genital region. In a case series of 18 patients with vulvar syringomas, most presented with multiple flesh-colored or brownish papules and less commonly with whitish cystic papules or lichenoid plaques. While most syringomas are asymptomatic, those on the vulva are often pruritic, as observed in this patient.
C. Fox-Fordyce disease – Incorrect. Fox-Fordyce disease, also called apocrine miliaria, presents with pruritic papules in axillae and anogenital areas. The pathogenesis involves obstruction of the apocrine gland duct with keratin accumulation in the infundibulum.
D. HPAP – Incorrect. This rare, benign tumor of apocrine origin typically presents as an asymptomatic, skin-colored or reddish nodule in the anogenital region of women aged 30–50. Unlike syringomas, HPAP does not usually present as multiple papules.
E. SM – Incorrect. SM is an uncommon, benign hamartomatous malformation of the pilosebaceous junction, characterized by multiple asymptomatic cystic papules and nodules. SM rarely involves the vulva. Biopsy may be necessary to differentiate from syringomas.

### Pigmented vulvar lesions [^115DCYVy]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Pigmented lesions represent an enormous range of conditions, from benign to malignant tumors, and from infectious to post-inflammatory. Pigmented lesions are much less easily diagnosed on anogenital skin, and clinicians should have a low threshold for biopsy confirmation of diseases not classic in appearance.

### Management of an advanced case of basal cell carcinoma in a patient with albinism: considerations for working in low-and middle-income countries [^116YF1kM]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a disorder of melanin biosynthesis that results in hypopigmentation of the eye, skin, and hair. The most common cancers seen in individuals with albinism are basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinomas. Historically, people with albinism had been thought to be more likely to develop squamous cell carcinomas. However, recent evidence has highlighted an increase in the occurrence of BCCs in this population. Although it remains unclear which cancer is dominant for this population, it is thought that the long indolent course of BCC leads to underdiagnosis and late presentation. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where there are limited dermatologists, late presentation is unfortunately a common occurrence. In this report, we highlight the case of a Ugandan patient with OCA with delayed presentation of an advanced BCC of the face and the challenges of management in a low-resource setting.

### Generalized extragenital lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in skin of color [^115YjxPv]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that typically affects the anogenital regions, but the extragenital variants comprise 15% to 20% of all LSA cases. Furthermore, only 6% of the LSA cases are of extragenital lichen sclerosus (EGLS) alone, without any genital involvement. Given the rare nature of extragenital-only forms of LSA, there are limited reports on this entity, with 1 case reported in the population with darker skin. Here, we reported a case series of generalized EGLS et atrophicus in 3 patients with Fitzpatrick Iv to Vskin and use of topical ruxolitinib as therapy in 1 patient.

Summary Statement 12 — Anogenital dermatitis: Evaluate patients presenting with anogenital dermatitis for possible ACD to antigens contained in topically applied products. [Strength of Recommendation: Moderate; C Evidence] Allergic CD can cause anogenital dermatitis, with a total of 17% to 74% of patients presenting with anogenital dermatoses diagnosed with confirmed ACD to allergens contained in topically applied products; in a recent large retrospective study, 44% of patients with anogenital dermatitis (including 41% of women and 50% of men) were identified with ACD. The most common sources of antigens were topical medications, including TCS, fragrances, BOP, nickel sulfate, cinnamic aldehyde, and neomycin sulfate, while a total of 21% patients were diagnosed with ICD; in another series, the preservative MI and benzocaine were frequently identified as contact allergens, and methylisothiazolinone used in wet baby wipes has been identified as a sensitizer causing ACD involving the buttocks and perianal area in children.

### Recurrent hypopigmented macules and papules in a young male: an extragenital presentation of guttate lichen sclerosus [^115CpBrk]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Correct answer: B. GLS – Homogenous structureless white to pink areas with irregular linear vessels and comedone-like openings.

GLS is an uncommon extragenital variant of lichen sclerosus (LS) presenting as small, scattered, drop-like atrophic or shiny white macules and papules. While LS frequently involves the genital region, ∼15% to 20% of cases are extragenital. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by histopathology revealing lichenoid interface dermatitis, dermal collagen homogenization, and epidermal changes, including hyperkeratosis, loss of rete ridges, and follicular plugging. Dermoscopy may aid diagnosis, revealing patchy yellow-white to white-pink structureless areas, linear or dotted vessels, comedone-like openings, and white chrysalis-like structures with surrounding erythema. Irregular linear vessels have been reported in "early" lesions.

GLS can be differentiated from other lichenoid or sclerotic dermatoses clinically, histologically, and with dermoscopy. Inflammatory vitiligo, which may be guttate, lacks the lichenoid infiltrate and collagen changes seen in LS. Histology shows epidermal melanocyte loss, while dermoscopy reveals depigmented macules with perifollicular pigmententation and marginal erythema. Atrophic lichen planus may mimic LS clinically with a lichenoid interface dermatitis histologically. However, it lacks dermal collagen changes and exhibits wickham striae under dermoscopy. Guttate morphea may resemble GLS clinically but is distinguishable dermoscopically by white fibrotic beams. Histology reveals deeper dermal sclerosis without the lichenoid band and follicular plugging seen in LS. Malignant atrophic papulosis can resemble GLS but is a thrombo-obliterative vasculopathy with histological wedge-shape pallor in the deep dermis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the reticular dermis, and vasculopathic features such as fibrin and thrombi. Dermoscopy reveals a central porcelain-white area with surrounding telangiectasias.

Dermoscopy, alongside histology, is useful in evaluating patients with atrophic papules and macules and identifying cases of GLS. Given the genital predilection of LS, genital exam should also be considered for patients with GLS to support early diagnosis and prevent functional complications. This case highlights an uncommon extragenital LS presentation in a young male without genital involvement, underscoring the importance of recognizing GLS as a distinct variant and including it in the differential for hypopigmented macules and papules.

Treatment

The various treatment options for anogenital LS are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Treatment of anogenital lichen sclerosus

Emollients

In a prospective open-label trial, 34 women were treated with topical corticosteroid cream once daily for 1 month. Seventy-one percent became symptom free and 29% experienced a partial response. Maintenance therapy consisted of an emollient alone. Seventy percent of the women could maintain initial treatment response after a median follow-up of 58 months with cold cream alone. After induction of remission with topical corticosteroids in women with vulvar LS, Cattaneo et al. also observed a good symptomatic control of the disease with a maintenance therapy with an emollient cream alone during the follow-up of 24 weeks.

Topical Corticosteroids

Most patients with LS will respond to topical corticosteroids with relief of symptoms and clinical and histologic improvement. When patients with LS do not respond to topical corticosteroids of an adequate potency and a sufficient duration, diagnosis should be doubted and reappraised, and contact allergy to a constituent of the cream, secondary infections, or malignant evolution should be excluded.

For lack of sufficient long-term studies there are still concerns about the long-term safety of topical corticosteroids. Feared adverse effects of long-term, topical corticosteroid maintenance treatment are atrophy, striae formation, rebound reactions, fungal infections, reactivation of human papilloma virus (HPV) and herpes simplex virus infection, or systemic absorption.

### Cluster of pigmented macules in a pediatric patient [^1156jwPx]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 13-year-old girl in good health presented with a cluster of pigmented lesions on the body that had been present since childhood. Upon examination, multiple brown, evenly pigmented macules were found to be present in the right scapular region, with sharp delineation at the midline (Fig 1); additionally, a few pigmented macules were found on the right buccal cheek (Fig 2) as well as right axillary freckling (Fig 3).

Question 1: What is the likely diagnosis in this patient?
A. Lentigo solaris
B. Partial unilateral lentiginosis (PUL)
C. Nevus of Ito
D. Speckled lentiginous nevus
E. Zosteriform lentiginous nevus

Answers:
A. Lentigo solaris – Incorrect. Lentigo solaris, also known as solar lentigo, is characterized by lentigines present on sun-exposed skin and is more commonly seen in older individuals. Histologically, there may be an increased number of melanocytes producing excess melanin, elongation of rete ridges, and solar elastosis within the dermis. This is in contrast to partial unilateral lentiginosis (PUL), which would look similar to lentigo simplex histologically; however, differences may arise in patient age, the clinical distribution of lesions, and histologic findings of solar elastosis.
B. Partial unilateral lentiginosis (PUL) – Correct. PUL is a rare disorder of aberrant pigmentation characterized by multiple lentigines with a unilateral segmental pattern and may follow ≥ 1 dermatomal distributions. These lesions typically present at birth or during childhood, becoming darker and more widespread with age. The presence of lentigines in a distinctive distribution indicates the need for a thorough physical examination to rule out any associated syndromes, including but not limited to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), LEOPARD (Lentigines, Electrocardiographic conduction defects, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormalities of the genitals, Retarded growth, Deafness) syndrome, and Carney complex.
C. Nevus of Ito – Incorrect. Nevus of Ito is a pigmented patch that is blue to gray-brown in color and is unilaterally located on the neck and shoulder. These nevi are typically present at birth and may mimic Mongolian spots.
D. Speckled lentiginous nevus – Incorrect. Speckled lentiginous nevus, also known as nevus spilus, appears as small, dark macules superimposed on a lighter pigmented patch. PUL may commonly be misdiagnosed as nevus spilus; however, PUL appears as brown macules on normal skin, without an associated background of lighter pigmentation.
E. Zosteriform lentiginous nevus – Incorrect. Zosteriform lentiginous nevus is from the family of nevus spilus; however, these lesions have more of a dermatomal arrangement.

### Unsuccessful treatment of extragenital lichen sclerosus with topical 1% pimecrolimus cream [^117WP8mf]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus most commonly affects the anogenital region. Spreading into the extragenital regions is rare, and its course is most commonly asymptomatic. Women have been reported to be affected 6 to 10 times more often than men. The etiology of lichen sclerosus is still unknown. The disease is characterized by ivory-white atrophic plaques, and no treatment ensuring complete recovery is available. T-cells are also involved in its pathogenesis. Pimecrolimus is a topical inhibitor of T-cells. In the present paper, we present a male patient with lichen sclerosus located only in extragenital regions and report an unsuccessful outcome of treatment with pimecrolimus 1% cream administered topically twice a day for 16 weeks.

### Localized involutional lipoatrophy with epidermal and dermal changes [^114fSiWc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Localized involutional lipoatrophy (LIL) was first described in 1986 as a distinctive idiopathic form of localized lipoatrophy characterized by loss of adipose tissue without antecedent inflammation. Clinically, LIL usually presents as a solitary, asymptomatic, well-demarcated, atrophic depression and often involves areas of antecedent intramuscular or intra-articular injections. Histologically, changes in the subcutaneous fat in LIL resemble fetal adipose tissue. Only rarely has there been any description of epidermal or dermal changes occurring with LIL. We describe two cases of LIL with overlying hypopigmentation and atrophy, and with morphea-like changes on histology. Recognition of these changes may have clinical and diagnostic implications.

### Common causes of hypopigmentation in children [^112bKqnC]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Disorders of hypopigmentation are relatively common in children. Hypopigmentation refers to decreased pigmentation compared with surrounding skin, and depigmentation refers to a complete loss of pigmentation. The most common acquired causes include post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, pityriasis alba, vitiligo, tinea versicolor, and halo nevi. Commonly, congenital hypopigmented lesions may be attributed to pigmentary mosaicism, a term that refers to hypo- or hyperpigmentation resulting from somatic mosaicism. Pigmentary mosaicism most commonly occurs without syndromic association, such as in the case of nevus depigmentosus; however, rarely it can occur as part of a syndrome that may require further workup with genetic testing, such as with the hypomelanotic macules of tuberous sclerosis complex. Although most of the conditions causing hypopigmentation and depigmentation in children are benign, rare instances may be associated with syndromes or rare dermatoses that require further workup by a specialist. Given their common presentation to the general pediatrician, this article aims to cover the most common causes of hypo- and depigmentation in children, along with their differentiating features, natural history and prognosis, first-line treatment, and indications for further evaluation.

### Vitiligoid variant of lichen sclerosus in young girls with darker skin types [^114Kqifm]. Pediatric Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Vitiligo and lichen sclerosus are autoimmune disorders characterized by white discoloration, and both frequently affect the anogenital region. Vitiligoid lichen sclerosus refers to a superficial variant of lichen sclerosus in which the lesion appears clinically to be vitiligo based on the predominant presentation of depigmentation and minimal inflammation and sclerosis but histologically is consistent with lichen sclerosus. A limited number of reports have described vitiligoid lichen sclerosus, and from these reports, it appears to primarily affect darker-skinned people.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 7 girls with darker skin types seen in our pediatric dermatology clinic who presented with a clinical overlap of vitiligo and lichen sclerosus. All had primarily well-demarcated, depigmented patches characteristic of vitiligo, but the lesions were symptomatic (pruritus, pain, bleeding, constipation), a presentation more consistent with lichen sclerosus.

Results

The girls were all treated with high-potency topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or both. The associated symptoms improved or resolved, but most had minimal improvement of the depigmentation.

Conclusions

The girls presented in this series appear to have had vitiligoid lichen sclerosus, given the clinical overlap of lichen sclerosus and vitiligo affecting the anogenital region, particularly given that they did not have depigmented patches elsewhere on their body. Previous cases of vitiligoid lichen sclerosus have been reported in darker skin types, and our findings support this possible predisposition. It is important for clinicians to assess patients presenting with genital depigmentation for overlapping features of vitiligo and lichen sclerosus and determine appropriate management.

### Desquamative erythematous rash in a young woman [^114KRvXb]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Zinc deficiency
B. Niacin deficiency
C. Biotin deficiency
D. Vitamin A deficiency
E. Protein deficiency

Answers:
A. Incorrect – Zinc deficiency leading to acrodermatitis enteropathica may present similarly with sharply demarcated erythematous, dry, scaly patches with superficial erosions. However, she did not have the typical distribution of rashes involving the periorificial, anogenital, and acral regions. There was also an absence of alopecia, nail changes, and diarrhea. Eventually, her serum zinc levels were found to be 754 ug/L (normal: 724–1244 ug/L).
B. Incorrect – Niacin deficiency leading to pellagra may present with rashes on the neck and upper portion of the chest resembling a "Casal necklace", a clinical sign comprising of a well-demarcated band of erythematous and hyperpigmented scaly rash around the neck. However, her flexural rashes were not photo-distributed. She had no other systemic symptoms besides deliberate weight loss. However, her niacin levels returned normal at 2.45 ug/mL (normal: 0.5–8.45ug/mL).
C. Correct – Biotin deficiency was suspected as biotin is a cofactor for zinc homeostasisin the skin. Mucocutaneous manifestations of biotin deficiency usually present 3 to 6 months after the onset of deficiency. They include acrodermatitis enteropathica-like rashes (often periorificial), erosions on flexural folds, alopecia, blepharoconjunctivitis, onychoschizia, and hyperesthesia. A low-serum biotin level was found in our patient at 0.2 ng/mL (normal ≥ 0.3 ng/mL). Although she did not present with all the mucocutaneous features of biotin deficiency, the replacement of biotin resulted in significant improvement and eventual resolution of her rashes within a few weeks. There has been no recurrence while she was on biotin supplementation. We postulate that the rashes may favor flexural location due to bending movements and friction, which cause the breakdown of the epidermis composed of degenerating keratinocytes due to the underlying nutritional deficiency. The patient was eventually prescribed high-dose oral biotin supplementation (10,000 mcg twice daily) in addition to multivitamins with the improvement of her rashes within a few days, which subsequently resolved in 3 weeks. She remains free of recurrence over the next one year after receiving biotin supplementation. In addition, she was also referred to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa.
D. Incorrect – Patients with vitamin A deficiency may manifest as phrynoderma, which are clusters of follicular papules with central keratotic plugs. Histologic findings include keratinous plugs within follicles, hyperkeratosis, and sebaceous gland atrophy. Our patient did not have such skin or histologic findings, and her vitamin A levels were 0.46 mg/L (normal: 0.26–0.72 mg/L).
E. Incorrect – Kwashiorkor is an acute form of protein-energy malnutrition. Although patients with kwashiorkor can develop erythematous rashes with erosions and desquamation resembling "flaky paint", characteristic findings are peripheral edema or anasarca in association with hypoalbuminemia. This patient did not have any peripheral edema, and her serum albumin levels were normal at 44 g/L (normal: 38–48 g/L).

### Pigmentation disorders: hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation [^112oFZCv]. Clinics in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pigmentation disorders include a large number of heterogeneous conditions that are usually characterized by altered melanocyte density, melanin concentration, or both, and result in altered pigmentation of the skin. Some of these disorders are extremely common (melasma, vitiligo), whereas others are rare. In this contribution, we review the most common pigmentation disorders that appear on the face. These lesions, even though mostly asymptomatic, have a great impact on a patient's quality of life.

### A mysterious white rash [^114Q1THa]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Pityriasis alba
B. Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor
C. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation
D. Progressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH)
E. Vitiligo

Answers:
A. Pityriasis alba — Incorrect. Pityriasis alba is a skin condition of hypopigmentation that is associated with atopic dermatitis. It predominantly affects children, and lesions typically involve the face. Wood's lamp examination does not accentuate the hypopigmentation or exhibit perifollicular fluorescence.
B. Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor — Incorrect. Like PMH, tinea versicolor is characterized by macular areas of hypopigmentation that typically involve the chest and upper portion of the back. However, tinea versicolor would be expected to improve with antifungal medications and does not exhibit red-orange perifollicular fluorescence under Wood's lamp examination. Instead, black-light illumination of skin affected by tinea versicolor reveals a yellow-orange fluorescence of the yeast. Additionally, potassium hydroxide examination characteristically reveals hyphae and yeast in a "spaghetti and meatballs" pattern.
C. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation — Incorrect. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation describes the loss of pigment in the skin after the resolution of an inflammatory process. The pathogenesis is thought to be due to the loss of functional melanocytes but is not completely understood. Wood's lamp examination does not accentuate hypopigmentation or reveal perifollicular fluorescence.
D. PMH — Correct. PMH is a skin condition of hypopigmentation that was undescribed in the scientific literature until 1988. It is clinically characterized by macular areas of hypopigmentation, typically on the chest or back, which exhibit perifollicular red-orange fluorescence under Wood's lamp examination. This characteristic finding with such an examination was first described by Wu et al in 2010. In their study of 21 patients with a previous diagnosis of PMH and with a previous negative potassium hydroxide test result, all 21 had perifollicular fluorescence with the application of black light. This finding has not been shown to be associated with any other hypomelanotic conditions and may therefore be considered pathognomonic for PMH. Currently, there are reports of cases studied with dermatoscopy; however, in hospitals in which there is no such tool or experience is limited, the use of Wood's lamp is an excellent method of differentiating PMH from other conditions of hypopigmentation, thus avoiding misdiagnoses and unnecessary treatments. This report supports the utility of Wood's lamp as a diagnostic tool for hypopigmented lesions.
E. Vitiligo — Incorrect. Vitiligo is an acquired disorder characterized by macules and patches of depigmentation that result from a progressive loss of functional melanocytes. Although clinical presentation may be similar to that of PMH, Wood's lamp examination of areas affected by vitiligo does not reveal red-orange perifollicular fluorescence and demonstrates complete depigmentation rather than the hypopigmentation of PMH.

### Lichen sclerosus [^11317Cb1]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is an inflammatory skin disease predominantly affecting the anogenital region. If untreated, progressive sclerosis results in scarring with distortion of the normal architecture. LS occurs more commonly in women than men but may occur in all age groups, including adolescents and prepubertal children. Its exact prevalence is unknown, but estimates range from 1:60 to 1:1000. In this article, LS is discussed in detail with respect to disease management in adults and children, risk of malignancy, and association with other diseases.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^111zKMoH]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of LS is usually clinical. When the clinical features are typical, histologic examination is not always essential. However, in the early stages of the disease the diagnosis can be difficult. The main differential diagnoses are lichen planus (LP), lichen simplex chronicus, vitiligo, immunobullous disorders such as mucous membrane pemphigoid and vulvar or penile intraepithelial neoplasia. In clinically inconclusive cases, a histologic examination is advisable and might close the gap, but should never be interpreted in isolation. One-third of men having sufficient symptoms and signs to be clinically diagnosed with LS, showed only nonspecific histology on biopsy or in the circumcised prepuce. A nonspecific biopsy does not rule out LS, but classic histologic findings confirm the diagnosis. Patients under routine follow-up will need a biopsy if: (1) there is a suspicion of neoplastic change, i.e. a persistent area of hyperkeratosis, persistent erosion, or erythema, or new warty or papular lesions; (2) there is an area resistant to adequate treatment; (3) there is extragenital LS, with features suggesting an overlap with morphea; (4) there are pigmented areas, in order to exclude an abnormal melanocytic proliferation; and (5) second-line therapy is to be used.

There are instances when it can be impossible to differentiate between LS and LP either on the basis of the clinical or the histologic features (Table 1). These cases are described as overlap syndrome and often show poor response to treatment.

Distinguishing features between lichen sclerosus and lichen planus

Clinical Features

Female Anogenital Lichen Sclerosus (LS): Adults

Meyrick Thomas et al. studied 350 women with clinically typical and histologically confirmed LS. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 45.5 years. In 9% of women the onset of LS was in prepuberty, in 41% in the reproductive years, and in 50% postmenopause. Cooper et al. studied a total of 253 women and 74 girls with the typical clinical features of vulvar LS. Twenty-three percent of the patients were premenarchal, 17% in their reproductive years, and 60% postmenopausal. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 5.4 years for girls and 55.1 years for women. The mean age at diagnosis was 7.6 years for girls and 60 years for women.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^116E7sMY]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

In a group of 30 prepubertal girls with anogenital LS, 6.6% had an associated autoimmune disease (vitiligo and alopecia areata), and 56% of their parents or grandparents did.

In men, the association with autoimmune disease is weaker. In a study of 35 men with LS, 6% had an associated autoimmune disease and 19% had a positive family history for autoimmune disease. Another study showed that only 3% of 58 men with LS had a personal history of autoimmune disease, and 10% had a first-degree relative with an autoimmune disease. In a case-control study, 73 men with LS were compared with 219 controls. Vitiligo (12% vs. 0%) and alopecia areata (12% vs. 1%) were significantly more common in patients than in controls. A family history of diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, alopecia areata, or thyroid disease and the presence of other autoimmune diseases were identified as risk factors for male LS.

Alopecias are traditionally categorized by the presence or absence of scarring and by a diffuse or localized pattern. A common clinical conundrum is that of a woman presenting with the chief complaint of diffuse, nonscarring hair loss. We review the 4 main diagnostic possibilities for this clinical scenario: (1) female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia), (2) acute and chronic telogen effluvium, (3) diffuse alopecia areata, and (4) loose anagen syndrome. We also outline our approach to the individual patient, emphasizing the pertinent history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic testing. This approach usually allows the clinician to make a definitive diagnosis or limited differential diagnosis and to offer the patient therapeutic options.

### Generalized extragenital lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in skin of color [^116z9deb]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

LSA is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology, although hereditary, endocrine, infectious, and autoimmune factors are suggested to be involved. Antibodies to extracellular matrix protein-1 have been suggested to be involved in the mechanism of LS.LSA has been associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, systemic lupus, vitiligo, alopecia areata, and Graves' disease, among others. LS can occur in both men and women but is more prevalent in women. Although the anal and genital regions are predominantly affected, EGLS comprises of 15% to 20% of all LS cases. Genital LS has a bimodal distribution, with 1 peak at puberty and another at menopause, whereas EGLS usually occurs in middle-aged adults. The most common symptoms are intractable pruritus and pain. The average age of patients with EGLS in this series is 75 years, which is significantly higher than that reported previously. All cases have Fitzpatrick skin type IV to V which has not been reported previously.

EGLS presents as asymptomatic white opalescent papules, patches, plaques, and erosions favoring the upper portion of the back, neck, and shoulders, and may become atrophic with time and appear parchment-like. The primary lesion begins as asymptomatic to mildly pruritic polygonal white papules that coalesce into well-demarcated erythematous plaques that become atrophic. Patients can frequently present with purpura. In patients with skin of color, EGLS can have various degrees of hypo- or hyperpigmentation.

Diagnosis of EGLS can be made clinically and confirmed histopathologically. Dermatoscopy shows multiple patchy yellow-white structures, scales, keratotic plugs, pseudo-pigment-like pattern, and chrysalis structures.EGLS characteristics vary histologically based on the duration of the disease. Early disease is characterized by interface dermatitis with vacuolar/lichenoid changes. Progressive changes include follicular plugging, upper dermal sclerosis with a band of hyalinization, and inflammatory infiltrate. Late-stage disease is characterized by epidermal atrophy, loss of rete ridges, upper dermal sclerosis, and scanty inflammatory cellular infiltrates.

### Unusual lesion on the vulva of a postmenopausal woman [^116zcMQ2]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Focal vitiligo – Incorrect. Although vitiligo can present as an isolated itchy, hypopigmented patch at its initial inflammatory phase, the histopathologic features exclude the diagnosis of vitiligo.
B. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation – Incorrect. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation is an important differential diagnosis in this case, as the patient was undergoing vaginal laser rejuvenation at the time of presentation. However, given the age of the patient, the symptomatic nature of the lesion, and the unclear history of the preceding inflammatory dermatoses, a skin punch biopsy was considered.
C. EMPD – Correct. The skin biopsy finding in Fig 2 is consistent with EMPD, showing characteristic large round atypical intraepithelial cells with abundant pale cytoplasm (Paget cells) arranged singly or in clusters with dermal invasion. Pigmentary skin changes, such as hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, may be seen in association with a classic slowly expanding eczematous plaque of EMPD. However, EMPD masquerading as a subtle hypopigmented patch is highly uncommon. Interestingly, our patient was found to have invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast during staging workup. The patient underwent wide local excision of the EMPD lesion with a transposition flap closure. However, as the excision margins were infiltrated by tumor cells, the patient subsequently received radiation therapy. This case highlights that an isolated hypopigmented patch on the genital skin in an elderly patient can be an early sign of EMPD, and the consideration of an early diagnostic biopsy can avoid a poor outcome. Depigmented EMPD has been previously reported in few case reports and one case series from Japan and Taiwan.
D. Dermatomycosis – Incorrect. Dermatomycosis usually present as an annular scaly plaque. The histopathologic features observed in this case do not support the diagnosis of dermatomycosis.
E. Early lichen sclerosus – Incorrect. An early stage of lichen sclerosus may present as a single ivory white sclerotic plaque; however, typical sites are the inter-labial sulcus and labium minus.

### Acquired disorders with depigmentation: a systematic approach to vitiliginoid conditions [^113QeMKp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acquired disorders with depigmentation are commonly encountered by dermatologists and present with a wide differential diagnosis. Vitiligo, the most common disorder of acquired depigmentation, is characterized by well-defined depigmented macules and patches. Other conditions, such as chemical leukoderma, can present with similar findings, and are often easily mistaken for vitiligo. Key clinical features can help differentiate between acquired disorders of depigmentation. The first article in this continuing medical education series focuses on conditions with a vitiligo-like phenotype. Early recognition and adequate treatment of these conditions is critical in providing appropriate prognostication and treatment.

### Pruritus: diagnosis and management [^113paMho]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Pruritus is the sensation of itching; it can be caused by dermatologic and systemic conditions. An exposure history may reveal symptom triggers. A thorough skin examination, including visualization of the finger webs, anogenital region, nails, and scalp, is essential. Primary skin lesions indicate diseased skin, and secondary lesions are reactive and result from skin manipulation, such as scratching. An initial evaluation for systemic causes may include a complete blood count with differential, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, liver function tests, iron studies, fasting glucose or A1C level, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Additional testing, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HIV screening, hepatitis serologies, and chest radiography, may also be appropriate based on the history and physical examination. In the absence of primary skin lesions, physicians should consider evaluation for malignancy in older patients with chronic generalized pruritus. General management includes trigger avoidance, liberal emollient use, limiting water exposure, and administration of oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. If the evaluation for multiple etiologies of pruritus is ambiguous, clinicians may consider psychogenic etiologies and consultation with a specialist.

### Diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus: an update [^115NPJpF]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Female Anogenital LS

Since the first published small study showing the effectiveness of ultrapotent topical corticosteroids in the treatment of adult vulvar LS, several authors have confirmed these positive results. Topical ultrapotent corticosteroids gave improvement of symptoms in nearly all patients, complete relief of symptoms in about 70%, and complete remission of skin changes in one-fifth of women with anogenital LS. Thirteen women with vulvar LS treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream twice daily for 12 weeks showed a significant reduction in epidermal atrophy, hyperkeratosis, epidermal basal cell liquefaction, inflammatory infiltrate, and hyalinization of dermal collagen after treatment. In four of the biopsies, no specific features of LS remained after 12 weeks of treatment. There are no randomized controlled trials providing evidence on how often, how long, and in which potency the corticosteroids are to be applied. However, the recent British Association of Dermatologists guidelines advocate their use and propose a detailed regimen. They recommend for a newly diagnosed case to apply clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment once daily at night for 4 weeks, then on alternate nights for 4 weeks, and then twice weekly for a further 4 weeks. If symptoms should recur with reduced frequency the patient should use the treatment more often until symptoms resolve. An ointment formulation is usually better tolerated than a cream base.

### Management of dyschromias in ethnic skin [^114kmkqT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Pigmentary disorders are one of the most common skin disorders among people of color. Dyspigmentation in the form of either hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation is often psychologically devastating to patients with darker skin. There is marked contrast between normally pigmented hyperpigmented, hypopigmented or depigmented skin in people of color. Despite being common, pigmentary disorders remain difficult to treat.

Five patients who presented stable bands of hair of a different color with respect to the surrounding hair are reported. In 4 patients this was an isolated finding. One patient also had diffuse linear skin hypopigmentation and other abnormalities. We hypothesize that these 5 cases represent a distinct type of hair heterochromia, possibly because of somatic mosaicism for genes affecting pigmentation.

### Clinical recommendation: pediatric lichen sclerosus [^113gBRny]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the anogenital region that may present in the prepubertal or adolescent patient. Clinical presentations include significant pruritus, labial adhesions, and loss of pigmentation. Treatment includes topical anti-inflammatory agents and long-term follow-up as there is a high risk of recurrence and an increased risk of vulvar cancer in adult women with history of lichen sclerosus. These recommendations are intended for pediatricians, gynecologists, nurse practitioners and others who care for pediatric/adolescent girls in order to facilitate diagnosis and treatment.

### Patterned cutaneous hypopigmentation phenotype characterization: a retrospective study in 106 children [^111eXpr6]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cutaneous patterned hypopigmentation's phenotype is highly variable and may be associated with extracutaneous anomalies.

Objective

We evaluated the phenotypic and clinical characteristics of patients with cutaneous patterned hypopigmentation to determine whether certain patterns were more likely to be associated with underlying anomalies.

Methods

The charts of 106 children with cutaneous patterned hypopigmentation were reviewed retrospectively (2007–2018) at Sainte-Justine University Hospital Centre, in Montreal, Canada. Retrieved information included sex, age at diagnosis, phototype, pattern, and distribution of the cutaneous lesions and the presence of extracutaneous findings. Data were recorded on a software tool which collects and analyzes phenotypic information.

Results

The predominant types of cutaneous patterned hypopigmentation were along Blaschko's lines in narrow (38.7%) and broad bands (53.8%). Mixed patterns were observed in 22.5% of children. The anterior trunk and posterior trunk were most frequently affected (69% and 56%, respectively). Extracutaneous involvement, especially neurological and developmental, was present in 28.3% of patients and was significantly associated with ≥ 4 involved body sites.

Conclusion

Distribution and types of cutaneous patterned hypopigmentation were not predictive of extracutaneous findings, with the exception of multiple sites involvement and possibly centrofacial location and blocklike lesions. Follow-up until school entry should help identify subtler associated extracutaneous anomalies.

### Peri-clitoral epidermal inclusion cyst as initial presentation of lichen sclerosus in a pediatric patient [^115k6qgj]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder, presenting with pruritis and hypopigmentation of the vulvar and anogenital skin. LS presenting as a peri-clitoral mass has not been previously described.

Case

A 5-year-old patient with vulvar pruritis and ultrasound showing a homogenous mass was referred for suspected clitoromegaly with normal labs. Examination demonstrated a prepubertal patient with a mobile, soft, peri-clitoral mass and surrounding hypopigmentation consistent with LS. The cyst was excised surgically; pathology revealed an epidermal inclusion cyst. Postoperatively, she began using topical steroids for LS with symptom resolution.

Conclusion

Thorough workup of clitoromegaly negative for hormonal causes requires further investigation to determine an alternative etiology of the mass. We suspect that inflammatory changes of LS and pruritus resulted in the peri-clitoral inclusion cyst.

### Enhancing awareness of vitiligoid vulvar lichen sclerosus: an underrecognized variant in patients with skin of color [^116AwXj8]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Table I
Clinical findings

Although VVLS may present with architectural changes, it is important to note that in case 3, there were no architectural changes noted at the initial presentation. This case underscores the need to acknowledge symptoms in the absence of architectural changes and pursue biopsy with uncertainty regarding diagnosis. Our work highlights the need to raise awareness to avoid misdiagnosis in patients with skin of color because currently there is a gap in the literature regarding this variant of VLS in the adult population as it has primarily been reported in the pediatric population.

Our cases demonstrate the need for physician recognition of vulvar symptoms and signs to delineate VLS versus VV when patients with skin of color present with depigmented patches on the vulva, perineum, and perianal area. Enhancing awareness of the variant, VVLS, can significantly contribute to improving the accuracy of the diagnosis. This is especially important because patients who are compliant with long-term topical corticosteroid therapy for VLS have significant differences in architecture changes and incidence of vulvar carcinoma. The cases we presented in this series demonstrate the similarity in appearance of VV and VVLS that may result in diagnostic and treatment delay.

### Possible role of psoralen-induced phototoxicity in the development of vitiligo [^115SsAik]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 60-year-old woman presented to our dermatology clinic with multiple depigmented lesions located symmetrically on her arms, legs, and trunk. The patient stated that the lesions appeared following a severe, blistering sunburn acquired during a beach vacation approximately 1 year prior to her current evaluation. On the day the patient obtained the burn, the weather was sunny with a temperature of approximately 15.5 °C. Her sun exposure was limited to 3 hours while wearing sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 30. The patient was joined by her biologic sister, who did not display any signs of sun damage or photosensitivity. A review of social history revealed that the patient had been on a "celery juice cleanse" prior to the vacation. She gained the inspiration from a health blogger's social media campaign endorsing the unregulated, unmeasured consumption of celery juice. The patient explained that she consumed a minimum of 4 glasses of celery juice per week for 6 months prior to the trip.

The patient denied any previous medical conditions, including diabetes, thyroid disorders, pernicious anemia, psoriasis, or alopecia areata. Additionally, she denied any previous observation of similar lesions or any personal or familial history of pigmentation disorders. However, she recalled experiencing a slight tingling sensation in her extremities leading up to the incidence of the sunburn that seemed to correlate with sun exposure, suggestive of photosensitivity.

A previous consultation with a dermatologist 3 months after her initial burn confirmed a provisional diagnosis of photosensitivity reaction with no treatment or follow up advised. In seeking a second opinion, the patient was seen in our clinic, and the attending physician diagnosed vitiligo due to the presence of several well-demarcated, depigmented lesions located bilaterally and symmetrically on the arms, legs, and trunk present for more than 1 year (Fig 1). The patient also had a halo nevus located on the right shin. Serum values for thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4, T3, and vitamin D were within the normal ranges. Furthermore, the patient denied any history of dermatitis or any other skin conditions that would lead to postinflammatory hypopigmentation.

### Characteristics among premenarchal girls with lichen sclerosus [^1156NXDj]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Lichen sclerosus (LS), a chronic inflammatory dermatosis localized in the anogenital region, is known to be associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in postmenopausal women; however, there is a paucity of data on prepubertal girls. We sought to characterize the relationship between LS, LUTS, and constipation among premenarchal girls.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of premenarchal girls presenting at the pediatric adolescent gynecology and pediatric urology clinics at our institution diagnosed with vulvar LS during a 4-year period. Demographics, clinical presentation, time from onset of urinary and/or bowel symptoms to LS diagnosis, and treatment response were assessed. Analysis was completed using median, range, and nonparametric statistical analysis where appropriate.

Results

Nineteen premenarchal girls with LS met inclusion criteria. The median age at LS diagnosis was 6.2 years (range = 3.3–13.3 yrs). Most girls (12/19, 63.2%) presented with LUTS during LS evaluation, and 11 (57.9%) of 19 patients had constipation. Pruritus and hypopigmentation were the most frequently encountered LS symptom and sign, respectively. Fourteen (73.7%) of the 19 girls had resolution/improvement of LS symptoms after LS treatment. Of the 12 patients with LUTS, 7 (58.3%) had resolution/improvement of LUTS symptoms, 3 (25.0%) had unchanged voiding symptoms, and 2 (16.7%) had unknown changes.

Conclusions

Although further studies are needed to better characterize the relationship between LUTS, constipation, and LS, our findings suggest that premenarchal subjects presenting with LUTS should be assessed for LS. Likewise, patients presenting with LS should be assessed for LUTS and constipation.

Lichen planopilaris is a primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia that commonly presents with hair loss at the vertex or parietal scalp. Patients may also have associated scalp itching, burning or tenderness. Due to scarring, hair loss is typically permanent. The main goals of treatment are reducing symptoms and preventing disease progression and further hair loss. Currently, the literature has limited evidence on treatments for this difficult condition, and most available evidence is from case reports and case series. Furthermore, the evidence shows a varied response to therapy, with frequent reports of poor response. This article reviews the diagnosis of this rare disease, summarize the currently available treatments, and provide insights and practices from alopecia experts.

### Enhancing awareness of vitiligoid vulvar lichen sclerosus: an underrecognized variant in patients with skin of color [^111Dr6er]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

VLS is a chronic inflammatory dermatosis commonly presenting with pruritus and atrophic pale plaques that may result in sequalae of scarring, architectural changes, dyspareunia, and increased risk of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. In skin of color, VLS may present with depigmentation rather than hypopigmentation or pallor thus mimicking vitiligo.VLS does not currently have a definitive pathogenesis but has supporting autoimmune etiology with a bimodal incidence in prepubescent girls and menopausal women. A diagnosis of VLS may be achieved based on clinical history however with diagnostic uncertainty or atypical features, histopathology should be performed for confirmation. Histologically confirmed VLS may include findings of epidermal hyperkeratosis, dermal sclerosis, and a band-like inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrate within the dermis. Because of the risk of scarring and squamous cell carcinoma associated with VLS, it is imperative for physicians to recognize this variant to ensure effective long-term management.

In this case series, all 3 patients were presumed to have a diagnosis of VV and were started on treatment that resulted in refractory symptoms of pruritus of the vulva (Table I). All patients subsequently received a histopathologic confirmed and revised diagnosis of VVLS. Specifically, in the third case, a SOX10 stain was performed revealing a reduction of melanocytes supporting a clinicopathologic diagnosis of VVLS. VLS resembling vitiligo has previously been reported in the literature in patients with vitiligoid lesions with histologically proven lichen sclerosus. The coexistence of lichen sclerosus and vitiligo in some patients may be explained by both conditions being driven by autoimmune etiology. Further, it has been suspected that lichenoid inflammation may prompt an autoimmune response against melanocytes. In a review of 266 patients with lichen sclerosus and VV, 15 patients were found to have VVLS, 3 of which occurred in the genital area. Although not found to be the case in the patients presented above, the coexistence of VLS and VV may also be observed and should be considered should symptoms develop such as pruritus, sensitivity, and dyspareunia in a patient with a known diagnosis of vitiligo.

### A folliculocentric variant of extragenital lichen sclerosus presenting in a 29-year-old man [^115v2eZA]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by hypopigmented atrophic macules, papules, patches, plaques, and erosions. About 85% of LS cases involve the anogenital region, while the remaining case are extragenital. Some patients present with both types of involvement. Extragenital LS is more common in women and typically occurs on the trunk or extremities. We present an unusual case of folliculocentric extragenital lichen sclerosus in a man and demonstrate the use of dermoscopy in helping to make this diagnosis.

### Persistent perianal "warts" [^116QAvrH]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
A. Condyloma acuminata
B. Darier disease (DD)
C. Hypertrophic herpes simplex virus infection
D. Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD)
E. Giant condyloma of Buschke-Löwenstein

Answers:
A. Condyloma acuminata – Incorrect. Condyloma acuminata is caused by the human papillomavirus and appears as papular, verrucous lesions. This is less likely in the absence of a positive contact/sexual history. The presence of erosions in her axillae and positive family history suggests HHD.
B. DD – Incorrect. DD presents as hyperkeratotic papules to plaques that favor a seborrheic distribution. Nail involvement is common. While limited perianal disease may appear similar to condylomata and HHD, the positive family history of erosions in intertriginous areas is more suggestive of HHD.
C. Hypertrophic herpes simplex virus infection – Incorrect. Hypertrophic herpes simplex virus presents as ulcerated nodules in the anogenital region and are episodic. HIV coinfection is a strong predisposing factor and is absent here.
D. HHD – Correct. HHD presents as inconspicuous, fragile vesicles that progress to macerated erosions and crusting, mainly in intertriginous areas. Limited disease in the perianal region frequently presents in the papular form, as in this patient. Her father also had HHD.
E. Giant condyloma of Buschke-Löwenstein – Incorrect. This condition is a low-grade, well-differentiated, verrucous variant of squamous cell carcinoma and may present in the anogenital region as a slow-growing, warty tumor. These squamous cell carcinoma variants tend to appear larger and more protuberant.

### Erythematous scaly plaques with erosions in a 4-month-old [^115e8o9k]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answer:
A. Acrodermatitis enteropathica – Incorrect. While acrodermatitis enteropathica has similar skin findings, it classically presents in infants shortly after weaning due to impaired intestinal zinc absorption in the infant. This exclusively breastfed infant presented with rash while breastfeeding, indicating insufficient zinc levels in maternal milk.
B. Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis – Incorrect. This describes a severe erosive rash in the diaper area that presents as well-circumscribed eroded or ulcerated papules and nodules. This would not account for the perioral and acral involvement.
C. TNZD – Correct. TNZD is a condition caused by a defect in maternal transfer of zinc into breast milk. Typical cutaneous lesions are characterized by sharply demarcated erythematous plaques that can become vesicular or eroded with peripheral scale crust and involve the perioral, acral, and anogenital skin. The perioral distribution often spares the upper lip, giving a U-shaped appearance. Concomitant symptoms often include diarrhea, irritability, and alopecia. TNZD improves rapidly with zinc sulfate supplementation at 3 mg/kg/day until weaning, with no zinc supplementation required following weaning.
D. Infantile psoriasis – Incorrect. While psoriasis of the diaper area is also sharply demarcated, the scale is classically silver and micaceous. While intertriginous psoriasis may lack scale, the erosions as well as perioral, acral, and genital distribution and "peeling paint" scale are more characteristic of a nutritional deficiency.
E. Langerhans cell histiocytosis – Incorrect. Varied skin lesions can be seen in Langerhans cell histiocytosis including red-brown papules in seborrheic distribution, crusted papules on the palms and soles, and vesiculopustular lesions. Discrete eroded papules and petechiae would be expected as opposed to the sharply demarcated broad scaly plaques seen here.

2. Male genital lesions

Discrete papules or larger nodules found on the penis (shaft, corona, glans, prepuce) and/or scrotum are highly specific for scabies. 34 Their surface may be smooth or rough depending on how vigorously the patient has been scratching, but are not scaly. Typically, several lesions are present at one time in an affected individual (Figure 3 g). 74, 75 These lesions are often very itchy, but in some individuals they may not be itchy at all. Genital lesions are reported to occur in up to 10–30% of male patients with scabies, but they may be more frequent in adult male individuals in temperate climates. 58, 76

3. Typical lesions

The clinical signs of common scabies vary widely in terms of the appearance of individual lesions; appearance of grouped or clustered lesions; and severity and degree of secondary changes such as excoriation, impetiginization, eczematization and lichenification (thickening of skin due to scratching and rubbing). In the absence of the highly specific signs of burrows or male genital lesions, the decision whether or not other observed skin lesions are typical for scabies is a critical determination in diagnosing clinical scabies or suspected scabies. For lesions to be considered typical, examiners must consider both morphology and number.

In morphology, typical scabies lesions are small, elevated and easily palpated. The most common lesions are solid and 2–3 mm in diameter (papules). 77 Larger, nodular lesions, usually 5–10 mm and occasionally > 10 mm, are more likely to be seen in certain body areas (groin and genitalia, buttocks, axillae, breasts of women and torsos of infants) 78, 79 and may persist for several months, even after mites are successfully eradicated. The colour is usually erythematous (pink to red) but may be hyperpigmented in darker‐skinned individuals.

### Dysphagia and history of vegetative plaques [^113n7hbQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. VPG – Incorrect. VPG is a rare pyoderma gangrenosum variant commonly found on the trunk as erythematous, ulcerated, vegetative plaques. Although vegetative, our patient's prior lesions lack ulceration and were located on intertriginous areas. Additionally, VPG would not explain her mucosal involvement.
B. Keloids – Incorrect. Keloids are caused by cutaneous injuries such as trauma, insect bites, and piercings. Our patient's hypertrophic scarring from surgery complicates her presentation, but her laryngeal involvement and previous vegetative intertriginous plaques suggest another diagnosis.
C. HS – Incorrect. HS is a chronic condition characterized by inflammation of the follicular epithelium, causing abscess, scar, and sinus tract formation. Our patient was unfortunately misdiagnosed and surgically treated for HS. The patient's laryngeal involvement and history of vegetative skin lesions suggest another diagnosis.
D. Pemphigus vegetans – Correct. Pemphigus vegetans is the rarest (1% to 2%)subtype of pemphigus vulgaris and is distinguished by the presence of papillomatous, vegetating plaques in flexural surfaces. It initially manifests with oral ulceration in 50% to 70% of cases, and 90% of patients ultimately develop oral involvement. Although our patient previously presented with intertriginous vegetative plaques, she presented to us with isolated laryngeal involvement. Histology of previously biopsied axillary lesions revealed epidermal hyperplasia and acantholytic keratinocytes present within eosinophil-rich microabscesses (Fig 2).
E. IP – Incorrect. IP is a form of plaque psoriasis that involves axillary, anogenital, and inframammary body folds. Although our patient's lesions are in intertriginous areas, they lack the well-demarcated, erythematous patches seen in IP.

### Distribution and arrangement of multiple lesions in the anogenital region [^111V9LhC]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

A series of skin diseases may affect the anogenital region with unusual presentations; therefore, a careful clinical approach is needed to make a correct diagnosis. Diseases of the anogenital area include inflammatory dermatoses, infectious lesions, and neoplastic conditions. Inflammatory dermatoses are frequently not restricted to the anogenital area and often occur on other sites. Infectious anogenital lesions can be easily confused with other benign or malignant processes. Tumors that arise on the anogenital skin are similar to those that occur on the skin elsewhere. The differential diagnosis of all of these lesions often depends upon the distribution and arrangement of the skin lesions.

### Misdiagnosis of capillary malformations in darker skin phototypes [^1174E8QU]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

In the dermatologic medical literature, there is an underrepresentation of conditions in individuals of color. Due to the lack of representation, it may be harder for clinicians to recognize certain diagnoses in patients with darker skin phototypes leading to misdiagnosis and affecting overall patient management, outcomes, and satisfaction. Here, we present four Black or Indigenous People of Color who were initially referred for hyperpigmentation, hemihyperplasia, or café au lait spots and found to have syndromic capillary malformations.

### Unusual lesion on the vulva of a postmenopausal woman [^111efqBa]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

An 82-year-old Chinese woman presented to our multidisciplinary vulva clinic with a mildly itchy patch on her external genitalia of unknown duration. Notably, she was also undergoing vaginal laser rejuvenation at a private clinic. Cutaneous examination revealed a 2 × 2 cm well-demarcated, smooth, slightly hypopigmented-to-pinkish patch in the lower one-third of the left labium majus without any surface change or underlying induration (Fig 1). The rest of the cutaneous examination was normal. There was no regional lymphadenopathy. Per-speculum and per-vaginal examination were normal. A 4-mm skin punch biopsy was taken from the lesion (Figs 2 and 3, A and B).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Focal vitiligo
B. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation
C. Extra-mammary Paget disease (EMPD)
D. Dermatomycosis
E. Early lichen sclerosus

### Approach to hypopigmentation disorders in adults [^117D8tyD]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Acquired hypopigmentation disorders in adults can be classified on the basis of lesion extent, and can generally be divided into disorders with localized, widespread or generalized lesions. Clinical findings, comprising the degree of pigment loss (hypopigmentation and depigmentation) and associated morphological findings (e.g. epidermal changes, infiltration and induration), are used to further distinguish the disorders. Diagnosing the disorders is important because the underlying causes may be treatable and some of the disorders are associated with malignancies. A systemic approach is useful for this clinical condition, as the causes are heterogeneous and investigations are usually nondiagnostic.

Boys most commonly present in need of circumcision because of associated phimosis. The reported incidence of LS in boys undergoing circumcision for phimosis ranges from 10 to 40%. A prospective study of 1,178 boys presenting with phimosis found that 40% had LS on circumcision pathology, with the highest incidence in boys aged 9–11 years (76%). Perianal involvement, as in adult men, is extremely rare.

### Trichodystrophies: a hair-raising differential diagnosis [^115wz23p]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The appearance of an individual's hair is said to be reflective of internal health. Patients with hair shaft disorders commonly present with fragile, lusterless, sparse hair in addition to psychosocial distress. Hair shaft disorders may be hereditary or acquired and may present in children or adults. Due to the varied presentations, the differential diagnosis for hair is broad and often confusing. The authors present a question-by-question guide to help clinicians arrive at the correct diagnosis.

### Presentation of a large and debilitating fungating anogenital lesion [^113jHGtW]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 65-year-old Caucasian man presented with a debilitating anogenital lesion.

Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of anogenital lesions includes infectious (syphilis, herpes simplex virus), noninfectious (hidradenitis suppuritiva, lymphedema), benign (condyloma acuminata), and malignant pathologies (squamous cell carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma).

Diagnostic Assessment, Management, and Outcome

Biopsy of an anogenital lesion will determine any oncologic potential. Further imaging can better characterize the disease. Once in the operating room, oncologic principles should be adhered to and quality of life concerns prioritized. Reconstruction of large defects may require a multidisciplinary team. Genitourinary and gastrointestinal diversions should be considered to improve wound healing, decrease infection risk, and optimize graft take.

Discussion

A multidisciplinary approach to medical and surgical reconstruction of anogenital lesions should be considered for extensive malformations.

### Pigmentary complications after non-medical male circumcision [^115W3VYi]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Post MC penile hypo- or hyperpigmentation may appear after several conditions affecting the penis, such as balanitis and meatitis (33%), secondary to topical medications applied after MC or a tight bandage, which may have been the cause of the spotty pigmentation of the glans. Biopsy and histology are indicated when history is unclear or the causative agent is no longer present. Further follow up and appropriate therapy is mandatory for such cases.

### White patch on back… [^111gxA1G]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Question Discussion The answer is B: nevus anemicus. Nevus anemicus is a congenital patch manifested by skin pallor. It most commonly occurs as a single patch on the trunk. Several studies have shown that nevus anemicus is caused by a localized vascular hypersensitivity to catecholamines. This catecholamine sensitivity produces increased vasoconstriction and skin pallor. When pressure is applied to the border of the patch with a clear glass slide, the border between lesion and normal skin disappears, because the normal skin becomes blanched. Since the histopathology of nevus anemicus is normal, nevus anemicus is a pharmacologic nevus and not an anatomic one. 1, 2 No treatment is available. The differential diagnosis of nevus anemicus includes Hansen's disease, nevus depigmentosus, tinea versicolor and vitiligo. Hansen's disease is a skin infection that is caused by. Mycobacterium leprae. It can manifest as hypopigmented patches and plaques.

Involvement of the nerves usually causes anesthesia or hypesthesia. Histopathology would help differentiate Hansen's disease from the other hypomelanotic dermatoses. Nevus depigmentosus is an uncommon, congenital dermatosis that manifests as unilateral, hypopigmented patches in a somewhat dermatomal pattern. It appears to be caused by a block of transfer of melanosomes from melanocytes to keratinocytes. Because this is an anatomic nevus, diascopy would not obliterate the border between lesion and normal skin. Tinea versicolor, a superficial mycotic skin infection caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare, manifests as finely scaling, hypopigmented-to-erythematous patches, usually on the trunk. A potassium hydroxide preparation would reveal spores and hyphae. Persistent hypopigmentation, even after treatment with antifungal agents, is often present.

This hypopigmentation is thought to result from the inhibition of tyrosinase by azelaic acid, a dicarboxylic acid, which is formed by Pityrosporum orbiculare. 3 Histology shows absence of melanocytes in the epidermis. The treatment of choice is psoralens and ultraviolet A. For localized disease, topical glucocorticoids may be useful.

### Mosaicvariant and associated ectodermal dysplasia features [^116bHMNT]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ectodermal dysplasia (ED) is a broad group of genodermatoses involving developmental defects of tissues derived from the ectoderm. The conditions vary in genetic etiology and phenotype, since there are multiple developmental pathways and genes that contribute to normal formation and function of ectodermal structures. Proposed classification systems for ED organize conditions based on genotype, molecular pathway, and phenotype. One group of ED conditions consists of disorders associated with the tumor protein p63 (TP63) pathway, which is essential to epidermal development and differentiation. Reports of genetic mosaicism in ED are rare, but they further contribute to the diverse clinical presentations among ED. We present the case of a young adult man with patterned hypopigmentation, alopecia, and dental anomaly who was found to have a variant of the TP63 gene with mosaic distribution on genomic analysis.

### Clinicopathologic correlation of dermatologic diseases in patients with darker pigmentation [^115cJ287]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Cutaneous diseases that disproportionately affect patients with darker pigmentation and their histologic features are historically understudied and undertreated. This review article aims to highlight the key clinical features, histopathology, and diagnostic pearls of several cutaneous diseases that commonly present in patients with darker pigmentation.

Methods

A literature search was conducted, and a list of cutaneous diseases that frequently affect patients with darker pigmentation was compiled. A group of experts expounded upon those that were most common or misdiagnosed according to scientific evidence and clinical practice.

Results

The diseases were divided into hypopigmented disorders, hyperpigmented disorders, scarring disorders, and alopecic disorders. Within each category, the etiology, clinical features, histopathology, and key histologic differential diagnoses are described and discussed.

Conclusions

As many clinicians are taught that there are no effective treatment options or that these diseases are considered "cosmetic" in nature, patients often do not get a thorough medical workup or skin biopsy. This article aims to decrease the knowledge gap and serve as a resource for anyone involved in the care of patients with these cutaneous conditions.

### Acquired disorders with hypopigmentation: a clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment [^112K2CaB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acquired hypopigmented skin changes are commonly encountered by dermatologists. Although hypopigmentation is often asymptomatic and benign, occasional serious and disabling conditions present with cutaneous hypopigmentation. A thorough history and physical examination, centered on disease distribution and morphologic findings, can aid in delineating the causes of acquired hypopigmented disorders. The second article in this 2-part continuing medical education series focuses on conditions with a hypopigmented phenotype. Early diagnosis and appropriate management of these disorders can improve a patient's quality of life, halt disease progression, and prevent irreversible disability.

Introduction

Hypopigmentation is seen in a wide range of skin conditions. The morphology and distribution of hypopigmented lesions help in narrowing down the differential diagnosis. Several diseases present with guttate, speckled, or confetti hypopigmented macules, and cases of speckled hypopigmentation limited to acral areas have recently been described. In this report, we describe a 9-year-old girl with acral speckled hypopigmentation and discuss the differential diagnosis.

### Evaluation of patch test findings in patients with anogenital dermatitis [^114g8qQA]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Contact dermatitis in the anogenital area is associated with sleep disturbance and dyspareunia and can profoundly affect quality of life. The literature on anogenital contact dermatitis and culprit allergens is limited. The last large-scale study on common, relevant allergens in patients with anogenital dermatitis was published in 2008.

Objectives

To characterize patients with anogenital dermatitis referred for patch testing by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group, to identify common allergens, and to explore sex-associated differences between anogenital dermatitis and allergens.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis was conducted of the North American Contact Dermatitis Group database among 28 481 patients who underwent patch testing from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2016, at outpatient referral clinics in the United States and Canada.

Exposure

Patch testing for allergens.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Currently relevant allergic patch test reactions in patients with anogenital dermatitis.

Results

Of 28 481 patients tested during the study period, 832 patients (336 men and 496 women; mean [SD] age, 50.1 [26.5] years) had anogenital involvement and 449 patients (177 men and 272 women; mean [SD] age, 49.6 [17.4] years) had anogenital dermatitis only. Compared with those without anogenital involvement, there were significantly more male patients in the group with anogenital dermatitis (177 [39.4%] vs 8857 of 27 649 [32.0%]; relative risk, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.14–1.66; P < .001). In the group with anogenital involvement, female patients were significantly less likely than male patients to have allergic contact dermatitis as a final diagnosis (130 [47.8%] vs 107 [60.5%]; relative risk, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.94; p = 0.01), whereas a final diagnosis of other dermatoses (eg, lichen planus, lichen sclerosus, or lichen simplex chronicus) was more frequent for female patients than for male patients (67 [24.6%] vs 28 [15.8%]; relative risk, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.02–2.31; p = 0.03). Of the 449 patients in the group with anogenital involvement only, 227 (50.6%) had 1 or more relevant reaction with patch testing. Allergens that were statistically significantly more common in patients with anogenital involvement compared with those without anogenital involvement included medicaments such as dibucaine (10 of 250 patients tested [4.0%] vs 32 of 17 494 patients tested [0.2%]; relative risk, 22.74; 95% CI, 11.05–46.78; P < .001) and preservatives such as methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone (30 of 449 patients tested [6.7%] vs 1143 of 27 599 patients tested [4.1%]; relative risk, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.14–2.41; p = 0.008). A total of 152 patients met the definition for anogenital allergic contact dermatitis, which is defined as anogenital involvement only, allergic contact dermatitis as the only diagnosis, and 1 or more positive reaction of current clinical relevance.

Conclusions and Relevance

For patients with anogenital involvement only who were referred for patch testing, male patients were more likely to have allergic contact dermatitis, whereas female patients were more likely to have other dermatoses. Common allergens or sources consisted of those likely to contact the anogenital area. For individuals with anogenital involvement suspected of having allergic contact dermatitis, reactions to preservatives, fragrances, medications (particularly topical anesthetics), and topical corticosteroids should be tested.

### The clinicopathologic challenge of nonneoplastic vulvar acanthosis [^115ZNsKD]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Two cases displayed an unusual epidermal appearance inconsistent with a known diagnosis. Both presented with pruritic plaques less than 3 cm in diameter but otherwise were dissimilar in demographics, demarcation, treatment, and response. These and 2 additional cases displayed features suggestive of HPV-related disease: perinuclear haloes (see Figure 3), squamatized whorls (see Figure 4), suprabasilar apoptotic keratinocytes, and multinucleated squamous cells. These cases all were negative for HPV. The one low-positive result for HPV 16 was a 47-year-old nonsmoker who presented with anogenital discomfort, poorly demarcated mild erythema, a perianal fissure, recent negative CST, and vaginal microbiology positive for Candida albicans (see Figure 5). The HPV 16 result occurred in 1 of 3 extracts with DNA at the lower limit of assay detection. Clinical impression was dermatitis with candidiasis and symptoms improved on a combination of topical corticosteroids, oral fluconazole, and modified vulvar care practices. The 3 cases unassessable for HPV DNA were obtained from a poorly demarcated pink-gray plaque in 2 and a periurethral white plaque in 1. The case not sent for molecular assessment was a 42-year-old patient with a clinical impression of LSC.

### Papillomatous anogenital lesions in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus [^112YaUYC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis: Verrucous herpes infection.

Two 4-mm punch biopsy specimens were taken from the patient's right thigh exophytic mass, one for histopathologic examination and one for tissue culture (marked in purple in Figure 1). Hematoxylin-eosin staining at scanning magnification showed verrucous hyperplasia with focal epidermal necrosis and acantholysis (Figure 2). Higher magnification at ×400 revealed multinucleated epithelial cells with nuclear molding, consistent with herpes virus. Immunohistochemical staining was performed and was focally positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV) and negative for treponema. Final tissue culture results were negative for all aerobic, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli positive organisms. Taken together, the diagnosis of verrucous HSV was confirmed.

Figure 1.

Treatment was then started with acyclovir, 400 mg 3 times daily for 14 days. The patient's condition improved after treatment, although he reported difficulty with compliance. The patient was then started on valacyclovir, 1000 mg twice daily. Two months later, he presented with resolution of the exophytic masses and residual hypopigmented skin changes at the site of the original lesions (Figure 3). Procedural intervention was not required.
