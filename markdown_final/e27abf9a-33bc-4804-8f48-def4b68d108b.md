## Question

For full-body twitching, on which body part(s) should an EMG be performed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which body part(s) an EMG should be performed on for "full-body twitching". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how fasciculations fit into the ALS differential and which EMG features truly separate benign from pathologic. Then, I should verify the principle of multi-regional sampling and how El Escorial–aligned segment coverage increases diagnostic yield. Next, I will select specific muscles in each region based on sensitivity and practicality, justify why distal muscles and thoracic paraspinals matter, and decide how to assess the craniobulbar region without compromising data quality. After that, I will confirm the need to pair NCS with needle EMG and specify what EMG parameters to analyze. Finally, I will tailor the plan to patient symptoms, comfort, and technical feasibility, and synthesize a concise, evidence-based protocol with explicit rationale [^113BB9MG] [^111X7yhQ].

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. "Full-body twitching" most often reflects fasciculations, which can be benign but also occur with lower motor neuron degeneration in ALS, where EMG identifies spontaneous activity and chronic neurogenic change in both symptomatic and subclinical muscles. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; benign fasciculation presentations can rarely progress, so longitudinal clinical and electrodiagnostic follow-up is prudent, and EMG remains central to detecting active denervation and reinnervation patterns that suggest motor neuron disease rather than a benign syndrome [^113BB9MG] [^116A3JP7] [^114X95To].

> I need to ensure the study samples multiple neuroanatomical regions. The classical framework requires evaluation across bulbar or cranial, cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral segments to detect diffuse anterior horn cell involvement and noncontiguous spread, aligning with El Escorial logic that segment-based abnormalities improve diagnostic accuracy. Wait, let me verify the segment rules; evidence supports higher specificity in cranial and thoracic segments and a requirement for more than one abnormal limb muscle per limb segment to optimize the balance of sensitivity and specificity [^111X7yhQ] [^113BB9MG].

> Next, I should review thoracic paraspinal sampling. I will now examine the latest data on thoracic paraspinals because their denervation profile can discriminate ALS from mimics. High-credibility evidence shows thoracic paraspinal EMG abnormalities are more frequent in ALS than in non-ALS neuromuscular disorders, though bulbar-onset ALS may have relatively normal or near-normal limb and TPSP EMG early on, which I should remember when interpreting a negative TPSP in that phenotype [^1164KroY].

> For the cervical segment, let me think about distal versus proximal muscle yield. Distal hand muscles such as the first dorsal interosseous or abductor pollicis brevis show high electrodiagnostic sensitivity for LMN dysfunction across onset phenotypes, while adding a proximal muscle like biceps provides complementary information and is frequently used for fasciculation quantification and monitoring. I should double-check that optimized sets of limb muscles maximize segment positivity while limiting discomfort and duration, and indeed algorithmic selection of a handful of upper extremity muscles can capture the vast majority of potentially positive segments [^114VGJmg] [^116XDM2E].

> For the lumbosacral segment, I need to check which distal leg muscles best detect fasciculations and denervation. Tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius are high-yield, standard targets for spontaneous activity detection and quantification, and they feature prominently in validated surface EMG protocols that distinguish ALS from benign fasciculation while also supporting longitudinal monitoring tolerability when needed. Let me verify agreement with shorter sampling epochs; 15 minutes suffices for HDSEMG quantification, which underscores their robust fasciculation signal, though this does not change the necessity of needle EMG in diagnostic workups [^114J6T1X] [^114VGJmg].

> For the craniobulbar assessment, hold on, I should verify whether to prefer tongue or an alternative muscle. The frontalis muscle offers reliable relaxation, high patient cooperation, and comparable spontaneous activity yield to tongue and SCM in bulbar ALS, while trapezius can serve as a practical alternative that often shows frequent spontaneous activity and is easier to relax than tongue. Wait, let me verify the relaxation rates and yield comparisons; complete relaxation is much more achievable in frontalis than tongue, and trapezius frequently demonstrates abnormal activity in ALS with excellent specificity against cervical spondylosis [^1137wMgn] [^116KFbqY].

> Now I should justify why distal muscles often outperform proximal ones in early detection. Distal muscles are innervated by longer motor neurons and are commonly the site of earliest clinical manifestations in limb-onset ALS; nonuniform motor neuron vulnerability and noncontiguous spread further support prioritizing distal sampling to enhance sensitivity. Let me reconsider the role of paraspinals; including thoracic paraspinals supports anterior horn cell disease patterns and complements limb findings when distinguishing radiculopathy, especially when abnormalities extend beyond a single root level or appear in noncontiguous segments, consistent with criteria that value cranial and thoracic segment changes [^111x3n1V] [^114VGJmg] [^111X7yhQ].

> I need to ensure proper study design by pairing NCS with needle EMG. The AANEM position is clear that NCS and EMG should be performed together and under the supervision of a trained physician, because NCS adds critical information to exclude neuropathy, conduction block, or neuromuscular junction disorders while EMG defines denervation and reinnervation patterns. Let me verify the complementary roles one more time; combining NCS with EMG allows determination of axonal versus demyelinating processes, focal versus multifocal patterns, and NMJ abnormalities that would substantially alter the differential and management [^1172XCEa] [^111MBGGC].

> Next, I should review the EMG parameters to analyze. I will now examine which signals matter most: at rest, look for fasciculation potentials, fibrillation potentials, and positive sharp waves; during activation, assess motor unit potential morphology for chronic neurogenic changes such as large-amplitude, long-duration, polyphasic units, and evaluate recruitment and interference patterns for reduced activation in more advanced disease. Wait, I should confirm that these are the patterns most consistently reported in ALS; contemporary clinical reviews and pathophysiology data confirm chronic neurogenic changes dominate in ALS muscle as a consequence of motor neuron loss [^113BB9MG] [^115znSBt].

> I need to tailor the muscle selection to the patient while minimizing pain and maximizing technical success. Let me consider symptom topography first; if twitching is most prominent in the hands or calves, I should prioritize those specific muscles while maintaining multi-segment sampling. I should confirm which muscles are better tolerated; evidence shows muscle selection has the largest modifiable impact on EMG-related pain, and in technically challenging scenarios or when anatomy is uncertain, ultrasound guidance improves needle placement accuracy, particularly for less experienced operators [^112YwSYc] [^114E7G3Z].

> Based on this, my minimum practical protocol for "full-body twitching" to differentiate benign fasciculation from ALS would include thoracic paraspinals as mandatory for thoracic segment assessment; bilateral distal hand muscles such as first dorsal interosseous or abductor pollicis brevis plus at least one proximal arm muscle such as biceps; bilateral tibialis anterior with optional medial gastrocnemius to strengthen distal leg sampling; and a craniobulbar muscle with high cooperation such as frontalis, with trapezius as a valuable adjunct if needed. Hold on, I should verify diagnostic coverage; optimized limb muscle sets have achieved over 98% capture of potentially positive cervical or lumbosacral segments in ALS cohorts, and thoracic paraspinals add discriminative value, while frontalis improves feasibility for cranial segment assessment compared to tongue [^114VGJmg] [^1164KroY] [^1137wMgn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied that frontalis routinely matches trapezius for spontaneous potential frequency across all phenotypes; let me correct that nuance. I should confirm that in bulbar ALS the frequency is comparable between frontalis and other cranial muscles, but in nonbulbar patients, trapezius can show a higher frequency of spontaneous activity than frontalis, which supports using both when craniobulbar yield is critical. Also, I need to be careful not to overstate that paraspinal abnormalities alone "exclude radiculopathy"; rather, widespread or multilevel paraspinal denervation in combination with noncontiguous limb findings supports anterior horn cell disease, whereas strictly focal abnormalities tied to a single root distribution keep radiculopathy in play and require correlation with NCS and imaging for accurate localization [^1137wMgn] [^111X7yhQ] [^111MBGGC].

For full-body twitching, EMG should sample **at least one proximal and one distal muscle in each limb, plus a bulbar muscle** [^113BB9MG] (e.g. tongue or sternocleidomastoid [^1137wMgn] [^116KFbqY]) and a thoracic paraspinal muscle [^1164KroY] to assess for widespread lower motor neuron involvement [^114VGJmg]. This distribution helps distinguish generalized motor neuron disease from peripheral neuropathies or myopathies [^111MBGGC], and additional muscles may be added based on clinical findings. EMG should be performed by a **trained neuromuscular physician** [^1172XCEa] to ensure accurate interpretation [^114E7G3Z] and diagnosis.

### Recommended muscle groups for EMG in full-body twitching

Recommended **muscle groups for EMG evaluation** in patients with full-body twitching include:

| **Muscle group** | **Specific muscles** | **Clinical rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Upper limbs | - First dorsal interosseous <br/> - Abductor pollicis brevis <br/> - Deltoid <br/> - Triceps brachii | - Assess distal and proximal upper limb involvement [^111x3n1V] <br/> - Commonly affected in motor neuron diseases [^113BB9MG] |
| Lower limbs | - Tibialis anterior <br/> - Gastrocnemius <br/> - Vastus medialis <br/> - Gluteus medius | - Evaluate distal and proximal lower limb involvement [^113BB9MG] <br/> - High yield for detecting lower motor neuron dysfunction [^114VGJmg] |
| Bulbar muscles | - Tongue (genioglossus) <br/> - Sternocleidomastoid <br/> - Trapezius <br/> - Frontalis | - Essential for assessing bulbar involvement [^1137wMgn] <br/> - Important in ALS and other motor neuron diseases [^116KFbqY] |
| Paraspinal muscles | - Thoracic paraspinals <br/> - Lumbar paraspinals | - Useful for detecting widespread lower motor neuron involvement [^1164KroY] <br/> - Differentiates ALS from other neuromuscular disorders [^111X7yhQ] |

### Clinical considerations and guidelines

- **Clinical correlation**: EMG findings [^111MBGGC] must be correlated with clinical symptoms and signs to accurately diagnose underlying neuromuscular disorders [^113BB9MG].
- **Expertise required**: EMG should be performed and interpreted by trained neuromuscular physicians [^1172XCEa] to ensure accurate diagnosis and avoid misinterpretation [^114E7G3Z].
- **Patient comfort**: Muscle selection should consider patient comfort [^114VGJmg], as certain muscles may cause more discomfort during needle insertion [^112YwSYc].

---

### Conclusion

EMG evaluation of full-body twitching should include proximal and distal muscles in each limb, plus bulbar and paraspinal muscles [^111X7yhQ]. This approach ensures **accurate diagnosis** [^111MBGGC] of underlying neuromuscular disorders (such as ALS) and differentiates them from other conditions [^1164KroY].

### Needle electromyography of the frontalis muscle in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1137wMgn]. Muscle & Nerve (2016).

We sought to determine which muscles to choose for better assessment of the craniobulbar region in establishing the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

- **Methods**: We studied the frontalis muscle in 83 controls and compared it with the tongue, sternocleidomastoid (SCM), and trapezius muscles in 105 definite or probable ALS patients (54 bulbar, 51 nonbulbar).

- **Results**: More patients achieved complete relaxation of the frontalis muscle than the tongue or SCM. Motor unit potentials were of longer duration and higher amplitude in ALS patients than in controls (P < 0.05). The frontalis had the same frequency of spontaneous potentials as the tongue, SCM, and trapezius muscles in bulbar ALS patients, but fewer than in the trapezius in nonbulbar patients.

- **Conclusions**: Examining the frontalis provides useful information in establishing the diagnosis of ALS by identifying clinically evident or subclinical abnormalities in the craniobulbar region.

### Optimizing muscle selection for electromyography in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^114VGJmg]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

We compared the yield of limb and thoracic paraspinal muscle examination for revealing lower motor neuron (LMN) dysfunction on electromyography (EMG) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of 354 patients with clinically definite or probable ALS was performed. Seventeen limb muscles and thoracic paraspinal muscles were evaluated for the presence of both active and chronic denervation.

- **Results**: Distal limb muscles showed the highest electrodiagnostic sensitivities of LMN dysfunction in ALS regardless of onset region and diagnostic certainty at the time of diagnosis. The electrodiagnostic yield is higher in muscles from the onset limb. Noncontiguous spread of lower motor neuron degeneration is present in ALS. Optimally selected six upper and five lower extremity muscles yielded over 98% of potential positive cervical or lumbosacral segments.

- **Conclusions**: An algorithmic approach to needle EMG in ALS based on the pretest probability of individual muscles optimizes electrodiagnostic yield, thus possibly minimizing test duration and patient discomfort. Muscle Nerve 56: 36–44, 2017.

### Proper performance and interpretation of electrodiagnostic studies [^1172XCEa]. Muscle & Nerve (2015). Low credibility.

The AANEM strongly recommends that electrodiagnostic (EDX) procedures be performed by physicians with comprehensive knowledge of neurological and musculoskeletal disorders to assure accurate interpretation and diagnosis. Individuals without a medical education in neuromuscular disorders and without special training in EDX procedures typically are not qualified to interpret the waveforms generated by nerve conduction studies (NCSs) and needle electromyography (EMGs) or to correlate the findings with other clinical information to reach a diagnosis.

It is also the AANEM's position that the same physician should directly supervise and interpret the NCSs, including those performed by an EDX technician. The AANEM believes that interpreting NCS without performing a focused history and physical, and having oversight over the design and performance, is inappropriate. Nerve conduction studies performed independently of needle EMG studies may only provide a portion of the information needed to diagnose muscle, nerve root, and most nerve disorders. For this reason, it is the position of the AANEM that, except in unique situations, NCSs and needle EMG should be performed together in a study design determined by a trained neuromuscular physician.

There are common diagnoses that depend on performing a needle EMG and combining the needle EMG data with the NCS data. Needle EMG studies are a necessary part of the evaluation in the diagnosis of myopathy, radiculopathy, plexopathy, disorders of the motor neuron, peripheral neuropathies, and most disorders of the individual peripheral motor nerves.

### Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A clinical review [^113BB9MG]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ALS relies on the medical history, physical examination, electrodiagnostic testing with needle EMG, and neuroimaging. EMG remains a very useful diagnostic tool to confirm LMN involvement in both clinically affected and non-affected muscles, showing fibrillation potentials, sharp waves, fasciculation potentials in relaxed muscles, and chronic neurogenic changes upon contraction [8, 69].

Biomarkers can play a crucial role in diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive research studies. They could potentially become important for the stratification of patients and the monitoring of treatment effects in clinical trials. Although not yet integrated into standard clinical practice, several biomarkers, such as cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament levels, especially the phosphorylated neurofilament heavy subunit, are useful in supporting the diagnosis [70, 71, 72]. This is particularly true for patients with a very recent onset of muscle weakness, without clear signs of UMN involvement, or with concomitant neuropathy, plexopathy, or cervical myelopathy.

Brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging are often performed to exclude structural lesions affecting the motor system [73]. Furthermore, if readily available, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography can reveal a typical pattern of hypometabolism in Rolandic brain regions and frontotemporal involvement [74, 75].

Genetic testing of the five most prevalent genes found to be mutated in ALS is routinely offered to patients with a positive family history. These genes include C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43, FUS, and TBK-1. Although there is no consensus on…

### Electrodiagnostic findings in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Variation with region of onset and utility of thoracic paraspinal muscle examination [^1164KroY]. Muscle & nerve (2024). High credibility.

This study aims to address the limited data regarding the variation of electrodiagnostic (EDX) findings in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with different onset regions and the specificity of thoracic paraspinal muscle (TPSP) examination for confirming a diagnosis of ALS. The goal is to demonstrate the variation of EDX features and characterize the utility of TPSP muscle examination in the electrodiagnosis of ALS.

The methods involved a retrospective study of a large cohort of ALS patients who had undergone a comprehensive EDX evaluation.

Results of the study included 448 patients, all fulfilling the Gold Coast criteria for ALS. The average age at the time of the EDX study was 64 years, and 41.1% of participants were women. The onset region was identified as follows: bulbar (N = 149), cervical (N = 127), lumbosacral (N = 162), and other (N = 10). In contrast to limb onset, bulbar-onset patients more frequently demonstrated a pattern of normal or near normal needle electromyography (EMG) (p < 0.0001) and less frequently had abnormalities on EMG of TPSP (p = .002). Clinical or EDX diagnosis of sensory polyneuropathy was present in 12.6% of patients, more frequently in the lumbosacral onset subgroup (p < 0.03). EMG showed active denervation in 9.6% and chronic denervation in 59% of craniobulbar muscles examined, without observed difference among different onset regions. TPSP showed higher frequencies of active and chronic denervation in ALS than a group of patients with non-ALS neuromuscular disorders.

The discussion indicates that EDX features may differ among ALS patients of different onset regions. TPSP EMG is highly useful in differentiating ALS.

### Fasciculation analysis reveals a novel parameter that correlates with predicted survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116XDM2E]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Low credibility.

Prognostic uncertainty in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) confounds clinical management planning, patient counseling, and trial stratification. Fasciculations are an early clinical hallmark of the disease and can be quantified noninvasively. Using an innovative analytical method, we correlated novel fasciculation parameters with a predictive survival model.

- **Methods**: Using high-density surface electromyography, we collected biceps recordings from ALS patients on their first research visit. By accessing an online survival prediction tool, we provided eight clinical and genetic parameters to estimate individual patient survival. Fasciculation analysis was performed using an automated algorithm (Surface Potential Quantification Engine), with a Cox proportional hazards model to calculate hazard ratios.

- **Results**: The median predicted survival for 31 patients was 41 (interquartile range, 31.5–57) months. Univariate hazard ratios were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.16) for the rate of change of fasciculation frequency (RoCoFF) and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.01–1.19) for the amplitude dispersion rate. Only the RoCoFF remained significant (P = 0.04) in a multivariate model.

- **Discussion**: Noninvasive measurement of fasciculations at a single time-point could enhance prognostic models in ALS, where higher RoCoFF values indicate shorter survival.

### A shortened surface electromyography recording is sufficient to facilitate home fasciculation assessment [^114J6T1X]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). High credibility.

Fasciculations are an early clinical hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), amenable to detection by high-density surface electromyography (HDSEMG). In conjunction with the Surface Potential Quantification Engine (SPiQE), HDSEMG offers improved spatial resolution for analyzing fasciculations. This study aims to establish an optimal recording duration to enable longitudinal remote monitoring in the home.

- **Methods**: Twenty patients with ALS and five patients with benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) underwent serial 30-minute HDSEMG recordings from the biceps brachii and gastrocnemii. SPiQE was independently applied to abbreviated epochs within each 30-minute recording (0–5, 0–10, 0–15, 0–20, and 0–25 minutes), outputting fasciculation frequency, amplitude median, and amplitude interquartile range. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess agreement with the validated 30-minute recording.

- **Results**: In total, 506 full recordings were included. The 5-minute recordings demonstrated diverse and relatively poor agreement with the 30-minute baselines across all parameters, muscles, and patient groups (ICC = 0.32–0.86). The 15-minute recordings provided more acceptable and stable agreement (ICC = 0.78–0.98), which did not substantially improve in longer recordings.

- **Discussion**: For the detection and quantification of fasciculations in patients with ALS and BFS, HDSEMG recordings can be halved from 30 to 15 minutes without significantly compromising the primary outputs. Reliance on a shorter recording duration should lead to improved tolerability.

### Electrodiagnostic assessment of peri-procedural iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries and rehabilitation [^114amJEx]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Using electrodiagnosis to determine possible neurotmesis in the acute setting: This section simplifies the process for determining potential neurotmesis. Identifying viable axons across the zone of injury can be challenging. Anatomic anomalies, such as the Martin-Gruber anastomosis (MGA), Riche-Cannieu anastomosis (RCA), or an accessory fibular nerve that might bypass the injury, must be considered. Technical difficulties, such as unintended needle insertion into incorrect muscles, can lead to inaccurate identification of muscles and nerves. For instance, misinterpreting motor unit potentials from the infraspinatus (suprascapular nerve) as originating from the teres minor (axillary nerve) may result in the misidentification of neurotmesis. Additionally, volume-conducted distant motor unit potentials in a stressful and painful testing situation can be mistaken for motor unit potentials within the muscle being directly evaluated, such as the muscle with the electromyography (EMG) needle inserted.

*Denotes that the presence or absence of fibrillation potentials (FP) can be irrelevant in this decision but may be important for other reasons. For example, FPs present 0–7 days may strongly suggest the presence of an older lesion, more than 14–28 days. Abbreviations used include EDX-electrodiagnostic, EMG-electromyography, FP-fibrillation potentials/positive sharp waves, MUAP-motor unit action potential, MGA-Martin-Gruber anastomosis, NCS-nerve conduction studies, RCA-Riche-Cannieu anastomosis.

### Perseris [^111BA5xR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Symptoms of dystonia, which are prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. Although these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia has been observed in males and younger age groups.

In an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study, there were no clinically relevant differences in mean changes from baseline to the end of the study in ECG parameters, including QTcF (Fridericia's corrected QT interval), QRS and PR intervals, and heart rate, in patients in either Perseris treatment group (90 mg and 120 mg) compared with placebo. Similarly, in a 12-month, long-term safety study, there were no clinically relevant changes in mean ECG interval values from baseline to post-dose assessments.

### Bedside and laboratory diagnostic testing in myasthenia [^114BPzWk]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Electromyography (EMG) is commonly used in neurophysiology laboratories, where single-fibre needle electrodes are often utilized for single-fibre EMG (SFEMG) studies to assess neuromuscular transmission. However, disposable single-use concentric needle electrodes (CEMG) can also be employed for SFEMG studies. The interpretation of SFEMG results considers several factors, including the cut-off values of jitter to determine abnormal test responses, the number of muscle fibre pairs tested, the muscles that can be tested, and voluntary versus stimulated muscle contraction.

- **Jitter in myasthenia**: The safety factor of neuromuscular transmission is evaluated by measuring neuromuscular jitter, which indicates the time variability of processing in the motor end-plate. Jitter is typically expressed as the mean consecutive difference (MCD) of the inter-potential interval between 20 pairs of muscle fibres. Each pair consists of two muscle fibres adjacent to each other, sharing the same axon and motor unit. Normal MCD has been previously defined as between 10 and 60 microseconds (μs). Abnormal jitter is variably defined as mean jitter exceeding 40 μs or 10% of potential pairs having block or jitter exceeding 54 μs. Nonetheless, these jitter parameters can vary depending on the laboratory, age of the patient, and the muscle used to determine normative data. Jitter increases in any condition with disturbed end-plate function, such as myasthenic syndromes and ongoing re-innervation, similar to the electro-decrement observed in repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) studies.

### Residual innervation of the pelvic floor muscles in people with motor-complete spinal cord injury [^113t16RG]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Low credibility.

Individuals clinically classified as having a motor-complete spinal cord injury (mcSCI) are expected to lack voluntary motor function below their injury level. However, neurophysiological assessments using electromyography (EMG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have demonstrated that individuals with mcSCI retain limited cortical descending innervation and voluntary activation of muscles below their level of injury, including those of the trunk and lower limb. We explored the possibility of preserved innervation of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) in persons with mcSCI. The PFM are controlled by widespread cortical and subcortical areas and typically coactivate with trunk and gluteal muscles to maintain continence and regulate intra-abdominal pressure. In this cross-sectional study, nine mcSCI subjects and eight controls participated. Surface EMG was used to record activity in the PFM while participants attempted various maneuvers of the trunk and pelvis. We applied TMS at incrementing levels of intensity over the primary motor cortex area to record motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the PFM. Activation of the PFM was possible in all controls and the majority of SCI participants during these maneuvers. However, in SCI participants, the PFM were only activated during maneuvers that engaged other trunk muscles. MEP responses in the PFM were evident in all controls and SCI participants, although the characteristics of the MEP responses were significantly altered in the SCI group. Our results suggest that persons with mcSCI retain some degree of innervation to the PFM.

### Can regional spreading of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor symptoms be explained by prion-like propagation [^111x3n1V]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Different motor neurons may also have different vulnerabilities. In a three-dimensional study of the distribution of anterior horn cells in the cervical eighth segment of the human spinal cord obtained at autopsy from patients with ALS, zones of focal and patchy loss of motor neurons were identified without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. According to the investigators, these findings imply that different pools of motor neurons have varying resistance to disease.

In limb onset cases, the initial symptoms present most commonly in distal muscles. In an analysis of 1200 patients, Haverkamp et al. found that 73% of non-bulbar patients first exhibited symptoms in the distal portions of the limbs. In 24 autopsies of ALS patients, Tsukagoshi et al. found more marked anterior horn cell loss at the eighth cervical segment, which mainly innervates the distal hand muscles, than at the sixth cervical segment innervating more proximal upper limb muscles. The distal predominance in the initial symptoms does not necessarily reflect only axon length-dependent vulnerability because bulbar and lower limb onset occur at the same frequency.

By using quantitative concentric needle EMG in the early stages of ALS, de Carvalho et al. showed that similar abnormalities in motor unit potentials (MUPs) were found in paraspinal and limb muscles in the same spinal segment, both in the sixth cervical segment and the fifth lumbar segment. Although fasciculation potentials were more frequent in limb muscles than in paraspinal muscles, fibrillations were most frequent in limb muscles.

### Development and preliminary validation of an electromyography-scoring protocol for the assessment and grading of muscle involvement in patients with juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^1173rrnL]. Pediatric Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

We performed a pilot study in order to investigate the feasibility of an electromyography (EMG)-scoring protocol for the assessment of disease activity in juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIM).

- **Methods**: Children with JIIM followed up in a tertiary-level care center underwent standardized clinical, laboratory, and EMG assessment. An EMG-scoring protocol was devised by a consensus panel including a pediatric neurophysiologist and two pediatric rheumatologists, based on a combined score obtained as the sum of (1) the presence of denervation signs (fibrillation potentials) and (2) motor unit remodeling (mixed pattern of short- and long-duration motor unit action potentials). The EMG-scoring protocol was then validated following the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials filter for outcome measures in rheumatology and the consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments methodology.

- **Results**: Thirteen children (77% females) were included in the study, with a median age of 10 years (interquartile range: 7–17 years) and median disease duration of 11.8 months (interquartile range: 2.1–44.5). A total of 39 EMG examinations were evaluated. A strong positive association between a standardized tool for muscle strength assessment and the combined score was observed. No significant associations were found with both creatine kinase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels.

- **Discussion**: Our EMG-scoring protocol is the first standardized and reproducible tool for the neurophysiologic evaluation and grading of muscle involvement in patients with JIIM.

### Non-hospitalized patients with post-COVID condition and myopathic electromyography findings show no difference in symptom severity and clinical manifestations compared to those without myopathic findings [^112CfpSg]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, qualitative and quantitative electromyography (EMG) is used to identify and analyze myopathic motor unit potentials (MUPs), characterized by brief duration, increased polyphasia, decreased amplitude, and early recruitment. It is important to note that the presence of MUPs with myopathic morphology alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis of clinical myopathy, and we cannot rule out the possibility that myopathic EMG findings may have been present in at least some patients before their SARS-CoV-2 infection or may have been unrelated to the post-COVID condition (PCC). However, in the absence of an underlying neuropathy, brief-duration polyphasic MUPs were interpreted as representing myopathic findings.

Furthermore, we previously performed the same methodology with the same equipment and medical staff, as well as a blind analysis, and observed only one person with myopathic EMG findings in the control group, which supports the accuracy of our methodology. However, it is crucial to critically evaluate and correlate myopathic EMG findings with clinical symptoms, as differences in PCC symptom duration, muscle severity, viral variants, and systemic inflammation can complicate interpretation across studies. In our study, all patients were vaccinated, and we included patients across different outbreaks (COVID infection from March 2020 to December 2022). However, further information about viral variants, number of vaccinations, and whether post-COVID symptoms first developed before or after vaccination are not available.

Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that central mechanisms, including altered cortical excitability and…

### Electrodiagnostic assessment of peri-procedural iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries and rehabilitation [^112ngR7z]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Providers may be reluctant to refer patients to medical specialists for evaluation due to concerns of malpractice implications, costs, time, and the likelihood of spontaneous recovery. By four weeks, static axonal injuries with Wallerian degeneration should be diagnosable. To optimize recovery outcomes, multidisciplinary teams, including but not limited to, medical specialists, physiatrists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and peripheral nerve surgeons, may be assembled to expedite the timing of rehabilitation and surgical interventions to improve outcomes.

If testing can identify the firing of at least one motor unit potential upon attempts to voluntarily contract a muscle innervated by a nerve across the suspected lesion location, the injury is incomplete, and surgical intervention or exploration is less likely to be beneficial, especially in the acute stage. When there are only one or two functioning motor units, a large portion of the motor unit pool may be lost (> 90% for the facial nerve), and terminal sprouting may be insufficient to compensate for the resulting functional loss. In this situation, axon regrowth, not just sprouting, will likely be needed to achieve adequate motor recovery to regain function. In proximal lesions, axon regrowth may not be sufficient to reach their distal target(s), leading to a poor prognosis for recovery.

EDX study design considerations may aid in study interpretation when trying to identify possible neurotmesis.

### Accuracy of electromyography needle placement in cadavers: Non-guided vs. ultrasound guided [^114E7G3Z]. Muscle & Nerve (2011). Low credibility.

Accuracy of needle electromyography is typically ensured by the use of anatomical landmarks and auditory feedback related to voluntary activation of the targeted muscle. However, in certain clinical situations, landmarks may not be palpable, auditory feedback may be limited or not present, and targeting a specific muscle may be more critical. In such settings, image guidance might significantly enhance accuracy.

- **Methods**: Two electromyographers with different levels of experience examined 14 muscles in each of 4 fresh-frozen cadaver lower limbs. Each muscle was tested a total of eight times; four fine wires were inserted without ultrasound (US) guidance, and four were inserted under US guidance. Overall accuracy as well as accuracy rates for the individual electromyographers were calculated.

- **Results**: Non-guided needle placement was significantly less accurate than US-guided needle placement, particularly in the hands of less experienced electromyographers, supporting the use of real-time US guidance in certain challenging situations in the electromyography laboratory.

### Ultrasound-guided motor unit scanning electromyography [^114VN5hE]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

Conventional needle electromyography (EMG) records the motor unit potential (MUP), which is the spatially summated electrical activity from muscle fibers within the vicinity of the needle tip. With appropriate filter settings, information on local fiber density can be obtained, but the dimensions of the motor unit (MU) and its internal structure cannot be determined. Several techniques have been developed to address this lack of spatial information, including multielectrodes, paired needle insertions, and, more recently, MU magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Perhaps the best known of these is scanning EMG, wherein a concentric needle electrode is withdrawn back through an MU in fixed increments to build a continuous representation of electrical activity within a corridor of the MU.

Scanning EMG has been used to measure MU territory in muscular dystrophy, as well as MU territory and temporal dispersion in neurogenic and myogenic disease. Most studies using scanning EMG demonstrated no changes in MU territory size in either myogenic or neurogenic disease, with one exception that showed a significant increase in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in patients with neurogenic disease. In contrast, notable internal structural changes within the MU have been shown in both disease groups, including fragmentation and increased polyphasic segments.

Scanning EMG has some limitations. First, it requires the insertion of two needles into the muscle and specialized equipment (computer-controlled stepper motor), increasing the time taken yet limiting its availability.

### Can electromyography objectively detect voluntary movement in disorders of consciousness [^112VPTqW]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Determining conscious processing in unresponsive patients relies on subjective behavioural assessment. Using data from hand electromyography, the authors studied the occurrence of subthreshold muscle activity in response to verbal command as an objective indicator of awareness in 10 disorders of consciousness patients. One out of eight vegetative state patients and both minimally conscious patients (n = 2) demonstrated an increased electromyography signal specifically linked to command. These findings suggest electromyography could be used to assess awareness objectively in pathologies of consciousness.

### Comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of the 2010 European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society and American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine diagnostic criteria for multifocal motor neuropathy [^114uu7pL]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare acquired motor neuropathy characterized by progressive multifocal or asymmetric weakness without sensory symptoms and signs. It typically affects the upper limbs more than the lower limbs. Electrodiagnostic studies reveal an asymmetric motor neuropathy with characteristic conduction block (CB). Serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) antiganglioside (anti‐GM1) antibodies are present in approximately 50% of patients. Its nosological characterization is relatively recent, dating back to 1988.

Unlike some motor neuropathies, MMN is treatable with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and untreated patients are likely to experience progressive muscle weakness that may result in serious functional impairment and reduced quality of life, making early diagnosis crucial. Since its nosological characterization, numerous sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed for MMN. In the absence of a pathognomonic diagnostic biomarker, diagnosis still relies on clinical manifestations and nerve conduction studies, possibly supported by some additional diagnostic examinations. Multifocal CB in motor nerves, occurring outside typical sites of nerve compression, remain the key instrumental and pathological hallmark of MMN. CB can be defined as the focal failure of a nerve impulse to propagate along a structurally intact axon. The CB observed in MMN is distinctive in that it exclusively affects motor fibers, whereas sensory conduction remains normal through the same nerve segment. There remains a debate regarding whether the decrease in the area or.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for muscle cramps, particularly in the context of initial evaluation (muscle spasticity), the AAPM&R 2024 guidelines recommend assessing the impact of spasticity on passive and active movement. Additionally, they advise evaluating the ability to repeat movements and overall function during the initial evaluation of patients with muscle spasticity.

### Utility of trapezius EMG for diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116KFbqY]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Needle electromyography (EMG) of the tongue is traditionally used as a key tool in the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), although achieving relaxation of the tongue is often challenging. Recently, frequent abnormalities in the EMGs of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) and upper trapezius muscles in ALS patients have been reported. To elucidate the diagnostic utility of these muscles, we performed a multicenter prospective study examining EMGs of the tongue (genioglossus), SCM, and trapezius in 104 ALS or suspected ALS patients. Additionally, we examined EMGs of the SCM and trapezius in 32 cervical spondylosis (CS) patients.

We mainly evaluated fibrillation potentials/positive sharp waves (Fib/PSWs) and fasciculation potentials. Complete relaxation was achieved in 85% of ALS patients in the trapezius, compared to only 6% of patients in the tongue. Fib/PSWs were observed in 8%, 13%, and 45% of ALS patients in the tongue, SCM, and trapezius, respectively, whereas fasciculation potentials were found in 1%, 7%, and 39%, respectively. Abnormal spontaneous activity of any type was found in 9%, 17%, and 63% of patients in the tongue, SCM, and trapezius, respectively.

The high frequency of abnormal spontaneous activity in the trapezius was consistent across different diagnostic categories; notably, 72% of clinically suspected ALS (progressive muscular atrophy) patients showed abnormalities in their trapezius. In our CS patient group, we did not observe Fib/PSWs or fasciculation potentials, indicating excellent specificity. Tongue EMG added little utility beyond the clinical sign of tongue atrophy.

### Nerve conduction and electromyography studies [^111MBGGC]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG), often shortened to 'EMGs', serve as a useful adjunct to the clinical examination of the peripheral nervous system and striated skeletal muscles. NCS provide an efficient and rapid method for quantifying nerve conduction velocity (CV) and the amplitude of both sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) and compound motor action potentials (cMAPs). The CV reflects the speed of propagation of action potentials, via saltatory conduction, along large myelinated axons in a peripheral nerve. The amplitude of SNAPs is partly determined by the number of axons in a sensory nerve, while the amplitude of cMAPs reflects the integrated function of motor axons, the neuromuscular junction, and striated muscles.

Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) can identify defects in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) transmission, whether pre- or post-synaptic. Needle EMG examination can detect myopathic changes in muscle and signs of denervation. By combining these procedures, it is possible to establish whether motor and/or sensory nerve cell bodies or peripheral nerves are damaged (e.g. motor neuronopathy, sensory ganglionopathy, or neuropathy) and also to indicate whether the primary target is the axon or the myelin sheath (i.e. axonal or demyelinating neuropathies). The distribution of nerve damage can be categorized as either generalized, multifocal (mononeuropathy multiplex), or focal, the latter often due to compression at common entrapment sites such as the carpal tunnel, Guyon's canal, cubital tunnel, radial groove, fibular head, and tarsal tunnel, among others.

### Combining electromyography and Raman spectroscopy: Optical EMG [^113mbTqH]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). Low credibility.

Electromyography (EMG) remains a key component of the diagnostic work-up for suspected neuromuscular disease; however, it does not provide insight into the molecular composition of muscle, which can provide diagnostic information. Raman spectroscopy is an emerging neuromuscular biomarker capable of generating highly specific molecular fingerprints of tissue. Here, we present "optical EMG", a combination of EMG and Raman spectroscopy, achieved using a single needle.

An optical EMG needle was created to collect electrophysiological and Raman spectroscopic data during a single insertion. We tested functionality with in vivo recordings in the SOD1 G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), using both transgenic (n = 10) and non-transgenic (NTg, n = 7) mice. Under anesthesia, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs), spontaneous EMG activity, and Raman spectra were recorded from both gastrocnemius muscles with the optical EMG needle. Standard concentric EMG needle recordings were also undertaken. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with standard univariate statistics, while Raman data were analyzed with both univariate and multivariate analyses.

A significant difference in CMAP amplitude was observed between SOD1 G93A and NTg mice with optical EMG and standard concentric needles (p = .015 and p = .011, respectively). Spontaneous EMG activity (positive sharp waves) was detected in transgenic SOD1 G93A mice only. Raman spectra demonstrated peaks associated with key muscle components.

### One nerve suffices: A clinically guided nerve ultrasound protocol for the differentiation of multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [^115hJdxc]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

In many cases, clinical deficits did not unequivocally identify one nervous structure. Single muscle testing in an individual patient often revealed that muscle functions of two different nerves were affected to the same extent. For distal muscle function deficits, the issues could be attributed to consecutive nerves; for instance, the sciatic versus peroneal nerve for dorsal foot extension or the C7 root versus the radial nerve for elbow extension.

Different selection strategies can be chosen for the nervous structure to be examined by ultrasound (US) based on individual clinical deficit distribution. These strategies were systematically compared for their diagnostic performance.

- **Diagnostic performance**:
	- The selection flow diagram and resulting models are detailed in Fig. 2, while the nerves finally selected according to each model can be found in Online Resource Table 3. Fig. 2 presents a flow chart of the different single nerve/nerve root selection strategies compared. The flowchart shows the various strategies assessed for determining the nerve/nerve root to include in an individualized US measurement protocol based on the results of clinical testing of motor deficits in an individual patient.

- **Preferred model**:
	- The model suggested for diagnostic application is shown in shaded green (model no. 7). This model is preferred because models without cervical roots exhibited slightly better diagnostic performance. Distal nervous structures and cross-sectional area (CSA) values are considered more easily measurable by US than proximal nervous structures and diameter measurements. However, diagnostic performance was stable or only slightly lower in models with the cervical root.

### French Society of ENT (SFORL) guidelines. Management of acute Bell's palsy [^114EWWeN]. European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Bell's palsy, specifically in relation to electrodiagnostic testing, the SFORL 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining the following studies during electroneuromyography for optimal prognostic value:

- **Study of bilateral facial nerve motor conduction**: Recorded in several muscles, including at least one peri-oral muscle (nasolabial groove, orbicularis oris, mentalis). Ideally, double recording simultaneously studies muscles with superior (nasalis, nasolabial groove) and inferior branch innervation (orbicularis oris, on the midline method). The nasolabial groove muscles may be more relevant for the patient, being preponderant in smiling. The prognostic value of compound muscle action potential amplitude in the orbicularis oculi seems controversial.

- **Study of blinking reflex**

- **Study of myography in more than two muscles**: From the superior and inferior facial nerve branches, screening for spontaneous activity at rest and assessing recruitment of motor units under effort.

### The electromyographic diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Does the evidence support the El Escorial criteria [^111X7yhQ]. Muscle & nerve (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to examine the accuracy of the El Escorial electromyographic criteria for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Based on a consecutive series of 73 patients with suspected ALS, the sensitivity of electromyography (EMG) ranged from 0.2 in the cranial segment to 0.74 in the thoracic segment. Specificity was highest (0.92–1.0) in the cranial and thoracic segments. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to examine the effect of varying the number of abnormal segments required for the diagnosis, we found an overall accuracy of 0.90 and 0.87 if one or two abnormal segments, respectively, were required. The best combination of sensitivity and specificity was achieved by requiring EMG changes in two segments with abnormalities in a single muscle in the cranial and thoracic segments, but abnormalities in two muscles in the cervical and lumbosacral regions. These findings lend support to the EMG criteria proposed at El Escorial.

### Role of EMG evaluation in muscle hyperactivity syndromes [^113ZjfBf]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Muscle hyperactivity can be a clinical feature on its own or, more commonly, an observation on electromyography (EMG) examinations. Whatever manifestation it takes, muscle hyperactivity always means enhanced excitability of muscle, axons, or neurons. Clinical findings may be variable, ranging from fasciculations to muscle cramps. Even though clinical examination may lead in most instances to suggest the diagnosis of the underlying disease, EMG studies are necessary to identify the type of abnormal discharges and suggest the site of their suspected origin.

Although in clinical studies, the action potential showing abnormal muscle hyperactivity is practically always recorded from muscle fibers, the site in which the impulse has arisen will determine its shape and firing patterns. In this review, we describe the EMG characteristics observed in syndromes featuring muscle hyperactivity and the pathophysiology underlying the abnormal firing of muscle fibers.

### Motor neurone excitability in back muscles assessed using mechanically evoked reflexes in spinal cord injured patients [^1132Ms7q]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical and functional assessment of back muscles in human spinal cord injury (SCI) has received little attention. This study aimed to develop a method for assessing the level of a thoracic spinal cord lesion based on the reflex activation of back muscles.

- **Methods**: In 11 control subjects and 12 subjects with clinically complete thoracic SCI (T2-T12), either a spinous process or an erector spinae muscle was prodded to elicit short latency reflexes recorded electromyographically at the spinal level of stimulation. An electromagnetic servo, attached to a blunt probe, applied stimuli at a frequency of 1 Hz and amplitude of 3 mm. Two trials of 50 mechanical prods were conducted at each site.

- **Results**: Reflexes were evoked in control subjects in 82% of trials when the spinous process was prodded and in 80% of trials when the muscle was prodded. In contrast, reflexes in SCI subjects could be elicited in 90–100% of trials two segments either above or below the lesion. Reflex responses in control subjects had a mean (SEM) latency of 5.72 (0.53) ms when the spinous process was prodded, and 5.42 (0.42) ms when the muscle was prodded. In the SCI subjects, responses exhibited slightly (but insignificantly) longer latencies both above and below the lesion to either stimulus. The amplitude of reflex responses, expressed as a percentage of the background EMG, was on average 2–3 times larger at the three vertebral levels spanning the lesion in SCI subjects than at sites above or below the lesion or at any level in control subjects.

- **Conclusion**: We propose that the size of…

### Muscle ultrasound: Present state and future opportunities [^112pTATa]. Muscle & Nerve (2021). Low credibility.

The optimal scan time for detecting fasciculations has been found to be 30‐60 seconds, which is similar to EMG. As a caveat, fasciculations of low amplitude on EMG (< 1 mV) and a simple morphology with a maximum of four phases on EMG could be missed with ultrasound, as a recent study by Bokuda et al. showed. It is thought that these fasciculations occur in muscles that are just at the beginning of denervation.

With the right equipment and settings, even fibrillations can be detected with ultrasound. A high‐resolution linear ultrasound probe with a frequency range of 5‐17 MHz will have a lateral resolution around 0.1‐0.3 mm. Since normal muscle fibers are around 0.04‐0.06 mm in diameter, and atrophic denervated ones will likely be smaller, several fibers need to fibrillate and move simultaneously to be seen by the probe. Fibrillations last about 50–100 μs, so with a frame rate of 20 Hz, it requires at least five fibrillations per second to cause enough displacement to be visible on screen. Just as for needle EMG, the occurrence of fibrillating muscle fibers is very temperature dependent, with a 30% decrease in their presence when the temperature is lowered from 39°C to 30°C.

### Electromyography evaluation of bodyweight exercise progression in a validated anterior cruciate ligament injury rehabilitation program: A cross-sectional study [^117KVjYs]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

In 2004, Risberg et al. provided an evidence-based review of the effectiveness of various rehabilitation programs for surgically or non-surgically treated ACL injuries in adult patients. The review emphasized that although all lower extremity muscles must be included in rehabilitation after ACL injury or reconstruction, particular attention must be paid to strengthening the quadriceps, as it is the most affected muscle in these situations. In our study, a significant increase in quadriceps muscle activity from one phase to the next was observed, which implies that bodyweight exercises were successfully progressed in the present rehabilitation protocol. Furthermore, in phase 3, both vastus lateralis (VL) and vastus medialis (VM) reached activity levels high enough to stimulate strength gains (i.e. > 60% nEMG). This indicates that the key goal of the late rehabilitation phase (i.e. to achieve substantial strength gains) is achievable with the present bodyweight exercises. Furthermore, there is consensus that vastus medialis oblique (VMO) activation and active knee extension are essential in ACL rehabilitation. In this regard, all exercises in phase 3 induced quadriceps activity levels more than 60% nEMG with significant VM dominance (i.e. 27–34 percentage points higher activity than VL).

This study has several limitations. The present study evaluated the exercises in healthy athletes, which prevents us from concluding that the findings can be generalized to ACL patients. However, the present EMG evaluation could be considered healthy reference material for comparison.

### Multichannel surface EMG: Basic aspects and clinical utility [^112wKqfT]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

The generation of the surface electromyogram (sEMG) is described with regard to the properties of the single muscle fiber action potential as a source, the physical aspects of volume conduction and recording configuration, and the properties and firing pattern of motor units (MUs). The spatial aspect of the motor unit action potential (MUP) is emphasized in relation to the results of high-density, multichannel sEMG measurements. The endplate zone, depth, size, and position of MUs can be estimated. Muscle fiber conduction velocity measurements are used in channelopathies, and the changes in pathological fatigue are described. Using the unique patterns of spatial spread of MUPs over the skin (MU fingerprint), MU classification and the determination of firing moments are done noninvasively. Clinical applications of high-density sEMG measurements are reviewed. Emerging possibilities provided by MUP size and fingerprint measurements in neuromuscular disease and motor control are discussed. We conclude that multichannel sEMG adds unique, and sometimes indispensable, spatial information to our knowledge of the motor unit.

### Effects of intramuscular needle position on motor unit action potential metrics [^114Xysyg]. Muscle & Nerve (2007). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether there are clinically significant differences in amplitude, duration, and numbers of turns and phases if an electromyographic (EMG) study is performed near to, or far from, the end-plate zone. The effects of temporal dispersion of arriving muscle-fiber action potentials on quantitative motor unit action potential (MUAP) metrics were assessed in simulated and biologic muscles. Two muscle simulation models were studied with electrode recording positions near the motor end-plate zone and 50–75 mm away.

When the electrode was moved away from the end-plate zone, averages of 20 MUAPs significantly decreased in amplitude and area, and increased in numbers of turns and phases, but there was no significant change in duration. In biologic muscles (both normal and pathologic), similar changes in average metrics were observed, but to lesser degrees; few were statistically significant. Zones of innervation in biologic muscles are broadly distributed and, during routine electrode studies, distances between random electrode placements and end-plate zones are therefore relatively short, leading to clinically insignificant changes in quantitative MUAP metrics with distance from the end-plate zone. Thus, electrode position within a muscle is unlikely to affect clinical MUAP interpretation.

### Motor unit recruitment and bursts of activity in the surface electromyogram during a sustained contraction [^111JRmPT]. Muscle & Nerve (2008). Low credibility.

Bursts of activity in the surface electromyogram (EMG) during a sustained contraction have been interpreted as corresponding to the transient recruitment of motor units, but this association has never been confirmed. The study compared the timing of trains of action potentials discharged by single motor units during a sustained contraction with the bursts of activity detected in the surface EMG signal. The 20 motor units from 6 subjects [recruitment threshold, 35.3 ± 11.3% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force] that were detected with fine wire electrodes discharged 2–9 trains of action potentials (7.2 ± 5.6 s in duration) when recruited during a contraction that was sustained at a force below its recruitment threshold (target force, 25.4 ± 10.6% MVC force). High-pass filtering the bipolar surface EMG signal improved its correlation with the single motor unit signal. An algorithm applied to the surface EMG was able to detect 75% of the trains of motor unit action potentials. The results indicate that bursts of activity in the surface EMG during a constant-force contraction correspond to the transient recruitment of higher-threshold motor units in healthy individuals, and these results could assist in the diagnosis and design of treatment in individuals who demonstrate deficits in motor unit activation.

### CK-2127107 amplifies skeletal muscle response to nerve activation in humans [^112NFmYE]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

The force‐frequency response of each participant was measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 hours postdose during each of the four dosing periods in CY 5013. Each stimulation protocol consisted of stimulation trains at 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 30, and 50 Hertz, with a pulse width of 0.5 milliseconds and a duration of 800 milliseconds. The stimulation frequency was delivered in random order so that participants could not anticipate the intensity of the stimulus, with a single stimulus pulse delivered 5 seconds before and 5 seconds after each stimulus train to elicit a twitch response. Twitch–train–twitch sequences were separated by 30 seconds. At each assessment time point, the stimulation protocol was performed in triplicate. Blood samples were taken to measure CK‐107 plasma concentrations.

The data acquisition system used to create stimulation pulse trains, amplify the EMG, and measure the strain‐gauge output was custom-designed. The measurement device and control software were validated to meet 21 CFR 11 regulatory requirements to ensure patient safety, confidentiality, and data integrity for use in a clinical trial.

- **Statistical analyses**: AEs were classified by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (versions used: CY 5011, 16.0; CY 5012, 16.1; CY 5013, 17.0). The number and percentage of participants with treatment‐emergent AEs were summarized by SOC, preferred term, treatment, and dose. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic methods were used for pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma concentration‐time profiles to determine maximum.

### Excitability properties of motor axons in patients with spontaneous motor unit activity [^115i9JHD]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Measures of nerve excitability provide information about the biophysical properties of peripheral axons in disease states. One measure, the strength duration time constant (tau(SD)), was previously reported to be prolonged in motor axons of patients with acquired neuromyotonia. This study used a new protocol, applying a more comprehensive and sensitive panel of measures of axonal excitability. The objectives were to determine firstly whether changes in tau(SD) were present in a group of patients with evidence of spontaneous motor unit activity, and secondly, if such changes in tau(SD) were observed, whether other parameters of axonal excitability were affected, to clarify the mechanism of the change in tau(SD).

Eleven patients with both symptoms and EMG evidence of spontaneous motor unit activity were studied. Eight had autoimmune-associated acquired neuromyotonia (aNMT) and three had the cramp fasciculation syndrome.

- **Methods**: The protocol first measured stimulus-response behavior using two stimulus durations, from which the distribution of strength-duration time constants was estimated. Then, threshold tracking was utilized to determine threshold electrotonus to 100 ms polarizing currents, a current-threshold relation indicating inward and outward rectification, and the recovery of excitability after supramaximal activation.

- **Results**: The results were compared with previously published normal data. The value for tau(SD) of motor axons in the patient group was 0.43 (0.02) ms (mean (SEM)), identical to the control value. Most other indices of axonal excitability…

### Botox [^111W5dPR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Adult Spasticity

Dosing in initial and sequential treatment sessions should be tailored to the individual based on the size, number, and location of muscles involved, severity of spasticity, the presence of local muscle weakness, the patient's response to previous treatment, or adverse event history with Botox.

The recommended dilution is 200 Units/4 mL or 100 Units/2 mL with preservative-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. The lowest recommended starting dose should be used, and no more than 50 Units per site should generally be administered. An appropriately sized needle (e.g. 25–30 gauge) may be used for superficial muscles, and a longer 22 gauge needle may be used for deeper musculature. Localization of the involved muscles with techniques such as needle electromyographic guidance, nerve stimulation, or ultrasound is recommended.

Repeat Botox treatment may be administered when the effect of a previous injection has diminished, but generally no sooner than 12 weeks after the previous injection. The degree and pattern of muscle spasticity at the time of re-injection may necessitate alterations in the dose of Botox and muscles to be injected.

- **Adult upper limb spasticity**: In clinical trials, doses ranging from 75 Units to 400 Units were divided among selected muscles at a given treatment session.

- **Adult lower limb spasticity**: The recommended dose for treating adult lower limb spasticity is 300 Units to 400 Units divided among 5 muscles.

### Characteristics and significance of doublets on needle EMG [^1139se7r]. Muscle & Nerve (2017). Low credibility.

Voluntary doublets are electrophysiological phenomena thought to be associated with metabolic derangements or neuromuscular conditions.

- **Methods**: We prospectively studied 232 consecutive patients examined by a single examiner during routine electromyography (EMG) to determine the frequency of doublets in individual patients, specific muscles, neuromuscular conditions, electrolyte levels, and doublet characteristics.

- **Results**: Of 232 patients, 25 (10.7%) exhibited doublets. The mean age was 59 (52% men). Only 32 of 1,303 (2.5%) muscles exhibited doublets. Lower extremity and paraspinal groups represented 91% of muscles with doublets. Doublet frequency grouped by EMG diagnoses was: ALS (3 of 11; 27.1%), myopathy (3 of 10; 30.0%), axonal polyneuropathy (7 of 29; 24.1%), and no disease (7 of 109; 6.4%). There were no differences in serum electrolytes between doublet and matched subjects.

- **Conclusions**: Doublets occur in approximately 10% of patients, more commonly in lower extremity and paraspinal muscles, and are not correlated with a specific metabolic abnormality or neuromuscular condition. Muscle Nerve 55: 598–600, 2017.

### Decomposition-based quantitative electromyography: Methods and initial normative data in five muscles [^116reDPZ]. Muscle & Nerve (2003). Low credibility.

Quantitative electromyographic (EMG) techniques provide clinically useful information to aid in the diagnosis and follow the course or response to treatment of diseases affecting the motor system. The purpose of this study was to describe a decomposition-based quantitative electromyography method (DQEMG) designed to obtain clinically applicable information relating to motor unit potential (MUP) size and configuration, and motor unit (MU) firing characteristics. Additionally, preliminary normative data were obtained from the deltoid, biceps brachii, first dorsal interosseous, vastus medialis, and tibialis anterior muscles of 13 control subjects.

DQEMG was capable of efficiently and accurately extracting MUP data from complex interference patterns during mild to moderate contractions. MUP amplitude, surface-detected MUP (S-MUP) amplitude, MUP duration, number of phases, and MU firing frequencies varied significantly across muscles. The mean parameter values for the individual muscles studied were similar to previous reports based on other quantitative methods. The main advantages of this method are the speed of data acquisition and processing, the ability to obtain MUPs from MUs with low and higher recruitment thresholds, and the ability to obtain both S-MUP or macro-MUP data as well as MU firing rate information.

### Skeletal muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^115znSBt]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

An undisputed fact is that the skeletal muscle of patients with ALS is subject to chronic neurogenic changes, similar to other diseases of peripheral motor nerve loss but in contrast to primary muscle diseases. It is thus clear that a large part of muscle alterations related to ALS occur subsequent to motor neuron (MN) degeneration. This is illustrated by early clinical neurophysiological investigations on patients with ALS, such as the classic study by Erminio et al. in 1959 that characterized motor unit territories of patients with peripheral nerve injury and ALS.

In contrast to modern EMG, this study employed a novel needle electrode in which 14 active recording ports were placed 2.5 mm apart along the shaft of the needle. The needle was 1 mm in diameter and inserted orthogonal to the long axis of muscle fibers, making this a heroic study for participants. Participants were asked to contract the muscle in question. An attempt was made to localize the needle so the middle electrode displayed the activity of a single motor unit, producing larger amplitude waveforms than the neighboring electrodes, which recorded from the same MN at varying distances from its motor point. In this way, both the maximum electrical amplitude and the spatial extent of the motor unit potential (MUP) could be examined.

Figure 2A shows the pattern seen for four motor units from patients with ALS, judged severe to mild, along with an MUP from a normal subject. The ALS patient MUP was, in general, higher in amplitude.

### Physiologic basis of potentials recorded in electromyography [^113npwPo]. Muscle & Nerve (2000). Low credibility.

The extracellularly recorded configuration of a single muscle fiber discharge is generally appreciated to be triphasic with an initially positive deflection. However, careful attention to waveform appearance during the electrodiagnostic medicine examination reveals that both innervated and denervated muscle waveforms may display a pantheon of configurations. Despite the fact that innervated and denervated single muscle fiber discharges arise from distinctly different intracellular action potential (IAP) configurations, their extracellularly recorded waveforms can appear quite similar, leading to potential misidentification and, hence, the possibility of an erroneous diagnostic conclusion.

The least appreciated, but nevertheless critical, aspect of explanations for muscle waveform configurations is the relationship between the muscle fiber and recording electrode. Additionally, it is important to appreciate both the near-field and far-field aspects of single fiber and compound muscle action potentials. In this review, the leading/trailing dipole model is used to explain muscle waveform configurations in both innervated and denervated tissues.

### Assessment of pulmonary function in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: when can polygraphy help evaluate the need for non-invasive ventilation [^117QGwJX]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

There are several measures of respiratory muscle strength. An FVC < 50%, seated or supine, has been widely applied as the threshold to initiate NPPV. Moreover, measurements of respiratory muscle strength, nocturnal gas exchange, and symptomatic complaints are used as indicators to start NPPV. Several consensus statements also recommend starting NPPV when daytime hypercapnia and nocturnal hypoventilation are present, when maximum inspiratory pressure is < 60 cm H2O, or if nocturnal arterial oxygen saturation (artSpO2) is < 88% for more than five consecutive minutes. However, these recommendations are not based on controlled studies and none were developed selectively for ALS.

Detecting early respiratory dysfunction in ALS is important but proving to be problematical. Needle electromyography (EMG) seems to be a sensitive measure of early respiratory failure in ALS, but it is usually not a routine component. Therefore, in daily routine, one must use several measures of respiratory muscle strength to monitor the progression of respiratory muscle weakness in ALS, because there is no single respiratory test available that can be used to reliably predict the onset of respiratory failure.

We aimed to study the usefulness of polygraphy to predict respiratory failure. In contrast to polysomnography, polygraphy represents an alternative, less time-consuming, and cost-consuming method of measuring sleep parameters without utilizing EEG recordings. Although analysis of sleep architecture (sleep states) is impossible, detailed information of nightly respiration can still be gathered.

### Is needle electromyography safe in patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy [^115tpGk7]. Nature Clinical Practice Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Needle electromyography (EMG) is a valuable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), yet the risk of complications with this procedure in patients on anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications is unknown. Guidelines recommend caution when performing needle EMG in patients with disturbances of hemostasis because of the risks of intramuscular hemorrhage or other bleeding.

This commentary reviews a study by Lynch et al. that investigated the risk of hematoma formation following needle EMG of the tibialis anterior muscle in 158 patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications. The authors used a standardized approach to the needle examination, followed by the application of direct pressure to the insertion site after removal of the needle. Three hematomas were detected: two in patients on warfarin and one in a patient taking clopidogrel. None of the patients had symptomatic bleeding. These results indicate that the risk of hematoma formation is low following needle EMG when direct pressure is applied after removal of the needle.

### Electrodiagnostic subtyping in Guillain-Barré syndrome patients in the International Guillain-Barré Outcome Study [^112Ena3N]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The study is based on the first 1500 patients included in IGOS, a prospective observational cohort study. A description of the collection of NCS data in IGOS has been published previously. Inclusion criteria were the fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria for GBS (of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) or one of the clinical variants; the presence of NCS with at least two motor nerves examined; and patients presenting within two weeks after the onset of GBS-related symptoms. Exclusion criteria included study protocol violation, other diagnoses, and insufficient clinical and electrophysiological data.

Local investigators were free to conduct EDx studies according to their standards, but it was recommended to perform studies twice: the first within seven days of registration in IGOS, and the second at four weeks after. Only the first EDx studies were used for this analysis. For motor conduction, the IGOS protocol recommended measuring unilaterally the median, ulnar, peroneal (fibular), and tibial nerves, including F-waves, with recording sites at the abductor pollicis brevis muscle, abductor digiti minimi muscle, extensor digitorum brevis muscle, and abductor hallucis muscle, respectively. Limb temperature control was allowed to be performed by local standards. The study report was uploaded to the online IGOS database and checked.

Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the IGOS database. Patients were classified into one of the following clinical variants: sensorimotor, pure motor, and M.

### Dysport [^116GP1fY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Dosing in initial and subsequent treatment sessions should be tailored to the individual based on the size, number, and location of muscles involved, severity of spasticity, the presence of local muscle weakness, the patient's response to previous treatment, and/or adverse reaction history with botulinum toxins. No more than 1 mL should generally be administered at any single injection site. The maximum recommended total dose, combining both upper and lower limbs, of Dysport for the treatment of spasticity in adults is 1500 Units.

Although the actual location of the injection sites can be determined by palpation, the use of injection guiding techniques, such as electromyography, electrical stimulation, or ultrasound, is recommended to accurately target the injection sites.

- **Upper limb spasticity**: In the clinical trial that assessed the efficacy and safety of Dysport for the treatment of upper limb spasticity in adults, doses of 500 Units and 1000 Units were divided among selected muscles at a given treatment session. Repeat Dysport treatment should be administered when the effect of a previous injection has diminished, but no sooner than 12 weeks after the previous injection. A majority of patients in clinical studies were retreated between 12 and 16 weeks; however, some patients experienced a longer duration of response, up to 20 weeks. The degree and pattern of muscle spasticity at the time of re-injection may necessitate alterations in the dose of Dysport.

### Probabilistic muscle characterization using QEMG: Application to neuropathic muscle [^115vFRCA]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). Low credibility.

Clinicians who use electromyographic (EMG) signals to determine the presence or absence of abnormalities in a muscle often evaluate sets of motor unit potentials (MUPs) both qualitatively and quantitatively. This process is intended to characterize the muscle in a clinically meaningful way, albeit with varying degrees of success. The intent of this study was to evaluate the performance of automated, conventional Means/Outlier and probabilistic methods in converting MUP statistics into concise and clinically relevant muscle characterizations.

Probabilistic methods combine MUP characterizations, derived using Pattern Discovery (PD), of all MUPs detected from a muscle into a characterization measure that indicates normality or abnormality. In this study, MUP data from healthy control subjects and patients with known neuropathic disorders were used. A probabilistic method applying Bayes' rule was used to combine MUP characterizations into a Bayesian muscle characterization (BMC). This method achieved a categorization accuracy of 79.7% compared to 76.4% using the Mean method for biceps muscles (P > 0.1) and 94.6% accuracy for the BMC method compared to 85.8% using the Mean method (P < 0.01) for first dorsal interosseous muscles.

The BMC method facilitates the determination of "possible", "probable", or "definite" levels for a given muscle categorization (e.g. neuropathic). In contrast, the conventional Means and Outlier methods support only a dichotomous "normal" or "abnormal" decision. This work demonstrates that the BMC method can provide informative categorization of muscle conditions.

### Fasciculations in children [^112axqgk]. Pediatric Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Fasciculations represent the most common form of spontaneous muscle contractions and frequently occur in healthy individuals. However, they can also be associated with specific neurologic disorders in a minority of cases. Publications concerning the evaluation of pediatric patients experiencing fasciculations are limited. As a consequence, children might undergo invasive or expensive diagnostic investigations that prove unnecessary. Furthermore, without careful differential diagnosis consideration, rare neuromuscular disorders presenting with fasciculations in the pediatric population can be under-recognized by pediatric neurologists. This review examines the most important pediatric disorders associated with fasciculations and other spontaneous muscle contractions to aid pediatric neurologists in evaluating these cases.

### Fasciculations and cramps: How benign? Report of four cases progressing to ALS [^116A3JP7]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, diagnosing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in patients who initially present with cramps and fasciculations may not be clear during the first consultation. Sequential reviews, both clinical and neurophysiological, are crucial in managing such cases. Recent efforts to identify a more benign group with cramps and fasciculations have failed to provide information on the long-term profile, both clinical and neurophysiological. This report describes four patients who were initially diagnosed with benign cramps and fasciculations but subsequently progressed to ALS. We propose that a diagnosis of benign cramps and fasciculations should not be considered definitive without a minimum follow-up period of 4–5 years.

### Cramps, muscle pain, and fasciculations: Not always benign [^114X95To]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Fasciculation and cramps without weakness or muscle atrophy are recognized as a benign syndrome. The authors report a patient with cramp and fasciculation, which persisted for one year without abnormal motor unit morphology on EMG, before progressive weakness, muscle atrophy, and EMG abnormalities developed. This observation raises the possibility that lower motor neuron hyperexcitability may precede motor neuron death in motor neuron disease.

### Techniques and applications of EMG: Measuring motor units from structure to function [^1142N3Wj]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Needle electromyography (EMG) is an established method for evaluating motor unit and muscle fiber function and pathology in clinical practice. The development of advanced techniques, including single-fiber EMG and combined recordings with other modalities, has become increasingly useful in research. Particularly, the development of quantitative EMG has led to greater reproducibility and inter-rater reliability. This review provides an overview of standard needle EMG and discusses advanced recording and analysis techniques, highlighting their increasing role in clinical research.

### Combining electromyography and Raman spectroscopy: Optical EMG [^114XPPaj]. Muscle & Nerve (2023). High credibility.

Electromyography (EMG) remains a key component of the diagnostic work-up for suspected neuromuscular disease, but it does not provide insight into the molecular composition of muscle, which can provide diagnostic information. Raman spectroscopy is an emerging neuromuscular biomarker capable of generating highly specific, molecular fingerprints of tissue. Here, we present "optical EMG", a combination of EMG and Raman spectroscopy, achieved using a single needle.

- **Methods**: An optical EMG needle was created to collect electrophysiological and Raman spectroscopic data during a single insertion. Functionality was tested with in vivo recordings in the SOD1 G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), using both transgenic (n = 10) and non-transgenic (NTg, n = 7) mice. Under anesthesia, compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs), spontaneous EMG activity, and Raman spectra were recorded from both gastrocnemius muscles with the optical EMG needle. Standard concentric EMG needle recordings were also undertaken. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with standard univariate statistics, and Raman data with both univariate and multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: A significant difference in CMAP amplitude was observed between SOD1 G93A and NTg mice with optical EMG and standard concentric needles (p = .015 and p = .011, respectively). Spontaneous EMG activity (positive sharp waves) was detected in transgenic SOD1 G93A mice only. Raman spectra demonstrated peaks associated with key muscle components, revealing significant differences in molecular composition between SOD1 G93A and NTg mice.

### The value of multiple tests of respiratory muscle strength [^116f4Qzr]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

Respiratory muscle weakness is an important clinical problem. Tests of varying complexity and invasiveness are available to assess respiratory muscle strength. However, the relative precision of different tests in detecting weakness is less clear, as is the value of using multiple tests.

- **Methods**: The respiratory muscle function tests of clinical referrals who underwent multiple tests in our laboratories over a six-year period were analyzed. Thresholds for weakness for each test were determined from published and in-house laboratory data. The patients were divided into three groups: those who had all relevant measurements of global inspiratory muscle strength (group A, n = 182), those with a full assessment of diaphragm strength (group B, n = 264), and those for whom expiratory muscle strength was fully evaluated (group C, n = 60). The diagnostic outcome of each inspiratory, diaphragm, and expiratory muscle test, both singly and in combination, was studied. The impact of using more than one test to detect weakness was also calculated.

- **Results**: The clinical referrals were primarily for the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases and dyspnoea of unknown cause. A low maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (Pimax) was recorded in 40.1% of referrals in group A, while a low sniff nasal pressure (Sniff Pnasal) was recorded in 41.8% and a low sniff oesophageal pressure (Sniff Poes) in 37.9%. When assessing inspiratory strength with the combination of all three tests, 29.6% of patients had weakness. Using the two non-invasive tests (Pimax and Sniff Pnasal) in combination showed a similar result.

### Dysport [^115M6zit]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dosing in spasticity in adults should be tailored to the individual based on factors such as the size, number, and location of muscles involved. It also considers the severity of spasticity, the presence of local muscle weakness, the patient's response to previous treatments, and any history of adverse reactions with botulinum toxins. Generally, no more than 1 mL should be administered at any single injection site. The maximum recommended total dose of Dysport for the treatment of spasticity in adults, combining both upper and lower limbs, is 1500 Units.

Although the actual location of injection sites can be determined by palpation, it is recommended to use injection guiding techniques, such as electromyography, electrical stimulation, or ultrasound, to accurately target the injection sites.

- **Upper limb spasticity**: In the clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of Dysport for upper limb spasticity in adults [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], doses of 500 Units and 1000 Units were divided among selected muscles during a treatment session. A majority of patients in clinical studies were retreated between 12–16 weeks; however, some patients experienced a longer response duration, such as 20 weeks. The degree and pattern of muscle spasticity at the time of re-injection may require alterations in the dose of Dysport. Repeat treatment should be administered when the effect of a previous injection has diminished, but no sooner than 12 weeks after the previous injection.

### Imaging muscle as a potential biomarker of denervation in motor neuron disease [^114htCrc]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Regions of interest were contoured manually according to the standardised anatomical landmarks (see online supplementary file 1) on single unprocessed coronal slices, in line with previous studies, using a semiautomated spline function provided in the system manufacturer's online workstation (Extended MR Workspace V.2.6.3.5, Philips Healthcare). Intrarater and inter-rater reproducibility was first confirmed by two independent raters, who achieved coefficients of variation < 5% for all regions of interest on six practice datasets at least 24 hours apart. Final contouring was performed by a single blinded operator (TMJ), and mean T2 signal estimates were derived for the tongue, right and left biceps, right and left thoracic paraspinals, right and left anterolateral leg compartment encompassing TA, second cervical vertebral body, right humerus, and right tibia. Individual anterolateral leg compartment muscle boundaries are not readily distinguishable on coronal MR but TA predominates and is used for brevity for the remainder of this manuscript. Muscle region of interest T2 values were expressed relative to those obtained from bone within the same station (tongue:second cervical vertebral body, biceps:humerus, paraspinals:humerus, and TA:tibia). A mean paraspinal muscle estimate was used for all analyses except where otherwise specified, in order for the thoracic domain to be represented by a single parameter, in accordance with El Escorial criteria. All scans were reviewed by a consultant neuroradiologist (NH) and incidental findings were reported back to study participants.

### Electromyography-related pain: Muscle selection is the key modifiable study characteristic [^112YwSYc]. Muscle & Nerve (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to estimate the effects of patient, provider, and study characteristics on electromyography (EMG)-related pain.

- **Methods**: Patients undergoing EMG rated their EMG-related pain after each muscle was studied on a 100-point visual analog scale (VAS). Investigators recorded the order in which the muscles were sampled, the total time spent with the needle in each muscle, and whether electrical endplate noise was noted.

- **Results**: A total of 1781 muscles were studied in 304 patients. Eleven muscles were associated with significantly more or less pain than the others. Endplate noise was associated with more pain (5.4 mm, 95% CI 2.8–7.0). There was a small but significant effect from needling time (0.02 mm, 95% CI 0.00–0.04).

- **Conclusions**: Among factors that electromyographers can control, muscle selection has the greatest impact on pain. Our data include an extensive list of muscle-specific EMG-related pain scores. Provider and other study characteristics have little or no impact on EMG-related pain.

### A cross-sectional electromyography assessment in linear scleroderma patients [^112zDHAn]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Muscle atrophy and asymmetric extremity growth are common features of linear scleroderma (LS). Extra-cutaneous features are also common, and primary neurologic involvement with sympathetic dysfunction may have a pathogenic role in subcutaneous and muscle atrophy. The aim was to investigate nerve conduction and muscle involvement by electromyography in pediatric patients with LS.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective review of LS pediatric patients who had regular follow-up at a single pediatric center from 1997–2013. We selected participants if they had consistently good follow-up and enrolled consecutive patients in the study. We examined LS photos as well as clinical, serological, and imaging findings. Electromyograms (EMG) were performed using bilateral symmetric techniques, with surface and needle electrodes, comparing the affected side with the contralateral side. Abnormal muscle activity was categorized as a myopathic or neurogenic pattern.

- **Results**: Nine LS subjects were selected for EMG: two with Parry-Romberg/Hemifacial Atrophy Syndrome, seven with linear scleroderma of an extremity, and two with mixed forms (linear and morphea). Electromyogram analysis indicated that all but one had an asymmetric myopathic pattern in muscles underlying the linear streaks. Motor and sensory nerve conduction was also evaluated in upper and lower limbs, and one presented a neurogenic pattern. Masticatory muscle testing showed a myopathic pattern in the atrophic face of two cases with head and face involvement.
