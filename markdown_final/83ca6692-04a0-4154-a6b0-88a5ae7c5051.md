## Question

What is a normal BUN to creatinine ratio

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the normal BUN/creatinine ratio is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what BUN and creatinine represent and why the ratio is used. Then, I should verify the normal ratio in conventional units and in SI units and ensure unit conversions are sound. Next, I will review interpretive thresholds and common caveats that can mislead clinicians. After that, I should check the diagnostic performance of the ratio for AKI phenotyping and whether guidelines endorse its use. Finally, I will integrate how to apply this in practice alongside eGFR and albuminuria, and summarize a safe, evidence-aligned answer with appropriate cautions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical constructs. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) reflects hepatic urea production and renal handling of urea, while creatinine reflects muscle metabolism and renal filtration with some tubular secretion; the BUN/creatinine ratio has historically been used to conceptualize prerenal versus intrinsic causes of AKI due to differential tubular urea reabsorption in hypoperfusion states, but I need to be careful because this tool has limitations and should not be interpreted in isolation [^111JuxEs] [^111ATaCw] [^114AzhGJ].

> Now, what is the "normal" BUN/creatinine ratio in mg/dL units? The commonly taught reference range is roughly 10:1 to 20:1 when both analytes are in mg/dL, which aligns with classic clinical practice, but wait, let me verify whether the cited KDIGO 2024 guideline explicitly states this numeric range; I should double-check because KDIGO focuses more on eGFR and albuminuria than on fixed BUN/creatinine cutoffs, so while I initially attributed the 10–20:1 to KDIGO, the explicit numeric range may not be directly specified there even though the conceptual use of these markers is consistent with KDIGO's broader framework for kidney evaluation [^111ATaCw] [^112P3426].

> I should confirm SI unit framing next. When urea and creatinine are expressed in mmol/L, under normal conditions the ratio is typically less than 100, which is mathematically concordant with the ~10–20:1 range in mg/dL, but hold on, I should verify the source; the ED-based nephrology literature explicitly frames a normal BUN/creatinine ratio as less than 100 in mmol/L units, and this serves as a practical SI anchor for clinicians who use mmol/L routinely [^111ATaCw].

> Next, I will examine interpretive thresholds and their meaning, but I need to ensure I do not overstate diagnostic accuracy. Ratios greater than about 20:1 in mg/dL are classically linked to hypoperfusion/prerenal states due to increased urea reabsorption, whereas a ratio below about 10:1 may point toward intrinsic renal processes or occasionally postrenal causes; however, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because these thresholds are context dependent and can be confounded by many non-GFR determinants of BUN and creatinine [^111ATaCw] [^1125mN4N].

> I will now examine real-world diagnostic performance. I should confirm whether BUN/creatinine discriminates prerenal from intrinsic AKI in practice; multiple large emergency department analyses show essentially no discriminatory capacity with AUROC approximating 0.5, so relying on the ratio alone to phenotype AKI is unsafe and may be misleading, which reinforces the need for clinical context, urine output, and urinalysis rather than ratio-based dichotomies [^114Pe6mf] [^115CRY98] [^111JuxEs].

> But wait, what if the ratio is low rather than high; does that help? A notable exception to the usual "high ratio" narrative is that a BUN/creatinine ratio of 12 or lower has been associated with biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis in hospitalized AKI, suggesting that a very low ratio can be a supportive clue in the right clinical setting, though even here, I should confirm that it is an adjunct and not a standalone diagnostic test [^112kJxys].

> Let me consider major confounders before applying thresholds. Gastrointestinal bleeding, high protein intake, catabolic illness, fever, trauma, infection, thyrotoxicosis, and corticosteroids or tetracyclines can increase BUN and inflate the ratio, whereas osmotic diuresis and acetazolamide can lower the ratio even during hypovolemia; liver disease or malnutrition can also lower BUN, reducing the ratio, so I need to ensure these are considered before inferring pathophysiology from a single ratio value [^111JuxEs].

> Next, I should review how guidelines recommend approaching kidney evaluation so I don't overemphasize the ratio. KDIGO 2024 recommends serum creatinine–based eGFR for initial evaluation of CKD, and ESC 2024 hypertension guidance recommends creatinine, eGFR, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio at baseline and periodically in those with CKD; neither guideline endorses the BUN/creatinine ratio as a primary diagnostic tool, reinforcing that the ratio should be contextual rather than determinative [^112P3426] [^1114ry3p].

> I should also confirm prognostic versus diagnostic uses, because the ratio sometimes emerges as a risk marker. In chronic heart failure cohorts across HFrEF and HFpEF, higher BUN/creatinine ratios are associated with worse outcomes independent of eGFR and NT-proBNP, indicating the ratio may capture neurohormonal and hemodynamic information relevant to prognosis, but again, this is prognostic and not a substitute for kidney phenotyping in AKI or CKD workups [^111ATaCw].

> Let me think about integration with filtration markers. Because creatinine has non-GFR determinants, combining creatinine with cystatin C improves eGFR accuracy in many populations and can mitigate misclassification; I should confirm the value of confirmatory cystatin C or combined equations when the creatinine-only eGFR seems discordant with clinical context, which is aligned with contemporary discussions in nephrology and clinical chemistry [^1151ULyu] [^113Z68RZ].

> Final answer summary and self-check: The typical BUN/creatinine ratio regarded as "normal" is approximately 10:1 to 20:1 when both are in mg/dL, and in SI units the ratio is generally less than 100, but I should emphasize that these are reference ranges for context and not diagnostic absolutes; values above about 20:1 can suggest prerenal physiology and values below about 10:1 can suggest intrinsic renal disease or specific entities such as AIN when very low, yet the ratio alone performs poorly for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic AKI in emergency settings, so it must be interpreted alongside history, exam, urine studies, and guideline-recommended measures including eGFR and albuminuria, with selective use of cystatin C to improve GFR estimation when needed [^111ATaCw] [^114Pe6mf] [^112kJxys] [^112P3426] [^1114ry3p] [^1151ULyu].

The normal BUN-to-creatinine ratio is **10:1 to 20:1** in adults, with a typical average around 15:1. Ratios above **20:1** suggest prerenal azotemia (e.g. dehydration, heart failure, GI bleeding, high protein intake [^111JuxEs], corticosteroids) [^111JuxEs], while ratios below **10:1** suggest intrinsic renal disease or low protein states (e.g. liver disease, malnutrition, SIADH). The ratio should be interpreted in clinical context, as it is influenced by diet, hydration, medications [^notfound], and comorbidities [^111JuxEs].

## Normal range of BUN-to-creatinine ratio

The **normal range** is 10:1 to 20:1, with a **typical average** of ~15:1 [^113GXEgH].

---

## Clinical significance of BUN-to-creatinine ratio

The BUN-to-creatinine ratio helps differentiate prerenal from intrinsic renal causes of azotemia. Prerenal azotemia is suggested by a ratio > **20:1** (e.g. dehydration, heart failure, GI bleeding, high protein intake, corticosteroids) [^113GXEgH], whereas **intrinsic renal disease** is suggested by a ratio < **10:1** (e.g. acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, low protein intake, liver disease, SIADH).

---

## Factors influencing BUN-to-creatinine ratio

Several factors can affect the ratio [^114AzhGJ]:

| **Factor** | **Effect on ratio** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| High protein intake | Increases BUN | - High-protein diet <br/> - GI bleeding |
| Dehydration | Increases BUN | - Vomiting <br/> - Diarrhea <br/> - Diuretics [^113GXEgH] |
| Liver disease | Decreases BUN | - Cirrhosis <br/> - Hepatitis [^111JuxEs] |
| Muscle mass | Affects creatinine | High muscle mass increases creatinine [^113Z68RZ] |
| Medications | Variable | - Corticosteroids <br/> - ACE inhibitors <br/> - Diuretics |

---

## Clinical implications of abnormal BUN-to-creatinine ratios

An **elevated ratio (> 20:1)** suggests prerenal azotemia — evaluate for dehydration, heart failure, GI bleeding, or high protein intake [^113GXEgH], whereas a **decreased ratio (< 10:1)** suggests intrinsic renal disease or low protein states — evaluate for acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, liver disease, or malnutrition.

---

## Limitations of BUN-to-creatinine ratio

Limitations: The ratio should be interpreted **cautiously**:

- **Non-renal factors**: Diet, hydration, and medications can affect the ratio [^1125mN4N].
- **Limited specificity**: Not always reliable for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic AKI [^111KxnfM].
- **Clinical context**: Must be interpreted with clinical findings and other tests [^116PT6Sf].

---

The normal BUN-to-creatinine ratio is **10:1 to 20:1**, with an average around 15:1. It helps differentiate prerenal from intrinsic renal causes of azotemia, but interpretation must consider diet, hydration, medications, and comorbidities.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^113GXEgH]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "BUN/Creatinine Ratio" is employed in the evaluation of conditions such as diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, anemia of chronic kidney disease, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, hepatorenal syndrome, immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, infection-related glomerulonephritis, kidney transplantation, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is a valuable tool in nephrology and internal medicine. BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is a waste product formed in the liver and excreted by the kidneys, while Creatinine is a byproduct of muscle metabolism, also excreted by the kidneys.

This ratio is primarily used to differentiate between prerenal and renal causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). A high BUN/Creatinine ratio (> 20:1) often indicates a prerenal cause such as dehydration or decreased blood flow to the kidneys. Conversely, a low ratio (< 10:1) tends to suggest intrinsic renal disease or postrenal obstruction.

The BUN/Creatinine Ratio is relevant for patients with suspected kidney disease or injury, as well as those with known renal conditions where monitoring of renal function is essential. It is also useful for evaluating patients with altered mental status or suspected metabolic disorders.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the BUN/Creatinine ratio; however, it should be interpreted with caution in patients with liver disease, malnutrition, or those on certain medications that can affect its accuracy.

### Nonlinear association between blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and obstructive sleep apnea: a cross-sectional study from NHANES [^1151Cox7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The RCS curve depicted in Fig. 2 clearly illustrates that the correlation between OSA and BUCR is nonlinear in nature. A delve into the threshold effect pinpoints a critical turning point at 10.86. Below this threshold, each unit decrease in the BUCR index elevates OSA risk by 5% (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01–1.09, P = 0.014). Conversely, upon surpassing 10.86, this association loses statistical significance (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.996–1.02, P = 0.189), with the likelihood ratio test yielding a P-value of 0.068, indicating that BUCR may no longer serve as a reliable marker of OSA risk above a certain threshold. This may be an important reference for clinicians to assess patients' susceptibility to OSA sensitivity.

- **Fig. 2 description**: The RCS curve between OSA and BUCR. BUCR, blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio; OSA, obstructive sleep apnea; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence intervals.

- **Threshold effect analysis (Table 3)**: The threshold effect analysis of the BUCR on OSA risk. OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence intervals; BUCR, blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio; OSA, obstructive sleep apnea.

- **Subgroup analysis**: Multi-subgroup analyses and interaction tests, incorporating a diverse range of covariates, were conducted to rigorously evaluate the robustness of the BUCR-OSA correlation and to identify potential variations across diverse populations. Within the majority of subgroups, a consistent and significant association between BUCR and OSA was observed. However, notable differences emerged among diabetic populations, with a P-value for interaction of 0.0221.

### Vasotec [^113bCJpP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Clinical laboratory test findings**: Serum electrolytes: Hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Hyperkalemia), hyponatremia.

- **Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen**: In controlled clinical trials, minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, which were reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in about 0.2 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with Vasotec alone. Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics or in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS, Impaired Renal Function). In patients with heart failure who were also receiving diuretics, with or without digitalis, increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine, usually reversible upon discontinuation of Vasotec and/or other concomitant diuretic therapy, were observed in about 11 percent of patients. Increases in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine were a cause for discontinuation in 1.2 percent of patients.

- **Hematology**: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.3 g percent and 1.0 vol percent, respectively) occur frequently in either hypertension or congestive heart failure patients treated with Vasotec but are rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexists. In clinical trials, less than 0.1 percent of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Hemolytic anemia, including cases of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency, has been reported; a causal relationship to enalapril cannot be excluded.

- **Liver function tests**: Elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, more specifically with respect to initial investigations, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining serum creatinine, eGFR, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio in all patients with hypertension. Repeat measurements of serum creatinine, eGFR, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio at least annually if moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is diagnosed.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: a prospective observational study [^112rf4pi]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is one of the substances that affects the calculated serum osmolality (cSosm). A previous study demonstrated that BUN and cSosm were independently associated with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with preserved kidney function. In advanced CKD stages, there is a concomitant increase in cSosm and BUN levels. However, it remains unclear whether BUN or cSosm levels are related to renal outcomes in patients with moderate to severe kidney dysfunction. The aim of this study was to clarify whether the BUN or cSosm level is associated with kidney disease progression in patients with advanced CKD.

- **Methods**: In this prospective study, we enrolled 459 patients with CKD (stages 3–5). The composite renal endpoint was end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death, and ESRD alone was added as an alternative outcome. A Cox proportional hazards model was utilized to determine the risk factors for a poor renal outcome. We adjusted for covariates including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The cSosm (mOsm/kg) was calculated using the following formula: (2 × sodium) + (BUN/2.8) + (glucose/18).

- **Results**: During a median follow-up of 25.8 months, the renal endpoint was observed in 210 patients. Multivariable Cox analysis determined the hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for the composite renal outcome in the second, third, and fourth BUN quartiles were 1.36 (0.72–2.58), 1.87 (0.95–3.66), and 2.66 (1.23–5.76) (P for trend < 0.01), respectively, compared with the first BUN quartile.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111Se2m2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

In recent years, owing to environmental factors such as sedentary lifestyles and changing dietary habits, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has gradually become a global health problem. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report, the age-standardized prevalence rate of diabetes in 2019 is 8.3%, which is expected to reach 9.6% in 2045. In China, T2DM has imposed a heavy economic burden on patients and society, with the total economic burden of T2DM and its complications reaching 247.8 billion RMB in 2007. If patients living with T2DM do not take an active role in effectively controlling and treating their diseases, they are prone to a variety of diabetes-related complications that are responsible for impaired quality of life, disability, and premature death. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a cardiovascular complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). In a systematic evaluation of 4,549,481 patients living with T2DM, the total incidence of macrovascular complications was 32.2%, and CAD was one of the most common cardiovascular diseases (21.2%).

The dysfunction of the kidney not only implicates potential pathological changes of the kidney but could also influence other organs and systems as a result of the impairments in body homeostasis. The cardiovascular system is one of the most affected systems upon the impairment of renal function. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), a metabolic product of protein, is susceptible to external factors and is a very sensitive indicator of changes in hemodynamic and renal perfusion. Studies have shown that BUN is strongly associated with mor…

### What should European nephrology do with the new CKD-EPI equation [^113Z68RZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

We could consider changing the analyte from creatinine or adding an analyte to creatinine as a marker for kidney function. In this respect, cystatin C has received the most attention. In contrast to creatinine, cystatin C is produced by all nucleated cells, not only by myocytes. Its serum concentration is therefore not dependent on muscle mass. The CKD-EPI research group showed that new eGFR equations, which incorporate creatinine and cystatin C but omit race, are more accurate and lead to smaller differences between Black and non-Black participants than the new equations without race using creatinine alone.

Moreover, the use of cystatin C alone or in combination with creatinine strengthens the association between eGFR and the risks of death and kidney failure across diverse populations. Unfortunately, cystatin C is not widely available for clinical use because not every clinical chemistry lab offers its measurement, and related costs are generally considerably higher than for serum creatinine. Additionally, cystatin C is not independent of specific subjects' characteristics. For instance, it is increased in obesity, hyperthyroidism, inflammatory states, and steroids also increase cystatin C values. Furthermore, the standardization of cystatin C measurement has not yet been fully optimized. Efforts should therefore be made to make cystatin C available at lower costs and to improve its standardization. At present, the measurement of cystatin C for GFR estimation is especially advised for subjects with clearly abnormal muscle mass for their age and sex, and for subjects with conditions that affect creatinine levels.

### The precision of estimating protein intake of patients with chronic renal failure [^114x58fB]. Kidney International (2002). Low credibility.

Biochemical methods for estimating protein intake are based on the concept that nitrogen-containing products from dietary protein, plus the products arising from endogenous protein, are excreted as either urea or non-urea nitrogen (NUN). This formulation is based on the fact that urea is the principal end product of amino acid degradation, and hence, the urea appearance rate (or net urea production) is parallel to protein intake. The urea nitrogen appearance (UNA) rate is measured as the amount of urea excreted in urine plus the net amount accumulated in body water.

A more difficult problem is how to estimate NUN, which is the sum of fecal nitrogen and all forms of non-urea urinary nitrogen. Maroni, Steinman, and Mitch proposed estimating nitrogen intake (IN MARONI) from UNA plus a NUN excretion rate of 0.031 g nitrogen/kg body weight/day, as they found NUN correlated with body weight but not with dietary nitrogen. Kopple, Gao, and Qing proposed a different equation for estimating nitrogen intake (IN KOPPLE) = 1.20 UNA + 1.74, concluding that dietary nitrogen directly correlates with fecal nitrogen and that NUN is constant for all patients. Their report prompted us to review all nitrogen balance measurements we had conducted in order to address the following questions: Does dietary protein increase fecal nitrogen excretion? Does NUN vary with weight or is it constant? How do the two methods (IN MARONI and IN KOPPLE) compare in estimating dietary protein from UNA?

- **Methods**: We examined nitrogen balance and its components.

### Association of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio and long-term outcome among women with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: Filling gaps in female [^117Tghi9]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Previous studies have established an association between the BUN/Cr ratio and adverse outcomes in various cardiovascular conditions. Specifically, a higher admission BUN/Cr ratio predicts increased in-hospital mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, even after multivariable adjustment, and elevated ratios are independently associated with higher long-term all-cause mortality in acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients. In contrast, our study identifies the BUN/Cr ratio as a valuable prognostic marker in female patients undergoing CABG, where a higher ratio is associated with reduced mortality. This apparent contradiction likely stems from divergent pathophysiological mechanisms reflected by the BUN/Cr ratio across different cardiovascular states. In female CABG patients, an elevated ratio primarily signifies effective perioperative volume management (achieved through active diuresis and fluid restriction), resulting in relative volume deficit. This contrasts with AMI and ADHF, where a high ratio typically indicates pathological renal hypoperfusion secondary to severe cardiac dysfunction.

We utilized RCS functions to analyze the dose-response relationship regarding long-term outcomes. Our findings reveal an L-shaped association between BUN/Cr levels and HRs for all-cause mortality. When the BUN/Cr ratio is below the turning point of 17.308, the low ratio reflects volume overload or renal tubular dysfunction (such as insufficient diuresis, chronic kidney disease), leading to increased cardiac burden, pulmonary edema, and increased risk.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^114Pe6mf]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) has been used since the early 1940s to help clinicians differentiate between prerenal acute kidney injury (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI). This ratio is simple to use and often put forward as a reliable diagnostic tool, even though little scientific evidence supports this. The aim of this study was to determine whether BCR is a reliable tool for distinguishing PR AKI from I AKI.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective observational study over a 13-month period in the Emergency Department (ED) of Nantes University Hospital. Eligible for inclusion were all adult patients consecutively admitted to the ED with a creatinine > 133 μmol/L (1.5 mg/dL).

- **Results**: Sixty thousand one hundred sixty patients were consecutively admitted to the ED. A total of 2756 patients had plasma creatinine levels in excess of 133 μmol/L, and 1653 were excluded, leaving 1103 patients for definitive inclusion. The mean age was 75.7 ± 14.8 years old; 498 (45%) patients had PR AKI and 605 (55%) had I AKI. BCR was 90.55 ± 39.32 and 91.29 ± 39.79 in the PR AKI and I AKI groups, respectively. There was no statistical difference between the mean BCR of the PR AKI and I AKI groups (p = 0.758). The area under the ROC curve was 0.5, indicating that BCR had no capacity to discriminate between PR AKI and I AKI.

- **Conclusions**: Our study is the largest to investigate the diagnostic performance of BCR. BCR is not a reliable parameter for distinguishing prerenal AKI from intrinsic AKI.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^115yjVG1]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Our methodology induces two limitations. Firstly, our study was retrospective, with the well-known limitations of such studies. In particular, it was not possible for us to assess the contribution of the "urine output" component of the KDIGO criteria. Secondly, there is no widely accepted definition of prerenal AKI. The common observation is that it is a reversible condition, but diagnostic criteria such as the amount, nature, and duration of fluid resuscitation, time frame for reversibility, or target creatinine improvement have not been addressed.

We defined prerenal AKI as a return of serum creatinine to 110% (or less) of the baseline value during the seven days following admission. In their review of AKI, Bagshaw et al. reported that time frames for defining reversibility, i.e. prerenal AKI, varied considerably from 48 hours to seven days or more and sometimes were not reported at all. The shorter (48–72 hours) time frame is the most published but concerns almost exclusively patients from intensive care units, where blood samples are drawn every day. This is not necessarily the case for most patients, such as ours, admitted to medical wards. By choosing a 72-hour time frame for reversibility, we would have had to exclude many patients who didn't have blood samples precisely on day three. We did, however, carry out a subgroup analysis of these patients. We found 418 (38%) patients that had BUN and creatinine measured at 72 hours. Again, there was no statistical difference between the mean BCR of the prerenal and the intrinsic AKI groups; the area under the ROC curve was 0.55.

### Suggested guidelines for the diagnosis and management of urea cycle disorders: First revision [^111vgt8W]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for urea cycle disorders, specifically concerning dietary management, the TEWG-UCD 2019 guidelines recommend not using high-dose L-arginine in patients with argininosuccinate lyase deficiency due to neurological and hepatic complications. Offer L-arginine for long-term management at the same dose as for other UCDs, in combination with nitrogen scavengers and protein restriction.

### Imperfect gold standards for kidney injury biomarker evaluation [^114PbobT]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Clinicians have used serum creatinine in diagnostic testing for acute kidney injury for decades, despite its imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Novel tubular injury biomarkers may revolutionize the diagnosis of acute kidney injury; however, even if a novel tubular injury biomarker is 100% sensitive and 100% specific, it may appear inaccurate when using serum creatinine as the gold standard. Acute kidney injury, as defined by serum creatinine, may not reflect tubular injury, and the absence of changes in serum creatinine does not assure the absence of tubular injury.

In general, the apparent diagnostic performance of a biomarker depends not only on its ability to detect injury but also on disease prevalence and the sensitivity and specificity of the imperfect gold standard. Assuming that, at a certain cutoff value, serum creatinine is 80% sensitive and 90% specific and disease prevalence is 10%, a new perfect biomarker with a true 100% sensitivity may seem to have only 47% sensitivity compared with serum creatinine as the gold standard. Minimizing misclassification by using more strict criteria to diagnose acute kidney injury will reduce the error when evaluating the performance of a biomarker under investigation. Apparent diagnostic errors using a new biomarker may be a reflection of errors in the imperfect gold standard itself, rather than poor performance of the biomarker.

The results of this study suggest that small changes in serum creatinine alone should not be used to define acute kidney injury in biomarker or interventional studies.

### Kidney disease, race, and GFR estimation [^1112owL2]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Assessment of GFR is central to clinical practice, research, and public health. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommend measurement of serum creatinine to estimate GFR as the initial step in GFR evaluation. Serum creatinine is influenced by creatinine metabolism as well as GFR; hence, all equations to estimate GFR from serum creatinine include surrogates for muscle mass, such as age, sex, race, height, or weight. The guideline-recommended equation in adults (the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation) includes a term for race (specified as black versus nonblack), which improves the accuracy of GFR estimation by accounting for differences in non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine by race in the study populations used to develop the equation. In that study, blacks had a 16% higher average measured GFR compared with nonblacks with the same age, sex, and serum creatinine.

The reasons for this difference are only partly understood, and the use of race in GFR estimation has limitations. Some have proposed eliminating the race coefficient, but this would induce a systematic underestimation of measured GFR in blacks, with potential unintended consequences at the individual and population levels. We propose a more cautious approach that maintains and improves accuracy of GFR estimates and avoids disadvantaging any racial group. We suggest full disclosure of the use of race in GFR estimation, accommodation of those who decline to identify their race, and shared decision-making between health care providers and patients.

### Normalization of urinary biomarkers to creatinine during changes in glomerular filtration rate [^116xacj7]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary biomarkers, such as albumin and other markers of kidney injury, are frequently reported as a normalized ratio to urinary creatinine (UCr) concentration to control for variations in urine flow rate. The implicit assumption is that UCr excretion is constant across and within individuals, such that changes in the ratio will reflect changes in biomarker excretion. Using computer simulations of creatinine kinetics, we found that normalized levels of a biomarker reflecting tubular injury can be influenced by dynamic changes in the UCr excretion rate when the glomerular filtration rate changes.

Actual timed urine collections from hospitalized patients with changing glomerular filtration rates and/or critical illness exhibited variability in UCr excretion rates across and within individuals. Normalization by UCr may, therefore, result in an underestimation or overestimation of the biomarker excretion rate depending on the clinical context. Lower creatinine excretion in the setting of acute kidney injury or poor renal allograft function may amplify a tubular injury biomarker signal, thereby increasing its clinical utility.

The variability of creatinine excretion, however, will complicate the determination of a threshold value for normalized biomarkers of acute or chronic kidney disease, including albumin. Thus, we suggest that the most accurate method to quantify biomarkers requires the collection of timed urine specimens to estimate the actual excretion rate, provided that the biomarker is stable over the period of collection.

### Elevated blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio increased the risk of coronary artery disease in patients living with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111UU3AC]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic criteria of participants**: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was diagnosed according to the guideline for the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in China. Diagnosis was confirmed if one of the following criteria was met: ① Typical symptoms of diabetes such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and decreased body mass, along with a random blood glucose level ≥ 11.1 mmol/L; ② Fasting blood glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, or plasma glucose of 2 hours post-glucose load ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, or HbA1c ≥ 6.5%; ③ A previous medical diagnosis.

	- In this study, the diagnosis of T2DM comprehensively considered fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, HbA1c, and T2DM records. Values of FPG, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose, and HbA1c were obtained from medical examination data. T2DM records were obtained from questionnaire data, electronic medical records data (only E11.0, E11.1, E11.2–E11.9 [ICD-10] were found in our dataset), and cause of death data. The earliest diagnosis of diabetes was used as the onset date.

- **Coronary artery disease (CAD)**: Individuals diagnosed with CAD at the Beijing Physical Examination Centre underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) examination and angiography. Those with abnormal ECG results indicating conditions such as angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or myocardial ischaemia were diagnosed with CAD. Additionally, CAD records were referred to in the cause of death data (I20–25 from ICD10 Codes) and electronic medical records. The earliest diagnosis of CAD was used as the onset date.

### The urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio is associated with eGFR and eGFR decline over time in a population cohort [^112iUAWV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

This study has several strengths and some limitations. It identifies a simple early marker of renal dysfunction in the general adult population of European descent in Switzerland, without prior selection of participants according to any health characteristics. The study includes a detailed phenotype description and exhibits a large range of protein intake, an important determinant of GFR, as shown by the wide range of 24-hour urinary urea excretion. Furthermore, urine data were based on a 24-hour collection, not on a spot urine sample. This is important as all urinary solutes do not display the same circadian pattern of excretion. Thus, a morning urine sample or a random sample during the day may not accurately reflect the proportion of the different solutes. Urine was collected in usual life conditions, representing everyday kidney function, not following a water deprivation test or dDAVP administration. Finally, the present study allowed for comparison of U/P urea and U/P osmolarity ratios.

The limitations of this study include the relatively low number of participants of European descent. Further studies should address people of other ethnic origins. Urine osmolality was not measured; instead, an estimated urine osmolarity was calculated based on a previously validated formula. Another limitation is that the decline of kidney function over time was based on only two measurements collected over a 3-year interval on average.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^111JuxEs]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Our study is the largest concerning the diagnostic performance of BCR for differentiating prerenal from intrinsic AKI. It is the first to specifically investigate BCR in an unselected population of patients admitted to the Emergency Department. We have found that BCR had no overall discriminative capacity in this setting, no matter what threshold of BCR is chosen.

Even though the rationale underlying the use of BCR is appealing, our results show that it does not work effectively in real-world settings. Many factors are known to modify BCR independently of effective circulating volume. Gastrointestinal bleeding, a high protein diet, the catabolic effects of fever, trauma, infection, thyrotoxicosis, and drugs such as tetracycline or corticosteroids increase protein turnover, resulting in increased hepatic production of urea and an increase in BCR. Conversely, in osmotic diuresis and with the use of acetazolamide, proximal tubular reabsorption of salt and water is impaired, leading to an increase in excreted urea and a decrease in BCR, even in states of hypovolemia. BCR also decreases in patients with liver failure or protein malnutrition due to lower levels of BUN.

One can speculate that AKI is likely due to a combination of functional and intrinsic disease coexisting in different proportions in a given patient at a given time. It is assumed that a continuum exists which leads from prerenal to intrinsic AKI, with the proportion of each changing over time. It can be assumed that BCR would only be reliable if the underlying disease was 100% prerenal or 100% intrinsic.

### Estimating time-averaged serum urea nitrogen concentration during various urine collection periods: A prediction equation for thrice weekly and biweekly dialysis schedules [^115GEfwb]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Residual kidney urea clearance in dialysis patients is typically calculated as the per-minute excretion of urea nitrogen, obtained during a 24–48 hour collection period that usually ends just prior to a dialysis session. This is divided by the time-averaged serum water urea nitrogen concentration during the collection period. Estimating this concentration is challenging without a formal kinetic modeling program.

Using a urea kinetic modeling program, we derived an equation to estimate the time-averaged serum water concentration during urine collection periods of various lengths, collected during different interdialytic intervals, for both thrice-weekly and biweekly dialysis schedules. The equation predicts time-averaged serum water urea nitrogen concentration during the collection period. It considers the ratio of the duration of the predialysis collection period to the duration of the interdialytic interval during which the collection was performed, as well as the urea reduction ratio and the predialysis serum urea nitrogen concentration of the dialysis session immediately following the collection period.

### A low BUN/creatinine ratio predicts histologically confirmed acute interstitial nephritis [^112kJxys]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

In hospitalized patients with AKI, the presence of a BCR ≤ 12 is a robust parameter that suggests the diagnosis of AIN. The BCR is obtained from a basic metabolic panel, and its low cost allows for longitudinal quantification. Additionally, if urinalysis and clinical course are atypical for AIN, a low BCR could provide additional support and allow for the avoidance of kidney biopsy in some patients.

### Kinetic modeling programs for hemodialysis adequacy focusing on urea, creatinine, phosphate, and beta-2-microglobulin [^115M6tSH]. Seminars in Dialysis (2025). Low credibility.

- **Urea solver**: The main utility of urea solver (version 2.14) is to calculate well-accepted measures of dialysis adequacy, such as Kt/V, standard Kt/V, and surface-area-normalized standard Kt/V. Another useful output is the normalized protein appearance rate (nPNA). The program is also designed to calculate the residual kidney urea (water) clearance (Kru) from input urine collection data. Alternatively, Kru can be input as a plasma water clearance. There is a regular mode of calculation, as well as several "special modes".

	- In the regular calculation mode, inputs include the pre- and postdialysis serum urea nitrogen (SUN) levels (in either mg/dL or mmol/L) and dialysis treatment parameters, including blood (Qb) and dialysate (Qd) flow rates, session length, and the dialyzer's in vitro mass transfer coefficient for urea (K0A). Asymmetric dialysis schedules can be analyzed, including the standard three/week and two/week schedules, and more frequent short or nocturnal dialysis. The dialyzer clearance is estimated internally from input values of in vitro urea K0A, blood, and dialysate flow rates; alternatively, the estimated in vivo dialyzer urea clearance can also be input directly, bypassing this calculation.

	- In urea modeling, one can either input estimated dialyzer clearance and solve for urea distribution volume, or one can input an estimated urea volume and solve for dialyzer clearance. In both instances, both pre- and postdialysis SUN are required inputs. However, if both dialyzer clearance and volume are known, then there is no need to enter a pos…

### Higher body mass index is associated with higher fractional creatinine excretion in healthy subjects [^111Vt48W]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Accurate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement in the normal to high range is important for epidemiological studies and the workup for kidney donation. Creatinine-based equations perform poorly in this GFR range. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) provides a substitute, provided urine is collected accurately and tubular creatinine handling can be accounted for. The latter is poorly characterized in the normal GFR range.

- **Methods**: Therefore, we studied the performance of CrCl, fractional creatinine excretion (FE(creat)), and its determinants in 226 potential kidney donors (47% males, mean age 53 ± 10 years). GFR was assessed as (125)I-iothalamate clearance, simultaneously with 2-hour CrCl and 24-hour CrCl.

- **Results**: Mean GFR was 101 ± 18, 2-hour CrCl 110 ± 20, and 24-hour CrCl 106 ± 29 mL/min/1.73 m². Mean bias of 24-hour CrCl was 7.4 [inter-quartile range -6.7 to 20.0] mL/min/1.73 m², precision (R²) 0.39, and 30% accuracy 82%. Mean FE(creat) was 110 ± 11%. FE(creat) correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.34, P < 0.05), with FE(creat) at 114% in subjects with BMI > 30 kg/m², compared to 109% in subjects with BMI < 30 kg/m², respectively (P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, BMI and gender were predictors of FE(creat).

- **Conclusions**: CrCl systematically overestimates GFR in healthy subjects. The overestimation significantly correlates with BMI, with higher FE(creat) in subjects with higher BMI. The impact of BMI on tubular creatinine secretion can be accounted for.

### Screening for renal disease using serum creatinine: who are we missing [^114CMddo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Appropriate management and timely referral of patients with early renal disease often depend on the identification of renal insufficiency by primary care physicians. Serum creatinine (SCr) levels are frequently used as a screening test for renal dysfunction; however, patients can have significantly decreased glomerular filtration rates (GFR) while maintaining normal range SCr values, complicating the recognition of renal dysfunction. This study was designed to estimate the prevalence of patients who have significantly reduced GFR as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) formula but exhibit normal-range SCr values:

- **Methods**: The study included 2781 outpatients referred by community physicians to an urban laboratory network for SCr measurement. GFR was estimated using the C-G formula. Patients were grouped according to the concordance of SCr level abnormalities (abnormal > 130 micromol/l) with significantly abnormal C-G values (abnormal < 60 ml/min). The prevalence of significantly reduced GFR despite normal SCr values was calculated for different demographic groups, including age and gender.

- **Results**: A total of 12.6% of the patients aged 70 years or older had significantly reduced GFR despite normal SCr values, highlighting the risk of missed renal dysfunction in older adults when relying solely on SCr levels.

This study underscores the importance of using both SCr and GFR estimates when screening for renal disease to ensure accurate identification and management of renal insufficiency.

### Novel monitoring of renal function and medication levels in saliva and capillary blood of patients with kidney disease [^116nuyza]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Low credibility.

Use of serum creatinine, urea, and cystatin C as main biomarkers is crucial for estimating glomerular filtration rates in individuals with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Frequent measurements of these assays are necessary to identify patients in the earlier stages of CKD, detect episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI), and monitor CKD progression. However, the conventional laboratory-based kidney function assays are cumbersome and time-consuming, limiting frequent monitoring and greater patient self-management.

Recent advancements in noninvasive salivary assessments of creatinine, cystatin C, and urea have made it feasible to conduct frequent monitoring of kidney function in point-of-care settings, as well as in nonclinical settings, such as at home. Additionally, fingerstick sampling presents an alternative method for blood testing suitable for home-based assessments. This review provides an overview of emerging data on various salivary versus fingerstick blood assessment methods for kidney function; their accuracy compared to 'gold-standard' laboratory-based methods; and their respective strengths and limitations in the clinical setting.

A practical, cost-effective, minimally invasive multimarker assessment platform has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional laboratory blood-based testing approaches, thereby addressing a significant unmet need in the management of CKD patients.

### The use of selected urine chemistries in the diagnosis of kidney disorders [^1125mN4N]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation but instead require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, to include kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

### Higher serum creatinine concentrations in black patients with chronic kidney disease: Beyond nutritional status and body composition [^111B5ax6]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine concentrations tend to be higher in Black than White individuals and those of other races or ethnicities. These differences have been assumed to be largely related to race-related differences in body composition, especially muscle mass.

- **Design, setting, participants, and measurements**: In a diverse population of hemodialysis patients, we compared mean serum creatinine concentrations in Black versus nonblack patients, adjusting for:
	- **Case mix**: age, gender, diabetes, dialysis vintage
	- **Body size**: height, weight
	- **Laboratory parameters of nutritional status**: albumin, predialysis blood urea nitrogen, transferrin, phosphorus, glucose
	- **Dialysis dosage**: urea reduction ratio
	- **Parameters of bioelectrical impedance (proxies for body composition)**: resistance, reactance

- **Results**: Adjusted mean serum creatinine concentrations were significantly higher in Black versus nonblack patients (11.7 versus 10.0 mg/dl; P < 0.001). Black patients were three times more likely to have a serum creatinine concentration greater than 10 mg/dl and six times more likely to have a serum creatinine concentration greater than 15 mg/dl. Higher serum creatinine concentrations were associated with a lower relative risk for death (0.93; 95% confidence interval 0.88 to 0.98 per mg/dl). The association was slightly more pronounced among nonblack patients.

- **Conclusions**: Serum creatinine concentrations are significantly higher in Black compared with nonblack hemodialysis patients; these differences are not readily explained by differences in nutritional status or body composition.

### Kidney function estimating equations: Where do we stand [^115i4Q8p]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of chronic kidney disease. This review summarizes recent data on the performance of equations using serum creatinine to estimate GFR, particularly the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation.

- **Recent findings**: During 2005, GFR estimation received substantial attention with a focus on comparing the MDRD Study equation with the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Several large studies (n > 500) have been conducted. Most studies discuss creatinine calibration, but few were able to standardize measurements. Studies that did calibrate creatinine showed improved performance. Overall, the MDRD Study equation performed well in populations with a low range of GFR and often outperformed the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Both equations have lower precision in high GFR populations, and the MDRD equation underestimated the GFR in a number of studies. Efforts are underway to develop improved prediction equations by pooling data across many study populations.

- **Summary**: Equations for estimating GFR from serum creatinine are useful for systematic staging of chronic kidney disease. The MDRD Study equation and systematic creatinine assay calibration improve precision and accuracy in many settings. However, GFR estimates are less useful in the normal range of GFR and are sensitive to the population under study.

### A low bun/creatinine ratio predicts histologically confirmed acute interstitial nephritis [^115o3ETH]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

Use of biomarkers in the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) has been controversial in the literature. Novel biomarkers have focused on subclinical phases or prognostic factors in acute kidney injury (AKI). Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is one of the most studied biomarkers. NGAL expression is related to stress or damage to the loop of Henle and the collecting duct; values greater than 104 ng/ml correlate with kidney damage.

Another well-studied novel biomarker is kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), which is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is upregulated in response to ischemia‒reperfusion kidney injury. Calprotectin is a heterodimer synthesized in epithelial cells in the collecting duct in response to damage or inflammation. Calprotectin is proposed to distinguish intrinsic renal injury from prerenal etiology; however, its secretion is known to increase in pyuria and some systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, thus limiting the specificity of this novel biomarker.

As a novel biomarker of AIN, the blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BCR) has multiple advantages, including low cost, ease of measurement, and the ability for longitudinal tracking of AIN. Creatinine and BUN are routinely measured in basic biochemical panels, and establishing a relationship between BCR and AIN would facilitate the diagnosis and early treatment of these patients prior to the analysis of renal histology.

A kidney biopsy is not systematically performed in patients with AIN. Drug-induced AIN can be diagnosed in patients who have a recent history of drug initiation.

### Time to rethink the current paradigm for assessing kidney function in drug development and beyond [^114AzhGJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

In typical clinical practice, as well as in clinical trials, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is frequently estimated using one of several equations developed empirically based on data from a large number of subjects. These equations (Table S1) have helped to overcome the practical problems encountered with the use of exogenous markers for measuring GFR, as well as the collection of timed urine and serum samples for approximating GFR. The equations depend on measuring serum markers and account for additional factors such as age, sex, and race. The most commonly used markers are serum creatinine and cystatin C.

Creatinine, a low‐molecular‐weight cation (113 daltons), is not metabolized, not bound to plasma proteins, and is freely filtered by the glomerulus in the kidneys. However, creatinine is also actively secreted by tubular cells in the kidneys, accounting for 10–40% of excreted creatinine in normal individuals. Active secretion of creatinine has been shown to be mediated via OAT2, as well as OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2K transporters.

Cystatin C is a cationic, nonglycosylated 13 kilodalton cysteine protease that is constitutively expressed by all nucleated cells in the body. In healthy individuals, tubular reabsorption and catabolism is complete with very minor urinary excretion. Increased urinary elimination happens in kidney disorders. Glomerular filtration is the primary mechanism for cystatin C removal and has been incorporated into the GFR estimation equations in recent years to overcome some of the limitations associated with equations based on creatinine.

### Defining acute kidney injury: What is the most appropriate metric [^116vMrdK]. Nature Clinical Practice. Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most widely accepted measure of kidney function. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a reduction in GFR. However, GFR is rarely measured in clinical practice; instead, serum markers, primarily creatinine, are used to define AKI. Because serum creatinine level is not linearly related to GFR, the performance of this marker is associated with ascertainment bias and poor sensitivity. In this article, we discuss the limitations and pitfalls of using serum markers to define AKI and offer some suggestions for the future.

### The urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio is associated with eGFR and eGFR decline over time in a population cohort [^113SuWZS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

The way to express eGFR deserves a special comment. The indexation of eGFR on 1.73 m² of BSA may be justified when comparing different independent studies performed in different countries, investigating different ethnic groups. It may also be justified for establishing thresholds defining different CKD stages that are widely recognized. However, it is not justified within a given study performed with a well-defined homogeneous protocol. This indexation blunts the inter-individual diversity and thus reduces the strength of some statistical relationships. It may result in failure to reveal significant differences. This is the case for the associations of eGFR with U/P potassium in NORM participants and for U/P osmolality in LOW participants. The associations are significant with eGFR in mL/min, but not with eGFR in mL/min × 1.73 m² (Table 5).

A few recent studies have already questioned this indexation because it introduces a bias in obese patients as excess weight leads to a higher BSA, resulting in an underestimation of eGFR. In the present study, mean BSA was higher than 1.73 m², and 46% of the participants were overweight or obese. To our knowledge, no study has ever shown that GFR (or eGFR) is related to BSA. GFR is known to vary with protein intake and urine concentration, not with BSA. In ADPKD, the total kidney volume is usually indexed on the height of the patients. In that case, this indexation is justified because kidney length (and thus most likely kidney volume) has been shown to be positively and linearly related to body height.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^115CRY98]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) has been used since the early 1940s to help clinicians differentiate between prerenal acute kidney injury (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI). This ratio is simple to use and often put forward as a reliable diagnostic tool even though little scientific evidence supports this. The aim of this study was to determine whether BCR is a reliable tool for distinguishing PR AKI from I AKI.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective observational study over a 13-month period, in the Emergency Department (ED) of Nantes University Hospital. Eligible for inclusion were all adult patients consecutively admitted to the ED with a creatinine > 133 μmol/L (1.5 mg/dL).

- **Results**: Sixty thousand one hundred sixty patients were consecutively admitted to the ED. Of these, 2756 patients had plasma creatinine levels in excess of 133 μmol/L; 1653 were excluded, leaving 1103 patients for definitive inclusion. Mean age was 75.7 ± 14.8 years old; 498 (45%) patients had PR AKI and 605 (55%) I AKI. BCR was 90.55 ± 39.32 and 91.29 ± 39.79 in PR AKI and I AKI groups, respectively. There was no statistical difference between mean BCR of the PR AKI and I AKI groups, p = 0.758. The area under the ROC curve was 0.5, indicating that BCR had no capacity to discriminate between PR AKI and I AKI.

- **Conclusions**: Our study is the largest to investigate the diagnostic performance of BCR. BCR is not a reliable parameter for distinguishing prerenal AKI from intrinsic AKI.

### Salivary creatinine and urea analysis in patients with chronic kidney disease: a case control study [^113AKmG4]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Many metabolic changes develop in patients with chronic kidney disease, often necessitating frequent biochemical analysis of blood. Saliva analysis as an alternative to blood has many advantages. The aims of this study were to evaluate levels of salivary creatinine and urea in patients with chronic kidney disease in comparison to healthy individuals, to determine the correlation between salivary creatinine/urea and blood creatinine/urea, and to evaluate the diagnostic potential of saliva.

- **Methods**: A case control study involved 50 patients with late-stage chronic kidney disease and 49 healthy individuals as controls. Blood and saliva samples were analyzed for urea and creatinine levels. Data are presented as median with interquartile range and compared using the Independent Samples Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between plasma and salivary creatinine, as well as urea, was determined using Spearman's correlation test. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine the diagnostic ability of salivary creatinine and urea, and cut-off values were established.

- **Results**: Median salivary creatinine levels were 2.60 mg/dl and 0.20 mg/dl, while median salivary urea levels were 92.00 mg/dl and 20.50 mg/dl in patients with chronic kidney disease and controls, respectively. Salivary levels of creatinine and urea were significantly elevated in chronic kidney disease patients (p < 0.001). In addition, there was a positive correlation between blood and salivary creatinine as well as urea levels. Total areas under the curve for salivary creatinine and urea were 0.97.

### Screening, identifying, and treating chronic kidney disease: Why, who, when, how, and what [^113TDR39]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

The serum creatinine and cystatin-C are currently the standard filtration markers for estimating GFR, but still may exhibit significant individualized variability from the true GFR. In the presence of non-GFR determinants for creatinine, the CKD-EPI 2012 eGFR equation using cystatin-C only may be the best assessment of kidney function. When absolute accuracy of GFR is necessary, such as for the safety of kidney donation or critical medication administration (such as chemotherapy), GFR can be directly measured (mGFR). Direct measurement of GFR generally includes administering exogenous markers, such as iohexol and iothalamate, and measuring their clearance from serum, since inulin is no longer available.

eGFR is traditionally indexed to a body surface area (BSA) of 1.73 m² for standardization across size variability. For patients at extremes of BSA, indexing GFR may lead to large discrepancies from true GFR, and thus de-indexing may be appropriate.

- **Albuminuria**: Under ordinary conditions, the glomerular basement membrane limits the passage of large molecules such as albumin.

### Blood urea nitrogen is independently associated with renal outcomes in Japanese patients with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease: A prospective observational study [^111BZpFe]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Six hundred eighty-two consecutive Japanese patients with CKD stage 3–5 were admitted to our hospital, the National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, for evaluation and education about CKD between June 2009 and December 2017. Figure 1 shows a flow chart of the patient enrollment process. To decrease the effects of extrarenal factors on BUN levels, patients who used corticosteroids at a dose > 5 mg/day, or who had an active gastric ulcer or hemorrhagic gastritis, liver cirrhosis, or a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% were excluded. Four hundred fifty-nine patients were analyzed.

- **Patients and study design**: After discharge, patients were prospectively followed at our hospital for at least 6 months. Data were collected until July 2018. The composite renal endpoint was end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death, whichever occurred first, and ESRD alone was added as an alternative outcome. ESRD was defined as renal dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy such as maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or having undergone kidney transplantation. When the patients showed gradual worsening of kidney function during follow-up and were determined to require renal replacement therapy, they were diagnosed with ESRD and were re-admitted for renal replacement therapy. Time to ESRD was defined as the duration from baseline to the day of the first dialysis session or the kidney transplantation procedure. Death occurred before reaching ESRD. Information regarding patient death and definitions of censored patients are described in our previous report.

### Care of the patient with abnormal kidney test results [^116PT6Sf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Blood and urine tests are commonly performed by clinicians in both ambulatory and hospital settings to detect chronic and acute kidney disease. Thresholds for these tests have been established to signal the presence and severity of kidney injury or dysfunction. In the appropriate clinical context of a patient's history and physical examination, an abnormal test result should trigger specific actions for clinicians, including reviewing patient medication use, conducting follow-up testing, prescribing lifestyle modifications, and making specialist referrals. Tests for kidney disease can also be used to determine the future risk for kidney failure and cardiovascular death.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^113noLk9]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The distribution of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and plasma creatinine values according to acute kidney injury (AKI) groups is illustrated in Fig. 2. The box extends from the 25th to 75th percentiles, with a line at the median and whiskers delimiting the minimum to maximum values.

- **BUN values at admission**: Patients with prerenal (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI) are compared.
- **Plasma creatinine values at admission**: Patients with PR AKI and I AKI are assessed.
- **Lowest plasma creatinine during the 7 days following admission (Adm.)**: Values for patients with PR AKI and I AKI are evaluated.

During the 7 days following admission, the patient's lowest plasma creatinine concentrations were selected and compared with their baseline creatinine levels. In the PR AKI group, the mean lowest creatinine concentration during this period was 118.0 ± 65.2 μmol/L (range 30–606; median 105). The mean difference with plasma creatinine concentrations at admission was 91.6 μmol/L. In the intrinsic AKI group, the mean lowest creatinine concentration was 162.4 ± 96.6 μmol/L (range 32–832; median 138). The mean difference with plasma creatinine concentrations at admission was 69.7 μmol/L. The mean difference between baseline and the lowest 7-day follow-up creatinine was significantly lower in the PR AKI group than in the I AKI group (p < 0.001).

The distribution of the blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) in the two groups is shown in Fig. 3. At admission, BCR was 90.6 ± 39.3 (range 24.4–262.7; median 83.0) and 91.3 ± 39.8 (range 9.8–269.1; median 81.8) in PR AKI and I AKI groups, respectively.

### How best to estimate glomerular filtration rate? Novel filtration markers and their application [^115ZeVaX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is an increasing health burden. Estimating equations using serum concentrations of creatinine and cystatin C facilitate the assessment of kidney function as reflected in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Reduced eGFR is associated with increased risk for numerous adverse outcomes and is an important aspect in many clinical situations. However, equations are suboptimal in some clinical settings. The review focuses on approaches to improve the estimation of GFR and aims to familiarize the reader with the underlying methodological hypotheses of how new markers could contribute to improving the overall performance of estimating equations.

Recent findings highlight that low molecular weight proteins such as β-trace-protein and β-2-microglobulin, as well as newly discovered metabolites, show promise as new filtration markers, as they might be beneficial in populations in which creatinine or cystatin C are inaccurate. We propose that the combination of multiple novel markers, alone or alongside creatinine, cystatin C, or demographics, can potentially improve GFR estimation. For special populations such as dialysis patients, separate equations have been developed to estimate residual kidney function.

In summary, GFR estimating equations are an essential part of routine clinical practice but have limitations. The use of multiple markers combined in a single equation appears to be the most promising approach. Future research is required to validate proposed equations in diverse populations.

### Urea reduction ratio may be a simpler approach for measurement of adequacy of intermittent hemodialysis in acute kidney injury [^1118RnnR]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is often required for the management of acute kidney injury (AKI). Depending on hemodynamic status, RRT may be provided by continuous dialysis (CRRT), hybrid forms of prolonged intermittent RRT (PIRRT), or intermittent dialysis (IHD). Assessment of the adequacy of solute clearance in IHD is conventionally based upon urea kinetic models for the calculation of single pool Kt/V urea (Kt/V). The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for AKI recommend achieving a threshold Kt/V of at least 1.3 thrice weekly or 3.9 per week when delivering IHD in the setting of AKI. These recommendations were substantially based on data from the Veterans Affairs/National Institutes of Health Acute Renal Failure Trial Network (ATN) study, a multicenter randomized trial comparing strategies of more-intensive and less-intensive RRT in critically ill patients with AKI, which targeted a delivered Kt/V of 1.2–1.4 in patients receiving IHD.

Rigorous quantification of dialysis dose using urea kinetic modeling is based on assumptions related to net nitrogen balance and the generation and volume of distribution of urea that are not necessarily present in the critically ill patient with AKI. Patients with AKI are often hypercatabolic and in net negative nitrogen balance. They may have rates of urea that are not constant over time and have alterations in regional blood flow, particularly in the setting of hemodynamic instability, which may produce disequilibrium in urea distribution between body compartments, invalidating standard single-pool models.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111uJJ39]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Most research on dialysis dose is therefore based on urea clearance in patients on a thrice-weekly schedule. Urea clearance may be calculated by three methods that are commonly used: urea reduction ratio, and the 'single pool' and 'equilibrated' formulas for Kt/V. Kt/V is less commonly calculated by urea kinetic modelling; these methods are summarized mathematically in Appendix 1. The diversity of methods can lead to duplication of effort, confusion over the meaning of targets, and impedes comparison between centres, so a single widely-used method would be desirable. As the most adjusted method, and the one which has been most commonly validated in outcome literature, eKt/V appears to be optimum, and we have therefore given dose targets in terms of eKt/V. Equivalent targets using other methods may be derived for individual patients depending on their dialysis duration and fluid removal.

The literature on clinical outcomes at different doses of dialysis is dominated by two randomized studies. The National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) was the landmark study which led to the concept of a threshold dialysis dose above which treatment was adequate, as well as the establishment of Kt/V as the accepted index of dialysis dose. Reporting in 1981, the study randomized 151 patients in a 2x2 design to high vs. low time-averaged urea, and short vs. long dialysis duration. The key finding was a lower rate of treatment failure (death or hospital admission) in the low urea (high dialysis dose) group. When reanalyzing the group with the newly proposed Kt/V measure, a clear threshold effect appeared.

### Using serum creatinine to estimate glomerular filtration rate: Accuracy in good health and in chronic kidney disease [^112XtJTR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The National Kidney Foundation has advocated the use of the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum creatinine measurements in clinical laboratories. However, healthy persons were not included in the development of the MDRD equation.

- **Objectives**: To assess the accuracy of the MDRD equation in patients with chronic kidney disease compared with healthy persons and to develop a new equation that uses both patients with chronic kidney disease and healthy persons.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional study.

- **Setting**: The Mayo Clinic, a tertiary-care medical center.

- **Participants**: Consecutive patients (n = 320) who had an iothalamate clearance test specifically for chronic kidney disease evaluation and consecutive healthy persons (n = 580) who had an iothalamate clearance test specifically for kidney donor evaluation.

- **Measurements**: Serum creatinine levels, GFR, demographic characteristics, and clinical characteristics were abstracted from the medical record.

- **Results**: The MDRD equation underestimated GFR by 6.2% in patients with chronic kidney disease and by 29% in healthy persons. Re-estimated coefficients for serum creatinine and sex were similar to the original MDRD equation in the chronic kidney disease series but not in the healthy series. At the same serum creatinine level, age, and sex, GFR was on average 26% higher in healthy persons than in patients with chronic kidney disease (P < 0.001). A quadratic GFR equation was developed to estimate logarithmic GFR from the following covariates: 1/S.

These findings suggest the need for revised equations that consider both patient populations for more accurate GFR estimation.

### Diagnostic performance of serum blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio for distinguishing prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in the emergency department [^111ATaCw]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio (BCR) has been used since the early 1940s to help clinicians differentiate between prerenal acute kidney injury (PR AKI) and intrinsic AKI (I AKI). This ratio is simple to use and is often put forward as a reliable diagnostic tool. Indeed, many textbooks of internal medicine, nephrology, and critical care continue to advocate the use of BCR, though its usefulness in the diagnosis and clinical management of AKI remains unclear.

Under normal conditions, BCR is less than 100 (with urea and creatinine concentrations expressed in mmol/L). In states of renal hypoperfusion with intact tubular function, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is considered to rise out of proportion to plasma creatinine concentration due to avid urea reabsorption by the proximal tubule, with the BCR typically becoming greater than 100.

One of the first to put forward this tool was Fishberg in 1939, when he observed that "an increase in urea content of the blood may be considerable before the creatinine value rises in prerenal azotemia". However, as soon as 1947, other investigators found no such relationship. Since then, very few studies (human or animal) have addressed the question, and their results are conflicting. These studies consisted of small series of patients, essentially from intensive care units, the largest of which included only 103 patients and was not specifically aimed at investigating BCR.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in emergency departments (ED). It can be challenging to differentiate prerenal from intrinsic acute kidney injury in this setting.

### Performance and pitfalls of the tools for measuring glomerular filtration rate to guide chronic kidney disease diagnosis and assessment [^115s9Svv]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis, classification, and risk stratification for chronic kidney disease (CKD) allow for early recognition and delivery of optimal care. Creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary albumin: creatinine ratio (UACR), and the kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) are important tools to achieve this, but understanding their limitations is crucial for optimal implementation. When accurate GFR is required (e.g. for chemotherapy dosing), GFR is measured using an exogenous filtration marker. In routine clinical practice, in contrast, estimated GFR (eGFR) from serum creatinine (SCr), calculated using the enzymatic method ± UACR, is recommended. Limitations of SCr include non-GFR determinants such as muscle mass, diet, and tubular handling.

Cystatin C is an alternative or additional endogenous filtration marker that can be used alongside SCr for confirmatory testing of CKD. However, its role in the UK is more limited due to concerns regarding false positive results. The recommended creatinine-based eGFR equation in the UK is the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration 2009 equation. This was recently updated to a race-neutral 2021 version, which demonstrated reduced bias in people of Black ethnicity, but it has not been validated in the UK. Limitations of this updated equation include extremes of age, inaccuracy at greater GFRs, and reduced generalizability to under-represented ethnicity groups.

The KFRE, based on age, sex, SCr, and UACR, has recently been developed to help determine 2-year and 5-year risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease. It has been validated in over 30 countries and provides meaningful insights for patient management.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for urea cycle disorders, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, the TEWG-UCD 2019 guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend newborn screening for N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 deficiency, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, arginase-1 deficiency, or hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome.

### Using standardized serum creatinine values in the modification of diet in renal disease study equation for estimating glomerular filtration rate [^116dE2nr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimates facilitate the detection of chronic kidney disease but require calibration of the serum creatinine assay to the laboratory that developed the equation. The 4-variable equation from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study has been re-expressed for use with a standardized assay.

- **Objective**: To describe the performance of the revised 4-variable MDRD Study equation and compare it with the performance of the 6-variable MDRD Study and Cockcroft-Gault equations.

- **Design**: Comparison of estimated and measured GFR.

- **Setting**: 15 clinical centers participating in a randomized, controlled trial.

- **Patients**: 1628 patients with chronic kidney disease participating in the MDRD Study.

- **Measurements**: Serum creatinine levels were calibrated to an assay traceable to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry. Glomerular filtration rate was measured as urinary clearance of 125I-iothalamate.

- **Results**: Mean measured GFR was 39.8 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (SD, 21.2). Accuracy and precision of the revised 4-variable equation were similar to those of the original 6-variable equation and better than in the Cockcroft-Gault equation, even when the latter was corrected for bias, with 90%, 91%, 60%, and 83% of estimates within 30% of measured GFR, respectively. Differences between measured and estimated GFR were greater for all equations when the estimated GFR was 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 or greater.

- **Limitations**: The MDRD Study included few patients with a GFR greater than 90 mL/min per 1.73 m2. Equations were not compared in a separate study sample.

### Refining GFR estimation: A quest for the unobservable truth [^115D3Jas]. Kidney International (2024). Low credibility.

Assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is central to evaluating kidney health, remains challenging. Measured GFR is not widely available and lacks standardization. Estimated GFR can be highly inaccurate for some patients and has limited applicability to many patient populations, such as those who are acutely ill. Recent metabolomic advances show promise for identifying new filtration markers that might enhance GFR estimation. Improving GFR assessment will require refinement in both GFR measurement and estimation methods.

### The correlation study between blood urea nitrogen to serum albumin ratio and prognosis of patients with sepsis during hospitalization [^1125nVeh]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Sepsis is a syndrome caused by various pathogenic microorganisms invading the human body, leading to a systemic inflammatory response. Early fluid resuscitation, infection control, and antibiotic therapy are the cornerstones of sepsis management, aimed at correcting the condition of such patients. Although sepsis guidelines have been continuously improved in recent years, and a series of active "rescue" measures have been taken internationally, its morbidity and mortality remain high. The mortality rate of sepsis patients hospitalized in the ICU is as high as 41.9%. Therefore, finding an accurate and reliable clinical index that is convenient for judging the prognosis of sepsis patients during hospitalization, in order to improve the successful rate of treatment, is a major challenge for clinicians.

BUN (blood urea nitrogen) is one of the end products of human protein catabolism and is mainly excreted by the kidneys. It is an important marker representing renal function, metabolic status, and nutritional status. In critically ill patients, protein catabolism is hyperactive, and BUN synthesis increases during stress response. Additionally, increased renal urea reabsorption leads to elevated blood urea nitrogen levels in dehydrated states. In recent years, studies have reported its potential predictive value in adverse clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis. In a retrospective cohort study of 12,713 patients with sepsis, there was a non-linear relationship between BUN and 30-day mortality. Serum albumin, which is easily accessible as an indicator of nutritional status, contributes significantly to the prognosis assessment.

### Independent prognostic importance of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio in heart failure [^112U38s1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). High credibility.

The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (HF), however, its importance in chronic HF remains less understood.

- **Methods and results**: We combined individual patient data from clinical trials. For HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), we included PARADIGM-HF, ATMOSPHERE, and DAPA-HF, while for HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), we included PARAGON-HF and I-PRESERVE. The primary outcome examined was a composite time to first HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death. Additionally, its components and all-cause death were assessed. Each HF phenotype was categorized according to the median BUN/creatinine ratio, generating four groups: HFpEF ≤ and > median BUN/creatinine ratio, and HFrEF ≤ and > median BUN/creatinine ratio. We evaluated the association between the BUN/creatinine ratio and outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazard models. Overall, 28,820 patients were analyzed. The median (IQR) BUN/creatinine ratio was 20.1 (16.7–24.7) in HFpEF and 18.7 (15.2–22.8) in HFrEF. In both HFpEF and HFrEF, a higher BUN/creatinine ratio was associated with older age, female sex, and diabetes, but a similar estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The risk of each outcome examined was significantly higher in patients with a BUN/creatinine ratio ≥ median compared to those median, even after adjusting for other prognostic variables, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and eGFR.

- **Conclusion**: A higher BUN/creatinine ratio was associated with worse outcomes in patients with chronic HF across the spectrum of left ventricular function.

### Urea reduction ratio may be a simpler approach for measurement of adequacy of intermittent hemodialysis in acute kidney injury [^112Y1YFX]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

In the VA/NIH Acute Renal Failure Trial Network Study, Kt/V was estimated at least three times per week in patients receiving IHD during the first two weeks of study therapy and then at least weekly thereafter using a second-generation logarithmic estimating equation. In order to adjust for variations in volume status, V urea was re-estimated each treatment using an iterative process incorporating estimates of edema weight based on the difference between pre-morbid and post-dialysis body weight. The calculation of Kt/V used during the study was therefore cumbersome and not readily transferable to clinical practice. While the use of URR is less precise in estimating small solute clearance in intermittent renal replacement therapy, we have shown satisfactory correlation between paired values of URR and Kt/V in more than 3600 dialysis sessions. The use of URR is readily transferable to clinical practice and would facilitate assessment of the delivered dose of intermittent renal replacement therapy in the acute setting and the implementation of quality improvement processes to ensure appropriate delivery of therapy.

- **Limitations of our analysis**: Must be noted. First and foremost, despite the fact that Kt/V calculation in the ATN study was rigorously protocolized, Kt/V was still calculated using a second-generation logarithmic estimating equation rather than using formal urea kinetic modeling. Secondly, errors in estimation of Kt/V may have resulted from the protocolized methodology used in the ATN study to estimate V urea. Third, all dialysis treatments utilized catheters.

### Kinetic modeling programs for hemodialysis adequacy focusing on urea, creatinine, phosphate, and beta-2-microglobulin [^111xcKmw]. Seminars in Dialysis (2025). Low credibility.

The "What-if" urea calculator, version 1.19, becomes a vital tool once multiple dialysis sessions from a specific patient have been analyzed. It provides known values for the patient's urea volume and urea generation rate. This calculator allows for the exploration of various dialysis treatment schedules, including the number of treatments per week, dialyzer session specifications (Qb, Qd, dialyzer in vitro K₀A urea, and session length), and residual kidney urea (plasma water) clearance. These variables are crucial for evaluating their impact on Kt/V and standard Kt/V. Additionally, the What-if calculator is instrumental in assessing the accuracy of candidate estimating equations for Kt/V, stdKt/V, or nPNA under diverse treatment conditions.

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine and cystatin C [^1151ULyu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that are based on serum creatinine are routinely used; however, they are imprecise, potentially leading to the overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Cystatin C is an alternative filtration marker for estimating GFR.

- **Methods**: Using cross-sectional analyses, we developed estimating equations based on cystatin C alone and in combination with creatinine in diverse populations totaling 5,352 participants from 13 studies. These equations were then validated in 1,119 participants from 5 different studies in which GFR had been measured. Cystatin and creatinine assays were traceable to primary reference materials.

- **Results**: Mean measured GFRs were 68 and 70 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body-surface area in the development and validation data sets, respectively. In the validation data set, the creatinine-cystatin C equation performed better than equations that used creatinine or cystatin C alone. Bias was similar among the three equations, with a median difference between measured and estimated GFR of 3.9 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with the combined equation, as compared with 3.7 and 3.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with the creatinine equation and the cystatin C equation (P = 0.07 and P = 0.05), respectively. Precision was improved with the combined equation (interquartile range of the difference, 13.4 vs. 15.4 and 16.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m², respectively [P = 0.001 and P < 0.001]) for both comparisons. The combined equation also had better accuracy, with 8.5% of measurements showing discrepancies greater than 30% compared to 12.8% and 14.1% for creatinine and cystatin C equations, respectively [P < 0.001 for both].
