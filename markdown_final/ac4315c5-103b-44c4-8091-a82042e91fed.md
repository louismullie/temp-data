## Question

What are the indications for doxazosin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for doxazosin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indications for the immediate-release formulation. Then, I should verify what is and is not labeled for the extended-release formulation. Next, I will review commonly used off-label indications and their evidentiary basis. After that, I need to examine the role of doxazosin in resistant hypertension relative to alternatives. Finally, I should consider safety constraints and summarize concisely while double-checking for consistency with authoritative sources [^111PTerM] [^111Ly6eU] [^1128Q4Hk].

> Let me first confirm the core FDA-labeled indications for immediate-release doxazosin (Cardura). The label indicates treatment of hypertension in adults and treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adults; these are the two formal labeled uses for the immediate-release formulation, and I need to ensure I do not overextend beyond these labeled statements [^111PTerM].

> Hold on, I should verify the extended-release formulation (Cardura XL) separately because labeling can differ by formulation. The extended-release formulation is labeled only for treatment of BPH in adults; it is explicitly not indicated for hypertension, and I should not conflate the immediate-release hypertension indication with the ER product, which the patient leaflet also underscores as not for blood pressure control [^111Ly6eU] [^1128Q4Hk].

> Wait, let me verify the commonly referenced off-label uses and be precise about their evidentiary status. The FDA SPL for the immediate-release formulation lists two off-label contexts frequently used in practice: facilitation of ureteral stone passage and induction of preoperative alpha-blockade in pheochromocytoma; for the latter, dosing protocols starting at 2 mg daily and titrating up over 10–14 days to as high as 32 mg daily are described in labeling-derived dosing information, while mechanistic and small clinical series provide supportive but non-labeled evidence for both scenarios [^111PTerM] [^117J6STi] [^113erqjY] [^1151rChb].

> I need to check how doxazosin fits into resistant hypertension algorithms, and I should not jump to conclusions about it being preferred. The PATHWAY-2 randomized, double-blind, crossover trial demonstrated that spironolactone was superior to doxazosin and bisoprolol as the fourth-line agent on a background of ACEI/ARB plus CCB plus thiazide, yet doxazosin still lowered blood pressure and remains an evidence-supported add-on option when spironolactone is contraindicated or not tolerated, which is best described as guideline-consistent off-label use rather than an FDA indication [^1134CPSd] [^111J3t7t] [^112HKpyL] [^115FuQo3].

> Let me consider the broader hypertension context to avoid overstating doxazosin's role. Systematic reviews and geriatric-focused syntheses reinforce that alpha-1 blockers should not be first-line for hypertension due to inferior cardiovascular outcomes relative to thiazide-like diuretics and other classes, which tempers how strongly we characterize the labeled hypertension indication for the immediate-release product in contemporary practice, especially in older adults [^113enLcA] [^117EDv5q] [^116yeyjM].

> I will now examine key safety and interaction constraints that often shape real-world indication choices, because I need to ensure clinical completeness. Doxazosin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to doxazosin or other quinazolines, requires caution with potent CYP3A inhibitors, and carries risks of orthostatic hypotension and syncope that are magnified with concomitant PDE5 inhibitors; severe hepatic impairment is a do-not-use condition for both IR and ER products, while moderate impairment warrants caution and monitoring [^113PqiMy] [^114Qs59U] [^117UKtqh] [^11366Bxr] [^111JkfyV] [^115RQEan] [^117JfYN9] [^116Qv5pn].

> Let me summarize to ensure I haven't missed anything critical. Labeled indications are: immediate-release doxazosin for adult hypertension and adult BPH, and extended-release doxazosin for adult BPH only, with ER explicitly not indicated for hypertension; clinically recognized off-label uses include facilitation of ureteral stone passage and preoperative alpha-blockade in pheochromocytoma, while in resistant hypertension doxazosin serves as a reasonable add-on when spironolactone is unsuitable, although it is not the preferred agent based on comparative efficacy in PATHWAY-2 [^111PTerM] [^111Ly6eU] [^1128Q4Hk] [^117J6STi] [^113erqjY] [^1151rChb] [^1134CPSd] [^112HKpyL].

Doxazosin is indicated for **benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)** [^111Ly6eU] to improve urinary flow and reduce symptoms [^111PTerM], and for **hypertension** as adjunctive therapy when other agents are inadequate or not tolerated [^112kDWSv] [^111J3t7t]. It is also used **off-label** for ureteral stones [^113erqjY] and for preoperative α-blockade in pheochromocytoma [^111PTerM] [^1151rChb]. Doxazosin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to doxazosin, other quinazolines [^114Qs59U], or any formulation components [^113PqiMy].

### Pharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension in patients with psoriasis [^112kDWSv]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Doxazosin is an alpha-1 blocker used for the treatment of resistant arterial hypertension (AH). It is specifically recommended as an adjunctive drug when existing treatment has failed to adequately reduce blood pressure, particularly in patients who are spironolactone intolerant. Doxazosin can also be used in combination with other drugs, such as beta-blockers or centrally acting drugs, to achieve better blood pressure control. There is no evidence that doxazosin affects inflammatory processes that could lead to worsening of psoriasis. Notably, doxazosin is sometimes used in patients with metabolic syndrome, a common comorbid condition in patients with psoriasis.

Urapidil also blocks alpha-adrenergic receptors in the periphery. Its main advantage is that it can rapidly lower blood pressure with minimal effect on heart rate. Urapidil is mainly used in acute settings to control hypertensive crises, especially in hospital care. Based on its influence on the sympathetic nervous system, it should not significantly worsen the course of psoriasis; however, studies focusing on its mechanism of action relative to psoriasis are lacking.

The main indication for sacubitril/valsartan is the treatment of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and it is not primarily used for AH treatment. Sacubitril/valsartan combines two mechanisms of action. Sacubitril inhibits the enzyme neprilysin, which increases natriuretic peptide levels, promotes vasodilation, and increases diuresis and sodium excretion, thereby lowering blood pressure and relieving the burden o

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^1134CPSd]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

PATHWAY-2 is, to our knowledge, the first randomised controlled trial to compare different blood pressure-lowering treatments in rigorously assessed patients with resistant hypertension and the first comparison of mineralocorticoid receptor blockade with alternative recommended classes that block the sympathetic nervous system (α blockers and β blockers). The size, crossover design, and hierarchical primary endpoints of PATHWAY-2 demonstrated with high significance (p < 0.0001) that spironolactone 25–50 mg/day is by far the most effective drug added to A + C + D for the treatment of resistant hypertension; blood pressure was controlled (home systolic blood pressure < 135 mm Hg) in 60% of patients. The role of sodium retention in causing resistant hypertension was strongly suggested by a low baseline plasma renin, despite treatment with three drugs which usually elevate renin, and by a significant inverse correlation between renin and blood pressure reduction by spironolactone. The individual crossover data show that spironolactone is the most effective add-on drug, by a large margin, for the overwhelming majority of patients confirmed as adherent but resistant to treatment with A + C + D.

The unequivocal superiority of spironolactone, together with supportive efficacy and safety data from longer-term observational studies, should influence treatment guidelines globally.

### Efficacy and safety of doxazosin for perioperative management of patients with pheochromocytoma [^1151rChb]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Despite adverse side effects, phenoxybenzamine has been widely used for the preoperative management of patients with pheochromocytoma. Doxazosin, a specific α1-adrenoceptor antagonist, has a pharmacologic profile more suited to controlling blood pressure in such patients. A sequential study of 35 patients with pheochromocytoma involved a definite and prescribed change in preoperative drug management from phenoxybenzamine to doxazosin. Hemodynamic, pharmacologic, and biochemical indicators of α- and β-adrenoceptor blockade were measured before, during, and after anesthesia and surgery in 8 patients pretreated with phenoxybenzamine and 27 patients pretreated with doxazosin.

Doxazosin (2–16 mg/day) was as effective as phenoxybenzamine in controlling arterial pressure and heart rate before and during surgery; however, it caused fewer undesirable side effects both before and after surgery. Following phenoxybenzamine therapy, substantial α1-adrenoceptor blockade, detected as a right shift of phenylephrine dose-response curves, persisted for more than 2 days postoperatively. In contrast, after doxazosin, it was undetectable on the first postoperative day. Doxazosin provided safe, efficacious pre- and perioperative control of arterial pressure. In patients with predominantly norepinephrine-secreting tumors, pretreatment 24-hour urinary norepinephrine excretion gave an indication of the daily doxazosin requirement.

### Doxazosin relaxes ureteral smooth muscle and inhibits epinephrine-induced ureteral contractility in vitro [^113erqjY]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Although recent evidence has supported increased ureteral stone passage with selective alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonists, no mechanistic study evaluating ureteral relaxation by alpha(1) antagonism had been reported at the time of writing. We evaluated whether the alpha-blocker doxazosin reduces spontaneous and inhibits alpha(1)-agonist-induced ureteral contractility. Additionally, alpha-receptor subtypes in normal and obstructed human ureter were analyzed.

- **Methods**: We exposed porcine ureters in organ tissue baths with 0.1, 1.0, or 10 microM doxazosin and recorded the tension for 90 minutes. After the initial treatment, a concentration-response curve of epinephrine or phenylephrine (1 nM to 10 microM) was generated. The experiment was repeated with the proximal, mid-, and distal ureter. The relative expression of the alpha 1A, 1B, and 1D receptor subtypes in normal and obstructed human ureters was analyzed using immunoblotting.

- **Results**: Doxazosin reduced the spontaneous ureteral contractility rates in a concentration-dependent fashion by 23% to 34%. A more pronounced relaxation effect by doxazosin was evident when epinephrine was introduced to the tissues. In 1 and 10-microM doxazosin-pretreated tissues, epinephrine caused 89% and 100% relaxation, respectively. Phenylephrine-induced contractions were antagonized by doxazosin but not reversed to any relaxant function. No differential expression of alpha(1)-receptor subtypes was identified in the obstructed versus normal ureters.

- **Conclusions**: The results of our study have shown that alpha(1)-receptor blockade decreases ureteral contractility effectively.

### Combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and a baseline total prostate volume of 25 mL or greater [^112jZL65]. The Journal of Urology (2006). High credibility.

We examined data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms trial to determine the relationship between baseline TPV and the effect of medical therapy in men with LUTS secondary to BPH.

A total of 3,047 patients with LUTS were randomized to receive either a placebo, 4 to 8 mg doxazosin, 5 mg finasteride, or a combination of doxazosin and finasteride. The average treatment duration was 4.5 years. The primary outcome was the time to overall clinical progression of BPH, defined as a confirmed 4-point or greater increase in AUA SS, acute urinary retention, incontinence, renal insufficiency, or urinary tract infection. Secondary outcomes included the need for invasive therapy for BPH and changes in AUA SS and the maximum urinary flow rate over time. TPV was measured by transrectal ultrasound at baseline and study end.

In patients with a small prostate (baseline TPV less than 25 ml), combination therapy was no more effective than doxazosin alone in decreasing the risk of clinical progression of BPH and the need for invasive therapy, as well as improving AUA SS and the maximum urinary flow rate. However, in patients with moderate-sized (25 to less than 40 ml) or enlarged (40 mL or greater) glands, combination therapy resulted in clinical benefits that surpassed those of doxazosin or finasteride alone.

Combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride led to a greater decrease in the risk of clinical progression of BPH than either drug alone in patients with LUTS with a baseline TPV of 25 mL or greater.

### Adcirca [^11366Bxr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Alpha-blockers and PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, are systemic vasodilators. In subjects receiving concomitant tadalafil (20 mg single dose) and doxazosin (8 mg daily), an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, there was an augmentation of the blood pressure–lowering effect of doxazosin. This effect was still present at 12 hours postdose and had generally disappeared at 24 hours. The number of subjects with potentially clinically significant standing–blood–pressure decreases was greater for the combination.

An additional study was performed with tadalafil (20 mg single dose) and doxazosin (4 and 8 mg daily) using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. The augmentation appeared unrelated to dosing times and resulted in a greater number of outliers for the combination than had been observed in the previous study. Both of these studies had some symptomatology associated with these blood pressure changes.

A further study was carried out with doxazosin (up to 4 mg daily) added to tadalafil (5 mg daily), and there was again an augmentation of response. In this clinical pharmacology study, there were symptoms associated with the decrease in blood pressure, including syncope.

An interaction study with tadalafil (20 mg single dose) and alfuzosin, also an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, showed no clinically significant effect on blood pressure.

In two clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers, tadalafil (5 mg daily, and 10 mg and 20 mg single dose) had no clinically significant effect on blood pressure.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111J3t7t]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The PATHWAY-2 study, published by Bryan Williams and colleagues in 2015 in the journal Lancet, examines the efficacy of spironolactone compared to doxazosin in treating drug-resistant hypertension. The study focuses on hypertension-related diseases and explores whether spironolactone is superior to add-on doxazosin for patients with drug-resistant hypertension. PATHWAY-2 was designed as a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The population included 335 patients (105 female, 230 male). Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18–79 years with seated clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) equal to or greater than 140 mmHg and home SBP equal to or greater than 130 mmHg, despite treatment with maximally tolerated doses of three antihypertensive drugs for at least three months. Key exclusion criteria included secondary or accelerated hypertension, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 45 mL/min, sustained atrial fibrillation (AF), and non-adherence to antihypertensive treatment.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Spironolactone**: n = 285, 25 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 50 mg/day through week 12.
	- **Doxazosin**: n = 282, 4 mg/day through week 6, forced uptitration to 8 mg/day through week 12.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant increase in the reduction of home SBP from week 6 to week 12 (12.8 mmHg vs. 8.7 mmHg; AD 4.03 mmHg, 95% CI 3.02 to 5.04).

Secondary outcomes were significant increases in the reduction of home SBP at week 12.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^113enLcA]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists (alpha-1 antagonists) are frequently used medications in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in the management of therapy-resistant arterial hypertension, two conditions frequently found in older adults. This systematic review aims at presenting a complete overview of evidence over the benefits and risks of alpha-1 antagonist treatment in people ≥ 65 years, and at deriving recommendations for a safe application of alpha-1 antagonists in older adults from the evidence found.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was performed, with the last update on March 25, 2022, including multiple databases: Medline/Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The PICOS framework was used to define search terms. The selection of the studies was conducted by two independent reviewers in a two-step approach, followed by a systematic data extraction. Quality appraisal was performed for each study included using standardized appraisal tools. The studies retrieved and additional literature were used for the development of recommendations, which were rated for strength and quality according to the GRADE methodology.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies were included: three meta-analyses, six randomized controlled trials, and nine observational trials. Doxazosin in the management of arterial hypertension was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure, than chlorthalidone. Regarding treatment of LUTS suggestive of BPH, alpha-1 antagonists appeared to be effective.

### Terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin: Current clinical experience [^112SR4WU]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction are common in aging men. Nearly 25% of men over 40 years of age have LUTS. Medical therapy with alpha-blockade is the most common method of medical therapy for benign prostatic obstruction.

Multiple methods of minimally invasive surgical therapies have been introduced in the last decade. These methods include balloon dilatation, temporary and permanent urethral stents, various laser techniques, microwave thermotherapy, transurethral needle ablation, electrovaporization, and high-intensity focused ultrasound.

Alpha-receptor blockers to reduce the sympathetic tone of the prostate are considered as first-line therapy to relieve the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Selective alpha(1)-receptor blockers relax prostatic smooth muscle, relieve bladder outlet obstruction, and enhance urine flow with fewer side effects. In addition, it was determined that treating patients with alpha-blockers increases prostatic apoptosis. Pharmacokinetic activity, mode of action, clinical efficacy, and side effects of the selective alpha(1)-receptor blockers terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin are reviewed.

### Viagra [^11468euS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

In the third study on Viagra with doxazosin, a single oral dose of Viagra 100 mg or a matching placebo was administered in a three-period crossover design to 20 generally healthy males with BPH.

- **Study design**: In dose period 1, subjects were administered open-label doxazosin and a single dose of Viagra 50 mg simultaneously, after at least 14 consecutive days of doxazosin. If a subject did not successfully complete this first dosing period, he was discontinued from the study. Subjects who had successfully completed the previous doxazosin interaction study (using Viagra 50 mg), including those with no significant hemodynamic adverse events, were allowed to skip dose period 1. Treatment with doxazosin continued for at least 7 days after dose period 1. Thereafter, Viagra 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin 4 mg (14 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (6 subjects) in standard crossover fashion. The mean subject age in this study was 66.4 years.

A total of 25 subjects were screened. Two were discontinued after study period 1: one failed to meet pre-dose screening qualifications and the other experienced symptomatic hypotension as a moderately severe adverse event 30 minutes after dosing with open-label Viagra 50 mg. Of the twenty subjects who were ultimately assigned to treatment, 13 subjects successfully completed dose period 1, and seven had successfully completed the previous doxazosin study (using Viagra 50 mg).

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^116y7CLw]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

PATHWAY-2 is the first randomised controlled trial to compare spironolactone with other blood pressure-lowering drug treatments in a well-characterized population of patients with resistant hypertension. The study shows that spironolactone was by far the most effective blood pressure-lowering treatment for patients with resistant hypertension. This was true in terms of the magnitude of the blood pressure response, the proportion of patients achieving a stringent measure of blood pressure control (home systolic blood pressure < 135 mm Hg), and the proportion in whom it was more effective than either of the non-diuretic alternative drugs.

These findings suggest that the predominant underlying pathophysiological cause of resistant hypertension is sodium retention, despite existing baseline diuretic therapy. This conclusion is supported by our finding that the response to spironolactone had a clear inverse relation with plasma renin, was especially effective at lower plasma renin levels, and yet the most effective drug throughout the range of plasma renin.

We examined the paradoxical hypothesis that the alpha-receptor inverse agonist doxazosin might produce beneficial effects in allergic rhinitis.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate single and chronic dosing effects of doxazosin on nasal airflow and symptoms in allergic rhinitis.

- **Methods**: Fifteen patients were randomized to receive 3–5 weeks of oral doxazosin 4 mg daily or placebo in crossover fashion. Measurements were taken at baseline and after the first and last doses.

- **Results**: There was a fall in peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) between baseline and the first dose of doxazosin: mean difference -19 L/min (95% CI -35 to -2) P = 0.03, with recovery between the first and last doses: 21 L/min (95% CI 7–34) P = 0.006. Nasal visual analogue scale (VAS) and blockage scores were worse between baseline and the first dose of doxazosin: mean difference VAS -10 mm (95% CI -18 to -2) P = 0.02, blockage -0.7 (95% CI -1.3 to -0.1) P = 0.02, with recovery between the first and last doses: VAS 15 mm (95% CI 4–25) P = 0.009, blockage 1.1 (95% CI 0.5–1.6) P = 0.001. The oxymetazoline dose-response for PNIF was blunted after single versus chronic dosing with doxazosin: mean difference -17 L/min (95% CI -30 to -4) P = 0.01. Heart rate and diastolic blood pressure showed the same pattern. There was a significant difference between doxazosin and placebo for nasal blockage score and heart rate after single but not chronic dosing.

- **Conclusions**: There was a disconnect between single and chronic dosing effects of doxazosin for nasal symptoms, oxymetazoline response, and cardiovascular outcomes, which in turn suggests alpha-1 receptor involvement.

### Terazosin [^1166zJs1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

**Indications and usage**: Terazosin capsules are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). There is a rapid response, with approximately 70% of patients experiencing an increase in urinary flow and improvement in symptoms of BPH when treated with terazosin capsules. The long-term effects of terazosin capsules on the incidence of surgery, acute urinary obstruction, or other complications of BPH are yet to be determined. Terazosin capsules are also indicated for the treatment of hypertension and can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, such as diuretics or beta-adrenergic blocking agents.

### Combination of doxazosin and sildenafil exerts an additive relaxing effect compared with each compound alone on human cavernosal and prostatic tissue [^115WUbj1]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5), such as sildenafil, are the first-line treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). Alpha1 (alpha1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as doxazosin, are indicated for the treatment of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). ED and LUTS/BPH are conditions that are often associated; accordingly, alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists and PDE5 inhibitors are often prescribed together in real-life settings.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of the combination of sildenafil and doxazosin on human cavernosal and prostatic tissue. Prostatic and erectile tissues were obtained from nine to twelve patients who underwent cystoprostatectomy for infiltrating bladder cancer or penile surgery for penile implant, congenital curvature, or Peyronie's disease.

- **Main outcome measures**: In organ baths, prostatic and cavernosal strips were subjected to either concentration-response curves (CRC) to phenylephrine (Phe) or norepinephrine (NE), respectively, in the presence of a vehicle, sildenafil (10^-6 M, 10^-5 M), doxazosin (10^-8 M, 3x10^-8 M, or 10^-7 M), or a combination of both. Continuous electrical field stimulation (EFS; 32 Hz, 5 ms, 5 seconds, 300 mA) was performed on prostatic strips incubated with sildenafil 10^-6 M or vehicle before the successive addition of doxazosin (10^-7 M, 10^-6 M) or vehicle. Cavernosal strips were pre-incubated with doxazosin (10^-9 M, 10^-8 M) or vehicle, then CRC to sildenafil were constructed on NE (3x10^-6 M) precontracted cavernosal strips.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^117EDv5q]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Use of doxazosin should not be considered as first-line medication for the management of arterial hypertension. The use of alpha-1 antagonists in the management of LUTS suggestive of BPH, however, appears to be promising in reducing urinary symptoms. The safety profile of different agents must be carefully assessed in a patient-oriented manner. Long-term safety and efficacy remain questionable, and an assessment of efficacy and safety profile in comparison with other classes of drugs could not be performed.

Even though many older adults suffer from hypertension and the majority of older men experience LUTS from BPH, only eighteen eligible studies could be identified, primarily due to the age restriction, only two of which are placebo-controlled randomized trials. This highlights the lack of evidence for older adults, although the largest part of medical interventions is performed in this age class. Additionally, randomized controlled trials with extended follow-up periods are needed to assess the benefits and risks of alpha-1 antagonist treatment in long-term use, providing an enhanced understanding of the real-world use of these medications. To complete the picture of managing LUTS suggestive of BPH in people ≥ 65 years, it would also be desirable if future research focused on comparisons and combinations of different classes of drugs.

Given that most included studies revealed considerable methodological limitations, a stronger emphasis should be laid on the application of appropriate methodology in future studies.

### Clinical ease of using doxazosin in BPH patients with and without hypertension [^114LAQNJ]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that doxazosin therapy reduced blood pressure (BP) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who were hypertensive at baseline but not in patients who were physiologically or pharmacologically normotensive at baseline. In patients with BPH and uncontrolled hypertension, despite treatment with other antihypertensive drugs, the addition of doxazosin resulted in improved control with significant reductions in BP. The new formulation, doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), is initiated at a therapeutic dose, simplifying dose titration. Based on its efficacy and pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, doxazosin GITS is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for normotensive and hypertensive patients with BPH.

### Effects of α-blocker 'add on' treatment on blood pressure in symptomatic BPH with or without concomitant hypertension [^11265eVG]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Of 953 patients enrolled, 385 patients (40.4%) took tamsulosin 0.2 mg, 203 (21.3%) took alfuzosin 10 mg, 197 (20.7%) were on the doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) 4 mg, and 168 (17.7%) took terazosin 2 mg once daily. The overall mean age was 63.2 ± 5.8 years and the mean prostate volume was 38.1 ± 5.5 cc. The mean duration of follow-up was 58.8 ± 7.3 days, and there was no significant difference in the duration of follow-up by AB regimen.

The addition of ABs lowered the mean systolic BP by 16.6 mm Hg for group 3 and by 8.6 mm Hg for group 4, and diastolic BP by 18.0 mm Hg for group 3 (P < 0.05). However, normotensive groups on entry, irrespective of antihypertensive medication, showed no significant BP changes from baseline values after AB medication. After adjusting for age, significant changes in mean systolic BP from baseline values were found in group 2 (Δ−0.4 mm Hg) versus group 3 (Δ−16.6 mm Hg); changes in diastolic BP were found in group 1 (Δ+1.6 mm Hg) versus group 3 (Δ−18.0 mm Hg), group 1 (Δ+1.6 mm Hg) versus group 4 (Δ−8.2 mm Hg), group 2 (Δ+1.7 mm Hg) versus group 3 (Δ−18.0 mm Hg), and in group 2 (Δ+1.7 mm Hg) versus group 4 (Δ−8.2 mm Hg) (Figure 1).

### Cardura XL [^1128Q4Hk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Read this patient information leaflet before you start taking Cardura XL and each time you get a refill, as there may be new information. This leaflet does not replace discussions with your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment.

- **What is Cardura XL?**: Cardura XL is a prescription medicine known as an "alpha-blocker". It is used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Cardura XL may help relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder, potentially lessening BPH symptoms and improving urine flow.

Before prescribing Cardura XL, your healthcare provider may examine your prostate gland and perform a blood test called a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test to check for prostate cancer. Both prostate cancer and BPH can cause similar symptoms, but prostate cancer requires different treatment.

Some "alpha-blockers" are used to treat high blood pressure, but Cardura XL is not indicated for this purpose. The safety and effectiveness of Cardura XL in children have not been established.

- **Who should not take Cardura XL?**: Do not take Cardura XL if you are allergic to doxazosin, other quinazoline medications, or any ingredients in Cardura XL. Refer to the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^111CT4G5]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

One hypothesis is that resistant hypertension is predominantly caused by sodium retention, due in part to the reduced doses of diuretics prescribed in recent years; if so, drugs with a diuretic action would be the most effective additional treatment. An alternative hypothesis is that resistant hypertension is a heterogeneous state, with average responses in study cohorts masking substantial individual patient differences. In the latter case, treatment could be stratified by use of biomarkers of sodium/volume status, particularly plasma renin level, to which sodium status is inversely related.

We selected spironolactone as the drug with diuretic action (through blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor) because of observational and limited randomised controlled trial data suggesting good blood pressure-lowering efficacy in resistant hypertension, recently summarised in a meta-analysis. However, spironolactone has not been compared with alternative drugs recommended for resistant hypertension. It has therefore been unknown whether spironolactone is the most effective treatment, and if so, whether this applies to a subset of patients or the majority. We aimed to compare spironolactone with alternative fourth-line treatments targeting different pathogenetic mechanisms: the α1-adrenoceptor blocker doxazosin, acting to reduce peripheral resistance, and the β1-adrenoceptor blocker bisoprolol, which inhibits the release of renin and reduces cardiac output. Our primary aim was to determine, for the first time, whether spironolactone is overall the most effective add-on drug treatment.

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): A randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^115FuQo3]. The Lancet (2015). High credibility.

The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that spironolactone is the most effective add-on treatment for patients with resistant hypertension. The primary analysis used an average of home systolic blood pressure recorded throughout the treatment cycle. We prespecified hierarchical primary endpoints: (1) the difference in the home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and placebo, followed if significant by (2) the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and the average of the other two active drugs (doxazosin and bisoprolol), followed if significant by (3) the difference in home systolic blood pressure between spironolactone and each of the other two active drugs.

- **Secondary objectives**: Included evaluation of (1) clinic blood pressure responses to randomised treatments; (2) blood pressure control rates, i.e. home systolic blood pressure less than 135 mm Hg; (3) whether plasma renin concentrations and other baseline characteristics could help personalise treatment by predicting the best drug treatment; and (4) adverse event rates during each treatment cycle.

To test the hypothesis that plasma renin (measured on a background of three drugs, i.e. A + C + D) will predict the most effective fourth-line drug, we examined the relationship between plasma renin and the reduction of home systolic blood pressure with each drug, adjusted for the placebo response. We also identified the best treatment for each patient — i.e. the one on which they achieved the lowest blood pressure — and estimated for each drug the relationship between blood pressure reduction and plasma renin levels.

### Terazosin [^112pbefC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

Please read this leaflet before you start taking terazosin capsules. Also, review it each time you receive a new prescription. This leaflet is a summary and should not replace a full discussion with your doctor, who has additional information about terazosin capsules. You and your doctor should discuss terazosin capsules and your condition before you start taking them, as well as at your regular checkups.

Terazosin capsules are used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men. This leaflet describes terazosin capsules as a treatment for hypertension or BPH.

- **Hypertension (high blood pressure)**: Blood pressure is the tension of the blood within the blood vessels. If blood is pumped too forcefully or if the blood vessels are too narrow, the pressure of the blood against the walls of the vessels rises. If high blood pressure is not treated, over time, the increased pressure can damage blood vessels, cause the heart to work too hard, and may decrease the flow of blood to the heart, brain, and kidneys. As a result, these organs may become damaged and not function correctly. If high blood pressure is controlled, this damage is less likely to occur.

### Controlled-release doxazosin in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115zjLEq]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of controlled-release doxazosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

In this open-label, noncontrolled, observational surveillance study, 3684 men with BPH received 4–8 mg of controlled-release doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) for 6 months. A total of 3283 (89.1%) patients completed the trial. Changes in urinary symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Additionally, blood pressure and adverse events were evaluated.

After 6 months of treatment, doxazosin GITS resulted in significant improvements in IPSS. Blood pressure was reduced only in hypertensive patients. Overall, doxazosin GITS was well tolerated.

### Cardura [^1114fTNX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

There are limited data on the effects of drugs known to influence the hepatic metabolism of doxazosin, such as cimetidine.

- **Cimetidine**: In healthy volunteers, administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin on day 1 of a four-day regimen of oral cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in the mean AUC of doxazosin, and a slight but not significant increase in mean Cmax and mean half-life of doxazosin.

In vitro data in human plasma indicate that Cardura has no effect on the protein binding of digoxin, warfarin, phenytoin, or indomethacin.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^112gEGXy]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

The applicability of results

Most findings of this systematic review confirm the important standing of alpha-1 antagonists in the management of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the minor role of doxazosin in the management of arterial hypertension. Nevertheless, some issues must be addressed concerning the applicability of the results.

The short follow-up time limits the ability to appraise the effects in long-term treatment with alpha-1 antagonists in LUTS suggestive of BPH. The applicability of the results is additionally impaired as the dose regimen used for tamsulosin was 0.2 mg once daily in all three trials, which is lower than the recommended daily dose of 0.4 mg in Western countries. It also must be considered that the trials were not placebo-controlled. Whether alpha-1 antagonists can be recommended for long-term treatment remains doubtful, as the results by Roehrborn et al. (2006) demonstrate similar progression event rates for treatment with alfuzosin as for placebo, and results about a possible relationship between tamsulosin and the incidence of dementia remain doubtful.

Other classes of drugs, such as 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g. dutasteride, finasteride) or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (e.g. tadalafil), are currently used in the management of LUTS suggestive of BPH, alone or in combination with alpha-1 antagonists. Only one study compared treatment satisfaction between management with tamsulosin 0.4 mg, tadalafil 5 mg, and placebo, but did not offer separate reporting for older adults. Therefore, no valuable additive informat

### Discontinuation of alpha-blockade after initial treatment with finasteride and doxazosin in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and clinical evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111xfvVP]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the effect of discontinuation of alpha-blockade and continuation of finasteride in men with lower urinary tract symptoms and enlarged prostates receiving combination treatment, the study aimed to assess whether the alpha-blocker dose influences the ability to discontinue it.

- **Methods**: We treated 272 consecutive men with a prostate size greater than 40 g and an American Urological Association symptom score greater than 20 with 5 mg finasteride and 2 mg doxazosin daily. Two hundred forty men reported a favorable response to therapy, defined as any reduction in symptom score and toleration of the medications. The dose was maintained at 2 mg doxazosin in 100 men, titrated to 4 mg in 80 patients, and to 8 mg in an additional 60 patients. We discontinued doxazosin at 3, 6, 9, or 12 months while continuing finasteride and then re-evaluated the patients 1 month later to determine whether any worsening of symptoms had resulted.

- **Results**: In patients discontinuing doxazosin at 3 months, success (defined as no increase in symptom score and no desire to resume doxazosin) was reported by 20%, 15%, and 13% of those taking 2, 4, and 8 mg, respectively. At 6 months, success was reported by 48%, 45%, and 40% for the same respective doses. At 9 months, success was seen in 84%, 80%, and 73%. Finally, at 12 months, success was reported by 84%, 85%, and 87% of those taking 2, 4, and 8 mg, respectively.

### Terazosin [^115AeLUK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

There are three main treatment options for BPH:

- **Program of monitoring or watchful waiting**: Some men have an enlarged prostate gland but no symptoms, or symptoms that are not bothersome. If this applies, you and your doctor may decide on a program of monitoring, including regular checkups, instead of medication or surgery.

- **Medication**: There are different kinds of medication used to treat BPH. Your doctor has prescribed Terazosin Capsules for you. See "What Terazosin Capsules do to treat BPH" below.

- **Surgery**: Some patients may need surgery. Your doctor can describe several different surgical procedures to treat BPH. Which procedure is best depends on your symptoms and medical condition.

- **What Terazosin Capsules do to treat BPH**: Terazosin Capsules relax the tightness of a certain type of muscle in the prostate and at the opening of the bladder. This may increase the rate of urine flow and/or decrease the symptoms you are having. Terazosin Capsules help relieve the symptoms of BPH. It does NOT change the size of the prostate, which may continue to grow. However, a larger prostate does not necessarily cause more or worse symptoms. If Terazosin Capsules are helping you, you should notice an effect on your particular symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks of starting the medication. Even though you take Terazosin Capsules and they may help you, Terazosin Capsules may not prevent the need for surgery in the future.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^1156RgHd]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

None of the included meta-analyses met any of the criteria defined in the AMSTAR 2 assessment tool, with the exception of the statement of funding. Neither of the publications provided detailed information on the methodology used. All meta-analyses utilized unpublished information and presumably based their analysis on raw data. Due to a lack of transparency in the calculations performed, the figures published cannot be reconstructed. It is also not possible to assess the homogeneity of the data or the likelihood of publication bias in the included studies. A comprehensible reproduction of the results is therefore not possible.

- **Critical quality appraisal for included meta-analyses according to AMSTAR 2**:

	- Table 3 (Critical quality appraisal for included meta-analyses according to AMSTAR 2) displays the assessment criteria for the studies. Abbreviations used: Y - Yes, N - No, U - Unclear, and RoB - Risk of Bias.

The result of the risk of bias assessment, based on the appraisal of five different categories according to the RoB 2 tool, is shown for each study in the following reference.

- **Interventional studies**:

	- Table 4 (Critical quality appraisal for included interventional studies according to the Cochrane Collaboration Tool) provides assessment details. Abbreviations used: LR - Low Risk of Bias, HR - High Risk of Bias, and SC - Some Concerns.

Selection bias arising from the randomization of the patients raised some concerns in the trial by Gotoh et al. (2005), as baseline characteristics in the categories total IPSS (p-value = 0.088) and prostate volume (p-value = 0.06) were imbalanced between the two interventional groups.

### Novel quinazoline-based compounds impair prostate tumorigenesis by targeting tumor vascularity [^113zfp67]. Cancer Research (2007). Low credibility.

Previous evidence showed the ability of the quinazoline-based alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonist doxazosin to suppress prostate tumor growth via apoptosis. In this study, we carried out structural optimization of the chemical nucleus of doxazosin and conducted a subsequent structure-function analysis towards the development of a novel class of apoptosis-inducing and angiogenesis-targeting agents. Our lead compound, DZ-50, was effective in reducing endothelial cell viability via a nonapoptotic mechanism. Treatment with DZ-50 effectively prevented in vitro tube formation and in vivo chorioallantoic membrane vessel development. Confocal microscopy revealed a significantly reduced ability of tumor cells to attach to the extracellular matrix and migrate through endothelial cells in the presence of DZ-50. In vivo tumorigenicity studies using two androgen-independent human prostate cancer xenografts, PC-3 and DU-145, showed that DZ-50 treatment leads to significant suppression of tumorigenic growth. Exposure to the drug at the time of tumor cell inoculation led to the prevention of prostate cancer initiation. Furthermore, DZ-50 resulted in a reduced formation of prostate-tumor-derived metastatic lesions to the lungs in an in vivo spontaneous metastasis assay. Thus, our drug discovery approach led to the development of a class of lead quinazoline-based compounds with higher potency than doxazosin in suppressing prostate growth by targeting tissue vascularity. This new class of quinazoline-based compounds provides considerable promise as antitumor drugs for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.

### Terazosin [^116YBcrr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

The dose of terazosin capsules and the dose interval (12 or 24 hours) should be adjusted according to the patient's individual blood pressure response. The following is a guide to its administration:

- **Initial dose**: 1 mg at bedtime is the starting dose for all patients, and this dose should not be exceeded. This initial dosing regimen should be strictly observed to minimize the potential for severe hypotensive effects.

- **Subsequent doses**: The dose may be slowly increased to achieve the desired blood pressure response. The usual recommended dose range is 1 mg to 5 mg administered once a day; however, some patients may benefit from doses as high as 20 mg per day. Doses over 20 mg do not appear to provide further blood pressure effect and doses over 40 mg have not been studied. Blood pressure should be monitored at the end of the dosing interval to ensure control is maintained throughout. It may also be helpful to measure blood pressure 2 to 3 hours after dosing to assess if the maximum and minimum responses are similar and to evaluate symptoms such as dizziness or palpitations that can result from an excessive hypotensive response. If the response is substantially diminished at 24 hours, an increased dose or a twice-daily regimen can be considered. If terazosin administration is discontinued for several days or longer, therapy should be reinstituted using the initial dosing regimen. In clinical trials, except for the initial dose, the dose was given in the morning.

Use with other drugs should be considered in the context of the patient's comprehensive treatment plan.

### Doxazosin, an alpha1-adrenergic antihypertensive agent, decreases serum oxidized LDL [^116Lqbwb]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is well known to play an important role in atherogenesis through the recruitment of monocytes into vessel walls and the deposition of cholesterol ester in the macrophages, which leads to the formation of lipid-rich plaque. It was assumed that only trace amounts of ox-LDL were present in plasma because the half-life of ox-LDL was only a few minutes. Recently, through the use of a monoclonal antibody against ox-LDL, a quantitative method to measure serum ox-LDL concentration has been developed.

Metabolites of doxazosin, an alpha1-adrenergic antihypertensive agent, have been reported to inhibit oxidation of LDL in vitro. In this study, we investigated the in vivo effect of doxazosin on LDL oxidation using this new method to measure serum ox-LDL concentration. After the administration of doxazosin for 1 to 2 months, serum concentration of ox-LDL decreased significantly (P < .05). Although the reduction of ox-LDL concentration does not strictly indicate doxazosin's antiatherosclerotic effect, it may constitute one of doxazosin's additional weapons besides lowering blood pressure and serum lipid values in the prevention of atherosclerosis.

### Carduraxl [^116Qv5pn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Drug-drug interactions**: No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed to assess the effect of concomitant medications on the pharmacokinetics of CARDURA XL or to assess the effect of CARDURA XL on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs. In vitro studies suggest that doxazosin is a substrate of CYP 3A4. Caution should be exercised when concomitantly administering CARDURA XL with a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, such as atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole.

	- In one placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of a single 1 mg dose of doxazosin IR on day 1 of a four-day regimen of cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) resulted in a 10% increase in the mean AUC of doxazosin, a 6% increase in mean Cmax of doxazosin, and no significant change in the mean half-life of doxazosin. Based upon the differences in dose and formulation, the applicability of these results to CARDURA XL is unknown. Otherwise, the interaction potential with other inhibitors or substrates of CYP enzymes has not been determined. Pharmacodynamic interactions between CARDURA XL and anti-hypertensive medications or other vasodilating agents have also not been determined. Finally, drugs that reduce gastrointestinal motility leading to markedly prolonged GI retention times (e.g. anticholinergic agents) may increase systemic exposure to doxazosin.

- **Use in specific populations - Geriatric**: In a study to assess the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of CARDURA XL, increases of 27% in plasma were observed.

KMUP-1 has been suggested to be beneficial in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This study aims to further investigate whether KMUP-1 and doxazosin prevent prostate cancer cell growth via androgen-dependent and -independent pathways in vivo and in vitro.

- **Methods**: KMUP-1 was measured for activity on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP, DU-145, PC-3) using MTT assay, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The inhibitory activities on androgen receptor (AR) and AR-targeting molecular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression by KMUP-1 and doxazosin were assessed by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA. Furthermore, the effects of KMUP-1 on the growth of LNCaP xenografts in nude mice were confirmed.

- **Results**: KMUP-1 significantly inhibited LNCaP cell growth and induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. KMUP-1 and doxazosin further inhibited the expression of AR and PSA. Treatment of LNCaP cells with KMUP-1 resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic activities, increasing p21 and p27 and decreasing expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK2, and CDK6. Moreover, KMUP-1 activated p53, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3, but reduced the expression of Bcl-2. Regular administration of KMUP-1 suppressed the LNCaP xenograft tumor growth in nude mice.

- **Conclusion**: These evidences indicate that KMUP-1 and doxazosin inhibit LNCaP cell growth and downregulate expression of AR and PSA. KMUP-1 might be used as a chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer.

### Molecular targets of doxazosin in human prostatic stromal cells [^1131J6yE]. The Prostate (2005). Low credibility.

We used cDNA microarray analysis to obtain insights into the mechanisms of action of doxazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

- **Methods**: Hierarchical clustering analysis and significance analysis of microarray (SAM) were performed to identify genes differentially expressed between untreated stromal cells cultured from normal tissue and BPH, as well as changes in gene expression induced by doxazosin. Transcript levels of selected genes were validated by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

- **Results**: Hierarchical clustering analyses separated untreated normal and BPH cells. Sixty-seven genes whose expression varied at least twofold after doxazosin treatment in both normal and BPH cells were identified, as were 93 genes differentially regulated in normal versus BPH cells. Molecular targets consistent with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-related activity were identified.

- **Conclusions**: Normal versus BPH stromal cells differ in global gene transcription. Doxazosin induced gene expression changes relevant to proliferation/apoptosis, immune defense, cell-cell signaling/signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation.

### Double-blind trial of the efficacy and tolerability of doxazosin in the gastrointestinal therapeutic system, doxazosin standard, and placebo in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^111GnwjY]. European Urology (2000). Low credibility.

The alpha(1)-blocker doxazosin mesylate is an established efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). However, its clinical utility can be limited by the need for multiple titration steps, starting at an initial dose of 1 mg, increased up to 8 mg once daily, to achieve optimal therapeutic response. A new controlled-release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin mesylate enhances the pharmacokinetic profile and drug delivery rate, reducing the plasma doxazosin mesylate peak-to-trough ratio and minimizing the need for titration.

- **Objective**: A study was conducted to assess the effects of doxazosin GITS 4 or 8 mg once daily, doxazosin standard 1 mg to 8 mg once daily, and placebo in 795 men with BPH. This randomized, double-blind, multicenter Scandinavian study included a 2-week washout period, 2-week single-blind placebo run-in phase, and 13-week double-blind treatment phase. Doxazosin GITS was initiated at 4 mg once daily and titrated to 8 mg once daily after 7 weeks if indicated, and doxazosin standard was initiated at 1 mg once daily, titrated to 2 mg after 1 week, to 4 mg at 3 weeks, and to 8 mg at 7 weeks if indicated, to achieve symptom control. The primary outcome measures were mean changes from baseline to the final visit for International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) and maximum urinary flow rate adjusted for baseline values.

- **Results**: Both doxazosin GITS and doxazosin standard significantly improved the symptoms of BPH, as evidenced by least-squares mean reductions in total I-PSS of -8.0.

### How carvedilol activates β-adrenoceptors [^111QBzgL]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Understanding the mechanism of drug action is no prerequisite for a drug to obtain approval from regulatory authorities; however, it provides a solid foundation for evidence-based decision-making throughout all stages of the drug discovery process. Conversely, if the mechanism of drug action remains enigmatic, or if there is a lack of consensus on how precisely a drug alters the function of its protein target, the molecular basis for therapeutic efficacy will remain obscure.

Carvedilol, a widely prescribed cardiovascular medication, is a case in point. It belongs to a class of drugs known as beta receptor blockers (β-blockers), which are commonly used to treat hypertension and heart failure. β-blockers are particularly effective in patients where myocardial damage is associated with overstimulation of β-adrenoceptors (βARs). βARs are prototypical class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the targets for the majority of prescription drugs in clinical use. They are also among the most powerful regulators of cardiac function and the primary targets for the endogenous catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which act as neurotransmitters and hormones to control heart rate and blood pressure. β-blockers oppose the stimulating effects of catecholamines, which explains their efficacy in the clinic to reduce heart rate and contractility, consequently lowering the cardiac oxygen demand.

### Determination of the efficiency of 8 mg doxazosin XL treatment in patients with an inadequate response to 4 mg doxazosin XL treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117BnjvS]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of 4 mg and 8 mg doxazosin XL treatments in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia-related lower urinary tract symptoms. Additionally, the study aimed to determine the efficiency of 8 mg in those patients who had an inadequate response to 4 mg.

- **Methods**: A total of 162 patients were included in this study. Of these, 108 were randomized to receive 4 mg doxazosin XL (group 1), and 54 were randomized to receive 8 mg (group 2) treatments. After 1 month of treatment, 31 patients in group 1 whose quality of life (QoL) score was unchanged or had deteriorated were switched to 8 mg doxazosin XL treatment (group 1b).

- **Results**: The mean age was 59.8 years. After 1 month of treatment, the mean alteration in the International Prostate Symptom Score was 3.9 and 5.2 (P = 0.028) for groups 1 and 2, respectively. For the maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)), it was 3.0 and 3.6 mL/s (P = 0.206), and for the QoL score, it was 1.3 and 1.7 (P = 0.038) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. For group 1b, during the period in which the patients were receiving 4 and 8 mg doxazosin XL treatments, the International Prostate Symptom Score changes were 1.3 and 3.6 (P < 0.001). The Q(max) changes were 1.6 and 3.2 mL/s (P < 0.019), and the QoL changes were 0.4 and 1.8 (P < 0.001) in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: With no changes in side effects, 8 mg doxazosin XL treatment is an efficient choice for patients who did not have an adequate response to 4 mg doxazosin XL treatment.

### Doxazosin and terazosin suppress prostate growth by inducing apoptosis: Clinical significance [^111sGCH2]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Doxazosin and terazosin are known to relax prostate smooth muscle by blocking alpha 1-adrenergic innervation to the prostate. However, this action alone does not fully account for the long-term clinical responses observed when treating patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Experimental and clinical studies have been conducted to establish that the induction of prostate cell apoptosis by alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists contributes to their long-term efficacy in managing lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH and potentially suppressing prostate cancer growth.

The data indicate that both doxazosin and terazosin induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. This apoptotic effect is mediated by a mechanism independent of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade, potentially directed by the quinazoline nucleus, since the nonquinazoline alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, tamsulosin, does not elicit an apoptotic response. Recent evidence suggests that deregulation of signal transduction pathways involving transforming growth factor-beta and disruption of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (anoikis) are potential mechanisms underlying this apoptotic action of quinazoline-based alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists against prostate cells.

The correlation of induced prostate smooth muscle cell apoptosis with improvement of urinary symptoms in patients with BPH treated with doxazosin and terazosin…

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^116s5wjL]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Our study also has a number of strengths. The patients in this study were particularly well characterized as having resistant hypertension, with the use of home blood pressure monitoring to exclude so-called white coat hypertension, standardization of background medication (A + C + D), and directly observed therapy to exclude patients non-compliant with background medication. We measured serum ACE to allow retrospective confirmation of the expected difference in distribution between patients receiving ACE inhibitor or ARB as one of their background drugs and had oversight by national specialist hypertension centers to exclude secondary hypertension.

In the late stages of the study, we incorporated a new assay for monitoring all commonly administered antihypertensive drugs in patients' urine and will report results from this substudy that strongly support a high adherence rate among our patients. Another strength was the design of the study, which incorporated a random crossover design, allowing each patient's best drug to be determined and predictive testing of this to be assessed. Mechanistic hemodynamic substudies, which could add to the predictive value of renin and help us to understand the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension, were included at most sites and will be reported separately. Finally, this was the first randomized controlled trial directly comparing different active drug treatments in resistant hypertension, and it produced an unequivocal result.

The results of PATHWAY-2 have broad international relevance because of convergent guideline recommendations, which re

### Spironolactone versus placebo, bisoprolol, and doxazosin to determine the optimal treatment for drug-resistant hypertension (PATHWAY-2): a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial [^112HKpyL]. Lancet (2015). High credibility.

Spironolactone substantially increased the likelihood of achieving blood pressure control relative to bisoprolol or doxazosin, with almost 60% achieving blood pressure control within 3 months of starting treatment. This challenges the concept that resistant hypertension cannot be treated adequately with existing drug therapies, a concept that might have contributed to the growth of non-drug-based therapies such as renal denervation. Indeed, only 15 of 285 patients assessed on spironolactone failed to achieve a home systolic blood pressure lower than 150 mm Hg (equivalent to a clinic systolic blood pressure of roughly 160 mm Hg), the usual eligibility criterion for denervation. Furthermore, it is clear from our data that spironolactone, unlike bisoprolol or doxazosin, exhibited a significant dose response with regard to the magnitude of blood pressure lowering. A previous crossover comparison of spironolactone with even higher doses (i.e. 50–100 mg) in patients without resistant hypertension also showed a dose response, suggesting that the highest dose of spironolactone used in our study (i.e. 50 mg) might not be at the top of the dose range, and hence the potential for even better control rates with higher doses.

The superior response to spironolactone, compared with the other drugs, particularly in patients at the lower end of the distribution of plasma renin, supports the hypothesis that the predominant cause of resistant hypertension is sodium retention. The fact that spironolactone was the most effective drug across a wide range of baseline plasma renin values does not.

### Combination therapy with doxazosin and tenoxicam for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms [^115DcaKX]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To compare the efficacy and safety of a combination therapy — doxazosin plus tenoxicam — and doxazosin alone for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as various combination therapies increase the efficacy of medical therapy. Alpha blocker agents have been widely used for the treatment of LUTS secondary to BPH. Fifty-seven patients complaining of LUTS secondary to BPH were enrolled in this clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive doxazosin 4 mg or doxazosin 4 mg plus tenoxicam 20 mg treatment.

Patients were evaluated for BPH according to the European Association of Urology and American Urological Association clinical guidelines. In addition, patients were assessed with the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Patients were reevaluated following a 6-week treatment course. The International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS-Quality of Life (IPSS-QoL), maximal urinary flow rates (Q(max)), and average urinary flow rates (AFR) were determined at baseline and again at 6 weeks as efficacy parameters.

- **Results**: The total IPSS, IPSS-QoL, and OABSS decreased significantly in both the tenoxicam plus doxazosin group and the doxazosin alone group compared with baseline (P < .01). Also, Q(max) and AFR significantly improved in both groups (P < .01). The improvements in IPSS, IPSS-QoL, and OABSS were significantly better in patients treated with combination therapy (P < .05).

- **Conclusions**: COX-2 inhibitors in combination with an alpha blocker may increase the effectiveness of treatment for BPH.

### Association of glycolysis-enhancing α-1 blockers with risk of developing Parkinson disease [^112Dqkjg]. JAMA Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Question**: Is use of glycolysis-enhancing drugs, such as terazosin, doxazosin, and alfuzosin, associated with a decreased risk of Parkinson disease compared with the use of tamsulosin, a drug prescribed for similar indications but which does not enhance glycolysis?

- **Findings**: In this cohort study of 147,248 propensity score–matched pairs of terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin users and tamsulosin users from Danish nationwide health registries and the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan, the use of terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin was associated with a 12% to 37% decrease in Parkinson disease risk compared with the use of tamsulosin.

- **Meaning**: Use of terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin may lower the risk of developing Parkinson disease.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^116yeyjM]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

The medical treatment of older adults comes with many challenges. On the one hand, it is known that pharmacodynamics, as well as pharmacokinetics, differ between younger patients and older patients, leading to an increased risk of developing adverse drug events (ADEs) among the elderly. On the other hand, older adults are more frequently affected by multimorbidity, which may result in polypharmacy; this again increases the risk of ADEs, adverse drug interactions, and possibly hospitalization. The versions of diverse national potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) lists are inconclusive on how to categorize alpha-1 antagonists. Doxazosin is included in three PIM lists, two of which also include terazosin. However, the PIM lists of Austria, France, and Canada do not include any of the alpha-1 antagonists.

In light of the above-mentioned points, it seems overdue to summarize and synthesize the evidence available on the treatment of the elderly with alpha-1 antagonists. An aging population associated with an expected substantial increase in the prevalence of hypertension and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the near future will lead to an increased use of alpha-1 antagonists in patients older than 65 years. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the effectiveness and safety of alpha-1 antagonists in these patients and to develop recommendations on when to discontinue or reduce the dose of alpha-1 antagonists to prevent inappropriate prescribing.

To the best of our knowledge, so far, no systematic review has analyzed the specific evidence on the use of alpha-1 antagonists in the aged population.

### Alpha blockers: Are all created equal [^117QyjRV]. Urology (2000). Low credibility.

Drug therapy with alpha blockers has become the standard treatment for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Medical treatment is often preferred by patients as opposed to minimally invasive therapy or transurethral resection of the prostate. Alpha blockers reduce urethral pressure by blocking the motor sympathetic adrenergic nerve supply to the prostate. Several alpha blockers are available for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, including alfuzosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, and doxazosin. Different meta-analyses have shown these agents to be comparable in terms of efficacy in improving symptom scores and increasing urinary flow rates. The clinical uroselectivity of these agents differs, however, and translates into differences in side effects. Side effects that have been reported with some alpha blockers include dizziness, headache, postural hypotension, and retrograde ejaculation.

### Inhibition of mitogenic signaling and induction of apoptosis in human bladder smooth muscle cells treated with doxazosin [^113L1vHj]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

The alpha1 antagonist doxazosin is used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms and is believed to function primarily as a smooth muscle relaxant. However, doxazosin has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in nonbladder smooth muscle. Consequently, we examined the effects of doxazosin on human bladder smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and apoptosis.

Primary human bladder SMCs were cultured in M199 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) until they reached 65% confluency. They were then made quiescent by serum starvation in M199 with 0.4% FBS for 24 hours. The quiescent bladder SMCs were pretreated for 30 minutes with doxazosin or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) and then stimulated with 10% FBS for 24 hours. Measurement of 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake by flow cytometry was used to determine the effect of doxazosin on cell cycle progression. Western immunoblot was used to examine cell cycle protein expression and phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and cyclin A, both of which regulate cell cycle progression.

Cellular proliferation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by doxazosin. There was nearly a 50% decrease in BrdU uptake at 10 microM doxazosin and an approximately 90% decrease in BrdU at 25 microM doxazosin. Notably, doxazosin inhibited phosphorylation of Rb and expression of cyclin A, both of which are necessary for cell cycle progression. At concentrations of 25 microM doxazosin or greater, apoptosis was induced in the bladder SMCs, as indicated by an increase in subG1 DNA content.

### Viagra [^112DSBka]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Three double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, two-way crossover studies were conducted to assess the interaction of Viagra with doxazosin, an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent.

- **Study 1: Viagra with doxazosin**: In the first study, a single oral dose of Viagra 100 mg or matching placebo was administered in a two-period crossover design to four generally healthy males with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Following at least 14 consecutive daily doses of doxazosin, Viagra 100 mg or matching placebo was administered simultaneously with doxazosin. After reviewing the data from these first four subjects, the Viagra dose was reduced to 25 mg. Thereafter, 17 subjects were treated with Viagra 25 mg or matching placebo in combination with doxazosin 4 mg (15 subjects) or doxazosin 8 mg (2 subjects). The mean subject age was 66.5 years.

	- For the 17 subjects who received Viagra 25 mg and matching placebo, the placebo-subtracted mean maximum decreases from baseline (95% CI) in systolic blood pressure were calculated.

The mean profiles of the change from baseline in standing systolic blood pressure in subjects treated with doxazosin in combination with 25 mg Viagra or matching placebo are shown in Figure 2.

Blood pressure was measured immediately pre-dose and at 15, 30, and 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours after Viagra or matching placebo. Outliers were defined as subjects with a standing systolic…

### Atp-binding cassette transporter A1 gene transcription is downregulated by activator protein 2alpha. Doxazosin inhibits activator protein 2alpha and increases high-density lipoprotein biogenesis independent of alpha1-adrenoceptor blockade [^111KKHMd]. Circulation Research (2007). Low credibility.

ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is a rate-limiting factor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biogenesis. The ABCA1 gene expression is known to be upregulated by various transcriptional factors. However, negative regulation factors might be better targets for pharmacological modulation of HDL biogenesis. Doxazosin, an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blocker, increased ABCA1 mRNA, its protein, and apolipoprotein A-I-mediated HDL biogenesis in THP-1 macrophages and CHO-K1 cells, independent of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockade.

- **Analysis of the human ABCA1 promoter**: The region between positions -368 and -147 contains an activator protein (AP)2-binding site responsible for the effects of doxazosin. Overexpression of AP2alpha inhibited ABCA1 transcription in a dose-dependent fashion. Mutation in the AP2-binding site caused an increase in the basal promoter activity while cancelling both the transactivation by doxazosin and the trans-repression by AP2alpha.

- **Doxazosin's effects on different cell types**: Doxazosin had no effect on ABCA1 mRNA level in HepG2 cells, which lack endogenous AP2alpha. However, it reversed the inhibitory effect of AP2alpha expression in these cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays revealed that doxazosin reduced specific binding of AP2alpha to the ABCA1 promoter, suppressing phosphorylation of AP2alpha.

- **Conclusion**: Doxazosin increased ABCA1 expression and plasma HDL in mice. It was thus concluded that AP2alpha negatively regulates ABCA1 gene transcription. Doxazosin inhibits AP2alpha activity, independent of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor blockade, and increases ABCA1 expression and function.

### Do we know everything about alpha-blockade in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms [^117ADtHD]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, such as tamsulosin, relieve both voiding and filling lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Improvement in voiding, or 'obstructive', symptoms is attributed to alpha(1A)-related desobstruction. The relief of filling, or 'irritative', symptoms may be associated with a reduction in alpha(1D) (and alpha(1A))-related obstruction. Blockade of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors in the human prostate may be essential for reducing obstruction and improving related voiding symptoms as well as urinary flow. Furthermore, the blockade of alpha(1D) (and alpha(1A))-adrenoceptors in the human bladder might be necessary to alleviate filling LUTS.

These concepts warrant further evaluation before definitive conclusions can be drawn. If definitely established, this could imply that alpha-blockers should be considered for their effects not only on BPH (the underlying disease) but also on the target organ, the bladder. Early treatment might have a protective effect on the bladder, while chronic treatment could prevent hypertrophic bladder modification.
