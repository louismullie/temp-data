## Question

LDL goals for comorbiditirs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about LDL cholesterol goals in patients with comorbidities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how major guidelines categorize cardiovascular risk and whether they endorse LDL-C targets or thresholds. Then, I should verify the specific LDL-C goals for very high-risk, high-risk, and moderate-risk patients, including those with diabetes, CKD, and established ASCVD. Next, I will examine the "lower for longer" principle and the role of percentage LDL-C reduction from baseline. After that, I need to check special populations and discordant lipid phenotypes where non–HDL-C or apoB may be preferred. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, comorbidity-aware approach and note controversies and implementation gaps, ensuring I anchor each point to current guidelines and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle: contemporary guidelines converge on a risk-based strategy rather than a one-size-fits-all LDL-C target, with the strength of evidence supporting progressively lower LDL-C as risk rises. I should double-check that both European and U.S. guidance align here, and yes, ESC/EAS and ACC/AHA both emphasize risk stratification and the concept that absolute risk reduction tracks with LDL-C lowering, supporting more aggressive goals in higher-risk patients [^79e4595d] [^cd9c83fa] [^ba41b1c7].

> Next, I should review the very high-risk category and its LDL-C goals. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — ESC/EAS 2019 explicitly recommends an LDL-C goal of less than 55 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction from baseline for very high-risk patients, and even suggests considering less than 40 mg/dL in those with recurrent events within 2 years. I need to ensure I'm citing the correct sections, and yes, those are the exact recommendations, which apply to clinical ASCVD, diabetes with end-organ damage, and other high-risk conditions [^79e4595d] [^083cef36]. The National Lipid Association similarly endorses less than 70 mg/dL for very high risk, and recent NLA guidance highlights that benefit continues down to very low LDL-C levels, reinforcing the "lower for longer" paradigm [^ec0d40e1] [^9e9c1967].

> For high-risk patients, I should confirm the targets. ESC/EAS recommends less than 70 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction from baseline, which fits patients with markedly elevated LDL-C, diabetes with additional risk factors, or CKD stages 3B–4. Wait, let me verify the CKD language — yes, CKD 3B–4 is considered high risk in NLA schema, aligning with this goal [^ce171f27] [^cf564187]. The ACC/AHA framework uses a threshold of 70 mg/dL to consider adding nonstatin therapy on top of maximally tolerated statins in very high-risk ASCVD, which operationalizes a threshold approach while still reflecting aggressive LDL-C lowering in practice [^5b9aa8cf].

> For moderate-risk patients, I need to check the more conservative goals. ESC/EAS suggests less than 100 mg/dL, and NLA likewise uses less than 100 mg/dL for LDL-C in moderate risk, typically those with two or more major risk factors without features placing them in higher-risk strata. I should confirm that this applies to both primary and secondary prevention contexts within that risk tier, and yes, that's correct [^6082eeb8] [^d3b8f11e].

> Now, diabetes deserves special attention. I should confirm that ADA 2025 recommends high-intensity statins with a 50% LDL-C reduction and a goal of less than 70 mg/dL for adults aged 40–75 with diabetes and at least one additional ASCVD risk factor, which it does. Hold on, I should verify whether this aligns with endocrine guidance — yes, the Endocrine Society also supports less than 70 mg/dL in type 2 diabetes with other cardiovascular risk factors, reflecting the high-risk phenotype of diabetes even in primary prevention settings [^d1d640d7] [^7d0e6f47]. But wait, what if the patient is very high risk with diabetes and end-organ damage? In that case, the ESC/EAS less-than-55 mg/dL goal and 50% reduction apply, which is more aggressive than the ADA's less-than-70 mg/dL language, so I should tailor to the comorbidity burden and patient preference [^79e4595d].

> Chronic kidney disease is another key comorbidity. I should confirm that CKD stages 3B–4 are considered high risk by NLA, supporting an LDL-C goal of less than 100 mg/dL, while acknowledging that stage 5 CKD has not had defined LDL-C goals due to inconsistent trial benefit. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought stage 5 CKD might share the same goals, but I should correct that — NLA notes undefined goals in stage 5, so decisions there are individualized and often prioritize statin safety and patient-specific factors [^cf564187] [^6a631163].

> I will now examine the principle of percentage reduction from baseline. Both ESC/EAS and ACC/AHA emphasize that achieving at least a 50% LDL-C reduction in very high-risk patients yields substantial absolute risk reduction, and this percentage reduction is a co-primary target alongside absolute LDL-C levels. I should double-check that this applies even when baseline LDL-C is already modest, and yes, the benefit is proportional to the absolute LDL-C reduction, supporting intensification even when starting low [^79e4595d] [^5b9aa8cf].

> Next, I should review secondary targets and discordance. In patients with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or hypertriglyceridemia, non–HDL-C and apoB better capture atherogenic particle burden. NLA recommends considering non–HDL-C less than 100 mg/dL in very high risk and less than 130 mg/dL in moderate risk, and to use apoB when available, especially if LDL-C and non–HDL-C are discordant. Hold on, I should verify the apoB thresholds — while exact numeric goals vary, the principle is to align with non–HDL-C targets and the patient's risk category, which is consistent with NLA guidance [^ec0d40e1] [^7e40909f].

> Let me consider special populations briefly. Familial hypercholesterolemia is treated as very high risk when ASCVD is present, with the same less-than-55 mg/dL and 50% reduction goals, and combination therapy is often needed. I should confirm that ESC/EAS explicitly addresses FH with ASCVD, which it does, reinforcing aggressive LDL-C lowering in this group [^6787558c]. For older adults, I need to ensure shared decision-making is emphasized, as guidelines increasingly focus on functional status, comorbidities, and patient preferences rather than rigid age cutoffs, which is reflected in both endocrine and cardiology guidance [^a50a6806].

> I should now synthesize a practical approach. First, classify risk using the major frameworks, then set the LDL-C goal and percentage reduction accordingly: very high risk targets less than 55 mg/dL with at least 50% reduction, high risk targets less than 70 mg/dL with at least 50% reduction, and moderate risk targets less than 100 mg/dL. Second, choose therapy intensity — high-intensity statin first line in very high risk, with rapid addition of ezetimibe and then a PCSK9 inhibitor if goals are not met. Third, monitor a lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiation or changes, then every 3–12 months to assess adherence and response. Fourth, incorporate non–HDL-C or apoB when discordant or in high triglyceride states. Finally, address adherence barriers proactively, as under-treatment and nonadherence are major reasons for failure to reach goals [^79e4595d] [^5b9aa8cf] [^a7202527] [^d8d19447].

> But wait, what about controversies and implementation gaps? Some U.S. perspectives remain cautious about hard numeric targets, favoring thresholds and percentage reductions, whereas European guidance embraces explicit goals. I should acknowledge that both approaches aim for the same clinical endpoint — lower LDL-C in higher-risk patients — and that reconciling these differences comes down to local practice patterns, payer constraints, and clinician judgment [^ba41b1c7] [^5b9aa8cf]. Real-world data show persistent under-attainment of LDL-C goals, especially in diabetes and other high-risk comorbidities, underscoring the need for systematic follow-up, combination therapy, and adherence support to close the gap [^200edf79] [^d8d19447].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is clear: in patients with comorbidities that elevate ASCVD risk, LDL-C goals are more aggressive, with very high-risk patients targeting less than 55 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction, high-risk patients targeting less than 70 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction, and moderate-risk patients targeting less than 100 mg/dL, all within a risk-based, "lower for longer" framework that prioritizes early identification, combination therapy when needed, and sustained monitoring to maintain on-treatment LDL-C at the lowest safely achievable level for that patient's risk profile [^79e4595d] [^ce171f27] [^9e9c1967].

LDL-C goals vary by comorbidity and cardiovascular risk: **< 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) with ≥ 50% reduction** for very high-risk patients (e.g. ASCVD, recent ACS, diabetes with end-organ damage) [^79e4595d] [^083cef36]; **< 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) with ≥ 50% reduction** for high-risk patients (e.g. diabetes with multiple risk factors, severe hypercholesterolemia, CKD stage 3–4) [^ce171f27] [^d3b8f11e]; and **< 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L)** for moderate-risk patients (e.g. diabetes without additional risk factors, multiple risk factors without ASCVD) [^6082eeb8] [^d3b8f11e]. For low-risk patients, aim for **< 116 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L)** [^cace242b]. These targets are supported by major guidelines and should be individualized to tolerance, adherence, and comorbidities [^79e4595d] [^cd9c83fa].

## LDL-C goals by comorbidity and risk category

| **Risk category** | **Comorbidities/examples** | **Ldl-c goal** | **Percentage reduction** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Very high risk | - ASCVD <br/> - Recent ACS <br/> - Diabetes with end-organ damage <br/> - Familial hypercholesterolemia with ASCVD | < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) | ≥ 50% |
| High risk | - Diabetes with multiple risk factors <br/> - Severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL) <br/> - CKD stage 3–4 | < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) | ≥ 50% |
| Moderate risk | - Diabetes without additional risk factors <br/> - Multiple risk factors without ASCVD | < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) | ≥ 30% |
| Low risk | - No significant risk factors | < 116 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) | ≥ 30% |

## Rationale for LDL-C goals in comorbidities

- **ASCVD and recent ACS**: Lower LDL-C reduces recurrent events and progression of atherosclerosis; < 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction is recommended [^79e4595d] [^083cef36].
- **Diabetes mellitus**: High cardiovascular risk warrants aggressive LDL-C lowering; < 70 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction for high-risk diabetes [^d1d640d7] [^7d0e6f47].
- **Chronic kidney disease**: Elevated cardiovascular risk supports < 70 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction in stages 3–4 [^notfound].
- **Familial hypercholesterolemia**: Lifelong high LDL-C mandates early, aggressive lowering; < 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction if ASCVD is present [^6787558c].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting LDL-C goals

- **IMPROVE-IT**: Simvastatin plus ezetimibe to ~53 mg/dL reduced cardiovascular events more than simvastatin alone [^notfound].
- **FOURIER and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES**: PCSK9 inhibitors achieving very low LDL-C reduced cardiovascular events without excess adverse effects [^notfound].
- **Meta-analyses**: Lower achieved LDL-C correlates with fewer cardiovascular events down to very low levels [^2c877207].

---

## Challenges in achieving LDL-C goals

- **Adherence**: Nonadherence and intolerance limit goal attainment [^d8d19447].
- **Therapy access**: Cost and coverage barriers restrict use of high-intensity statins and PCSK9 inhibitors [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Infrequent lipid checks delay intensification [^notfound].

---

## Individualized patient care

Treatment should be **tailored to patient-specific factors**, including age, comorbidities, tolerance, and preferences. Shared decision-making improves adherence and outcomes [^5ac5af12].

---

LDL-C goals are **risk-stratified**: < 55 mg/dL for very high risk, < 70 mg/dL for high risk, and < 100 mg/dL for moderate risk, with percentage reductions of ≥ 50% in very high/high risk and ≥ 30% in moderate/low risk. These targets are supported by robust evidence and should be applied within individualized, patient-centered care.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^2261d16c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

Plasma lipid recommendations

Seventeen of the guidelines provided at least one target, with all except one of these providing an LDL cholesterol goal. Target values ranged between 1.0 and 2.6 mmol/L, although the most frequently recommended was <1.8 mmol/L (n=12). Many guidelines additionally suggested that a 50% reduction in LDL could be used as an alternative where this target may be unattainable or for patients whose baseline values were already <3.5 mmol/L (n=7). A non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol target was also common (n=8), with target values ranging from 2.5 to 3.4 mmol/L, with 2.6 mmol/L the most frequent (n=5). These targets were usually given in combination with a target for LDL cholesterol, though in the case of the Japan Atherosclerosis Society, the non-HDL target was considered only relevant when a patient’s triglycerides were elevated. Meanwhile, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence did not provide a numerical target for non-HDL, recommending a 40% reduction from the patient’s baseline only. Only two guidelines referred to other lipid parameters in their recommendations. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCSG) provided an apolipoprotein B target as an alternative for LDL, and the International Diabetes Federation provided additional targets for triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. There were no apparent differences in recommendations for stroke or diabetes-specific guidelines, although some guidelines for all secondary prevention populations provided different targets for those patients with additional comorbidities (n=2), or specific cardiovascular events (n=2).

### Counterpoint: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^0f3dcf67]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### New cardiovascular prevention guidelines: how to optimally manage dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular risk in 2021 in patients needing secondary prevention? [^c430c24b]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a principally modifiable cause of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; accordingly, recent European and US multisociety dyslipidaemia guidelines emphasise the importance of lowering LDL-C to reduce cardiovascular risk. This review provides perspectives on established and emerging agents that reduce LDL-C to help providers synthesize the abundance of new evidence related to prevention of cardiovascular disease. We provide hypothetical cases of patients with different cardiovascular risk factors and medical histories to illustrate application of current lipid-lowering guidelines in various clinical settings. As a core focus of preventive therapy, both European and US lipid management guidelines emphasise the importance of identifying patients at very high cardiovascular risk and treating to achieve LDL-C levels as low as possible, with European guidelines setting a goal of <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL) in patients with very high-risk cardiovascular disease. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are now included in the guidelines and may fulfil an important unmet need for very high-risk patients who are not able to achieve LDL-C goals with conventional agents. The recently approved bempedoic acid and other promising agents under development will add to the armamentarium of lipid-lowering drugs available for clinicians to help patients meet their treatment goals.

### LDL cholesterol: how low to go? [^e0e60a62]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and the results of large-scale outcome trials indicate that the association of LDL with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is causal, and continuous not only across levels seen in the general population but also down to sub-physiological values. There is no scientific basis, therefore, to set a target or 'floor' for LDL cholesterol lowering, and this presents a clinical and conceptual dilemma for prescribers, patients, and payers. With the advent of powerful agents such as proprotein convertase/subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, LDL cholesterol can be lowered profoundly but health economic constraints mandate that this therapeutic approach needs to be selective. Based on the need to maximize the absolute risk reduction when prescribing combination lipid-lowering therapy, it is appropriate to prioritize patients with the highest risk (aggressive and established CVD) who will obtain the highest benefit, that is, those with elevated LDL cholesterol on optimized statin therapy.

### Identifying patients for aggressive cholesterol lowering: the risk curve concept [^c29bc656]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The National Cholesterol Education Program's 2004 report identified more aggressive optional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol treatment goals of <70 mg/dl for secondary prevention patients and <100 mg/dl for moderately high risk, primary prevention patients. Although LDL cholesterol reduction is the first step in reducing cardiovascular risk, it may be difficult for clinicians to visualize the risk reduction benefit for patients from various risk interventions. The concept of a "risk curve," or the absolute risk of a patient for subsequent cardiovascular events over a range of LDL cholesterol values, is proposed. In conclusion, placing a patient on the appropriate risk curve may facilitate an individualized clinical management strategy that takes into account the patient's absolute benefit from further LDL cholesterol reduction as well as from shifting the risk curve downward through non-LDL cholesterol interventions.

### Rationale for targeting multiple lipid pathways for optimal cardiovascular risk reduction [^33b347dd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of statin therapy have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in coronary artery disease (CAD) events, yet statin-treated patients remain at risk for CAD despite substantial reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Recent evidence from clinical trials supports reduction of LDL cholesterol to lower targets, and the updated treatment guidelines include optional, more aggressive LDL cholesterol goals for patients at very high and moderately high risk. Achievement of these lower goals will require enhanced treatment strategies. Targeting multiple lipid pathways can provide greater reductions in LDL cholesterol as well as improvements in other lipid parameters. Clinical trials are needed to determine which treatment strategies provide optimal cardiovascular risk reduction.

Objective

To review clinical trials driving the evolution of hyperlipidemic guidelines, discuss whether low-density lipoprotein (LDL) targets and adjunctive therapy on top of statins should be used, and summarize the pharmacist's role in helping achieve LDL goals.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search (1/1980-5/2017) using terms including LDL, lipid, and statin, with forward and backward citation tracking.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language studies and guidelines assessing LDL-lowering therapy were included.

Data Synthesis

In 2013, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) hyperlipidemic guideline stepped back from LDL goals opting for statin monotherapy with an intensity of dosing predicated on baseline risk. This was driven by abundant clinical trial evidence for the statins, with adjunctive therapy on top of statins failing to show substantial benefit. However, recent evidence suggests that returning to LDL goals is warranted and adjuvant ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor therapy may further reduce cardiovascular events. This is reflected in some society guidelines but not from the AHA/ACC. Pharmacists are well positioned to help achieve LDL goals, as they have positively affected LDL goal attainment across a multitude of settings.

Conclusions

Statins are the mainstay of therapy but patients should have LDL targets, and if patients on maximally tolerated statin doses are not at goal, adjunctive therapy with ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors may improve outcomes. In the emerging LDL goal paradigm, the pharmacist has a critical role to play.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^38122881]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, preventing ASCVD requires a coordinated response across primary and secondary care to diagnose and manage patients according to their risk profile. As the major modifiable causal factor for atherosclerosis, lowering LDL-C is the primary target and appropriate modification of dietary and lifestyle risk factors is the starting point. The updated 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines recommend a move towards intensive lowering of LDL-C, which is warranted on scientific grounds and achievable in clinical practice. Implementation strategies are needed to apply current knowledge, guidelines and clinical judgement to the benefit of those at highest risk.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^d3b8f11e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association—ASCVD risk categories and atherogenic cholesterol targets are organized as follows: For low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors), treatment goals are Non–HDL-C <130 mg/dL and LDL-C <100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥190 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL; for moderate risk (≥ 2 major ASCVD risk factors), goals are Non–HDL-C <130 mg/dL and LDL-C <100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥160 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL; for high risk (criteria include ≥3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL; or quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold), goals are Non–HDL-C <130 mg/dL and LDL-C <100 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥130 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL; for very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage), goals are Non–HDL-C <100 mg/dL and LDL-C <70 mg/dL, and consider drug therapy at Non–HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

In some high-risk patients, drug therapy may be started concurrently with lifestyle therapy. The non–HDL-C goal is <130 mg/dL and the LDL-C goal is <100 mg/dL.

### Lipid-lowering therapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk: dose or combination? [^2f60983a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Dyslipidemia, manifested by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is central to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Dyslipidemia has become a primary target of intervention in strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as increased physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and adoption of a healthier diet, are effectively reducing cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention. The combination therapy lowered LDL-C levels and achieved the LDL-C target in patients with high cardiovascular risk.

### 2013 ACC / AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^73010106]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

1 INTRODUCTION

Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a leading cause of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in the United States.Recent cholesterol management guidelines targeting dyslipidemia have set progressively lower target threshold levels to achieve a reduction in the risk of ASCVD or associated clinical events.,The 2018 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines on cholesterol management recommend using statins at maximally tolerated doses to achieve ≥ 50% lower low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels in patients with clinical ASCVD.Similarly, the National Lipid Association recommends an LDL‐C goal of <70 mg/dl for patients with ASCVD.In contrast, the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines include a ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction, and additional recommendation of an LDL‐C goal of <55 mg/dl for all patients with ASCVD.

Despite the evolution to increasingly strict lipid guideline recommendations, many potentially treatable patients remain untreated, are inadequately treated, or are non‐adherent to medication, with the consequence of suboptimal LDL‐C levels.Indeed, patterns of poor lipid‐lowering therapy (LLT) implementation have been documented in observational studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011–2012, which found that up to 80% of patients with ASCVD who were statin‐eligible did not achieve their recommended LDL‐C goal of <70 mg/dl.Additionally, high rates of statin discontinuation have been reported in previous studies, including a cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for myocardial infarction (MI), showing that 15.4% of beneficiaries discontinued statins in the 6 months following hospital discharge.

Multifactorial contributors to not achieving LDL‐C goals often include both patient and physician factors. One major contributor among eligible patients with ASCVD is patient nonadherence to LLT, with key drivers that include socioeconomic factors, limited access to healthcare, treatment side effects, and the presence of comorbidities.These factors may affect patient adherence to LLT at different timepoints, with cost, healthcare disparities, or access to healthcare being likely associated with early nonadherence, and treatment side effects and polypharmacy contributing to later nonadherence.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^54620948]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

In assessing progress towards goals, it should be noted that laboratory measurement of LDL-C at very low levels can present challenges especially when lipoprotein (a) or plasma triglyceride levels are elevated.In this context, secondary goals relating to non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B can be useful when judging whether to prescribe add-on therapy.

Figure 4 summarises the types of conditions that would lead to intensification of LDL-C-lowering therapy, that is, combination of statins with ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitors. Identification of an individual with elevated risk of ASCVD, based on risk factor screening and evaluation of their SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Estimation),or the presence of disorders that predispose to the development of ASCVD, such as type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease, would place them in the ‘high risk’ category with goals of LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L and at least a 50% reduction from baseline. Among individuals with established ASCVD (on imaging or clinical presentation) and comorbidities (chronic kidney disease or history of diabetes with organ damage, proteinuria, hypertension), vascular imaging can aid in judging the most appropriate LDL-C goal. Where it is clear that a patient has atherosclerotic disease that is following an aggressive course, as indicated by serial events within 2 years, a goal of <1.0 mmol/L is warranted.

### Lipids and CVD management: towards a global consensus [^f65a5e3d]. European Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and its incidence is likely to increase. Multiple risk factors contribute to CVD. Elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels, low HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and smoking are key modifiable risk factors. Such risk factors are present in 80-90% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. For many factors, modification can significantly reduce CVD incidence. For example, statin-induced LDL-C reductions reduce cardiovascular events by 24-37% and smoking cessation reduces CHD mortality by 36%. The need to identify and treat these risk factors has led many national and local groups to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of CVD. Although the aim of such guidelines is to provide practitioners with a framework to identify, prioritize, and manage patients, the plethora of guidelines can cause confusion. In addition, research indicates that guidelines are not being optimally implemented. This review considers these practical issues, highlights the common goals shared by many guidelines, and focuses on how these can be best achieved. It also highlights areas where the guidelines differ and discusses points to consider when selecting the most appropriate recommendation.

### The evolution of European guidelines: changing the management of cholesterol levels [^c6e1a4cf]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Europe and the US. This paper reviews the evolution of the Joint European Societies' guidelines with respect to their lipid recommendations. We stress the importance of lowering lipid levels to, or below, the currently recommended goals and argue that patients' global risk for CVD, rather than baseline lipid levels, should direct the intensity of lipid-lowering treatment. However, the emphasis on near-term (i.e., in the next 10 years) global risk estimation may under-emphasize the importance of considering lifetime cardiovascular risk in treatment decisions. Although various guidelines' thresholds for treatment initiation and recommended goals differ, they are similar in the theme of treating global risk. Most clinical trials have not identified a threshold of cholesterol level beyond which lowering cholesterol levels no longer provides cardiovascular benefit. An urgent call for action is needed to improve goal attainment in patients with or at risk for CVD. Improving access to risk-reducing treatments should be a priority.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^71f4a962]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Desirable LDL-C targets for adults: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management should be individualized, and evidence supports an LDL-C target of <100 mg/dL for healthy adults in the general population; individuals at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including those with very high baseline LDL-C suggestive of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), multiple risk factors, or established ASCVD, may require lower LDL-C levels, and higher plaque burden or progression are situations where more intensive LDL-C lowering therapy should be considered.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^ade5b042]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

ASCVD moderate-risk category—criteria and lipid goals: Patients with 2 major ASCVD risk factors, without conditions placing them into the high- or very high–risk categories, are at moderate risk; consideration should be given to drug therapy in those with values at least 30 mg/dL above goal levels after initiation of lifestyle therapy. For moderate risk, the non–HDL-C goal is <130 mg/dL and the LDL-C goal is <100 mg/dL.

### Dyslipidemia in primary care – prevalence, recognition, treatment and control: data from the German metabolic and cardiovascular risk project (GEMCAS) [^7057a567]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2008). Low credibility.

The European guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice for example recommends a TC of below 190 mg/dl (5.0 mmol/l) and an LDL-C of below 115 mg/dl (3.0 mmol/l) for the general population. When additional comorbidity is present (coronary artery disease (CAD), other cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes mellitus) the goals are even lower: < 175 mg/dl (4.5 mmol/l) for TC and < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) for LDL-C.

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines chose another approach to define LDL-C targets based on the presence of additional risk factors: For patients with maximum 1 risk factor LDL-C levels of < 160 mg/dl (4.1 mmol/l) are targeted. Patients with 2 or more risk factors or a 10-year risk for CAD (myocardial infarction or CAD death) of less than 20% LDL-C levels < 130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/l) are targeted. If patients already show CAD or CAD risk equivalent (other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease, diabetes mellitus, or a 10 year-risk for CAD greater than 20%) an LDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) is recommended which is identical to the European guideline. The NCEP coordination committee, encouraged by the results of major statin trials, even recommended a goal for LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l) in patients at very high risk, at least as a therapeutic option.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^5ac5af12]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

ASCVD remains the #1 cause of death in the United States and has been on the rise for more than a decade after more than 40 years of steady decline. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a well-established causal factor for the development of ASCVD that should be monitored in a timely manner and may be modified through both lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Despite the existence of cholesterol guidelines, universal screening ages, risk assessment tools, and recommendations for LDL-C management based on risk, data show that LDL-C measurement and management in patients with ASCVD are not meeting guideline-directed objectives. Further, there is no single clinical guideline that presents LDL-C measurement frequency, risk assessment, management, and desirable LDL-C levels for adults based on risk.

Objective

This document aims to summarize the numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C.

Methods

Guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other relevant professional organizations were systematically reviewed. Key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application.

Results

The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations across major guidelines emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and the use of shared decision-making to improve adherence. The resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care.

Conclusion

Integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding. This approach supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances the implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The primary goals for LDL-C management are to achieve an acceptable level for the patient's risk category and to maintain that over time because lower for longer is better to reduce ASCVD risk.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^36dffbdb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large, European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults >40 years of age.The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events.Also, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered.A summary of the risk categories and recommendations for LDL‐C lowering in both the ACC/AHA/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines is provided in Table 1.

Table 1 
Classification of ASCVD Risk and LDL‐C Thresholds Defined by US and European Guidelines

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events; however, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at “very high risk.”,In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥70 mg/dL.The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions in the absence of ASCVD. A more aggressive approach to lipid lowering is advocated. Add‐on nonstatin therapies are recommended if a target reduction of ≥50% in LDL‐C values from baseline and a treatment goal of <55 mg/dL are not achieved.

### Effect of 2013 ACC / AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^b5725569]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the “2013 guidelines” or simply “guidelines”), LDL‐C goals were <4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, <3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with 2 or more risk factors, and <2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. 4 The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a “treating to goal” approach with respect to LDL‐C 1 and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk. The 4 statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are (1) patients with clinical ASCVD, (2) adult patients with LDL‐C ≥4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), (3) patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL), and (4) patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥7.5% and LDL‐C levels 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention). 1 With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate‐ or high‐intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10‐year ASCVD risk and engage in patient‐clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. 5 In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess achievement of a particular LDL‐C goal, but instead recommend monitoring LDL‐C to determine adherence and anticipated therapeutic response.

### Review of clinical practice guidelines for the management of LDL-related risk [^5bef850b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Managing risk related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is vital in therapy for patients at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events given its important etiologic role in atherogenesis. Despite decades of research showing reduction of ASCVD risk with multiple approaches to lowering of LDL cholesterol, there continue to be significant gaps in care with inadequate numbers of patients receiving standard of care lipid-lowering therapy. Confusion regarding implementation of the multiple published clinical practice guidelines has been identified as one contributor to suboptimal management of LDL-related risk. This review summarizes the current guidelines for reduction of LDL-related cardiovascular risk provided by a number of major professional societies, which have broad applicability to diverse populations worldwide. Statements have varied in the process and methodology of development of recommendations, the grading system for level and strength of evidence, the inclusion or exclusion of expert opinion, the suggested ASCVD risk assessment tool, the lipoproteins recommended for risk assessment, and the lipoprotein targets of therapy. The similarities and differences among important guidelines in the United States and internationally are discussed, with recommendations for future strategies to improve consistency in approaches to LDL-related ASCVD risk and to reduce gaps in implementation of evidence-based therapies.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^20499151]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association (NLA) Expert Panel scope—Part 1 and planned Part 2 covers screening and classification of lipoprotein lipid levels in adults (>20 years), targets for intervention in dyslipidemia management, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment and treatment goals based on risk category, atherogenic cholesterol—non–high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C)—as the primary targets of therapy, and lifestyle and drug therapies intended to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with dyslipidemia; Part 2 is in development and will cover lifestyle therapies, groups with special considerations (children and adolescents; gender, including pregnancy; ethnic groups; older patients; patients with human immunodeficiency virus; patients with selected chronic inflammatory states; patients with residual risk despite statin therapy), strategies to assist with patient adherence, and team-based collaborative care; the panel graded the type and strength of the evidence using a hybrid of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Evidence-Based Methodology Lead rating system and adapted from the original GRADE system of evidence rating.

### How low is safe? The frontier of very low ( [^2c877207]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a proven causative factor for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Individuals with genetic conditions associated with lifelong very low LDL-C levels can be healthy. We now possess the pharmacological armamentarium (statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) to reduce LDL-C to an unprecedented extent. Increasing numbers of patients are expected to achieve very low (<30 mg/dL) LDL-C. Cardiovascular event reduction increases log linearly in association with lowering LDL-C, without reaching any clear plateau even when very low LDL-C levels are achieved. It is still controversial whether lower LDL-C levels are associated with significant clinical adverse effects (e.g. new-onset diabetes mellitus or possibly haemorrhagic stroke) and long-term data are needed to address safety concerns. This review presents the familial conditions characterized by very low LDL-C, analyses trials with lipid-lowering agents where patients attained very low LDL-C, and summarizes the benefits and potential adverse effects associated with achieving very low LDL-C. Given the potential for cardiovascular benefit and short-term safe profile of very low LDL-C, it may be advantageous to attain such low levels in specific high-risk populations. Further studies are needed to compare the net clinical benefit of non-LDL-C-lowering interventions with very low LDL-C approaches, in addition to comparing the efficacy and safety of very low LDL-C levels vs. current recommended targets.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^d5729803]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

NLA Part 1 recommendations—ASCVD risk categories define atherogenic cholesterol goals and thresholds to consider drug therapy as follows: Low risk (0–1 major ASCVD risk factors; consider other risk indicators) targets Non–HDL-C <130 and LDL-C <100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥190 or LDL-C ≥160. Moderate risk (≥2 major ASCVD risk factors; consider quantitative risk scoring and other risk indicators) keeps goals <130 and <100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥160 or LDL-C ≥130. High risk (≥3 major ASCVD risk factors; diabetes mellitus [type 1 or 2]; CKD stage 3B or 4; LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL; or a quantitative risk score reaching the high-risk threshold) keeps goals <130 and <100, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥130 or LDL-C ≥100. Very high risk (ASCVD; diabetes mellitus with ≥2 other major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage) sets goals Non–HDL-C <100 and LDL-C <70, with therapy considered at Non–HDL-C ≥100 or LDL-C ≥70. For patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, consideration should be given to use of moderate or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^901a66c9]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

ASCVD risk assessment and treatment goals—ASCVD risk has been classified into 4 categories, and the NLA Expert Panel recommends consideration of the use of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, irrespective of baseline atherogenic cholesterol levels, for patients with ASCVD or diabetes mellitus, based on RCT results that demonstrate a benefit in these patients at all levels of baseline lipids. Lifestyle therapies should be emphasized and monitored in all patients with elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, whether or not pharmacotherapy for dyslipidemia management is used. Risk assessment will often proceed according to the following steps: Step 1—identify high- and very high–risk conditions, if present, including Clinical ASCVD and Diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2) with ≥2 major ASCVD risk factors or evidence of end-organ damage (estimated glomerular filtration rate, <60 mL/min/1.73 m^2), and high risk conditions such as LDL-C of ≥190 mg/dL (severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype) or Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus with 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

### Lipid disorders: justification of methods and goals of treatment [^4ec5ed1c]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). While some uncertainty exists about the clinical significance of improving high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, large primary- and secondary-prevention studies aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with statins have convincingly reduced CHD events and total mortality. Despite the strong clinical evidence and widely publicized treatment guidelines, many hyperlipidemic patients receive inadequate lipid-lowering treatment. This failure to achieve clinical treatment goals may be due to poor physician adherence to treatment guidelines, patient noncompliance, and the presence of concomitant medical conditions that modify typical hyperlipidemia management. This review considers the challenges and available strategies to optimize lipid management in patients at risk for CHD.

### Statin treatment and LDL-cholesterol treatment goal attainment among individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia in primary care [^35c61cad]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of individuals by LDL treatment goal attainment at 12 months

Table 2 shows the baseline and lipid-lowering treatment characteristics of individuals, by LDL treatment goal attainment at 12 months. Compared with individuals who did not attain the LDL-C treatment goal of 50% or greater, a significantly higher proportion of those who attained the goal was women. Individuals who attained the treatment goal were of older age at time of FH diagnosis (53.4 years vs 49.7 years) and at time of first statin treatment (53.2 years vs 49.2 years), and they had significantly higher mean pretreatment total cholesterol (8.20 (SD 1.38) mmol/L vs 7.57 (SD 1.39) mmol/L) and pretreatment LDL-C (5.83 (SD 1.36) mmol/L vs 5.25 (SD 1.40) mmol/L) than those who did not attain the treatment goal. Overall, the proportion of individuals treated with low-intensity and medium-intensity statins reduced, while the proportion of prescribed with high-intensity statins increased from baseline to 12 months. Significantly more people who attained the LDL-C treatment goal were treated with medium-intensity and high-intensity statins than those who did not attain the treatment goal, at baseline (71.7% and 24.3% vs 69.3% and 20.2%, respectively), 6 months (54.2% and 33.3% vs 50.1% and 21.9%, respectively) and 12 months (47.6% and 33.6% vs 36.8% and 21.9%, respectively) after statin initiation (table 2 and figure 1). Compared with individuals who attained the treatment goal, significantly higher proportions of those who did not attain the treatment goal were smokers at the time of their first statin treatment (31.0% vs 26.0%). There were no significant differences in ethnicity, mean pretreatment triglycerides, alcohol consumption and prevalence of comorbidities such as atrial fibrillation, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity and physical activity levels between those who attained a ≥50% LDL-C target and those who did not. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease was higher in those who attained the treatment goal compared with those who did not (2.1% vs 1.0%), and more people who attained the treatment goal were on antipsychotics and corticosteroids than in those who did attain the treatment goal.

### Pushing the limits of LDL cholesterol: emerging paradigms in cardiovascular risk reduction [^13b1905b]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) has long been recognized as a primary contributor to cardiovascular disease. Over time, guideline-recommended LDL-C targets have varied considerably, trending toward progressively more aggressive therapeutic goals. The focus on residual risk reduction and development of novel therapies-including PCSK9 inhibitors, siRNA-based treatments, and ANGPTL3 inhibitors-have significantly expanded the options for achieving unprecedentedly low LDL-C levels. Given the fundamental role of cholesterol in cellular function, it has been long been postulated that very low cholesterol could be associated with adverse events. In this review, we dissect the benefits and potential risks of very low LDL-C levels. We begin by providing an overview of the evolution of LDL-C targets in previous guidelines and highlighting therapies-including newer agents-used for aggressive LDL-C lowering. Drawing on clinical and genetic evidence, we then examine the benefits and risks associated with achieving very low LDL-C levels. Finally, we present a practical framework for balancing the potential risks and benefits of intensive LDL-C reduction in patient care.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^91e771b9]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

All clinicians attest to the fact that guidelines, although helpful, do not match day-to-day practice. Many patients do not fit neatly into the categorised recommendations, and judgement must be made on the most prudent course of action. The recently updated guidelines for management of dyslipidaemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) present a further challenge since they recommend aggressive goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering: <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) for patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); <1.4 mmol/L (<55 mg/dL) for patients at very high risk or with clinically evident ASCVD; and <1.0 mmol/L (<40 mg/dL) for very high-risk patients who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years.The ESC/EAS approach of recommending these very low goals for LDL-C is in distinction to the recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines where a threshold of 70 mg/dL was identified as a level at which addition of non-statin to maximally tolerated statin therapy could be considered, but no lower goal was set.The European guideline writers believe that the science is strong enough to state that ‘no level of LDL-C below which benefit ceases or harm occurs has been defined’.This approach prompts a number of questions—how do we translate this into clinical practice? Should it be applied universally or selectively? This review briefly lays out the evidence that led the writers to recommend the most aggressive goals yet for LDL-C lowering, and explores a case-based interpretation of the practicality of intensive LDL-C lowering.

### Improving statin treatment strategies to reduce LDL-cholesterol: factors associated with targets' attainment in subjects with and without type 2 diabetes [^200edf79]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In these patients, dyslipidemia is a major cardiovascular risk factor. As such, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the best therapy for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) reduction. Several trials have shown significant CV risk reduction through LDLc lowering in patients with diabetes, supporting its causal role in atherogenesis, as also demonstrated in genetic studies. Statin therapy is considered essential both in primary and secondary prevention of CVD in diabetes. Trials have shown that statin therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not already have manifest coronary heart disease or high cholesterol concentrations. In the Health Protection Study (HPS), allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in the diabetic patients included in that study. Key observations provide evidence that, in patients with type 2 diabetes, the benefit of statin therapy confers protection at considerably low LDLc levels of less than 1.8 mmol/l (< 70 mg/dl). Additional trials and metanalyses have highlighted a benefit by further reducing LDL cholesterol down to 55 mg/dl. This concept has been incorporated in most of the recent guidelines, which now recommend the initiation of statin treatment on the LDL cholesterol target levels and the CV risk profile of the patient. Most of the patients referring to diabetes clinics suffer from type 2 diabetes and have an average duration of the disease > 10 years, at least 90% have high blood pressure. More than 60% are on statin treatment : therefore, according to the 2019 ESC/EASD Guidelines, most of them fall into either high or very high-risk categories for which LDLc levels < 70 mg/dl and 55 mg/dl, respectively, are recommended. With the same class of recommendation and level of evidence, guidelines underscore the importance of LDLc reduction of at least 50%. These more stringent goals make the attainment of LDLc targets among diabetic patients even more problematic. In the PINNACLE registry, patients with comorbidities were less likely to have LDLc at target, particularly those with diabetes. Overall, systematic reviews and national-or multinational surveys indicate that a substantial proportion of patients at high risk are exposed to an unacceptably high concentration of LDLc. Previous studies have highlighted the difficulties to reach lipid targets, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes, although a significant correlation is observed between adherence and plasma LDLc, the probability of goal achievement appears, and lipid management appears far from perfect. Mainly routine care data have shown high off-target prevalence and little change in LDLc over time [,–]. Off-target values are persistent in diabetes mellitus, which is considered an equivalent of CV disease, also in primary prevention.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^af5f5d22]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

National Lipid Association guidance for adult low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management—atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the #1 cause of death in the United States, and LDL-C is described as a causal factor that should be monitored and may be modified through lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. The objective is to summarize numerous guidelines and recommendations from leading professional organizations to help clinicians and patients improve evidence-based measurement and management of LDL-C. Methods systematically reviewed guidelines and updates from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, National Lipid Association, and other organizations, and key recommendations were synthesized and translated into a simplified, patient-centered message for clinical application. The synthesis revealed consistent recommendations emphasizing early identification of risk, aggressive lipid lowering in high-risk populations, and shared decision-making to improve adherence; the resulting simplified message aligns with current evidence and is intended to support clinical teams in delivering consistent, guideline-directed care. The conclusion states that integrating major cardiovascular and lipid management guidelines into a unified, simplified message may improve provider clarity and patient understanding, supports team-based care, reduces variation in practice, and enhances implementation of evidence-based strategies to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

Moderate risk lipid goals and when to consider drug therapy: The goals of therapy for those at moderate risk are non–HDL-C of <130 mg/dL and LDL-C of <100 mg/dL with consideration given to drug therapy in those who will have at least 30 mg/dL above these levels, and the presence of one or more additional risk indicators may prompt consideration of drug therapy when the atherogenic cholesterol level is less than 30 mg/dL above the goal threshold.

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^67391d48]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45-75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70-189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40-75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70-189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a <140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

The current Third Joint European Societies' Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice reflect an active approach to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. These guidelines have shifted the emphasis from coronary heart disease to total atherosclerotic CVD. A new risk prediction system, Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE), has been developed to define risk in terms of absolute 10-year risk of a fatal cardiovascular event. The definition of high risk has also been refined. The currently recommended goals for total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are based on the evidence pool that was available at the time of publication. More recent evidence from the Heart Protection Study (HPS), the lipid-lowering arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT-LLA), and the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) trial indicates that lowering LDL cholesterol levels beyond the currently recommended goals can produce incremental reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Results from the recently completed Treating to New Targets (TNT) study lend further support to implementing lower lipid goals than those currently suggested by guidelines. Results from the ongoing Incremental Decrease in Endpoints through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) trial may provide additional evidence in support of the implementation of lower lipid goals. Nevertheless, the scope of future guidelines extends well beyond lipid targets. Guidelines of the future are likely to provide increasingly comprehensive recommendations on combined risk reduction, to publicize the characteristics of healthy people by highlighting acceptable levels of all cardiovascular risk factors, and to refine the concept of evidence-based medicine by shifting the focus from drug therapy to preventive therapy.

### A look to the future: new treatment guidelines and a perspective on statins [^a65966f8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

New National Cholesterol Education Program treatment guidelines incorporate a global measure of coronary heart disease (CHD) that alters risk categorization in primary prevention by identifying individuals with CHD risk equivalence on the basis of estimated absolute CHD risk. Increasing recognition of the association of on-treatment non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels with risk of CHD events is also reflected in the new guidelines by incorporation of secondary non-HDL cholesterol goals. The increased complexity of the guidelines and the likelihood of more individuals being assigned to higher risk groups with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals is of some concern, because most patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy do not achieve current guideline LDL cholesterol goals. Increased potency of LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs would be of value in enabling more patients to achieve goals.

### Harder-to-treat patients: recognizing them and adapting treatment strategies [^0791e886]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite significant progress in pharmacologic treatment aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, a number of patient groups that often prove difficult to treat remain. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.

### Nonadherence to lipid-lowering therapy and strategies to improve adherence in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^d8d19447]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Despite the availability of effective therapies, a large gap exists between guideline‐recommended LLT and clinical practice, with a high percentage of eligible patients not receiving appropriate treatment and presenting with LDL‐C levels higher than their goal. Closing this gap would be the first step toward improving clinical outcomes in patients with ASCVD. Another major barrier to achieving LDL‐C goals is poor patient adherence to LLT due to multiple contributors including out‐of‐pocket costs, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, side effects, lack of access to healthcare, failure to identify eligible patients, and physician under prescribing and underdosing. There is an inverse correlation between long‐term statin adherence and mortality in patients with ASCVD, suggesting that improving adherence would lead to a significant increase in survival among these patients.

There is a need to implement new strategies to increase the use of LLT in eligible patients and to improve treatment adherence. Initiatives that have shown to be effective in increasing the use of LLT include patient and physician educational programs and algorithms to guide decision‐making, as well as pharmacy‐based programs and routine monitoring. Importantly, the ability of individual patients to access the most effective therapy, including use of non‐statin therapies that require less frequent administration, could help them to reach and maintain guideline‐recommended LDL‐C goals and overcome treatment non‐adherence.

### Frequency of obtaining national cholesterol education program adult treatment panel III goals for all major serum lipoproteins after initiation of lipid altering therapy [^f354c04a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Statin treatment targeting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is widely used for cardiovascular risk reduction, but many statin users still face greatly elevated risks. Some experts advocate additional therapy that targets high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. However, the size of the patient group that could benefit from HDL cholesterol or triglyceride therapy has not been reported. Using observational data from a large health maintenance organization, 5,158 patients were identified who initiated dyslipidemia pharmacotherapy from July 2004 to June 2006, continued therapy for 1 year, and had full lipid panels within 6 months before and 9 to 15 months after therapy initiation. Therapy (primarily statins) reduced the proportion of patients not at LDL cholesterol goals from 77% to 22% and the proportion with high triglyceride levels from 34% to 20%. HDL cholesterol levels were unchanged (49% and 50% were less than normal levels before and after therapy, respectively) in the aggregate and in high-risk subgroups (patients with coronary artery disease, diabetes, and 10-year heart disease risk >20%). After therapy, 29% of high-risk patients still had multiple lipid abnormalities. In conclusion, current dyslipidemia therapy substantially improved LDL cholesterol goal attainment in this cohort, but low HDL cholesterol levels were unaffected. About half the patients starting statins could be candidates for additional therapy targeting non-LDL cholesterol lipid fractions.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1d011761]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk." The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### The importance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement and control as performance measures: a joint clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^4617f9ea]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

What is the impact of LDL-C monitoring and LDL-C control in reducing healthcare disparities in ASCVD?—documented inequities and rationale for performance measurement: Large disparities in CVD treatment have been recognized as major barriers to health equity, despite guidance that therapy should be applied to all patients regardless of race/ethnicity, sex/gender, socioeconomic status, or geography. Contemporary lipid-lowering agents—statins, PCSK9 inhibitors, and ezetimibe—have unequivocal safety and efficacy by sex and race yet are underutilized in women and various racial/ethnic populations as compared with White adults. In the CASCADE-FH registry, women were 40% less likely than men to achieve LDL-C goals and 40% less likely than men to receive any statin, and Asian and Black adults were 40–50% less likely to achieve LDL-C goals; statin undertreatment persists in women, minority adults, and younger patients. Therefore, another important rationale for re-establishing LDL-C as a performance measure is to improve equity in cardiovascular care for historically undertreated populations by identifying those groups for whom treatment initiation, further treatment intensification, or efforts to improve medication adherence are needed.

### Hit or miss: the new cholesterol targets [^0b4ed5c7]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Drug treatment to reduce cholesterol to new target levels is now recommended in four moderate- to high-risk patient populations: patients who have already sustained a cardiovascular event, adult diabetic patients, individuals with low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥190mg/dL and individuals with an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk ≥7.5%. Achieving these cholesterol target levels did not confer any additional benefit in a systematic review of 35 randomised controlled trials. Recommending cholesterol lowering treatment based on estimated cardiovascular risk fails to identify many high-risk patients and may lead to unnecessary treatment of low-risk individuals. The negative results of numerous cholesterol lowering randomised controlled trials call into question the validity of using low density lipoprotein cholesterol as a surrogate target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Conclusions

In summary, a personalized approach, identifying patients at risk of ASCVD earlier in the risk continuum and optimizing the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies in combination with statins, will enable more patients to achieve LDL‐C targets and help to address the current high global burden of ASCVD.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 expert consensus—treatment thresholds and statin efficacy indicators: The writing committee endorsed the evidence-based findings regarding indicators of efficacy, including ≥50% LDL-C reduction for high-intensity statin therapy doses and 30% to 49% reduction for moderate-intensity doses. It judged it appropriate to continue to provide levels of LDL-C or “thresholds,” in terms of both percentage LDL-C reduction from baseline and absolute on-treatment LDL-C measurement, which, if not achieved by adherent patients, would serve as factors to consider in decision-making regarding further therapy. Throughout this guidance, absolute LDL-C levels are considered as “thresholds” for considering the addition of nonstatin therapies, and not LDL-C goals, and these are not firm triggers for adding medication but are factors that may be considered within the broader context of an individual patient’s clinical situation.

High-risk treatment targets and limits of risk equations—risk equations should generally not be used in patients already treated for dyslipidemia and should not be used in individuals with FH because they underestimate risk. The goals of therapy for patients at high risk are non–HDL-C <130 mg/dL and LDL-C <100 mg/dL, with consideration given to drug therapy in those whose atherogenic cholesterol levels are higher than those goal levels, generally after a trial of lifestyle therapy. Drug treatment may be started concurrently with lifestyle therapy in some high-risk patients, such as those unlikely to attain goal atherogenic cholesterol without drug therapy (eg, LDL-C of ≥190 mg/dL) or with diabetes mellitus and 0 to 1 major ASCVD risk factors.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^0547af1b]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) were updated in late 2019 in light of recent intervention trials involving the use of innovative lipid-lowering agents in combination with statins. The new guidelines advocate achieving very low LDL-C levels in individuals at highest risk, within the paradigm of ‘lower is better’. With the advent of combination therapy using ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors in addition to statins, the routine attainment of extremely low LDL-C levels in the clinic has become a reality. Moreover, clinical trials in this setting have shown that, over the 5–7 years of treatment experience to date, profound LDL-C lowering leads to further reduction in cardiovascular events compared with more moderate lipid lowering, with no associated safety concerns. These reassuring findings are bolstered by genetic studies showing lifelong very low LDL-C levels (<1.4 mmol/L; <55 mg/dL) are associated with lower cardiovascular risk than in the general population, with no known detrimental health effects. Nevertheless, long-term safety studies are required to consolidate the present evidence base. This review summarises key data supporting the ESC/EAS recommendation to reduce markedly LDL-C levels, with aggressive goals for LDL-C in patients at highest risk, and provides expert opinion on its significance for clinical practice.

ABSTRACT

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds.

Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

• Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus. • Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels.

Based on nonrandomized trials, patients at very high risk should be considered for treatment with maximally tolerated statin doses and ezetimibe before considering the addition of a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. Selected Moderate-Strength Recommendations Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, the addition of nonstatin drug therapy should be considered at a threshold LDL-C level of at least 70 mg per dL on maximal statin therapy in patients with ASCVD at very high risk.

Based on moderate-quality evidence from nonrandomized studies, the 10-year risk of a first ASCVD event can be assessed in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes and an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg per dL. Patients with diabetes who have multiple ASCVD risk factors should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels by 50% or more, according to data from RCTs.

### Prevalence of low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with documented coronary heart disease or risk equivalent and controlled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^a46ffadf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Current guidelines identify low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as the primary target for cardiovascular prevention but also recognize low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as an important secondary target. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of low HDL cholesterol in a contemporary ambulatory high-risk population across various LDL cholesterol levels, including patients taking statins. Screening of 44,052 electronic medical records from a primary care practice identified 1,512 high-risk patients with documented coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents. Low HDL cholesterol (< or =40 mg/dl in men, < or =50 mg/dl in women) was present in 66% of the 1,512 patients. Low HDL cholesterol was prevalent across all LDL cholesterol levels but most prevalent in patients with LDL cholesterol < or =70 mg/dl (79% vs 66% in those with LDL cholesterol 71 to 100 mg/dl and 64% in patients with LDL cholesterol >100 mg/dl, p <0.01). Low HDL cholesterol was equally and highly prevalent in patients taking statins (67%) and those not taking statins (64%) (p = NS). HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels correlated poorly (R(2) = 0.01), and this was unaffected by gender or statin treatment. In conclusion, in high-risk patients with CHD or CHD risk equivalents, low HDL cholesterol levels remain prevalent despite statin treatment and the achievement of aggressive LDL cholesterol goals.

### Cardiovascular risk in patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and particle targets [^a2fe0fe8]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Previous research suggests that LDL particle number (LDL-P) may be a better tool than LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to guide LDL-lowering therapy. Using real-world data, this study has two objectives: [1] to determine the incidence of CHD across LDL-P thresholds; and [2] to compare CHD/stroke events among patients achieving comparably low LDL-P or LDL-C levels.

Methods

A claims analysis was conducted among high-risk patients identified from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database(SM). The impact of LDL levels on risk was compared across cohorts who achieved LDL-P <1000 nmol/L or LDL-C <100 mg/dL. Cohorts were matched to balance demographic and comorbidity differences.

Results

Among 15,569 patients with LDL-P measurements, the risk of a CHD event increased by 4% for each 100 nmol/L increase in LDL-P level (HR 1.04; 95% CI 1.02-1.05, p < .0001). The comparative analysis included 2,094 matched patients with ≥12 months of follow-up, 1,242 with ≥24 months and 705 with ≥36 months. At all time periods, patients undergoing LDL-P measurement were more likely to receive intensive lipid-lowering therapy and had a lower risk of CHD/stroke than those in the LDL-C cohort (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.61-0.96; at 12 months).

Conclusions

In this real-world sample of commercially insured patients, higher LDL-P levels were associated with increased CHD risk. Moreover, high-risk patients who achieved LDL-P <1000 nmol/L received more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy than patients achieving LDL-C <100 mg/dL, and these differences in lipids and therapeutic management were associated with a reduction in CHD/stroke events over 12, 24 and 36 months follow-up.

### Achieving optimal lipid goals in patients with coronary artery disease [^32b94438]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy recommend intensive low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering for patients with coronary artery disease. Previous studies have found that many high-risk patients are not achieving their LDL cholesterol goals, and many patients, despite being treated with lipid-lowering therapy, also have elevated triglycerides or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. To evaluate lipid goals in a "real world" clinical setting, the electronic medical records of 10,040 patients with coronary artery disease from a large cardiology subspecialty practice from September 2008 to September 2009 were reviewed. Overall, 79% of patients achieved an LDL cholesterol goal of <100 mg/dl, while only 35% achieved the more aggressive goal of <70 mg/dl. Non-HDL cholesterol goals of <130 and <100 mg/dl were achieved in 79% and 44% of patients, respectively. Only 69% achieved normal triglyceride levels, and only 63% of men and 56% of women achieved normal levels of HDL cholesterol. Women and younger men were less likely to achieve their lipid goals. In conclusion, most patients with coronary artery disease achieve the minimal LDL cholesterol goal of 100 mg/dl, but few achieve the more aggressive goals of <70 mg/dl. Many high-risk patients have elevated levels of triglycerides or low levels of HDL cholesterol despite treatment. Combination lipid-lowering therapy is used infrequently in practice. There exists a significant opportunity for physicians to more aggressively treat lipids to achieve the levels recommended by clinical guidelines.

### Compliance with dyslipidemia guidelines in daily practice: how effective is cardiovascular risk prevention? [^4f124a1a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis is the leading cause of early mortality and morbidity. The current European guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice recommend the use of the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation (SCORE) system. The current American Heart Association guidelines recommend the use of the new pooled cohort risk assessment equations to estimate the 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk. The purpose of this article was to investigate the compliance of dyslipidemia guidelines in daily practice in patients with dyslipidemia or who have risk factors for CVD.

Methods

The study group consisted of 500 outpatients who had dyslipidemia or risk factors for CVD. The risk level was computed according to the European and American Heart Association guidelines. Therapeutic LDL-C targets were identified based on the calculated risk level. Therapeutic target levels were compared based on the dosage of statins used and achievement of the LDL-C goal in daily practice according to the risk levels.

Findings

According to the European dyslipidemia guidelines, 231 patients were in the very-high/high-risk group, and 106 patients (45.9%) achieved the LDL-C target (<100 mg/dL); 210 patients were in the moderate-risk group, and 156 (74.3%) patients achieved the LDL-C target (<115 mg/dL); and 59 patients were in the low-risk group, and 55 (93.2%) patients achieved the LDL-C target (<155 mg/dL). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that the LDL-C level and presence of coronary artery disease were significantly reverse associated with achievement of the LDL-C goal (both, P < 0.001).

Implications

Our results showed that the majority of patients were in the very-high/high-risk group in daily practice. Although the European dyslipidemia guidelines are more likely to be used in daily practice, achievement of the guidelines-recommended treatment goals was low.

### Current and future aims of lipid-lowering therapy: changing paradigms and lessons from the heart protection study on standards of efficacy and safety [^afce48bb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering guidelines continue to evolve toward the use of (1) global risk assessment, (2) lipid measures other than or in addition to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in assessment of risk and treatment benefit, and (3) recommendations for more aggressive lipid lowering. Findings in the Heart Protection Study (HPS) indicate that high-risk patients benefit from statin therapy initiated at a dose that provides aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol. Statin treatment in this trial provided consistent benefits in reducing major vascular events among a wide variety of high-risk patients, including those beginning treatment with LDL cholesterol levels <100 mg/dL. The HPS findings therefore suggest that the optimal LDL cholesterol level is well below current target levels. In addition, they provide reassurance that aggressive statin therapy is safe. Frequently, current targets for LDL cholesterol are not achieved in clinical practice, particularly among those patients who have coronary artery disease or are at high risk of disease. More intensive lipid lowering than that currently practiced is necessary to achieve current goals and to provide the aggressive reduction of LDL cholesterol shown to improve outcomes in clinical trials. New statins, such as rosuvastatin, offer the prospect of improved lipid-lowering therapy.

### Transatlantic lipid guideline divergence: same data but different interpretations [^ba41b1c7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Examining the Guidelines: Major Similarities But Differences in Interpretation of the Data

Both the 2018 AHA/ACC/MS Guideline and the 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines employ a risk‐based approach to grade intensity of the intervention and use patient history, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data to identify individuals most likely to benefit from lipid‐lowering therapy. Both guidelines identify 4 major, mutually exclusive categories of patients likely to benefit from lipid‐lowering interventions, including those with clinical ASCVD, severe primary hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and primary prevention patients with high 10‐year risk for ASCVD. They recommend treatments based on the premise that the higher the baseline risk, the greater the absolute ASCVD risk reduction derived from the same reduction of LDL‐C. Some key differences in the interpretation of data include the following: definition of risk categories; employment of risk calculation systems that depend on ASCVD death (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE]) versus fatal and nonfatal ASCVD (Pooled Cohort Equations); use of atherosclerosis imaging tests to inform treatment decisions; value of employing LDL‐C goals, and, in selected hypertriglyceridemic patients, non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non‐HDL‐C) and apoB goals, for clinical decision making; and use of pharmacotherapy that is based upon achieved LDL‐C levels. While both guidelines recognize that there is a continuum of risk, the ESC/EAS Guidelines proceed on the premise that ASCVD risk is a continuum from low to very high without categorizing people to primary and secondary prevention, while the AHA/ACC/MS Guideline maintains that differentiation between primary and secondary prevention is warranted based on the results of randomized controlled trials. The 2019 ESC/EAS Guidelines provide a number of important updates to the previous ESC/EAS Guidelines of 2016 and among other key points, emphasize that lower LDL‐C is better and that the absolute LDL‐C reduction drives the clinical benefit (Data S1, Table S1). This perspective has led to new goals in high‐risk and very high‐risk patients, shifting the focus from high‐intensity statin to high‐intensity lipid‐lowering. The philosophical underpinnings of these documents and their divergent approaches to lipid lowering for ASCVD risk reduction are summarized in Table 1.

### 2013 ACC / AHA cholesterol treatment guideline: what was done well and what could be done better [^d6e129d4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Five years after convening the expert panel, the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was released. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association issued the guideline on the basis of a systematic review of cholesterol treatment trials performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This report critically appraises the guideline and provides our view of what was done well and what could be done better. In particular, we propose that the guideline succeeds in prioritizing statin therapy, expanding the focus to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and emphasizing absolute cardiovascular risk to determine eligibility for statin therapy. We contend that the guideline could be enhanced by refining the use of lipid goals rather than removing them, enhancing guidance on evaluation of cholesterol, and broadening the concept of age underpinning risk-based decision making to include vascular and physiological age. We further suggest that the next guideline panel could comprehensively review current best evidence, build on existing guidelines, and cultivate broader national and international consensus. Overall, we aim to continue discussions about the important contributions and shortfalls of the guideline and create momentum for effective implementation and timely updates.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) risk–reduction magnitude—within the studied range, there was no evidence of an LDL-C threshold; larger LDL-C reductions, for example 2 to 3 mmol/L (77.4–116.1 mg/dL), could yield up to 40% to 50% relative risk reduction for ASCVD.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment in high-risk family medicine patients [^9c25f04d]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The Adult Treatment Panel III guideline recommends a low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goal of <100mg/dl for patients with coronary heart disease or risk equivalence (ie, other forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease [peripheral vascular disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, cerebrovascular disease], diabetes). An optional LDL-C goal of <70mg/dl is recommended for patients considered "very high risk." This category is not well defined, and clinical interpretation of this category varies.

Methods

To define this category and to determine eligibility for an LDL-C goal of <70mg/dl, 5 definitions of "very high risk" were developed. Patients with coronary heart disease or risk equivalence within the University of Colorado Family Medicine system over the course of 2 years were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes (n=445). Their medical records were evaluated retrospectively. Patients characterized as "very high risk" according to the 5 definitions were assessed for LDL-C <70mg/dl goal attainment.

Results

Twenty-seven patients did not have LDL-C measurements and were excluded. Using the 5 definitions, we discovered that prevalence as "very high risk" was 10.8% (atherosclerotic vascular disease [AVD] plus smoking), 19.1% (AVD plus diabetes), 21.5% (AVD plus metabolic syndrome plus uncontrolled hypertension or smoking), 47.1% (AVD plus metabolic syndrome), and 67.2% (All AVD), P < .0001. LDL-C <70mg/dl was attained in 26.7%, 46.3%, 31.1%, 39.1%, and 35.2%, respectively (P=.13).

Conclusion

Classifying patients as "very high risk" is highly variable depending on individual definitions, but this does not appear to alter the rates of attaining an LDL-C goal of <70mg/dl. When the Adult Treatment Panel IV guidelines are developed and issued, simplicity and clarity will be important in assisting clinicians in defining patient risk and developing LDL-C goals.

### Primary prevention of ASCVD and T2DM in patients at metabolic risk: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^a50a6806]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Cholesterol reduction—Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline recommendations specify statin treatment thresholds, targets, and monitoring for adults at metabolic risk. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL (≥5.9 mmol/L), we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve an LDL-C reduction of ≥50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L), we recommend a 10-year risk for ASCVD should be calculated. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥7.5%, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy either to achieve an LDL-C goal <100 mg/dL (<2.6 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of ≥50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5%, we recommend moderate statin therapy as an option after consideration of risk reduction, adverse events, drug interactions, and individual preferences, to achieve either an LDL-C goal <130 mg/dL (<3.4 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of 30% to 50%. In individuals with metabolic risk, without diabetes, on statin therapy, we suggest monitoring glycemia at least annually to detect new-onset diabetes mellitus. In individuals aged >75 years without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥7.5%, we recommend discussing the benefits of statin therapy with the patient based on expected benefits vs possible risks/side effects; decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis and statin therapy should be calibrated to reach the recommended LDL targets.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol—risk-based statin therapy are as follows: “In adults at intermediate risk (≥7.5% to <20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended.” Targets are specified: “In intermediate risk (≥7.5% to <20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more,” and “in patients at high risk (≥20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more.” Diabetes-specific guidance states: “In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated,” and “In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more.” For very high LDL-C, “In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended.”

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^bc77fbc2]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1 
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality (–).Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome (–). Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data (–), a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients—those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals—how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the “evidence-based” fixed dose?

LDL-C and non–HDL-C preventive thresholds—evidence cited supports an LDL-C concentration of <100 mg/dL and a non–HDL-C level of <130 mg/dL for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), corresponding to an LDL-C concentration of ∼ 100 mg/dL; lipid-lowering therapy which reduced LDL-C to ≤100 mg/dL was associated with a significantly lower percentage of total and CHD-related deaths (40% vs 61%) compared with patients with LDL-C of ≥100 mg/dL, and lower-risk associations have been shown to be present to LDL-C values of <55 mg/dL; designation of non–HDL-C treatment targets as 30 mg/dL more than the LDL-C concentration is based on the assumption that “normal” very low–density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) when triglycerides are <150 mg/dL is typically ≤30 mg/dL, whereas when triglycerides are elevated, VLDL-C is typically >30 mg/dL; in observational studies, each 1 mg/dL increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol is associated with an increment in ASCVD event risk at least as large as that for each 1 mg/dL increase in LDL-C.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^26480d9e]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Low credibility.

The leadership of the National Lipid Association convened an Expert Panel to develop a consensus set of recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine. An Executive Summary of those recommendations was previously published. This document provides support for the recommendations outlined in the Executive Summary. The major conclusions include (1) an elevated level of cholesterol carried by circulating apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], termed atherogenic cholesterol) is a root cause of atherosclerosis, the key underlying process contributing to most clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events; (2) reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol will lower ASCVD risk in proportion to the extent that atherogenic cholesterol is reduced. This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.

3.3 European perspectives

In secondary prevention of very high‐risk patients, an LDL‐C reduction of ≥50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal <55 mg/dL are both recommended (class I, level A). A reduction in LDL‐C by 50% from baseline with high‐intensity statin is a first common step in both guidelines. However, European guideline recommends intensifying lipid‐lowering treatment even in patients who achieve on LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL, whereas the addition of nonstatin agent is recommended in the US guideline only for those above the threshold ≥70 mg/dL. In the European guidelines, patients with ASCVD who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally statin therapy, an LDL‐C goal of <40 mg/dL (<1 mmol/L) may be considered (class IIb, level B). Compared to the US guideline, the European guideline supports even lower LDL‐C goals with further intensification of therapy in patients with a recurrent ASCVD event with an LDL‐C of 55 to 70 mg/dL. The concept of goals implies that therapeutic options will be added sequentially to achieve a specific recommended LDL‐C level.

Follow-up visits for atherogenic cholesterol management—if goal levels have not been achieved, the statin dosage may be increased or the patient might be switched to a more efficacious agent; after an adequate trial of the highest intensity statin therapy tolerated, the clinician may consider referral to a lipid specialist or addition of a second cholesterol-lowering agent. Once goals have been achieved, response to therapy should be monitored periodically, and within 4 to 12 months, to confirm maintenance of goal levels and adherence.

Cholesterol, LDL-C, and ASCVD—population and trial evidence indicates that optimal total cholesterol levels are about 150 mg/dL (3.8 mmol/L), corresponding to an LDL-C of about 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), and adult populations with cholesterol in this range manifest low rates of ASCVD; randomized controlled trials in high-risk patients confirm that LDL-C lowering produces marked reductions in ASCVD, supporting the principle that “lower is better” for LDL-C.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for... [^e21c004d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.
1. Icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a single randomized trial among secondary prevention patients with elevated triglyceride levels. 2 The high rates of events in the control group and lack of corroborating studies limit our confidence in recommending this medication. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo.

Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring. After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. Even while making primary prevention decisions, we find the evidence supports infrequent lipid monitoring. Risk calculators demonstrate that patient factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use influence risk scores significantly more than cholesterol values. Cholesterol levels are stable for up to 10 years, with most change between measurements due to testing variability.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^aad50cb0]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the management of blood cholesterol were updated in the past year in the United States and Europe, reflecting a more intensive approach to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on practice guideline released the 2018 guideline on the management of blood cholesterol on behalf of several American societies. Approximately 9 months later, the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society published their 2019 guideline for the management of dyslipidemias. Both guidelines have similarities for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Both emphasize risk assessment of patients as a main approach to guide therapy; those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease have a greater clinical benefit of LDL-C reduction by at least 50%. Both guidelines reinforce the indication to lower LDL-C as an important modifiable risk factor and consider the addition of nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in addition to lifestyle counseling and high-intensity statin for further reduction of LDL-C levels. However, the guidelines have differences in the concepts of treatment thresholds (≥70mg/dL in the United States) vs treatment goals (<55mg/dL in Europe), in the definition of very high-risk category and in the classes for recommendation for the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

### LDL cholesterol management simplified in adults-lower for longer is better: guidance from the National Lipid Association [^7e40909f]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). High credibility.

Risk assessment markers for ASCVD—Primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD require an accurate estimation of risk of both future and recurrent cardiovascular events, and the LDL-C level is the focus of this article and is a highly relevant biomarker (indicator) of ASCVD risk, with high LDL-C generally indicative of high ASCVD risk and very low LDL-C levels generally indicative of low ASCVD risk (in the absence of other major risk factors). In individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, obesity, or metabolic syndrome, non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B (apo B) offer superior risk assessment by accounting for all atherogenic particles, and the National Lipid Association (NLA) and other major guidelines recommend consideration of apo B or non–HDL-C as secondary targets, particularly in high-risk patients or when triglyceride levels are elevated; the level of ASCVD risk should inform intensity of treatment to lower LDL-C.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^a15b87e5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

National Lipid Association—risk indicators and threshold-based considerations include that discordance may occur between LDL-C and non-HDL-C/apo B/LDL particle measures, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, or hypertriglyceridemia, and if discordance exists, further lipid-lowering treatment to reach goal levels of non-HDL-C and apo B may be considered; levels of Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL indicate increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and are a reason to consider more intensive non-HDL-C and LDL-C lowering, although no specific goals have been recommended and treatment options to lower Lp(a) are limited; peripheral artery disease with an ankle brachial index of <0.90 is one of the strongest ASCVD risk indicators, with attainment goals in such patients of <100 mg/dL for non-HDL-C and <70 mg/dL for LDL-C; LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL and/or non-HDL-C ≥190 mg/dL in low or moderate risk patients may justify a higher level of treatment; severe disturbance in a major ASCVD risk factor (e.g., multipack per day smoking or strong family history of premature CHD) is noted; and patients with stage 3B or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk and warrant a lower treatment goal.

### Hypertriglyceridemia and residual dyslipidemia in statin-treated, patients with diabetes at the highest risk for cardiovascular disease and achieving very-low low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels [^a6d4b3d5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

As the result of the high prevalence of comorbidities and conventional risk factors among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), most patients belong to the highest cardiovascular disease risk category, and have a target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of <70 mg/dL. Because substantial residual risk persists at LDL-C <70 mg/dL, a more comprehensive control of non-LDL-C and particles was recommended in the joint 2008 American Diabetes Association/American College of Cardiology Consensus.

Objective

To ascertain, in statin-treated T2DM patients belonging to this greatest-risk group, with on-statin LDL-C <70 mg/dL, (1) the proportion of patients meeting all three critical levels (LDL-C <70 mg/dL, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] <100 mg/dL, apoB <80 mg/dL) and (2) the variables associated with target attainment versus nonattainment.

Patients and Methods

Among 675 unselected patients with T2DM, 367 were both at very high cardiometabolic risk and taking statins; 118 of these patient had LDL-C levels <70 mg/dL. Patients meeting all three criteria (LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB; n = 79; all three at goal group) were compared with those only reaching LDL-C (n = 49; only LDL-C at goal group).

Results

LDL-C was 54 (12) for the all three at goal group versus 57 (10) mg/dL for the only LDL-C at goal group (NS). The two groups were similar regarding age, gender, diabetes duration, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, renal function and micro-/macroangiopathy prevalence. A statin plus fibrate was given to 16% of patients in the all three at goal group and 32% in the only LDL-C at goal group. The two groups did not differ in baseline (prestatin) LDL-C, HDL-C, and non-HDL-C, except for pre-/post-lipid-lowering drug(s) triglycerides (TG): 177 (95)/118 (56) for all three at goal versus 279 (134)/ 241 (103) mg/dL for only LDL-C at goal (P = .0230 and P = .0001). The only LDL-C at goal group had lower HDL-C (vs. all three at goal): 41 (12) vs. 47 (14) mg/dL (P = .0237), with atherogenic dyslipidemia [hypo-HDL-C + hyper-TG] prevalence of 35% in the all three at goal versus 56% in the only LDL-C at goal group (P < .0001). log(TG)/HDL-C was 0.049 (0.021) for all three at goal versus 0.063 (0.021) for only LDL-C at goal (P < .0001). The LDL-C/apoB ratio was 0.92 (0.24) for all three at goal vs. 0.67 (0.18) for only LDL-C at goal (P < .0001), suggestive of smaller/denser LDL.

Conclusion

The presence of atherogenic dyslipidemia was associated with a failure to meet all three critical modifiable targets for hypercholesterolemia, such a nonachievement being found in a large proportion (one-third) of very-high risk T2DM patients with very-low on-statin LDL-C. Attainment of all three targets will require (1) titration/permutation of statins, (2) lifestyle (re)inforcement; and/or (3) statin-fibrate bitherapy.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, statin therapy, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate high-intensity statin therapy to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50% of baseline and to obtain an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) in patients aged 40-75 years with diabetes at higher cardiovascular risk, including patients with ≥ 1 ASCVD risk factors.

### Improving statin treatment strategies to reduce LDL-cholesterol: factors associated with targets' attainment in subjects with and without type 2 diabetes [^8b122480]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

However, comparisons between LDLc targets as a function of the type of statin treatment, adherence, prior cardiovascular event in patients with and without diabetes are lacking. Furthermore, the prevalence of off-target values, in light of the new recommended LDLc target for very high-risk patients, is unknown.

Therefore, in light of these considerations, we performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study, intending to gain a snapshot of lipid levels of two different populations, with and without diabetes, in the light of a previous cardiovascular event. More specifically, we wished to: (1) determine the proportion of patients, on different types of statin treatments, at target for LDLc; (2) analyze the differences between patients without and with diabetes; (3) quantify the impact of prior events; (4) identify the determinants of LDLc attainment and quantify their contribution.

Both guidelines have similarities for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Both emphasize risk assessment of patients as a main approach to guide therapy; those at higher risk of cardiovascular disease have a greater clinical benefit of LDL‐C reduction by at least 50%. Both guidelines reinforce the indication to lower LDL‐C as an important modifiable risk factor and consider the addition of nonstatin agents, such as ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, in addition to lifestyle counseling and high‐intensity statin for further reduction of LDL‐C levels. However, the guidelines have differences in the concepts of treatment thresholds (≥70 mg/dL in the United States) vs treatment goals (< 55 mg/dL in Europe), in the definition of very high‐risk category and in the classes for recommendation for the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

### The importance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement and control as performance measures: a joint clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology [^a7202527]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2023). High credibility.

2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guideline—The expert panel recommended a paradigm shift away from a treat-to-goal strategy to treatment intensity using fixed doses across four statin benefit groups, including ASCVD, diabetes mellitus (DM), LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, or a calculated 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5%. Statin doses to achieve LDL-C reductions of ≥50% for patients with either ASCVD or LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, or 30–49% for persons with DM or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥7.5%, were recommended. A repeat lipid panel 4–12 weeks after initiation of statin therapy was recommended as a Class IA recommendation (should be performed), with measurement every 3–12 months thereafter, and monitoring of lipid levels was established as a Class IA recommendation.

### Systematic review of clinical guidelines for lipid lowering in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events [^9f78cada]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The WHO recommends that those with established cardiovascular disease should be treated with lipid-lowering therapy, but there is no specific guidance regarding lipid monitoring. Unnecessary general practitioner visits may be a burden for patients and increase healthcare costs. A systematic review of the current guidelines was performed to reveal gaps in the evidence base for optimal lipid monitoring approaches.

Methods

For this systematic review, a search of Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Turning Research Into Practice databases was conducted for relevant guidelines published in the 10 years prior to 31 December 2019. Recommendations surrounding the frequency of testing, lipid-lowering therapies and target cholesterol values were compared qualitatively. Each guideline was assessed using the 2009 Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool.

Results

Twenty-two guidelines were included. All recommended statins as the primary lipid-lowering therapy, with a high level of supporting evidence. Considerable variation was found in the recommendations for cholesterol targets. Seventeen guidelines provided at least one cholesterol target, which for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ranged between 1.0 and 2.6 mmol/L, although the most frequently recommended was <1.8 mmol/L (n=12). For long-term follow-up, many recommended reviewing patients annually (n=9), although there was some variation in recommendations for the interval of between 3 and 12 months. Supporting evidence for any approach was limited, often being derived from clinical opinion.

Conclusions

Further research is required to provide an evidence base for optimal lipid monitoring of the on-statin secondary prevention population.
