## Question

Is reflex HCV rna test same as NAAT?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a reflex HCV RNA test is the same as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for hepatitis C virus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of reflex testing and NAAT. Then, I should verify how major guidelines (CDC, AASLD/IDSA, WHO) describe the diagnostic algorithm and whether they equate reflex RNA with NAAT. Next, I will examine operational details and specimen handling to ensure there is no hidden distinction. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion and note any nuances that could cause confusion in practice.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. Reflex HCV RNA testing refers to an automated laboratory workflow in which a specimen that tests positive for HCV antibody is automatically sent for HCV RNA testing on the same sample or a retained aliquot, without requiring the patient to return for another blood draw, which is a strategy explicitly encouraged by CDC to complete the two-step diagnostic algorithm in a single visit [^112F3aSH] [^111jy447]. NAAT stands for nucleic acid amplification test, which for HCV detects viral RNA and is the confirmatory test that establishes current infection; in HCV diagnostics, NAAT is synonymous with HCV RNA testing by PCR or related molecular methods [^114ydQNe] [^115cph2A].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic algorithm language in authoritative sources. CDC's testing guidance states that persons who test anti-HCV positive should have follow-up testing with an FDA-approved nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA, and CDC encourages reflex HCV RNA testing using the same specimen to avoid loss to follow-up, which operationally means the reflex RNA test is an NAT implementation strategy [^112F3aSH] [^111jy447]. AASLD/IDSA guidance similarly recommends HCV antibody screening with reflex HCV RNA PCR to establish active infection, again equating reflex RNA with PCR-based NAT confirmation [^113nJmWZ] [^112QFQYt]. WHO guidance likewise recommends reflex HCV RNA testing after a positive antibody result as a key strategy to promote linkage to care, reinforcing that reflex RNA is the confirmatory NAT step in the algorithm [^112c9pnz] [^115XwgBm].

> Hold on, I should verify operational details to ensure there is no hidden distinction. Reflex RNA can be performed on the same venipuncture specimen used for antibody testing or on a second tube collected at the same visit, and it can be done in-house or referred to another laboratory; in all cases, it is an HCV RNA NAT that determines viremia and current infection, which is the same molecular assay family used when RNA is ordered separately [^111jy447] [^112F3aSH]. I should double-check that this aligns with laboratory practice descriptions: multiple public health laboratory analyses describe automatic reflexing of antibody-reactive specimens to HCV RNA NAT as the mechanism to complete the two-step algorithm without a second patient visit, confirming that reflex RNA is NAT by implementation [^112BWBgX] [^113QzWk3] [^115ZCYux].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could someone argue that "reflex" implies a different assay category? Let me reconsider and verify against guideline phrasing. The documents consistently use "reflex HCV RNA testing" and "NAT for HCV RNA" interchangeably within the same algorithmic context, and they specify that NAT detects HCV RNA to confirm current infection; there is no indication that "reflex" denotes a different molecular technology, only that it denotes an automated, same-visit confirmation pathway for antibody-positive specimens [^112F3aSH] [^113nJmWZ] [^112c9pnz]. I should confirm that even in occupational exposure guidance, reflex to NAT is explicitly described as the confirmatory step after antibody positivity, again underscoring that reflex RNA equals NAT confirmation in practice [^111cijuS] [^1162CU6x].

> But wait, what if the question is about alternatives to RNA NAT, like HCV core antigen? I need to ensure I don't conflate these. Core antigen assays are sometimes used as lower-cost alternatives to RNA NAT in certain settings, but they are not as sensitive and are not the same as RNA NAT; guidelines still prioritize RNA NAT as the confirmatory test, with reflex RNA being the preferred operationalization to close the care cascade, which reinforces that reflex RNA is NAAT rather than an antigen test [^111VtT1S] [^116rKcqM] [^112c9pnz]. Hold on, I should verify that WHO acknowledges antigen as an alternative in some contexts; yes, WHO notes core antigen can be considered where RNA is not available, but it is not equivalent to RNA NAT in analytical performance, so reflex RNA remains the NAAT gold standard when available [^115cKqnf] [^116rKcqM].

> I will now examine real-world implementation data to ensure the operational equivalence holds. Studies and programmatic reports consistently treat reflex HCV RNA as the NAT step that completes diagnosis, showing dramatic improvements in RNA test completion and linkage when reflex pathways are implemented, which would not make sense if reflex RNA were anything other than NAT confirmation of active infection [^113URceS] [^113xDhLj] [^113wyqJe]. Let me double-check that these sources explicitly frame reflex as NAT; yes, they describe viral load reflex testing and automatic RNA confirmation as the NAT component of the two-step algorithm [^113URceS] [^113xDhLj].

> Synthesis and conclusion: Yes, reflex HCV RNA testing is the same as NAAT for HCV. Reflex RNA is simply the operational implementation of the confirmatory NAT step — detecting HCV RNA to establish current infection — triggered automatically after a reactive antibody result, ideally on the same specimen to enable single-visit diagnosis and reduce loss to follow-up [^112F3aSH] [^113nJmWZ] [^112c9pnz]. I should confirm the bottom line one more time: across CDC, AASLD/IDSA, and WHO documents, reflex HCV RNA is the recommended NAT confirmation of active infection within the standard two-step diagnostic algorithm, with no guideline distinction suggesting it is a different assay category from NAAT [^112F3aSH] [^113nJmWZ] [^112c9pnz].

The reflex HCV RNA test is a **nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)** that automatically detects HCV RNA when the antibody test is positive, confirming active infection in a single visit [^112F3aSH] [^113nJmWZ]. It is the **gold standard** for diagnosing current HCV infection and is recommended by CDC and AASLD/IDSA to reduce loss to follow-up and expedite care [^113nJmWZ] [^111jy447] [^116rKcqM].

---

## Definition and methodology

- **Reflex HCV RNA testing**: An automated laboratory process that performs HCV RNA testing on the same specimen when the antibody test is positive, confirming active infection without a second visit [^112F3aSH] [^111jy447].

- **NAAT methodology**: Reflex HCV RNA tests use NAAT (PCR or TMA) to detect HCV RNA, the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosing active infection [^116rKcqM] [^115cph2A].

- **Single-visit diagnosis**: Reflex testing enables same-day confirmation of active infection, reducing loss to follow-up and speeding linkage to care [^1165Cdfb] [^113URceS].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

CDC recommends **reflex HCV RNA testing** for all antibody-positive results to confirm active infection and enable prompt linkage to care [^112F3aSH] [^111jy447]. AASLD/IDSA likewise endorse **reflex HCV RNA testing** as the preferred initial diagnostic approach to confirm active infection and guide treatment [^113nJmWZ] [^112fLM8J]. WHO supports **reflex HCV RNA testing** to improve linkage to care and treatment, especially in resource-limited settings [^112c9pnz] [^115XwgBm].

---

## Clinical implications and benefits

- **Reduced loss to follow-up**: Reflex testing significantly increases RNA test completion and reduces patients lost between antibody and RNA testing [^1165Cdfb] [^113URceS].

- **Faster diagnosis and treatment**: Reflex testing shortens time to diagnosis and treatment initiation, improving outcomes and reducing transmission [^113URceS] [^111iXJzH].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Reflex testing reduces healthcare costs by minimizing repeat visits and streamlining the diagnostic process [^113wyqJe] [^111J18qV].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Specimen handling**: Reflex testing requires careful specimen handling to avoid RNA degradation and ensure accurate results [^112azwkD] [^113zTFdD].

- **Laboratory capacity**: Implementing reflex testing may require additional laboratory resources and training [^116H6erh] [^112BWBgX].

- **False positives/negatives**: Rare false results can occur; clinical judgment and repeat testing may be needed in inconclusive cases [^1146p3dU] [^112TCXHv].

## Comparison with other diagnostic methods

| **Attribute** | **Reflex hcv rna (naat)** | **Hcv antibody test** | **Hcv core antigen test** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Purpose | Confirm active infection | Screen for exposure | Detect active infection |
| Sensitivity | High (detects low-level viremia) | Moderate (false positives/negatives) | Lower than RNA (misses low-level viremia) |
| Specificity | High | Moderate | High |
| Turnaround time | Rapid (single visit) | Rapid | Rapid |
| Clinical utility | Gold standard for active infection | Screening only | Alternative where RNA unavailable |

---

The reflex HCV RNA test is a **NAAT** that automatically confirms active HCV infection when antibodies are positive, enabling single-visit diagnosis, reducing loss to follow-up, and expediting treatment. It is the **gold standard** for diagnosing current HCV infection and is strongly recommended by major guidelines.

REFLEX HCV RNA TESTING

The implementation of reflex HCV RNA testing, in which a test for HCV RNA is automatically performed when a test comes back positive for HCV antibody, has been an important advance. In regions without reflex testing, 20% to as high as 50% of people who test HCV antibody positive do not have a follow-up HCV RNA performed, constituting one of the major drop-offs in the HCV cascade of care. When Quest diagnostics, a large commercial laboratory in the United States, adopted reflex HCV RNA testing, the rate of follow-up HCV RNA testing within 30 days of a positive HCV antibody test went from 40% to 95%. Similarly, Spanish data showed that the rate of RNA testing increased from 52% to 91% with introduction of reflex testing. Even with reflex testing, challenges with inadequate sample volume or sample mishandling, prevent laboratories from getting to universal HCV RNA testing for all antibody-positive samples.

Although reflex testing is an important step and should be standard practice globally, implementation is limited in many regions of the world, including in many high-income countries, particularly in rural and remote communities. Although laboratories have cited challenges to move samples from the serology section of a laboratory to the site of nucleic acid testing, particularly if these tests are not done in the same place, this should be weighed against the inconvenience and cost to a patient to return to a provider and provide a second sample for follow-up testing. Some laboratories require collection of a second sample at the time of initial antibody testing, which improves the reliability of the reflex test, but greatly increases the cost of HCV screening because most screened individuals test HCV negative. Even where reflex testing has been adopted, turnaround times for HCV antibody and RNA results are often prolonged, particularly if testing volumes are low, leading laboratories to wait for enough samples for batch testing. Reflex HCV RNA testing should already be standard practice globally and efforts to ensure its universal adoption should be a priority.

### Maximizing reflexive hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing of HCV antibody-reactive samples within United States public health laboratories [^112BWBgX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Testing guidelines from the CDC recommend a 2-step algorithm to diagnose current HCV infection. The first test in the algorithm is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HCV antibody (Ab) test. A reactive Ab test indicates that the individual has been exposed to the virus at some point; however, it does not indicate whether the virus is still present in the blood. Thus, following a reactive HCV Ab test, specimens must undergo an FDA-approved nucleic acid test (NAT) that detects HCV RNA to confirm a current infection. Depending on the individual, follow-up or additional testing may be needed when the screening test is negative. Effective HCV treatment is available following a detectable HCV RNA, but loss to follow-up before a NAT can be performed is a major concern. Loss to follow-up occurs when a patient does not return for additional testing or care and can result in an active infection going undiagnosed and untreated. To ensure that patients are not lost to follow-up, best practice is to complete the entire HCV testing algorithm (Ab and NAT) on samples collected during a single patient visit. While the recommendation to test a sample that is reactive for HCV Ab using an HCV NAT is clear, it can be complicated for a laboratory to perform the reflexive testing. Discrepancies in the number of specimens that require HCV Ab testing versus HCV NAT (ie, many specimens will not require NAT), along with differences between testing methodologies typically mean that Ab tests and NATs are performed in different laboratory sections (immunology vs molecular) or even different laboratories (ie, via reference laboratories). This article aims to characterize the current landscape of HCV testing within US public health laboratories and identify critical areas for improvement of HCV testing to inform future programmatic action and advance HCV elimination goals.

CDC Guidance and Recommendations

Test the Source Patient

Baseline testing of the source patient should be performed as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hours) after the exposure (Figure 1) (Box). This guidance provides two options for initial source patient testing: 1) option A (preferred), to test for HCV RNA, or 2) option B, to test for anti-HCV and then if positive, test for HCV RNA (Figure 1). All source patients who are anti-HCV positive should be tested by a nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA, preferably with a reflex test by using the same specimen if cross-contamination is not a concern or by using a fresh aliquot of the same sample if stored correctly. If HCV RNA tests are positive but the RNA level is less than the lower limit of quantitation of the assay, the results are reported as < XX IU/mL (e.g. < 15 IU/mL if the lower limit of quantitation of the assay is 15 IU/mL). This means that HCV RNA was detected in the sample but is not quantifiable and that the person from whom the sample was collected should be considered to have current HCV infection.

Hepatitis C Testing Strategy

The goal of hepatitis C screening is to identify persons who are currently infected with HCV. Hepatitis C testing should be initiated with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-HCV test. Persons who test anti-HCV positive are either currently infected or had past infection that has resolved naturally or with treatment. Immunocompetent persons without hepatitis C risks who test anti-HCV negative are not infected and require no further testing. Persons testing anti-HCV positive should have follow-up testing with an FDA-approved nucleic acid test (NAT) for detection of HCV RNA. NAT for HCV RNA detection determines viremia and current HCV infection. Persons who test anti-HCV positive but HCV RNA negative do not have current HCV infection. CDC encourages use of reflex HCV RNA testing, in which specimens testing anti-HCV positive undergo HCV RNA testing immediately and automatically in the laboratory, using the same sample from which the anti-HCV test was conducted. Hepatitis C testing should be provided on-site when feasible.

Using real-time technology, we reliably identified chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and quantified virus from reflex samples originally submitted for serologic testing. There was no need to process specimens obtained directly for quantitation separately. Whether the initial source is a reflex sample or one obtained directly, a repeat HCV RNA test is needed before starting treatment.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^112fLM8J]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection? [^111ZrpGF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

If testing in a low-prevalence population (eg, 1%–2%), even with 97% sensitivity, the negative predictive value of a test would still be extremely high approximately 99.9%. However, in higher-prevalence populations (eg, PWID with prevalence approximately 40%), the negative predictive value would only be 98%. At its current sensitivity, core Ag test would likely have to be used with a paradigm of testing all core Ag-negative/HCV antibody-positive tests for HCV RNA. The cost-effectiveness of this strategy would likely depend on the viremic prevalence among antibody-positive people, which will go down as more and more people are treated. Ultimately, the availability of HCV core Ag test could be helpful if algorithms could be designed to test core Ag, with a plan to treat if positive but follow-up with reflex antibody and then RNA testing in those who test core Ag negative/HCV antibody positive. The cost-effectiveness and efficiency of such a strategy would have to be assessed to determine in which settings it would be most useful. Development of a POC core Ag test, ideally with improved sensitivity over existing assays, would be a major advance and would likely be not only cost-effective but significantly cost-saving (Table 1).

* Testing of the source patient should be performed as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hour) after exposure. Testing may follow option A (preferred), which is testing with a NAT for HCV RNA, or option B, which is testing for anti-HCV with reflex to a NAT for HCV RNA if positive. If the source patient is known or suspected to have recent behaviors that increase risk for HCV acquisition (e.g. injection drug use within the previous 4 months) or if risk cannot be reliably assessed, initial testing of the source patient should include a NAT for HCV RNA. A source patient found to be positive for HCV RNA should be referred to care. Follow-up testing of HCP is recommended if the source patient is HCV RNA positive, anti-HCV positive with HCV RNA status unknown, or cannot be tested. Persons with detectable HCV RNA at any point should be referred to care consistent with current AASLD-IDSA guidelines for evaluation and treatment of all persons with acute or chronic HCV infection. Guidance for hepatitis C treatment is evolving with emerging data on treatment with direct-acting antivirals.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis and screening — The diagnosis of HCV infection usually begins with an immunoassay for detection of HCV IgG or total antibodies in serum or plasma, but antibody may not be detectable until 6–10 weeks after the onset of clinical illness. Individuals with negative HCV antibody screening test results do not need further testing except in immunocompromised individuals, in whom development of HCV IgG antibody may be delayed for up to 6 months after exposure, or those suspected to have acute HCV infection. Those with positive initial HCV IgG or total antibody test results should undergo confirmatory or supplemental testing for HCV RNA with nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT); supplemental HCV IgG antibody assays can confirm antibodies but are not FDA-approved currently for clinical use in the United States. Per current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, the following individuals should be screened for HCV infection: all adults aged > 18 years at least once, previously untested persons with risk factors, and pregnant women during each pregnancy except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is < 0.1%. HCV RNA can be detected soon after infection and NAAT can be qualitative or quantitative; highly sensitive molecular assays with a limit of detection of ≤ 25 IU/mL are necessary to monitor virologic response and to determine cure, and determination of HCV genotype and subtypes (ie, 1 to 6 and 1a vs 1b) is used to guide antiviral therapy choice and duration and to predict response.

Education surrounding the importance of completing the 2-step algorithm is crucial to ensure buy-in from providers, laboratory professionals, and health department staff. Moreover, strong relationships between these groups can facilitate linkage to care following receipt of an HCV diagnosis, which is a known bottleneck in the HCV cure cascade. While some of the burden for assuring diagnosis and treatment falls to the patient, it is the responsibility of providers, laboratory professionals, and health department staff to facilitate access to straightforward means of HCV detection and treatment. Thus, laboratories that offer HCV Ab testing must assure the algorithm is completed by automatically reflexing HCV Ab-reactive specimens to in-house RNA testing or by automatically referring specimens to a different laboratory.

Baseline Testing

HCP should have an initial baseline test for anti-HCV with testing for HCV RNA if positive (i.e. either reflex or follow-up NAT) as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hours) after the exposure to rule out a pre-existing chronic infection (Box) (Figure 2). HCP testing positive for HCV RNA at baseline should be referred to care for pre-existing current HCV infection. If HCP are anti-HCV positive and HCV RNA negative at baseline, this likely indicates a previously cleared infection; therefore, if test results for the source patient warrant follow-up testing for HCP in context of a current exposure (Figure 1), HCP should be tested for HCV RNA instead of retesting for anti-HCV, which usually will remain positive regardless of current infection status.

Aside from the benefits of this technique at the level of public health, reflex-testing-based diagnosis means fewer visits to the doctor and unnecessary blood draws. This, in turn, translates into not only more comfortable patients, but also fewer subjects lost to follow-up and a shorter delay time for diagnosis and referral to a specialized center to receive treatment. It is noteworthy that the reflex testing protocol provided a diagnosis within a mean of 2 days, in contrast with the six-step protocol, which lasted weeks — or even months — due to administrative barriers to scheduling extra appointments. In addition to a shorter time for diagnosis, previous studies have found that the application of similar protocols are cost-effective. In this regard, it is important to highlight that the cost of a viral RNA determination (less than 30 euros in our laboratory) is much lower than the cost of a physician appointment and a blood extraction, so overall cost reduction may be of note. Furthermore, our algorithm includes request containment tools, such as avoiding duplicated determinations for patients with previous positive anti-HCV test results.

Introduction

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health problem, estimated to infect 1.0% of the world's population (71 million people)and to be responsible for 400 000 annual deaths as a result of cirrhosis and liver cancer. With the advent of highly potent direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, cure is now possible in > 95% of treated individuals achieving a sustained virological response, thus changing the landscape of clinical HCV management in recent years. Consequently, the WHO published in 2016 a global strategy to eliminate HCV as a public health threat by 2030.

To achieve this ambitious goal, it is essential to scale up diagnosis and treatment capacities in low-income and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa and Central Asia where HCV is highly endemic. However, in these regions, access to HCV diagnostic tools is severely limited. The current diagnostic algorithm is based on serological screening of HCV-specific antibodies (two different positive serological tests may be mandatory in some countries), followed by nucleic acid testing to detect presence of HCV RNA. Although rapid serological diagnostic tests exist for anti-HCV antibodies, nucleic acid testing for HCV RNA often involves dedicated facilities and highly qualified personnel, even if platforms such as Cepheid, Panther or VERIS/MDx are changing such requirements. In low-income and middle-income countries, HCV RNA tests are currently only available in centralised laboratories, resulting in less than 1% of infected people in these regions being aware of their infection. In certain at-risk patient subgroups (eg, migrants and prisoners) with current testing practices, it requires multiple visits to make a diagnosis, and as a result, many positives cases are missed. Therefore, to improve the 'suboptimal' cascade from screening to linkage to care and efficient therapy, there is an urgent unmet clinical need for decentralised HCV RNA testing. Point-of-care (PoC) molecular technologies have emerged as a viable strategy for improving clinical management of HCV, as they facilitate diagnosis and treatment programmes with the possibility to work in rural, resource-limited settings. In addition to decentralised nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT), serological rapid diagnostic tests are also contributing to the improvement of diagnosis strategies.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1146p3dU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

### Maximizing reflexive hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing of HCV antibody-reactive samples within United States public health laboratories [^113QzWk3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can have serious consequences when untreated and diagnosis is the first step in any treatment regimen. In the Unites States a 2-step algorithm consisting of HCV antibody screening and HCV RNA testing of HCV antibody-reactive specimens is recommended for detection of current HCV infection. We conducted a survey of HCV diagnostic practices in US public health laboratories and convened a meeting of HCV subject matter experts to identify opportunities for improvement in HCV diagnosis. Automatic reflexive HCV RNA testing of HCV antibody-reactive specimens was identified as a gap in laboratory practice. Only 54% of respondent laboratories always automatically reflexed or referred an anti-HCV-reactive specimen to an HCV RNA test. To facilitate diagnosis and ensure patients are not lost to follow-up, laboratories should ensure that the entire HCV testing algorithm can be completed with a sample(s) collected during a single patient visit.

RESULTS

Sample suitability and integrity for reflex testing.

Of the nine samples without a tested detectable viral load, seven remained free of HCV RNA, while amounts lower than the quantification limit of the analytical process were detected in two samples (< 15 IU/ml). Regarding the integrity of HCV RNA over time, the Wilcoxon test did not reveal any significant differences in its levels throughout the period of conservation of the samples.

Result of the six-step protocol with active recommendation.

Between January 2015 and March 2018, anti-HCV antibody determination was performed in 140,329 patients from primary care centers, of which 5,436 (3.9%) tested positive for anti-HCV. In 2,716 (50%) anti-HCV-positive patients, the laboratory included a recommendation to perform an HCV RNA analysis in the printed and online result reports, which was followed in 1,412 cases (52% of all recommendations), and the determination of HCV RNA was therefore requested and performed. Of all cases in which the recommendation was omitted, 986 (36%) corresponded to HCV patients with known infection, whereas in 327 (12%) cases, the reason for omitting HCV RNA determination was unknown.

### Maximizing reflexive hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing of HCV antibody-reactive samples within United States public health laboratories [^1165Cdfb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Implementation of a single-step algorithm for HCV diagnosis would simplify the process of confirming an HCV infection for patients, providers, and laboratorians. However, the diagnostic tests and guidelines that enable such a change are currently lacking. In contrast, public health and clinical laboratories that test for HCV Ab can immediately work to ensure that HCV Ab-reactive specimens are automatically reflexed or referred to an HCV NAT while the 2-step testing algorithm is in place. Laboratories may not automatically reflex Ab-reactive specimens for numerous reasons, including restrictions within their laboratory and local agreements with submitting providers. Financial restrictions are another common barrier to complete HCV testing with SMEs citing low reimbursement rates, a lack of clarity surrounding reimbursable testing intervals, and stringent criteria applied to the type of provider and setting required for screening test reimbursement.

While there may be barriers to overcome, completion of the recommended 2-step testing algorithm with a specimen(s) drawn during a single patient visit minimizes the potential for missed diagnoses and is best practice. This is critical because to reduce transmission, morbidity, and mortality and increase the likelihood of cure, a patient must first know their status. The HCV Ab test alone is not enough to diagnose an individual with current HCV infection. An HCV Ab test must be used in conjunction with an HCV NAT to facilitate diagnosis of current HCV infection.

Currently, public health laboratories possess a high capacity for HCV testing, with 50 responding laboratories (60%) offering any type of HCV testing by the end of 2020. While more than 80% of laboratories that performed Ab tests reflexed, referred, or recommended Ab-reactive specimens for RNA testing, the ultimate goal is for laboratories to automatically reflex or refer these specimens for supplemental RNA testing. Automatic reflexing to an in-house test or referring to a reference laboratory are both suitable approaches because they do not require a follow-up visit for a second specimen collection, and thereby minimize testing delays, loss to follow-up, and the potential for other involved parties, such as clinicians that do not specialize in HCV, to decide that RNA testing is unnecessary.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^112TCXHv]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic algorithm for current infection or reinfection — For diagnosis of current initial HCV infection, begin with HCV-antibody testing and for recurrent HCV infection, begin with HCV-RNA testing; ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection, with terminal pathways labeled "No Current HCV Infection" or "Additional Testing as Appropriate", whereas when infection is present the pathway labels "Current HCV Infection" and "Link to Care for Treatment or Retreatment". HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection, and for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months or who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA should be performed; repeat HCV-RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

### Role of serologic and molecular diagnostic assays in identification and management of hepatitis C virus infection [^116yedHG]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

An alternative to directly measuring HCV RNA is quantification of the amount of HCV proteins in the blood. Production of HCV proteins requires viral replication and thus serves as a reliable marker of active infection. HCV core antigen testing has been the most extensively validated and the only commercially available approach for detecting HCV proteins in serum or plasma, although this test is available in the United States for research use only. Studies performed with different HCV core antigen tests have shown that, while assays using core antigen levels are not as sensitive or precise as measurement of HCV RNA levels, those levels are significantly related to the HCV RNA level. Because HCV core antigen analysis is faster and usually less expensive than NAT approaches, there is increasing interest in using this test as a reflex test for HCV-seropositive samples to identify individuals who are actively infected with HCV, particularly in resource-limited regions. Due to the lower sensitivity of HCV core antigen tests compared to HCV RNA tests, in order to achieve 100% detection of active viremia, confirmation of HCV RNA negativity should be considered in HCV-seropositive samples with negative HCV Ag results (Fig. 1). As the number of cAg false-negative results would be expected to be very low in the general population, the number of RNA tests required to confirm cAg negative results could be reduced while maintaining the 100% detection goal by pooling samples prior to HCV RNA testing. These numbers could be further reduced by triaging/stratifying samples for confirmation on the basis of those with an elevated aminotransferase level.

### Significant improvement in diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection by a one-step strategy in a central laboratory: an optimal tool for hepatitis C elimination? [^1157Mfj8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Result of implementing the one-step protocol.

During the entire period analyzed (2017 to 2018), a total of 128,721 cases were collected (Table 1). During the six-step protocol period, omitted HCV RNA analyses ranged from 8% to 82% of all anti-HCV-positive patients. The setting in which less HCV RNA tests were requested for anti-HCV-positive patients in this period was drug treatment centers (CAS) (82%), followed by primary care settings(28%). After implementation of the one-step protocol (based on reflex testing), the percentage of HCV RNA tests that were omitted in anti-HCV-positive patients was ≤ 11% in all settings. In the case of drug treatment centers and primary care settings, the absolute percentages of omitted HCV RNA analyses decreased 76.4% (from 81.5% to 5.1%) and 20.2% (from 28.4% to 8.2%), respectively. Table 1 shows the number of cases with detectable HCV RNA, and Table 2 shows the range and median of HCV RNA levels for each group.

Of the 1,924 anti-HCV-positive patients with HCV RNA determination in the second analysis period (i.e. after implementing the reflex testing protocol), 1,034 (53.7%) had been requested by the physician, whereas 890 (46.3%) were performed as reflex testing despite not having been requested (Table 3). The result of the HCV RNA analysis was provided in a mean of 2 days after anti-HCV determination. In the primary care setting, of the 295 patients with detectable HCV RNA during this period, the reflex testing had been performed on 163 (55.3%), despite the fact that the doctor had not requested it. In the case of drug treatment centers, positive HCV RNA identified thanks to reflex testing amounted to 60.6% of the total.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^115cKqnf]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of progressive liver disease and associated morbidity and mortality globally. In 2021, there were an estimated 58 million persons with a chronic infection, with a disproportionately high burden in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Short‐course curative direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) regimens have transformed opportunities for treatment scale‐up and elimination. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Health Sector Strategy for elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat, with ambitious targets for elimination of HCV including a 90% reduction in new infections and a 65% reduction in HCV‐related mortality by 2030.

In order to meet the 2030 global targets for HCV elimination, there is a need to substantially scale‐up access to testing and treatment, with simplified service delivery models and diagnostic innovations to expand access. A key step in the care cascade is the use of HCV viral load assays to confirm presence of viraemic infection, and then a test of cure following treatment. The 2017 WHO viral hepatitis testing guidelines recommended a laboratory‐based PCR Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT), or a core HCV antigen assay with comparable clinical sensitivity, as preferred strategies for diagnosis of viraemic HCV infection, and laboratory‐based PCR assays as a test of cure at SVR12. Point‐of‐care HCV viral load assays are now available as an alternative to laboratory‐based NAAT assays to promote access, especially in hard to reach or marginalized populations. A previous multi‐cohort analysis examined the distribution of HCV viral load at diagnosis in 66,640 individuals from 12 countries and established that 97% had a viral load greater than 1318 IU/mL and 95% had a viral load greater than 3,311 IU/mL. The key laboratory‐based assays (Abbott Real time HCV PCR, Alinity m HCV RT‐PCR, Abbott Real time HCV PCR) have an analytical sensitivity or LloD of between 5–15 IU/mL, and key PoC assays: HCV RNA PoC GeneXpert assays are 10 IU/mL for venous blood, or 100 IU/mL using fingerstick capillary blood. All these assays are therefore acceptable for diagnosis of HCV viraemic infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113eyN2D]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) perinatal exposure — nucleic acid test (NAT) performance and testing algorithm indicate that HCV infection can be diagnosed in infants with perinatal exposure by a NAT to detect HCV RNA after age 1 month. The sensitivity of the HCV RNA testing was low (22%) at birth but increased to 79% at age 1 month and 85% at 6 months in a multisite European study, while a more recent single-site study utilizing high-sensitivity HCV RNA reverse transcription PCR at age 2 to 6 months reported a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval, 87.5% to 100%). The use of early NAT at 2 to 6 months is recommended by the CDC to identify infants with hepatitis C, given concerns about loss to follow-up before HCV antibody testing can be done at age ≥ 18 months. When testing children age ≥ 18 months an HCV antibody test when reactive should always be followed automatically by a NAT for HCV RNA, and HCV antibody testing without reflex to HCV RNA when antibody is reactive, is incomplete testing. As per CDC guidelines, all pregnant women should be tested for hepatitis C with each pregnancy.

### Reducing read time of point-of-care test does not affect detection of hepatitis C virus and reduces need for reflex RNA [^115uYTKy]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Global elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) will require increases in diagnosis. Point of care (POC) tests that detect antibodies against HCV can be useful for testing large and difficult to reach populations. The most accurate POC test requires a 20 min read time to identify antibody-positive samples. We investigated whether viremic patients could be identified using a shorter read time, to increase efficiency and reduce the need for reflex tests (a follow-up test for HCV RNA on the same specimen to confirm viremia).

Methods

Patients with past or current HCV infections provided samples at 2 clinics in Canada for evaluation by the OraQuick HCV Rapid antibody POC test. A community HCV-screening program in Madrid, Spain (real-world cohort) invited people to be tested for HCV with the same OraQuick test. Patients provided samples of whole blood, via finger prick. Fingerprick samples were tested immediately after collection. In the clinic cohort, photographs of the developing test were taken at 15 second intervals, and blinded readers recorded the time to positivity. In the real-world cohort, readers recorded the OraQuick result at 5 minutes, and each minute after, up to 10 minutes, and then again at 20 minutes; viremia was then evaluated using a POC HCV RNA test (GeneXpert HCV Viral Load Assay). Sera from viremic and non-viremic clinic patients were used to quantify antibody titers to investigate the relationship between the time of band appearance and antibody concentration. Fisher's exact test and exact logistic regression were used to determine factors associated with a positive result at 5 minutes.

Results

Blood from all viremic patients produced a positive result in the antibody POC test by 5 min. Median time to a positive result for 171 viremic patients was 2.6 min (range, 1.8–4.6 min), vs 4.1 min (range, 2.3–14.4 min) for 108 patients with resolved infection (P < .001). The 5-min threshold identified all viremic cases among 176 HCV antibody-positive patients in the real-world cohort, confirmed by testing for HCV RNA. In the pooled cohorts, antibody positivity at 5 min identified viremic patients with 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 98.4%-100%); the negative predictive value was 100% (95% CI, 94.9%-100%). The positive predictive value at 5 min was 62.0% (95% CI, 56.7%-67.0%) and therefore insufficient alone to detect viremia; an HCV RNA test would still be necessary to confirm active infection.

Conclusions

The wait time for the OraQuick HCV Rapid antibody POC blood test can be reduced from 20 min to 5 min and continue to reliably identify patients with HCV infection. Shortening the test time could increase high-throughput screening, reduce loss to follow up, and reduce the need for reflex HCV RNA testing.

### Testing and clinical management of health care personnel potentially exposed to hepatitis C virus guidance, United States, 2020 [^1162CU6x]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Exposure to hepatitis viruses is a recognized occupational risk for health care personnel (HCP). This report establishes new CDC guidance that includes recommendations for a testing algorithm and clinical management for HCP with potential occupational exposure to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Baseline testing of the source patient and HCP should be performed as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hours) after the exposure. A source patient refers to any person receiving health care services whose blood or other potentially infectious material is the source of the HCP's exposure. Two options are recommended for testing the source patient. The first option is to test the source patient with a nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA. This option is preferred, particularly if the source patient is known or suspected to have recent behaviors that increase risk for HCV acquisition (e.g., injection drug use within the previous 4 months) or if risk cannot be reliably assessed. The second option is to test the source patient for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), then if positive, test for HCV RNA. For HCP, baseline testing for anti-HCV with reflex to a NAT for HCV RNA if positive should be conducted as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hours) after the exposure and may be simultaneous with source-patient testing. If follow-up testing is recommended based on the source patient's status (e.g. HCV RNA positive or anti-HCV positive with unavailable HCV RNA or if the HCV infection status is unknown), HCP should be tested with a NAT for HCV RNA at 3–6 weeks postexposure. If HCV RNA is negative at 3–6 weeks postexposure, a final test for anti-HCV at 4–6 months postexposure is recommended. A source patient or HCP found to be positive for HCV RNA should be referred to care. Postexposure prophylaxis of hepatitis C is not recommended for HCP who have occupational exposure to blood and other body fluids. This guidance was developed based on expert opinion (CDC. Updated U.S. Public Health Service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis. MMWR Recommend Rep 2001;50[No. RR-11]; Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/90288) and reflects updated guidance from professional organizations that recommend treatment for acute HCV infection. Health care providers can use this guidance to update their procedures for postexposure testing and clinical management of HCP potentially exposed to hepatitis C virus.

Introduction

Examination of the hepatitis C care cascade in the United States reveals a substantial gap between the number of persons who have a reactive hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody test and those who undergo nucleic acid testing (NAT) for detection of HCV RNA. Performing an HCV RNA test whenever an HCV antibody test is reactive (complete testing) is critical to increase the percentage of patients diagnosed with current HCV infection who are linked to care and receive curative antiviral therapy. To address the challenge of incomplete hepatitis C testing, many laboratories have implemented automatic HCV RNA testing whenever an HCV antibody test result is reactive. "Automatic" testing refers to laboratory testing that occurs without additional action on the part of the patient or the health care provider.

Testing for Hepatitis C Virus

Persons with a reactive HCV antibody test result and detectable HCV RNA are determined to have current HCV infection and should be linked to care. Persons who received a reactive HCV antibody test result and undetectable HCV RNA likely have a resolved HCV infection, although falsely reactive HCV antibody tests can occur. The 2013 CDC testing guidance * describes four possible operational strategies to diagnose current HCV infection:

Blood from a subsequent venipuncture is submitted for HCV RNA testing if the blood sample collected is reactive for HCV antibody during initial testing;
From a single venipuncture, two specimens are collected in separate tubes, one tube for initial HCV antibody testing, and a second tube for HCV RNA testing if the HCV antibody test is reactive;
The same sample of venipuncture blood used for initial HCV antibody testing, if reactive, is reflexed for HCV RNA testing without another blood draw; and
A separate blood sample is submitted for HCV RNA testing if the initial testing of HCV antibody has used finger-stick blood.

Operational strategies 2–4 allow for single-visit sample collection, which ensures that HCV RNA testing is performed automatically without requiring a separate health care visit. Operational strategy 1, however, requires two visits to a health care facility, and therefore leads to missed opportunities for HCV diagnosis and linkage to curative HCV treatment.

### Effective management of hepatitis C molecular testing improves test use without compromising patient management [^111aUpqu]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Context

The availability of effective antiviral therapy for hepatitis C has increased the need for molecular detection and quantification of circulating hepatitis C viral particles. The limits of detection differ for the quantitative and qualitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays; furthermore, adequate patient assessment requires both detection of hepatitis C virus when it is present and quantitation of the viral load when possible. The combination of these factors promotes the simultaneous ordering of both tests with the possibility of generating redundant test information.

Objective

To reduce the number of unnecessary hepatitis C tests performed.

Methods

We established a reflexive testing protocol for quantitative and qualitative RT-PCR testing for hepatitis C.

Results

During a 3(1/2)-month interval, 170 qualitative RT-PCR hepatitis C tests were eliminated (a 59.4% reduction in the number of these tests). This reduction was achieved without a clinically significant change in turnaround time or a compromise of patient care.

Conclusions

Establishing the quantitative and qualitative RT-PCR tests in-house and adopting the reflexive testing protocol was cost-effective and did not compromise patient management or care.

Abbreviations: AASLD-IDSA = American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America; HCP = health care personnel; HCV = hepatitis C virus; NAT = nucleic acid test.

* Baseline testing of HCP for anti-HCV with reflex to a NAT for HCV RNA if positive should be done as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hours) after the exposure and may be simultaneous with source-patient testing. If follow-up testing is recommended based on the source-patient's status, test for HCV RNA at 3–6 weeks postexposure. Testing for HCV RNA performed at 6 weeks postexposure has the advantage of coinciding with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) postexposure testing schedules if HIV surveillance is recommended. If HCV RNA is negative at 3–6 weeks postexposure, a final test for anti-HCV at 4–6 months postexposure is recommended due to the possibility of intermittent periods of aviremia in acute HCV infection. If the HCP was anti-HCV positive and HCV RNA negative at baseline, testing at this time should be conducted for HCV RNA detection, as persons successfully treated for HCV infection will remain anti-HCV positive and HCV RNA negative unless reinfected. Testing performed at 6 months postexposure has the advantage of coinciding with hepatitis B virus (HBV) postexposure testing schedules if HBV testing is recommended. HCP with anti-HCV seroconversion and negative HCV RNA should be referred for further evaluation. False-positive anti-HCV results are known to occur among low-risk populations. Anti-HCV seroconversion occurs on average 8–11 weeks after exposure, although cases of delayed seroconversion have been documented among persons with immunosuppression such as in HIV infection. For persons who had a negative anti-HCV result and are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA can be considered. Also, for persons with a positive anti-HCV and negative HCV RNA result, HCV RNA testing should be repeated if an additional potential HCV exposure occurred within the past 6 months, clinical evidence of HCV infection is present, or concerns exist about specimen integrity, including handling and storage conditions that might have compromised test results. Exposed persons who develop viral syndromes suggestive of acute HCV infection at any point should be retested for HCV RNA. Persons with detectable HCV RNA at any point should be referred to care consistent with current AASLD-IDSA guidelines for evaluation and treatment of all persons with acute or chronic HCV infection. Those persons with acute infection should be treated on initial diagnosis without awaiting spontaneous resolution. Guidance for hepatitis C treatment is evolving with emerging data on treatment with direct-acting antivirals.

### Reflex hepatitis C virus viral load testing following an initial positive hepatitis C virus antibody test: a global systematic review and meta-analysis [^113URceS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Many people who have a positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody (Ab) test never receive a confirmatory HCV RNA viral load (VL) test. Reflex VL testing may help address this problem. We undertook a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of reflex VL testing compared with standard nonreflex approaches on outcomes across the HCV care cascade.

Methods

We searched 4 databases for studies that examined laboratory-based reflex or clinic-based reflex VL testing approaches, with or without a nonreflex comparator, and had data on the uptake of HCV RNA VL test and treatment initiation and turnaround time between Ab and VL testing. Both laboratory- and clinic-based reflex VL testing involve only a single clinic visit. Summary estimates were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses.

Results

Fifty-one studies were included (32 laboratory-based and 19 clinic-based reflex VL testing). Laboratory-based reflex VL testing increased HCV VL test uptake versus nonreflex testing (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.16–1.58) and may improve linkage to care among people with a positive HCV RNA test (RR: 1.47; 95% CI: .81–2.67) and HCV treatment initiation (RR: 1.03; 95% CI: .46–2.32). The median time between Ab and VL test was < 1 day for all laboratory-based reflex studies and 0–5 days for 13 clinic-based reflex testing.

Conclusions

Laboratory-based and clinic-based HCV reflex VL testing increased uptake and reduced time to HCV VL testing and may increase HCV linkage to care. The World Health Organization now recommends reflex VL testing as an additional strategy to promote access to HCV VL testing and treatment.

### Testing for HCV infection: an update of guidance for clinicians and laboratorians [^114enkj8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Recommended Testing Sequence

The testing sequence in this guidance is intended for use by primary care and public health providers seeking to implement CDC recommendations for HCV testing. In most cases, persons identified with HCV viremia have chronic HCV infection. This testing sequence is not intended for diagnosis of acute hepatitis C or clinical evaluation of persons receiving specialist medical care, for which specific guidance is available.

Testing for HCV infection begins with either a rapid or a laboratory-conducted assay for HCV antibody in blood (Figure). A nonreactive HCV antibody result indicates no HCV antibody detected. A reactive result indicates one of the following: 1) current HCV infection, 2) past HCV infection that has resolved, or 3) false positivity. A reactive result should be followed by NAT for HCV RNA. If HCV RNA is detected, that indicates current HCV infection. If HCV RNA is not detected, that indicates either past, resolved HCV infection, or false HCV antibody positivity.

Initial Testing for HCV Antibody

An FDA-approved test for HCV antibody should be used. If the OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test is used, the outcome is reported as reactive or nonreactive. If a laboratory-based assay is used, the outcome is reported as reactive or nonreactive without necessarily specifying signal-to-cutoff ratios.

Testing for HCV RNA

An FDA-approved NAT assay intended for detection of HCV RNA in serum or plasma from blood of at-risk patients who test reactive for HCV antibody should be used. There are several possible operational steps toward NAT after initial testing for HCV antibody:

Blood from a subsequent venipuncture is submitted for HCV NAT if the blood sample collected is reactive for HCV antibody during initial testing.
From a single venipuncture, two specimens are collected in separate tubes: one tube for initial HCV antibody testing; and a second tube for HCV NAT if the HCV antibody test is reactive.
The same sample of venipuncture blood used for initial HCV antibody testing, if reactive, is reflexed to HCV NAT without another blood draw for NAT.
A separate venipuncture blood sample is submitted for HCV NAT if the OraQuick HCV Rapid Antibody Test for initial testing of HCV antibody has used fingerstick blood.

HCV PEP Not Recommended

HCV PEP with DAA therapy is not routinely recommended. The risk for transmission of HCV from percutaneous exposures (0.2%) and mucocutaneous exposures (0%) is low and in most situations does not justify giving DAAs to several hundred exposed HCP because of potential side effects; furthermore, efficient duration of PEP has not been established. DAA therapy is highly efficacious in eradicating acute and chronic infections; therefore, new HCV infections should be identified early and treated, and the strategy of testing and treating if transmission occurs is recommended.

Testing 3–6 Weeks Postexposure

If the source patient is HCV RNA positive or source-patient testing is not performed or not available, HCP baseline testing should be followed by a NAT for HCV RNA at 3–6 weeks after exposure. This test also should be performed if a source patient is anti-HCV positive and no source patient HCV RNA testing is available. A NAT performed at 6 weeks postexposure has the advantage of coinciding with HIV postexposure testing schedules, if recommended.

Testing 4–6 Months Postexposure

For all HCP for whom follow-up testing is recommended, a final test for anti-HCV at 4–6 months with testing for HCV RNA if positive (i.e. either reflex to or follow-up NAT) should be conducted. Testing performed at 6 months postexposure has the advantage of coinciding with hepatitis B virus (HBV) postexposure testing schedules, if recommended. Exposed HCP who develop illness with symptoms indicative of acute HCV infection at any point should be tested for HCV RNA.

No further follow-up is indicated for HCP who remain anti-HCV negative at 4–6 months. However, for those who had a negative anti-HCV result at 4–6 months and are immunocompromised or have liver disease, an additional test for HCV RNA can be considered. Seroconversion from anti-HCV negative to anti-HCV positive with undetectable HCV RNA can indicate resolved infection or acute infection during a period of aviremia. In addition, false-positive anti-HCV tests have been reported to occur. For HCP with a positive anti-HCV result and confirmed undetectable HCV RNA after 4–6 months, a NAT for HCV RNA should be repeated if clinical evidence of HCV infection is present. Tests should be repeated if concerns exist about results being compromised because of storage and handling errors or other issues that might affect specimen integrity.

### Cost-effectiveness of strategies for testing current hepatitis C virus infection [^111J18qV]. Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Six strategies for identifying hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremia, involving testing for HCV antibody (HCVAb) followed by a nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA when the antibody test is positive, are compared. Decision analysis was used to determine mean relative cost per person tested and outcomes of HCV viremia detection. Parameters included proportions of test population with HCVAb and viremia plus specificity, sensitivity, and cost of individual tests. For testing a population with an HCVAb seroprevalence of 3.25%, all strategies when adopting quantitative NAT vary little in cost (range, $29.50-$30.70) and are highly viremia specific (≥ 0.9997). Four of the strategies using venipuncture blood for HCVAb testing (whether laboratory conducted or employing a rapid, point-of-care assay) and for NAT (whether done by reflex or using separately drawn blood) achieve the highest viremia sensitivities (range, 0.9950–0.9954). Point-of-care HCVAb testing in fingerstick blood followed by NAT in venipuncture blood yields relatively lower viremia sensitivity (0.9301). The strategy that requires returning for NAT is even less viremia sensitive (< 0.9000) because of follow-up loss. Strategies adopting qualitative rather than quantitative NAT are slightly cheaper (range, $28.90-$29.99), similarly viremia specific (≥ 0.9997), but less viremia sensitive (≤ 0.9456). Viremia sensitivity and specificity remain the same regardless of the proportion of HCVAb-seropositive persons in the cohort being tested.

Conclusions

Strategies involving HCVAb testing in venipuncture blood, whether laboratory conducted or using a point-of-care assay, when followed by quantitative NAT done reflexively or in separately drawn blood, are comparably economical and suitably viremia sensitive. Less cost-effective is point-of-care HCVAb testing in fingerstick blood followed by NAT in venipuncture blood. Least cost-effective is the strategy requiring the tested person to return for NAT.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis C virus infection, more specifically with respect to injection drug users, AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend to offer routine, opt-out HCV antibody testing with reflexive or immediate confirmatory HCV-RNA testing and linkage to care in infected patients by substance use disorder treatment programs and needle/syringe exchange programs.

### Maximizing reflexive hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing of HCV antibody-reactive samples within United States public health laboratories [^113jwVmu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, 25 out of 46 laboratories (54%) always automatically reflexed or referred an Ab-reactive specimen to RNA testing and 2 additional laboratories sometimes automatically reflexed. One additional laboratory reflexed reactive specimens to HCV genotyping and planned to implement in-house HCV RNA testing and alter reflexing practices at that time. Eleven laboratories (24%) either recommended additional testing or requested additional samples to complete the algorithm. Seven laboratories (15%) reported HCV Ab-reactive specimens as positive, with one of these laboratories performing RNA testing only if the specimen qualified under other, unspecified circumstances.

HCV Diagnostic Meeting

After presentation and discussion of the 4 key questions (Supplementary Table 1) and a public comment period, SMEs put forth 7 recommendations for action towards HCV elimination (Table 2). These recommended actions were focused on the removal of barriers to testing, optimization of current practices and recommendations, and development of new technologies that would enable the use of more efficient algorithms. Reclassification of HCV antibody and RNA tests from class III to class II to help facilitate development of new HCV diagnostics by removal of perceived regulatory barriers (ie, requirement for 510[k] premarket notification instead of premarket approval) was a recommendation that was approved by the FDA shortly after the meeting. Incomplete testing (ie, Ab only) was identified as a major concern and an underlying problem that contributed to the development of many of the recommended actions. To reduce the need for follow-up testing, development of diagnostics with performance characteristics, regulatory claims, and costs that could facilitate use of a single-step testing algorithm was an identified goal. However, until a single-step testing algorithm is available, ensuring completion of the 2-step testing algorithm is critical. Thus, SMEs identified the need to "increase implementation of automatic reflexing of HCV Ab-reactive specimens to HCV RNA testing (following the current recommended algorithm)" as a significant opportunity for improvement of HCV diagnostic methods/approaches.

### Maximizing reflexive hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing of HCV antibody-reactive samples within United States public health laboratories [^113YhKLg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Based on the responses from public health laboratories, there is significant opportunity for increased automatic reflexing and referral. Laboratories that currently offer both Ab and RNA testing could work to implement practices that allow for sharing of specimens between laboratory sections (ie, immunology and molecular) when necessary and work with submitting providers to gain support for removing the option for Ab-only testing. Removal of Ab-only testing orders may have the added benefit of enabling linkage to care when the HCV RNA test is positive and reducing duplicative standalone antibody testing in HCV-reactive individuals which is costly and noninformative. When establishing test menus, laboratories should consider the need to offer not only an HCV antibody with reflex to HCV RNA test, but also a standalone HCV RNA test (particularly quantitative), and potentially an HCV genotyping assay as a reflex or referral test when HCV diagnosis is first established. Although pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals may obviate the need for genotyping, genotyping may be required by insurance companies prior to initiation of HCV treatment.

Data obtained through APHL surveys (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19], etc.) demonstrate US public health laboratories have the capability to perform molecular testing. However, this testing capability is underutilized for NAT for HCV RNA. For example, 99 public health laboratories reported performing molecular testing for COVID-19 during the pandemic response, but only 30 survey respondents performed NAT for HCV RNA. These laboratories could work to implement in-house HCV RNA testing and leverage the capabilities of existing laboratory equipment and staff. Moreover, survey data indicates a higher percentage of laboratories with internal HCV RNA testing capabilities (69%) automatically reflex to an HCV RNA test than laboratories that offer HCV antibody testing only (35%).

For US public health laboratories that do not offer RNA testing, APHL established an HCV NAT Reference Center where public health laboratories can submit qualifying specimens at no cost. Currently, 9 laboratories that refer or recommend additional testing utilize APHL's HCV NAT Reference Center; however, this federally funded service could be further utilized to ensure additional laboratories have the capability to complete the 2-step HCV testing algorithm with a specimen collected during a single patient visit.

### Advancing diagnosis of current hepatitis C virus infection: a key to hepatitis C elimination in the United States [^117Muj3A]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The article by Johnson and colleagues provides a perspective from public health laboratories in the United States in terms of maximizing reflex HCV RNA testing for antibody-positive samples. The authors describe results from a survey conducted by APHL in 2021 of its 99 member laboratories and the outcome of a virtual HCV diagnostic meeting hosted by APHL and CDC in 2021. The need for completion of the current 2-step testing algorithm (testing all anti-HCV reactive samples for HCV RNA) and development of a single-step algorithm for HCV diagnostics in future are further discussed.

The final article by Fricker et al, while examining the tools needed to support same-day diagnosis and treatment of current HCV infection, highlights the challenges with the current multiday diagnosis and treatment, which result in the loss of a number of patients who fail to receive treatment. Current practices, diagnostic tools, and gaps in care in the field of hepatitis C in the United States are also discussed, in addition to the steps that need to be taken for same-day testing and care are discussed. The authors emphasize the need for new tools, such as FDA-approved, CLIA-waived POC antigen tests or NATs for HCV and hepatitis B virus and NATs for human immunodeficiency virus that do not require venous blood; the availability of such tools will bring a paradigm shift in our approach to achieving the goal of same-day testing and treatment.

Eliminating hepatitis C as a public health threat in the United States is achievable but requires unfettered access to early diagnosis and timely treatment. A transformative national hepatitis C elimination program has been proposed by the highest levels of US government. One of the three priorities identified in the proposed national elimination initiative is to accelerate the availability of innovative hepatitis C diagnostic tests, including POC testing supporting same-day testing and treatment. This 8-part supplement characterizes advancements in hepatitis C diagnostics and recent changes in the US regulatory landscape that, together, provide opportunities to expand patient-centered hepatitis C testing and treatment services across the variety of settings where people with hepatitis C receive care. Identifying and seizing these opportunities will be essential to eliminating hepatitis C as a public health threat in the United States.

### Prevalence-based screening by anti-HCV reflex HCV antigen test and accessible post-screening care towards elimination of hepatitis C in rural villages [^117GsGrR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Even though an outreach hepatology clinic model can increase accessibility for HCV care in remote areas with scarce medical resources, referral of all anti-HCV-reactive subjects may still result in futile and tiring journeys as only around half of anti-HCV-reactive individuals were actually viremic according to previous studies in Taiwan. Although anti-HCV has been the standard tool for screening HCV and was adapted and endorsed in recent WHO guidelines, this traditional anti-HCV testing strategy involves a relatively expensive and complicated two-step diagnostic approach with a subsequent confirmatory nucleic acid testing in a central laboratory mandatory. The simplified single-step HCV testing strategy was revealed to be more effective and cost-effective than the traditional two-step testing approach. Technically, the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of this single-step strategy would be increased if HCV RNA testing is replaced by the cheaper and easier HCV antigen testing in the outreach screening setting. The latest guideline of the European Association for the Study of the Liver also recommended reflex testing for either HCVRNA or HCV antigen in patients found to be anti-HCV antibody-positives to shorten pathways to care. Our previous study has demonstrated the feasibility of anti-HCV reflex HCV antigen screening in identifying viremic infection in community screenings which was further validated in this study.

### Dried blood spots and plasma separation cards can broaden access to molecular testing for HBV, HCV and HIV [^113zTFdD]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

This review has some limitations. Studies demonstrating poor performance of DBS or PSC for NAAT might be less likely to be published in peer‐reviewed journals, possibly resulting in biased assessments of performance. Since the PSC is a commercial product that has been available for a much shorter period of time compared to DBS, the number of studies that evaluated PSC is much lower; this could reduce the opportunity for publication of studies evaluating performance. This is not a systematic review, and the publications highlighted as examples may not be representative of all published data; given the heterogeneity in laboratory methods used with DBS, as an uncontrolled product and procedure, a systematic review would be a significant challenge.

Our literature review provides a window into relatively under‐studied aspects of the use of DBS or PSC for NAAT in the context of managing care for HBV, HCV, and HIV‐1 infected persons. These include cost effectiveness compared to use of plasma, especially in LMIC and other difficult to reach populations, larger‐scale comparisons between PSC, DBS and plasma for HBV and HCV, the use of PSC for EID of HIV‐1, and use of PSC for reflex testing, that is PSC as a specimen type for antibody testing followed by retrieval of remnant spots from the same card for NAAT. For reflex testing, it is crucial that differences in requirements for specimen preservation and contamination are considered, since the first test (usually an antibody test) uses a more stable analyte. Since the storage requirements for antibody testing are less stringent than those for RNA‐based NAAT, the specimen must always be treated as if it will be used for NAAT until it has been determined whether the RNA NAAT test will be needed. This applies to both temperature and humidity control as well as the potential for inter‐specimen molecular contamination.

In conclusion, DBS and PSC are feasible alternatives for specimen collection that overcome constraints related to reliance on plasma as the specimen type for NAAT to diagnose and monitor HBV, HCV, and HIV‐1 infections. Each alternative has advantages as well as technical limitations. Additional operational research and sharing of lessons learnt will guide the choice of DBS and PSC for diverse settings and target populations. With this growing body of experience, DBS and PSC based NAAT testing will simplify viral testing and care helping countries reach goals for HBV, HCV and HIV elimination.

### Testing and clinical management of health care personnel potentially exposed to hepatitis C virus guidance, United States, 2020 [^117KHm5f]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Evidence

Updated Guidance from Clinical Organizations

Recent guidance from AASLD and IDSA recommends a test-and-treat strategy for persons with acute HCV infection on initial diagnosis without awaiting spontaneous resolution. Although spontaneous clearance occurs in approximately 25% to 45% of acute infections, delays introduced by waiting for clearance might be associated with substantial anxiety on the part of the exposed HCP, might result in lost work time and risk for transmission depending on the HCP's HCV RNA level, and might increase the possibility of loss to follow-up. Furthermore, emerging data about treatment of acute HCV infection with shortened courses of all-oral, direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens demonstrate potential benefit for treatment during the acute phase (,–).

Follow-Up Testing of HCV-Exposed HCP

For exposed HCP for whom follow-up testing is indicated, CDC continues to recommend early testing for HCV RNA at 3–6 weeks after exposure. HCV RNA becomes detectable on average within 1 week after exposure; most infected persons will have detectable HCV RNA within 1–2 weeks of exposure when tested with HCV RNA detection tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, CDC now recommends additional follow-up testing at 4–6 months for anti-HCV with reflex or follow-up HCV RNA if anti-HCV positive because of the possibility of intermittent periods of aviremia during acute HCV infection. This phenomenon has been reported previously among exposed persons, including those who progressed to chronic infection, primarily when using older HCV RNA tests (,–). Anti-HCV seroconversion occurs, on average, 8–11 weeks after exposure, although cases of delayed seroconversion have been documented among persons with immunosuppression (e.g. immunosuppression from human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection). Frequency of testing during the follow-up period depends on the management objectives and plan for timing of therapy if seroconversion occurs.

### Dried blood spots and plasma separation cards can broaden access to molecular testing for HBV, HCV and HIV [^112azwkD]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

The preferred biological specimen type for NAAT testing is blood plasma or serum, from which viral nucleic acids are extracted. Proper collection, handling, storage and shipment of plasma involves several steps (Figure 1). Each of these steps has environmental condition requirements (e.g. limits on temperature, time, and humidity) to preserve the integrity of nucleic acid(s). For example, plasma must be frozen for long‐term storage to prevent genomic nucleic acid degradation during storage and shipping. Furthermore, phlebotomy should only be performed by a trained technician using the necessary equipment in an appropriate setting, and transfer of potentially infectious materials from one tube to another should take place under strict biosafety procedures. These requirements cannot be met in many locations, due to paucity of trained personnel, lack of reliable electricity supply for biosafety cabinets, refrigerators and freezers, and limited availability of dry ice for shipping frozen specimens. This restricts the reach of diagnostic testing to settings that can support the required steps and excludes many rural settings in LMIC where phlebotomists and/or a cold chain for preservation and shipping are not available. Thus, reliance on plasma specimens for NAAT represents an important barrier to reaching the epidemic control goals set forth by the WHO and other agencies.

FIGURE 1
Comparison of steps for preparation of plasma, DBS and PSC. The steps required for specimen preparation when NAAT is indicated are shown. Both DBS and PSC can be prepared using capillary blood (e.g. form a finger prick) or venous blood following venipuncture. Nucleic acids extracted from DBS will contain relatively more DNA (illustrated as a double helix) versus RNA (single stranded). EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; PPT, plasma preparation tube; DBS, dried blood spot; O/N, overnight; PSC, plasma separation card.

In addition to resource constraints in LMIC, the requirement to attend a phlebotomy facility can be an obstacle in certain populations in resource‐rich countries, such as the rurally located, unhoused, and people who inject drugs (PWID). For such populations, there can be significant losses in follow‐up when multiple clinic visits are needed. For this reason, WHO and others have recommended decentralised reflex testing for HBV and HCV, a two‐step diagnostic algorithm whereby a positive rapid antibody test is followed by NAAT using the same specimen or a second one collected at the same visit.

Introduction

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver-related mortality with 71 million people chronically infected globally. Recent advances in direct acting antiviral treatments have improved cure rates to > 95%. However, currently an estimated 80% of all infected individuals are unaware of their status due to the asymptomatic nature of infection. Many of these patients will remain undiagnosed until irreversible clinical manifestations, such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, develop, contributing to the 400,000 HCV related deaths reported every year.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has established a global elimination strategy to reach significant disease reduction targets by 2030. The most challenging obstacle in achieving this ambitious goal is the rapid diagnosis of patients and their integration into an appropriate clinical care pathway for treatment.

Current diagnostic strategies rely on testing for anti-HCV antibodies followed by RNA or core antigen detection. This two-step process requires a centralised laboratory infrastructure and delays active HCV infection diagnosis by significant periods of time. Successful implementation is also limited by cost, long turnaround times and the high level of expertise required for diagnostic testing. High risk groups, including people-who-inject-drugs (PWID), are often lost to follow-up due to the multiple visits required for HCV diagnosis. Additionally, absent or delayed seroconversion, particularly in immunocompromised patients, may reduce overall rates of diagnosis.

Most individuals with HCV reside in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with only limited access to diagnosis. Although recent advances in HCV nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have provided a possible solution for improving the management of HCV diagnosis, the existing diagnostic platforms still pose several limitations, including the high cost and training requirements associated with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, especially when used in decentralised testing. Not only are simpler and cheaper NAATs for point-of-care (POC) testing required in order to improve HCV diagnosis and eliminate the need for follow-up visits, but importantly, the selection of a universal NAATs' target is needed. HCV, like many RNA viruses, exhibits high genetic diversity, with eight distinct HCV genotypes and at least 90 different subtypes identified with varied prevalence gobally.

### Significant improvement in diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection by a one-step strategy in a central laboratory: an optimal tool for hepatitis C elimination? [^113xDhLj]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

The remarkable effectivity of current antiviral therapies has led to consider the elimination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. However, HCV infection is highly underdiagnosed; therefore, a global strategy for eliminating it requires improving the effectiveness of HCV diagnosis to identify hidden cases. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of a protocol for HCV diagnosis based on viral load reflex testing of anti-HCV antibody-positive patients (known as one-step diagnosis) by analyzing all diagnostic tests performed by a central laboratory covering an area of 1.5 million inhabitants in Barcelona, Spain, before (83,786 cases) and after (45,935 cases) the implementation of the reflex testing protocol. After its implementation, the percentage of anti-HCV-positive patients with omitted HCV RNA determination remarkably decreased in most settings, particularly in drug treatment centers and primary care settings, where omitted HCV RNA analyses had absolute reductions of 76.4 and 20.2%, respectively. In these two settings, the percentage of HCV RNA-positive patients identified as a result of reflex testing accounted for 55 and 61% of all anti-HCV-positive patients. HCV RNA results were provided in a mean of 2 days. The presence of HCV RNA and age of ≥ 65years were significantly associated with advanced fibrosis, assessed using the serological FIB-4 index (odds ratio [OR], 5.92; 95% confidence interval, 3.4 to 10.4). The implementation of viral load reflex testing in a central laboratory is feasible and significantly increases the diagnostic effectiveness of HCV infections, while allowing the identification of underdiagnosed cases.

### What hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic tools are needed to advance diagnosis of current HCV infection in outreach settings and in a nonclinical setting? [^115f6fEV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Given the growing hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic in the United States, it is imperative to implement a coordinated, equitable public health approach to HCV testing that will facilitate immediate access to treatment, especially for individuals with limited healthcare access and those who inject drugs. Point-of-care RNA diagnostic tests have the greatest potential to address this need. Future regulatory approval has been facilitated by a recent change in the US Food and Drug Administration's approach to evaluating point-of-care diagnostic tests that have been developed and validated.

### Balancing efficiency and accuracy in hepatitis C rapid antibody testing: insights from a cluster randomised crossover trial [^112aVjkn]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results highlight the potential of a five‐minute read time as an adjunct to the 20‐min OraQuick test, triggering RNA testing for positive results at five minutes and assuming resolved infections for results positive only at 20 min. This approach offers efficiency benefits that must be balanced against the possibility of missing a small proportion of viraemic individuals with a five‐minute OraQuick test. Reflexive RNA testing remains essential alongside rapid antibody testing to differentiate active from resolved infections. Ongoing evaluation and adaptation of testing protocols are important to identify their context‐specific considerations, maximise their utility in priority populations and remain on track to eliminate hepatitis C.

DISCUSSION

The results from this study show how the application of a viral load reflex testing (or one-step) protocol for the diagnosis of HCV infections in a central laboratory allows an outstanding increase in diagnostic rates, particularly in the primary care setting, which in our discipline entails the main entry point for new cases of HCV infection, and drug treatment centers, where hepatitis C has the highest prevalence in our area (21%).

To implement this screening protocol, it was essential to first ensure the suitability of the sample in which the viral load was to be determined. The fact that the flow cytometry analyzer keeps samples capped while processing them — thus preventing contact with aerosols and environmental RNAses — strongly reduced the likelihood of contamination and deterioration of viral RNA. Furthermore, the probability of a sample free of HCV RNA matching a sample with a detectable viral load in the same analytical sequence was in fact much lower than the probability of both samples coexisting in the same anti-HCV antibody determination sequence in the serology analyzer (even taking into account the low probability in the Cobas 8000 analyzer due to the use of disposable tips). Despite the a priori favorable conditions to implement the reflex testing protocol, an occasional error in the washing system of the blood count analyzer could cause minimal contamination, like that observed in two of the nine analyzed samples in which HCV RNA was detected, although in amounts below the quantification limit of 15 IU/ml. In this regard, it is important to mention that, in naive patients, viral loads have been previously reported to be > 3 logs in a very high proportion (EASL guidelines) or even > 2 logs based on our own experience. In fact, in the cases analyzed in this study, after application of the HCV RNA reflex testing, only nine cases (one in the primary care setting and eight in the CAS setting) showed HCV RNA levels of < 2 logs. Among them, only five cases with levels of < 15 IU/ml (four in CAS and one in primary care) were observed, which, after further investigation, were all related to antiviral treatment. Hence, a value of < 15 IU/ml should be considered irrelevant in the context of a new diagnosis. Still, faced with this potential risk, the need to evaluate the viral load in a new sample in cases with an HCV RNA level of ≤ 2 logs was included in the protocol (Fig. 2). Given the sampling path in our area, the sample collected for blood count analysis seems to be optimal for viral load reflex testing; however, other type of samples processed before could be used, provided that their adequacy (i.e. stability and lack of contamination) has been assessed. This possibility is also indicated in our recommended algorithm, which in fact is currently being implemented in all Catalonia.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115Kbc79]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnosis in adults and adolescents with HIV — On entry into HIV care, all patients should undergo routine HCV screening (AII). Initial testing for HCV should be performed using a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved immunoassay licensed for detection of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) in blood. For at-risk HCV-seronegative individuals, specifically MSM or persons who inject drugs, HCV antibody testing, using an FDA-approved immunoassay, is recommended annually or as indicated by clinical presentation, risk activities, or exposure (AII). Concordantly, both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) HCV guidance and CDC PrEP guidelines also recommend HCV serologic testing at baseline and every 12 months for MSM, transgender women, and people who inject drugs. Nucleic acid testing for HCV RNA is recommended in settings where acute infection is suspected or in persons with known prior infection cleared spontaneously or after treatment (AIII). False-negative anti-HCV antibody results are possible among people with HIV but uncommon (2% to 4%), and more likely to be seen in patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count < 200 cells/ mm3), and HCV RNA testing should be performed in those patients with risk factors or unexplained ALT elevation. Following acute HCV infection, the duration of the window period prior to seroconversion is highly variable, ranging from 2 weeks to more than 24 weeks, with antibody response in most persons detectable at 8 to 12 weeks, and high ALT levels should prompt testing for HCV RNA if serologic test results are negative or indeterminate in individuals at risk of HCV infection. Individuals who test positive for HCV antibody should undergo additional diagnostic testing by using a sensitive quantitative assay to measure plasma HCV RNA level and confirm current infection (AI), and this should preferentially be done as an automatic reflex to HCV RNA testing of the leftover serum from the blood draw for antibody testing to facilitate diagnosis. Reinfection can occur in those who clear infection, and diagnosing a new active infection will require HCV RNA testing in such individuals (AII).

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C testing among perinatally exposed infants and children-United States, 2023 [^111Tjo2i]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

The elimination of hepatitis C is a national priority (https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/Viral-Hepatitis-National-Strategic-Plan-2021-2025.pdf). During 2010–2021, hepatitis C virus (HCV) acute and chronic infections (hereinafter referred to as HCV infections) increased in the United States, consequences of which include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. Rates of acute infections more than tripled among reproductive-aged persons during this time (from 0.8 to 2.5 per 100,000 population among persons aged 20–29 years and from 0.6 to 3.5 among persons aged 30–39 years). Because acute HCV infection can lead to chronic infection, this has resulted in increasing rates of HCV infections during pregnancy. Approximately 6%-7% of perinatally exposed (i.e., exposed during pregnancy or delivery) infants and children will acquire HCV infection. Curative direct-acting antiviral therapy is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for persons aged ≥ 3 years. However, many perinatally infected children are not tested or linked to care. In 2020, because of continued increases in HCV infections in the United States, CDC released universal screening recommendations for adults, which included recommendations for screening for pregnant persons during each pregnancy (Schillie S, Wester C, Osborne M, Wesolowski L, Ryerson AB. CDC recommendations for hepatitis C screening among adults-United States, 2020. MMWR Recomm Rep 2020;69[No. RR-2]:1–17). This report introduces four new CDC recommendations: 1) HCV testing of all perinatally exposed infants with a nucleic acid test (NAT) for detection of HCV RNA at age 2–6 months; 2) consultation with a health care provider with expertise in pediatric hepatitis C management for all infants and children with detectable HCV RNA; 3) perinatally exposed infants and children with an undetectable HCV RNA result at or after age 2 months do not require further follow-up unless clinically warranted; and 4) a NAT for HCV RNA is recommended for perinatally exposed infants and children aged 7–17 months who previously have not been tested, and a hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) test followed by a reflex NAT for HCV RNA (when anti-HCV is reactive) is recommended for perinatally exposed children aged ≥ 18 months who previously have not been tested. Proper identification of perinatally infected children, referral to care, and curative treatment are critical to achieving the goal of hepatitis C elimination.

### Balancing efficiency and accuracy in hepatitis C rapid antibody testing: insights from a cluster randomised crossover trial [^112JuXti]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Our results highlight a clinical trade‐off between reducing unnecessary reflexive RNA testing and ensuring accurate viremia detection. Reducing the OraQuick rapid antibody test read time from 20 min to five would have reduced unnecessary reflexive RNA testing by approximately 13% in our cohort, at the cost of failing to detect around 2.5% of viraemic participants. With the five‐minute OraQuick test, 64% of participants with detected antibodies were non‐viraemic, showing the need for confirmatory RNA testing to differentiate active from resolved infections.

Declining hepatitis C testing rates necessitate re‐evaluation of the testing and treatment paradigm. Rapid antibody tests, such as the OraQuick test, are adaptable, with a five‐minute read time proving a useful diagnostic complement to the 20‐min test. A positive OraQuick result at five minutes triggers reflexive RNA testing, while individuals without detectable hepatitis C antibodies at five minutes but with them at 20 min are likely non‐viraemic and do not require further RNA testing. This dual approach could streamline diagnosis, increase throughput in large screening programmes, and lower costs through reducing unnecessary RNA testing for non‐viraemic individuals. Our data indicate that, in our cohort, this approach would identify and administer RNA testing to 97.5% of viraemic individuals and 87% of non‐viraemic individuals with residual antibodies, with the remaining individuals not receiving RNA testing.

All children perinatally exposed to HCV should receive a NAT for HCV RNA at age 2 to 6 months; infants and children aged 7 to 17 months who have not previously been tested should receive a NAT for HCV RNA; and children aged ≥ 18 months who previously have not been tested should receive an anti-HCV test with reflex to NAT for HCV RNA when anti-HCV is reactive (strong, high). Undetectable HCV RNA at age 2 to 6 months is highly suggestive (> 99% negative predictive value) of perinatal transmission, and perinatally exposed children aged ≥ 18 months with nonreactive anti-HCV test results do not have hepatitis C (strong, low). Infants and children with detectable HCV RNA should be managed in consultation with a provider with expertise in pediatric hepatitis C management and receive regular follow-up care until eligible for HCV treatment at age 3 years (strong, high), and children aged 3 years or older should receive HCV treatment.

### Hepatitis C: diagnosis and management [^111a3eT6]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Screening recommendations and treatment guidelines for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have been updated. People at the greatest risk of HCV infection are those between 18 and 39 years of age and those who use injection drugs. Universal screening with an anti-HCV antibody test with follow-up reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing for positive results to confirm active disease is recommended at least once for all adults 18 years and older and during each pregnancy. Any person with ongoing risk factors should be screened periodically as long as the at-risk behavior persists. One-time screening is recommended for patients younger than 18 years with risk factors. For treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, a simplified treatment regimen consisting of eight weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir results in greater than 95% cure rates. Undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completing therapy is considered a virologic cure (i.e., sustained virologic response). A sustained virologic response is associated with lower all-cause mortality and improves hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations, cognitive function, physical health, work productivity, and quality of life. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, posttreatment surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal varices should include abdominal ultrasonography (with or without alpha fetoprotein) every six months and upper endoscopy every two to three years. In the absence of cirrhosis, no liver-related follow-up is recommended.

### Real-world utility of HCV core antigen as an alternative to HCV RNA testing: implications for viral load and genotype [^116rKcqM]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2020). Medium credibility.

Following positive serology, the gold standard confirmatory test of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is detection of HCV RNA by PCR. We assessed the utility of HCV core antigen testing to identify active infection among those positive for anti-HCV antibodies, when introduced to routine testing. We identified serum samples that were tested at a single laboratory in Scotland from June 2011to December 2017. Serum samples testing positive for HCV antibodies (HCV Ab positive) followed by reflex HCV core antigen (Ag) testing during the study period were identified. Those patients for whom a PCR test was requested on the baseline sample were also identified. For this group, the sensitivity and specificity of HCV Ag as a diagnostic tool were assessed using HCV PCR as gold standard. In our cohort of 744 patients, we demonstrated a sensitivity of 82.1% (95% CI 77.1%-86.2%) and a specificity of 99.8% (95% CI 98.6%-100%). Genotype 3 was associated with increased odds of a false-negative result (OR = 3.59, 95% CI: 1.32–9.71), and reduced odds of a false negative were associated with older age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88–0.97 per year) and viral load (OR = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.05–0.21 per log 10 IU/ml). While the implementation of HCV core antigen testing for diagnosis could lead to significant cost savings in national screening programmes, our data suggest that a significant proportion of HCV-infected individuals may be missed. These findings have implications for HCV diagnosis and determination of viral clearance after treatment, particularly in low- and middle-income regions, where genotype 3 is prevalent.

CDC Recommendations for Hepatitis C Testing Among Perinatally Exposed Infants and Children

CDC recommends HCV testing for all infants and children born to pregnant persons with current or probable HCV infection (Box). A pregnant person with a current HCV infection has detectable HCV RNA. A pregnant person is considered to have a probable infection if anti-HCV testing is reactive and HCV RNA results are not available.

BOX
CDC recommendations for hepatitis C testing among perinatally exposed infants and children — United States, 2023

All infants and children born to pregnant persons with current or probable hepatitis C virus infection should be tested for hepatitis C. Pregnant persons with detectable HCV RNA are considered to have current HCV infection. If anti-HCV testing is reactive and HCV RNA results are not available, pregnant persons are considered to have probable HCV infection. *
Perinatally exposed infants should receive a NAT for HCV RNA at age 2–6 months to identify children in whom chronic HCV infection might develop. † Infants with detectable HCV RNA should be managed in consultation with a health care provider with expertise in pediatric hepatitis C management.

* Because a pregnant person with a detectable HCV RNA test anytime during pregnancy (even if followed by an undetectable HCV RNA test) can potentially transmit HCV during the infectious period, the infant should be tested for HCV RNA. If no HCV test is available from pregnancy and the most recent NAT indicates detectable HCV RNA in the absence of treatment, a pregnant person is considered to have current HCV infection. Similarly, if no HCV test is available from pregnancy and the most recent anti-HCV test is reactive in the absence of an undetectable HCV RNA or treatment, a pregnant person is considered to have probable HCV infection.

### HCV testing and treatment of adults in the United States: 2014 through 2021-data from two national commercial testing laboratories [^116W4Tqb]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Results

During the period January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2021, a total of 46,646,661 individuals were tested for hepatitis C antibody at the two nationwide commercial laboratories. Of the individuals tested, 2,253,500 (4.8%) were HCV antibody positive. During the same period, 3,117,372 persons were tested for HCV RNA and 1,951,742 (62.6%) were viremic (Figure 1). The number of individuals tested for HCV antibody increased each year from 2014 through 2019 (Figure 2). The number of HCV antibody tests decreased slightly in 2020, likely reflective of the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic followed by an increase in 2021. From 2014 through 2021, the proportion of individuals who received reflex HCV RNA testing of HCV Ab+ specimens rose from 21% in 2014 to 36% in 2021 (Figure 2). A greater proportion of men tested positive for HCV RNA compared to women, 63.1% versus 36.8%, respectively (Table 1).

RESULTS

HCV Diagnostics Survey

Eighty-two public health laboratories (83%) completed the survey. State laboratories, including the District of Columbia, had a slightly higher response rate (89%, 48/54) than local laboratories (76%, 34/45). Out of the 82 responding laboratories, 51 (62%) offered HCV testing of any kind in 2019–2020. State laboratories (75%, 36/48) were more likely to offer HCV testing as compared to local laboratories (44%, 15/34). One local laboratory discontinued HCV services in 2020 with no additional information provided.

Of the 50 laboratories that performed any kind of HCV testing, 92% (46/50) performed HCV Ab tests, either laboratory based or rapid tests, and 60% (30/50) offered quantitative or qualitative HCV RNA testing. About half (52%, 26/50) of these laboratories performed both in-house HCV Ab testing and HCV RNA testing, 40% (20/50) performed only HCV Ab testing, and 8% (4/50) performed only HCV RNA testing (Table 1).

Table 1.
HCV Testing Algorithms Performed by Public Health Laboratories

Fewer than half (39%, 18/46) of all laboratories performing HCV Ab testing always automatically reflexed Ab-reactive specimens to in-house RNA testing; 2 additional laboratories reflexed Ab-reactive specimens to in-house RNA testing upon request from the submitting provider (Table 1). These 2 laboratories partially achieved the ideal testing algorithm; however, because a provider can request Ab testing alone, specimens may still not complete the recommended algorithm. Additionally, 7 laboratories that did not offer in-house HCV RNA testing automatically referred Ab-reactive specimens to another laboratory for HCV RNA testing using the original sample or another sample already submitted (Table 1). Our findings show that a higher percentage of laboratories that offer both in-house HCV Ab and HCV RNA testing (69%, 18/26) complete the HCV testing algorithm with a sample(s) that was already submitted as compared to laboratories that offer only HCV Ab testing (35%, 7/20).

### CDC recommendations for hepatitis C testing among perinatally exposed infants and children-United States, 2023 [^111LdRm6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Perinatal HCV Testing Recommendations of Other Organizations

CDC testing recommendations differ in certain ways from those of other organizations, particularly on the ages at which testing should occur (Table 2). CDC testing recommendations focus on an earlier infant age range of 2–6 months because of increasing rates of pediatric hepatitis C, high rates of loss to follow-up among exposed infants and children, and the increased effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of earlier hepatitis C diagnosis with a NAT for HCV RNA in young infants. As of 2023, AASLD-IDSA, NASPGHAN, and AAP recommend anti-HCV testing at age ≥ 18 months with reflex to NAT for HCV RNA among perinatally exposed children. These organizations also recommend considering a NAT for HCV RNA at age ≥ 2 months in certain circumstances. AAFP recommends two separate NATs for HCV RNA at age 2–6 months or an anti-HCV test at age ≥ 15 months. AASLD-IDSA and AAP recommend an anti-HCV test ≥ 18 months, regardless of the exposed child's HCV RNA result during infancy. AASLD-IDSA also recommends a NAT for HCV RNA at age 3 years for those with perinatal HCV transmission to confirm chronic infection. AASLD-IDSA and NASPGHAN recommend screening siblings of perinatally infected children.

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection? [^111VtT1S]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

HCV Core Antigen

An alternative to HCV RNA measurement is the use of HCV core antigen (Ag). As a direct measure of a structural viral protein, detection of core Ag in the blood is equivalent to detecting HCV RNA. HCV core Ag is highly specific and correlates well with HCV RNA but is less sensitive, with existing assays reporting an analytical sensitivity equivalent to approximately 3000 IU/mL of HCV RNA. Current core Ag platforms are automated but require a central laboratory and with current technology, POC assays have proven difficult to develop due to challenges with virion lysis, dissociation of the core Ag from antibody complexes, and the need for signal amplification to improve sensitivity. However, core Ag tests can be done on the same sample as HCV antibody tests.

Although core Ag test is cheaper than HCV RNA testing and could theoretically be used as a first-line test, the sensitivity may be a relevant issue. In a large study of 62 000 samples from patients with chronic HCV infection of varying genotypes, Freiman and colleagues reported that 97% of samples were above 1000 IU/mL and 95% were above 3000 IU/mL. Current commercial HCV RNA assays have sensitivity of 12–15 IU/mL and the GenXpert POC RNA test has a lower limit of detection of 40 IU/mL. Notably, Freiman et al found that the factors associated with an HCV RNA level below 1000 IU/mL were genotype 3 infection, HIV coinfection, and the presence of cirrhosis, populations that would be particularly concerning to miss. In large real-world studies of core Ag testing, sensitivity ranges from 87% to 94% compared to HCV RNA, with most core Ag-negative samples showing low HCV RNA levels. Mutations in the core region that interfere with detection may also give false-negative results. Despite this observation, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) has recommended that new assays for HCV viremia must only be able to detect samples equivalent to HCV RNA levels of 1000 IU/mL or greater.

### Half a diagnosis: gap in confirming infection among hepatitis C antibody-positive patients [^1141ZqmG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Recent guidelines recommend testing all individuals born during 1945–1965 for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody. For antibody-positive patients, subsequent RNA testing is necessary to determine current infection status. This study aimed to assess whether clinicians order HCV RNA tests as recommended for antibody-positive patients and to identify barriers to such testing.

Methods

We sampled individuals newly reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's HCV surveillance system and collected information from clinicians. For patients without RNA test results, we asked the reason an RNA test was not ordered and requested that the clinician order the test.

Results

Of 245 antibody-positive patients, 67% were tested for HCV RNA (for 21% of these, the test was ordered only after our request); 33% had no RNA testing despite our request. Patients without RNA testing were seen in medical facilities (47%), detox facilities (30%), and jail/prison (15%). Reasons RNA testing was not done were that the patient did not return for follow-up (35%), the facility does not do RNA testing (22%), and the patient was tested in jail (15%).

Conclusions

In our study, one third of patients did not get complete testing for accurate diagnosis of HCV, which is essential for medical management. Additional education for clinicians about the importance of RNA testing may help. However, with improved antiviral treatments now available for HCV, it is time for reflex HCV RNA testing for positive antibody tests to become routine, just as reflex Western blot testing is standard for human immunodeficiency virus.

### Real-life validation of a sample pooling strategy for screening of hepatitis C [^111Atrmf]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To test a real-life sample pooling screening strategy which contributes to increasing the diagnostic capacity of clinical laboratories and expanding access to massive screening of hepatitis C.

Methods

After evaluating the sensitivity of the pooling strategy for seven different commercial assays which are used to determine the concentration of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA in the plasma or serum, consecutive samples submitted for HCV diagnosis during the first 3 weeks of November 2021 were tested for HCV antibodies and, in parallel and in a blinded way, were pooled into 100 samples and tested for HCV-RNA. When the result was positive, a strategy to un-mask the positive(s) pool(s), which needed up to 15 total HCV-RNA tests, was used.

Results

All platforms were able to detect the presence of HCV-RNA in a single sample from a patient with viremic HCV present in pools of up to at least 10 000 HCV-RNA-free samples. A total of 1700 samples (17 pools) were analysed, with an overall prevalence of anti-HCV and HCV-RNA of 0.24%. After pooling, we could detect all samples previously detected using standard diagnosis tests (reflex testing) with a specificity and sensitivity of 100% (CI, 99.78–100%). Given the median current prices of anti-HCV and HCV-RNA on the market in Spain as well as personnel costs, testing using the pooling strategy would have resulted in a save of 3320€.

Conclusions

Here, we demonstrated that by improving cost effectiveness, with no loss of sensitivity and specificity, the strategy of pooling samples may serve as an appropriate tool for use in large-scale screening of HCV.

### Diagnosis and monitoring of HCV infection using the cobasHCV test for use on the cobas6800 / 8800 systems [^1144brem]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Accurate, sensitive, and specific tests for detection and monitoring of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA concentrations are essential for diagnosis and management of HCV infections. We evaluated the next-generation reverse-transcription real-time PCR test, cobas ® HCV test for use with the cobas ® 6800/8800 systems ("cobas HCV") by determining its analytical performance characteristics and clinical utility for the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of chronic HCV infections.

Methods

The limit of detection (LOD), linearity, precision, specificity, matrix equivalence of plasma and serum, and quantitative agreement with the COBAS ® AmpliPrep/COBAS ® TaqMan ® HCV Test version 2.0 ("CAP/CTM HCV v2") were evaluated. Clinical utility for the diagnosis of chronic HCV infection was demonstrated by testing plasma from HCV seropositive individuals and comparing results to a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) approved for use in the diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C. Clinical specificity was investigated by testing plasma from HCV antibody negative subjects with non-HCV related liver diseases. Utility for monitoring treatment response was defined by testing plasma collected during treatment of HCV genotypes (GT) 1, 2, and 3 and determining positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and the odds ratio (OR) for predicting cure (sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment cessation, "SVR12").

Results

The cobas HCV test demonstrated an LOD of at least 15 IU/mL and measurable range from 15 to at least 1.0E + 08 IU/mL (1.2–8.0 log 10 IU/mL) for GT 1–6, with high accuracy (≤ 0.16 log 10 difference) and precision (standard deviation 0.04–0.14 log 10) throughout the linear range. Paired plasma and serum samples showed highly correlated performance (R 2 = 0.97). Quantification was 100% specific for HCV in analytical studies. Correlation with CAP/CTM HCV v2 was high in patient samples (mean titer difference: 0.05 log 10 with a 95% CI: 0.03–0.06 log 10). For the diagnosis of chronic HCV, positive and negative percent agreement between cobas HCV and the comparator NAAT were 98.8–100% on the cobas 6800 and 8800 systems. Clinical specificity of cobas HCV using samples from HCV antibody negative subjects with non-HCV related liver diseases was 99.6% and 100% on cobas 6800 and 8800 systems. In therapeutic monitoring and SVR12 prediction during experimental treatment for chronic HCV GT 1 infections, undetectable HCV RNA by cobas HCV at different on-treatment weeks had a PPV 76.8%-79.4%, NPV 29.9%-100%, and OR 1.64–47.52. During therapy of HCV GT 2 and GT 3, treatment week 4 and 12 results were: PPV, 84.7% and 75.3%; NPV, 47.8% and 50.0%; OR, 5.09 and 3.05.

Conclusions

The cobas HCV test is highly sensitive, specific, and accurate HCV RNA test for GT 1–6. It demonstrates excellent correlation with the FDA-approved CAP/CTM HCV v2 test. It is useful clinically for detection of active HCV infection in individuals that have had a positive anti-HCV antibody test result and in monitoring treatment response.

### Primary care perspectives on hepatitis C virus screening, diagnosis and linking patients to appropriate care [^113fXnp5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Enormous progress has been made in recent years toward effectively treating and curing patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). However, at least half of the possible 7 million individuals infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the US remain undiagnosed. The formidable task of increasing the number of patients diagnosed, and subsequently linked to appropriate care has fallen to primary care clinicians, who are mandated by some US States to offer screening to individuals born between 1945 and 1965 (the Baby Boomer Generation). This peer-reviewed video roundtable discussion http://hepcresource.amjmed.com/Content/jplayer/video_roundtable.html#video0 addresses the challenges encountered by primary care clinicians faced with the increasing societal need to screen for HCV, make appropriate diagnoses, and subsequently link infected patients to appropriate care. Discussion in this roundtable initially focuses on the offering of HCV screening to patients in primary care settings. Roundtable participants discuss the need for primary care clinicians to ask appropriate risk factor-based questions of their patients, especially if the ongoing HCV epidemic is to be curtailed. The participants note, however, that the majority of patients currently infected with HCV in the US are Baby Boomers, and USPTF guidelines require this population to be tested for HCV regardless of any past risk-taking behaviors. So while asking the right questions is important, the failure of a Baby Boomer to recall risk-taking behavior does not preclude HCV screening. In fact, clinicians should proactively screen all persons in this birth cohort, and be more sensitive and open to screening requests from these individuals. Roundtable participants also discuss how HCV screening results should be communicated to patients, and how physicians can keep patients engaged and not lost to follow-up after an initial positive HCV antibody test. Patients screened and found to be HCV antibody positive require a follow-up HCV RNA test, and every effort must be made to overcome the challenge of losing patients between these two steps. Good communication between the physician, the physician's office staff, and the patient is necessary. In addition, point-of-care tests and PCR reflex testing can alleviate the need for HCV antibody positive patients to arrange subsequent office visits to undergo confirmatory HCV RNA testing. Physician and patient perspectives are presented throughout this roundtable discussion to obtain a complete picture of the management barriers encountered prior to initiation of therapy. Physician perspectives are provided by Edward Lebovics, the Upham Professor of Gastroenterology and Director of the Sarah C. Upham Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatobiliary Diseases at New York Medical College and Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla, New York, and Richard Torres, Chief Medical Officer at Optimus Health Care and an Associate Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine. Torres has been a primary care provider for 29 years, working at the largest federally qualified community health center in Southwestern CT, which provides over 240,000 patient visits annually primarily to populations that are underserved and suffering from healthcare disparities. Patient perspectives in this roundtable are provided by Lucinda K. Porter, RN, who is the author of two books for hepatitis C patients, and is a former hepatology nurse and hepatitis C patient. She has been advocating for others since 1997, and writes for the HCV Advocate. Lucinda is a contributing editor of HEP magazine, and she blogs at www. LucindaPorterRN.com. The overall goal of this video roundtable discussion is to demonstrate that when provided with appropriate clinical knowledge, and aided by supportive collaborations with appropriate specialists, primary care clinicians should be able to effectively screen, diagnose, and link patients with hepatitis C to appropriate care. While patients need to be educated on the possible outcomes of a positive HCV antibody test, the significance of a positive HCV RNA test, and how to prevent further transmission, they should also be assured that currently available therapies have dramatically increased the chances of being cured. Appropriate education and the availability of excellent treatment options will hopefully quell fears and increase the morale of patients as they navigate the process of HCV screening and diagnosis.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with HDV co-infection, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining reflex testing for anti-HDV antibody testing following a positive HBsAg test result and also for HDV RNA testing (where available) following a positive anti-HDV antibody test result as an additional strategy to promote diagnosis.

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection? [^113925Su]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

To accelerate HCV elimination efforts, diagnostic paradigms will have to be simplified. Development of single-step approaches to diagnosis of current HCV infection is likely possible but current tools have significant limitations including cost, turnaround time and sensitivity. The rapid development of high-quality diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 will hopefully lead to innovation in other fields. Until simple POC tests for viremia are available, it will be important to optimally match testing approaches to the population and the setting to ensure that testing tools are most efficiently used. A new regulatory environment in the United States and guidelines with less-stringent requirements will hopefully encourage entry into the HCV diagnostics field and accelerate the path to a single-step HCV diagnosis.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

### Trends in HCV RNA testing among HCV antibody-positive persons in care, 2003–2010 [^1155goBq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is essential to identify persons with active, or current, HCV infection. We assessed trends in HCV RNA testing following a positive HCV antibody result among persons in 4 large healthcare organizations.

Methods

Data collected from adults with ≥ 2 clinical encounters during 2003–2010 were analyzed to determine the frequency of, interval between, and factors associated with having an RNA test after a first positive HCV antibody test.

Results

From 2003–2010, 5860 persons had a positive antibody test, of whom 3570 (60.9%) had a follow-up RNA test. During this period, the annual frequency of persons with an eventual RNA test did not change significantly; however, the fraction of persons who had the follow-up RNA test within 6 months improved significantly, from 45% in 2003 to 57% in 2010 (P < .001, for trend). Persons born during 1945–1965, men, and those with annual income < $30 000 (by census geocode) were less likely to have had a follow-up RNA test done within 6 months of a positive antibody test.

Conclusions

Less than two-thirds of persons with a positive HCV antibody test had a follow-up RNA test. Rapid ascertainment of HCV infection status with reflex testing to RNA is critical to identify persons eligible for treatment.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to monitoring of treatment response, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining reflex HBV DNA testing where available, through either laboratory-based reflex HBV DNA testing using a sample already held in the laboratory or clinic-based reflex testing in a healthcare facility through immediate sample collection following a positive HBsAg rapid diagnostic test, as an additional strategy to promote linkage to care and treatment in patients testing positive on HBsAg.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^1129JxPg]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

This study assessed the distribution of detectable viral loads 12 weeks following the end of treatment for HCV infection in an international cohort to inform the lower limit of detection of viral load assays for test of cure to identify treatment failure as well as for diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection. Based on a combined data set of clinical trials and observational data, a LLoD of 227 IU/mL (4030 IU/mL in the clinical trials subsample) would identify 95% of patients with a detectable viral load 12 weeks after treatment. While more than 10 times higher than the analytical sensitivity of laboratory‐based NAATs, it is more than 10 times lower than the LLoD for HCV diagnosis. These findings demonstrate it might be prudent and necessary to consider different LLoD standards for HCV diagnosis and for test of cure. Development of a point‐of‐care HCV test for cure with a low enough limit of detection to identify 95% of patients and is affordable, is an important aspect of expanding access to HCV treatment and a vital component of the WHO's HCV elimination targets.

Clinical Considerations for Children with Unknown HCV Exposure During Pregnancy

The risks for and benefits of testing children born to pregnant persons with unknown hepatitis C status were not directly assessed. Evidence indicates that siblings of children with perinatal hepatitis C exposure born to the same birth parent would benefit from being tested for HCV infection unless the birth parent was known to be HCV negative (i.e. HCV RNA not detected) during the previous pregnancy. Testing can be performed starting at age 2 months with a NAT for HCV RNA, or at age ≥ 18 months with an anti-HCV test with reflex to NAT for HCV RNA. In addition, children whose birth parent's hepatitis C status is unknown because the child and birth parent are separated (e.g. children in foster care or infants safely surrendered after birth) or other situations where the birth parent cannot be tested also would benefit from being tested starting at age 2 months with a NAT for HCV RNA or at age ≥ 18 months with an anti-HCV test with reflex to NAT for HCV RNA (,–). If a pregnant person was at risk for having an acute infection during pregnancy (e.g. IDU) and was not tested close to the time of delivery, the infant also would benefit from being tested.

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics of HCV RNA‐positive adults, 2014–2021.

Cumulatively, from 2014 through 2021, a total of 672,745 individuals were treated for HCV infection. An estimated 643,043 (96%) were cured of their HCV infection (Figure 1). The treatment rate of HCV RNA + persons did not vary by gender or by genotype. However, HCV treatment rates increased stepwise by age from 21% among individuals 18–30 years to 56% among individuals > 65 years (Table S1 and Figure S1a). HCV treatment rates also varied by the fibrosis stage from 46.5% among persons with FIB‐4 scores > 3.25 (indicative of advanced liver fibrosis) compared to 33.6% among individuals with FIB‐4 scores < 1.45 (indicative of no/mild fibrosis), (Table S1 and Figure S1b). A greater percentage of HIV‐infected individuals received HCV treatment (62.5%) as compared with HIV‐uninfected individuals (38%) (Table S1 and Figure S1c). The percentage of individuals treated varied by U.S. region, with the highest percentage in the Northeast (47.3%) and the lowest percentage in the Midwest (27.5%) (Table S1). State‐by‐state differences in treatment rates also occur, (Figure S2). A greater proportion of individuals in urban areas received treatment (40.1%) as compared with rural areas (35.4%) (Table 1). HCV specialists treated the highest percentage of HCV RNA positive individuals in their care (76.2%) followed by primary care providers (31.4%) and nurse practitioners/physician assistants (27%). Compared to individuals for whom HCV antibody and HCV RNA testing were ordered separately, those identified as HCV RNA + by reflex testing of the HCV antibody positive specimen were more likely to receive HCV treatment (30% vs. 8%) (Figure 2) and to receive treatment sooner 8.1 vs. 12.4 months, respectively (Figure 2).

2.5 Statistical Analysis

This study was descriptive in nature. After retrieving and combining data from the two laboratory databases, observations were reported for the number of individuals in whom HCV antibody was tested, who were HCV antibody positive, persons tested for HCV RNA, HCV RNA positive, as well as those treated and cured individuals across the years 2014 to 2021 (henceforth termed the "HCV Care Cascade"). The HCV care cascade during this period was also reported based on sex and fibrosis stage categorisations. HCV cured individuals predicted from the machine learning algorithms were removed from each year's estimates. The total number of persons who remained HCV RNA positive and not cured was reported for the respective years between 2014 and 2021. To assess the impact of COVID‐19, changes in HCV treatment and cure rates between 2019 and 2021 were reported for HCV RNA tested, HCV RNA positive, treated (among those who tested HCV RNA+ in 2021), and cured individuals who had an HCV Ab+ test in 2021. The observed number of individuals who were HCV antibody screened, tested HCV antibody positive and tested HCV RNA positive was stratified by age for the year 2021. The proportion of RNA positive patients who were treated in 2021 were reported as a geographic heatmap of the 51 U.S. states and territories (Puerto Rico and D.C.). Observations of provider specialties that ordered the PCR test detecting HCV viremia and treated overall are reported for 2021. Ordering provider of the first positive RNA test in 2021 was assumed to be the diagnosing provider. Ordering provider of the RNA test with a decline of at least 1.2 × log 10 units since the first positive HCV RNA test was assumed to be the treating provider. Observations are reported on an annual basis from 2014 to 2021. Time to treatment after a reflex test was analysed and was limited to individuals with an HCV antibody positive test at least 28 days prior to the viral load decline.

Means and standard deviations were reported for normally distributed continuous variables, medians and interquartile ranges for non‐normally distributed continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages (%) for categorical variables. All persons identified as RNA+ were included in the analysis. For demographical and clinical characteristics, persons with missing data in any field were not removed, but rather they were not counted toward the denominator and did not contribute to the percentage calculation for that characteristic.

### What hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic tools are needed to advance diagnosis of current HCV infection in outreach settings and in a nonclinical setting? [^116KzQkf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In the US, the most commonly used HCV POC test is the rapid anti-HCV test. Although HCV core antigen and rapid HCV RNA test platforms have been developed and have good performance characteristics, core antigen testing is not available in the US and only laboratory-based RNA testing is currently available. The advantages of the rapid anti-HCV test, including speed, convenience, and accessibility, are greatly outweighed by the inability to distinguish persistent HCV infection from previous resolution of infection, nor does it distinguish acute infection from chronic disease. While the anti-HCV POC test facilitates screening for exposure to HCV, it is not helpful for treatment decisions without additional testing. Also, as the window period for detection of anti-HCV is long, this approach does not identify acute or recent infection, when transmission risk may be high. The value of HCV antigen tests and rapid HCV RNA testing is the actionable results they provide, which is especially important when dealing with populations for whom a follow-up visit for confirmatory testing is far from assured. While antigen testing is more likely than antibody testing to detect HCV in the early stages of infection, cost and limited sensitivity impact its utility. These tests are especially useful in settings where molecular testing is not available, but antigen detection is not likely to be further developed as a diagnostic tool in the US given US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. Rapid HCV RNA tests, which detect HCV genetic material, offer the greatest advantage for diagnosis and rapid initiation of treatment as the presence of HCV RNA confirms current infection. HCV RNA testing in the US is conducted in laboratories using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on serum or plasma obtained by venipuncture following receipt of a reactive anti-HCV test. RT-PCR, a highly sensitive and specific method for detecting and quantifying viral RNA in blood samples, is considered the gold standard for HCV RNA detection. The lack of a POC option for HCV RNA testing in the US is a significant impediment to the rapid diagnosis and swift initiation of treatment — especially in nontraditional settings — impacting the ability to address the HCV epidemic in the highest risk groups and, eventually, to eliminating HCV.

2.2 Algorithms for Treatment Receipt and Achievement of Sustained Virologic Response

2.2.1 Treatment Receipt

Due to the lack of information on the treatment of hepatitis C and continuity of medical or pharmacy benefit enrollment in the derived dataset, receipt of HCV treatment and achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) (i.e. cure) was imputed using validated algorithms based on viral load decline and continued negative HCV RNA test results, respectively. A viral load decline of at least 1.2 × log 10 units (minimum meaningful decline attributable to treatment) was used to identify patients assumed to have initiated therapy. Briefly, machine learning predictive models were built and validated using a separate set of 92,099 treated HCV individuals with medical and pharmacy claims available in the Symphony Health Solutions (SHS) medical and pharmacy claims dataset from 2017 to 2019, with over 98% accuracy in each year. This model — now validated across 7 years consecutively with > 98% accuracy — was then applied to our dataset; individuals in the current laboratory dataset who were predicted to have achieved SVR from the machine learning algorithms were classified as cured in the year following the year of treatment (e.g. individuals flagged as initiating treatment in 2019 were classified as treated in 2019 and cured in 2020).

2.2.2 Viremic Status

Because individuals might have varied follow up duration and/or inconsistent HCV RNA measurements in the years from 2014 to 2021, a longitudinal method was applied to impute their HCV viremic status over multiple years. Individuals who had two positive HCV RNA values with gap years in between were assumed to stay HCV viremic in the gap years.

2.3 Observed Rates ofScreening and Diagnostic Testing

The number of persons screened for HCV antibody and the number who tested positive for HCV antibody or for HCV RNA were assessed for each year from 2014 to 2021. The proportion of individuals who were HCV antibody positive among all individuals tested for HCV antibody was calculated.

2.4 Antibody With Reflex toTesting

Ordering of reflex testing (HCV antibody with reflex to HCV RNA) was identified using test numbers, test names, and by matching the test date (date the specimen was drawn) of the HCV antibody test with the date of the HCV RNA test.

### Development and clinical validation of the genedrive point-of-care test for qualitative detection of hepatitis C virus [^114JwrBB]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We developed and validated the Genedrive HCV assay for the qualitative detection of HCV RNA. The Genedrive instrument is a handheld rapid thermocycler that permits NAAT on plasma or serum samples, which fulfils the target product profile for HCV diagnosis drafted by FIND/WHO (diagnostic specificity > 98% and sensitivity > 95%). Diagnostic accuracy was shown for all six majors genotypes, although genotypes 2, 5 and 6 had a limited presence in the samples tested (online supplementary table S1 B).

Although DAAs for HCV cure are now available, the challenge for HCV infection, and especially for HCV elimination programmes, is the screening of undiagnosed HCV-infected subjects and the linkage to care, namely the availability of DAA at reasonable costs. The majority of infected individuals are unaware of their infection and as such do not benefit from this unprecedented medical advance. HCV infection is often first identified by serological testing, followed by diagnostic confirmation of HCV nucleic acid in circulation. At present, HCV RNA testing is only available in centralised medical settings resulting in less than 1% of infected people in low-income and middle-income countries being aware of their infection. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet clinical need for decentralised HCV testing that can provide rapid diagnosis that may result in improved patient outcome and public health as shown for other diseases.

Initial assay validation was conducted to establish specificity for HCV with clinical validation performed in a two-site retrospective clinical study to determine sensitivity and specificity. In our treatment-naïve case subjects, the lack of a result and false-negative results were only observed in samples with RNA viral levels below the LoD of the Genedrive HCV assay. It is unlikely that this analytical sensitivity would impact diagnostic sensitivity, as the vast majority of people with pretreatment chronic HCV infection have high VL (> 5 log IU/mL). This is supported by a study of 2400 treatment-naïve patients with chronic HCV, where it was shown that < 2% of patients had viraemia below 4 log 10 IU/mL. Furthermore, recent WHO guidelines explicitly acknowledged that 'a limit of detection of 3000 IU/mL or lower would be acceptable and would identify 95% of those with viremic infection'.

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection? [^116jJAkC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite remarkable therapeutic advances, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection continues to be a major global problem. While the development of highly effective direct-acting antivirals has ensured that almost all those who are treated achieve viral cure, progress toward HCV elimination globally has stalled due to challenges upstream of treatment in the cascade of care, namely diagnosis and linkage to care. The major challenge continues to be the relative complexity of HCV diagnosis with the current requirement for a confirmatory HCV RNA test after an initial antibody-positive result. In this review, challenges with the current paradigm are highlighted with a focus on new technologies, as well as simple strategies using existing tools, which may simplify diagnosis and improve linkage to care and treatment. To achieve HCV elimination, improvements in the HCV diagnostics field to allow for a simple single-step diagnosis are required.

### Development and clinical validation of the genedrive point-of-care test for qualitative detection of hepatitis C virus [^112PatJg]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Linking diagnosis to treatment decisions is now the major clinical challenge: in Europe, the percentage of cured individuals from initial viraemic infections is only 4.1%. In the best cases, the treatment rate is around 5% (eg, France and Germany) and does not exceed 1% in resource-limited countries. Furthermore, it has been well described how HCV prevalence negatively correlates with treatment rate, as illustrated by countries such as Egypt and Mongolia, which have very high HCV prevalence and treatment rates between 0.1% and 1.2%. These data show how both initial screening and linkage to care after diagnosis are still major challenges, one of the main consequences being the low number of individuals that are prescribed and adhere to treatment. This is partially due to a lack of PoC diagnostic tests, as well as the requirement for multiple clinical visits (eg, diagnosis by serology followed by NAAT). Devices like Genedrive could have a major impact in improving the chronic HCV care continuum, as diagnosis through HCV RNA detection could be performed in a wide range of field settings and no intermediate visits would be required. Thus, screening in resource-limited settings could be easy, effective and rapid and, consequently, treatment could be started as soon as a positive result has been obtained.

### Vital signs: newly reported acute and chronic hepatitis C cases-United States, 2009–2018 [^112qhiWb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

To quantify the number and rate of confirmed chronic hepatitis C cases newly reported to CDC by sex, age, and social generation (i.e. birth cohort), NNDSS data for 2018 were analyzed. In 2018, CSTE defined a confirmed chronic hepatitis C case as one that did not meet the definition of an acute case and had a positive NAT for HCV RNA or HCV antigen test. A newly reported chronic case is a chronic hepatitis C case that meets the CSTE case definition and has not been reported previously. § All acute and chronic hepatitis C rates were calculated using yearly U.S. population estimates from 2009–2018. The p-values for all chi-squared tests were < 0.001 and are not presented.

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data were analyzed to estimate the proportion of adults with confirmed current hepatitis C who reported having ever been told that they had hepatitis C. NHANES is an ongoing, nationally representative interview and examination survey of the U.S. noninstitutionalized population. As part of the 2015–2016 and 2017–2018 surveys, participants were asked whether they had ever been told that they had hepatitis C and were then tested for hepatitis C during an examination (anti-HCV testing followed by reflex NAT testing for HCV RNA). Participants who answered "No" and had positive test results for HCV RNA were considered to be unaware of their infection. Those who refused to answer were classified as missing. Because the number of HCV RNA-positive NHANES participants during any given survey is small (e.g. 50 during 2015–2016 and 51 during 2017–2018), the two survey cycles were combined to improve stability of the estimates. The proportion of HCV RNA-positive persons aged ≥ 20 years aware of their infection during 2015–2018 was weighted to account for unequal probability of selection and nonresponse, and 95% Clopper-Pearson exact CIs accounted for the complex survey design. SUDAAN (version 11.0.1; RTI International) was used for the analyses. Stratifying the estimate by selected demographic and socioeconomic characteristics was attempted; however, no stratifications of interest met National Center for Health Statistics data presentation standards because of small cell counts.

### Role of serologic and molecular diagnostic assays in identification and management of hepatitis C virus infection [^115cph2A]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

ROLE OF TESTING IN DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE HCV INFECTION

The diagnostic methods associated with treatment are different from those designed to screen and protect the blood supply. As treatments of HCV have improved dramatically in recent years, the diagnostic paradigm has also evolved to meet the changing clinical needs. Approximately 15% to 30% of patients spontaneously clear HCV within 6 to 12 months of initial exposure. Such individuals remain anti-HCV antibody positive but have no detectable viremia and are truly cured of the infection, without long-term sequelae. Prior to placing a patient on therapy, a physician must differentiate those people who have been exposed to HCV but who have, after acute and usually asymptomatic infection, resolved their infection without sequelae from those who have been exposed and have progressed to a chronic and potentially lifelong infection. Traditionally, the RIBA was used to confirm HCV infection by demonstrating reactivity of antibodies in the serum with specific HCV proteins, increasing the specificity of the initial antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, this test has been discontinued and is consequently no longer available. The presence of HCV RNA in the peripheral blood is a reliable marker of HCV replication and is the main marker used today to confirm an active infection. Two technologies are routinely used for the qualitative HCV RNA test, PCR and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA).

### Guidelines for health care personnel exposed to hepatitis… [^111wfzo9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation details This guidance includes recommendations for a testing algorithm and clinical management for HCPs with potential occupational exposure to HCV. There are two options for testing the source patient. Option one is preferred, especially if the source patient is known or suspected to be at increased risk for HCV.
- **Option one**: Nucleic Acid Test for HCV RNA.
- Option two: Hepatitis C antibody test with reflex to NAT if positive. Test the HCP Simultaneous with source-patient testing, test the HCP as soon as possible after exposure. See algorithm below: At baseline, test the HCP with an HCV antibody test with reflex to NAT for HCV RNA if positive. Follow-up testing of HCP is recommended if the source patient is:

- HCV RNA positive, OR
- Anti-HCV positive with HCV RNA status unknown, OR
- Cannot be tested.

Follow-up testing and management of the HCP If follow-up testing is recommended based on the source patient status, conduct a test 3–6 weeks after exposure with a NAT for HCV RNA. If the HCP is HCV RNA negative at 3–6 weeks:

- Test one more time at 4–6 months after exposure for HCV antibody, with reflex to RNA if positive.
- If the HCP remains anti-HCV negative at 4–6 months, no follow up is needed in most circumstances. However, if the HCP is immunocompromised or has liver disease, testing for HCV RNA can be considered. If at any point the HCP has detectable HCV RNA or tests positive for anti-HCV after a previous negative test:

- Refer for further care and evaluation for treatment as indicated in AASLD-IDSA guidelines.

Additional considerations
- Note that if an HCV RNA test is positive but the RNA level is less than the lower limit of quantitation of the assay, the result may be reported as
- If there are concerns about results being compromised because of storage and handling errors or other issues that might affect specimen integrity: Repeat Tests.
- If the exposed HCP develops illness with symptoms indicative of acute HCV infection at any point: Test for HCV RNA.

### Clinical screening and diagnosis for hepatitis C… [^114jXRQq]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommended tests Clinicians should use an FDA-approved HCV antibody test followed by a NAT for HCV RNA test when antibody is positive/reactive. Tests include:

- HCV antibody test.
- Nucleic acid test to detect presence and levels of HCV RNA. CDC recommends that clinicians collect all samples needed to diagnose hepatitis C in a single visit, initiating hepatitis C testing with an HCV antibody test, and ordering HCV RNA testing automatically when the HCV antibody is reactive. Nonreactive/negative HCV antibody results If an HCV antibody test is not reactive, the patient has likely not been exposed and you can rule out infection. However, RNA testing is recommended for the diagnosis of current HCV infection among people who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months, regardless of HCV antibody result.

Suspected exposure may be inferred from the patient's history or the context and setting of the patient encounter. Reactive/positive HCV antibody results If an HCV antibody test is positive/reactive, this indicates a history of past or current HCV infection and clinicians should order HCV RNA testing automatically. When the HCV antibody test is reactive, laboratories should automatically perform NAT testing for HCV RNA detection. This automatic testing streamlines the process because it occurs without any additional action on the part of the patient or the clinician. Negative HCV RNA results A non-detectable HCV RNA test result indicates no current HCV infection and no further action required in most cases.

Positive HCV RNA results It usually takes 1–2 weeks after exposure to the virus for detectable HCV RNA levels to appear. A detectable HCV RNA test result indicates current infection, and you should counsel the patient, evaluate for treatment, and initiate an appropriate direct-acting antiviral regimen. HCV antibody reactive Presumptive HCV infection A repeatedly reactive result could be consistent with current HCV infection, past HCV infection that has resolved, or biologic false positivity for HCV antibody. Test for HCV RNA to identify current infection. HCV antibody reactive, HCV RNA detected.
