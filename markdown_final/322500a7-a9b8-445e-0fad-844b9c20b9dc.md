## Question

How to evaluate vertigo

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate vertigo. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial triage and red flags. Then, I should verify the timing-and-triggers paradigm to frame the syndrome. Next, I will examine the bedside examination strategy, including HINTS, Dix-Hallpike, and gait. After that, I need to check when imaging and ancillary testing are indicated. Then, I will consider special populations and follow-up. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight key takeaways with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the initial triage priorities: I need to screen immediately for life-threatening causes, especially posterior circulation stroke, and for non-neurologic emergencies like hypoglycemia, arrhythmia, or sepsis, because missing these carries high morbidity and mortality; this means checking vitals, ABCs, and a rapid neurologic screen for focal deficits, severe ataxia, or altered mental status, and activating stroke protocols when indicated [^7862bdfd] [^7b1afc98].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptom quality; I should verify the timing-and-triggers framework because patients are more consistent describing when symptoms occur and what provokes them than describing "dizzy" versus "vertigo", and this organizes the evaluation into acute vestibular syndrome, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, and triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, which in turn guides testing and interpretation of findings [^470ee741] [^7f9000ae].

> Next, I should review the bedside examination strategy; for acute vestibular syndrome with nystagmus, HINTS (head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) performed by trained clinicians can reliably distinguish peripheral vestibular neuritis from central stroke, but I need to ensure I do not overstate accuracy in untrained hands, as emergency physicians without specific training have lower sensitivity and specificity in meta-analyses, so training and correct patient selection are essential [^9b8a75f1] [^396c84cd].

> Wait, let me verify the role of gait and non-HINTS elements; when nystagmus is absent in AVS, severity of gait unsteadiness helps distinguish central from peripheral causes, and adding a bedside hearing check such as finger rub can uncover new unilateral hearing loss that increases suspicion for stroke even when HINTS suggests peripheral disease, so I should integrate these elements rather than rely on a single sign [^d1026618] [^dd28604b].

> I will now examine triggered episodic vertigo; for suspected posterior canal BPPV, I should perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to elicit torsional upbeating nystagmus and, if negative but suspicion remains, follow with the supine roll test for lateral canal BPPV, and I should treat immediately with a canalith repositioning maneuver such as Epley rather than deferring, while avoiding routine imaging or vestibular testing when the presentation is classic [^7f118857] [^5f860ddf] [^e5306638].

> Let me consider spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome; I need to check for vascular risk factors and migrainous features because vestibular migraine is common and can mimic TIA, and if TIA is suspected, I should obtain CTA or MRA of the head and neck rather than a noncontrast CT, which is low yield for posterior circulation ischemia in this context [^55b911fa] [^3fcb6d45].

> I should double-check imaging indications; in acute vestibular syndrome, routine CT or MRI is not first-line if a trained clinician can perform HINTS, but MRI with DWI and MRA is indicated when HINTS is central or equivocal or when red flags are present, whereas in classic BPPV, imaging is not recommended, and in persistent vertigo with neurologic symptoms or asymmetric hearing loss, MRI of the brain and internal auditory canals is appropriate to exclude structural or vascular causes [^c75ddab1] [^f44714c1] [^901af98a] [^afc8d454].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child; I need to ensure age-specific considerations because central causes are more frequent in younger children, so a lower threshold for neurologic consultation and imaging is warranted, and in adolescents, migraine-related dizziness predominates, which should shape the evaluation and referral patterns [^5a324001] [^bfd75c55].

> Next, I should review follow-up and reassessment; for BPPV, I should confirm resolution or persistence at about one month and, if symptoms persist, re-evaluate for unresolved BPPV or alternative diagnoses, and for unilateral vestibular hypofunction, vestibular rehabilitation with gaze stabilization and balance exercises is recommended with defined dosing and duration, and I should also screen for fall risk and home safety, especially in older adults or those with limited support [^9f25ee06] [^20e05d93] [^4c4541ff].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying: first, triage for red flags and non-neurologic emergencies; second, classify by timing and triggers into AVS, s-EVS, or t-EVS; third, apply the appropriate bedside battery (HINTS plus gait and hearing checks for AVS, Dix-Hallpike and CRP for t-EVS, history and vascular/migraine assessment for s-EVS); fourth, reserve MRI for central or equivocal HINTS, suspected TIA, or persistent vertigo with neurologic or audiologic signs; fifth, arrange follow-up and vestibular rehabilitation as indicated, documenting outcomes at one month for BPPV and adjusting care accordingly [^7862bdfd] [^470ee741] [^9b8a75f1] [^f44714c1] [^9f25ee06].

> Hold on, I should verify key takeaways to avoid misapplication: HINTS is highly accurate in trained hands but not a universal ED standard yet, so I must align use with local expertise; BPPV is common and treatable at the bedside, so I should prioritize maneuvers and avoid low-yield imaging; and persistent or atypical cases deserve reconsideration of the diagnosis and targeted testing rather than reflexive imaging, which improves both safety and stewardship [^396c84cd] [^e5306638] [^901af98a].

Vertigo evaluation should be **structured around timing, triggers, and targeted examination** (TiTrATE) to distinguish peripheral from central causes and guide testing and treatment [^4f91cf15]. Most cases are peripheral (BPPV, vestibular neuritis, Ménière's) and can be diagnosed at the bedside with **Dix-Hallpike, HINTS, and gait testing**; routine labs or imaging are not needed unless red flags or atypical features are present [^4f91cf15] [^901af98a]. BPPV is treated with canalith repositioning maneuvers (Epley), vestibular neuritis with supportive care and vestibular rehabilitation, and Ménière's with salt restriction and diuretics; persistent or atypical cases warrant MRI and specialty referral [^e5306638] [^20e05d93] [^ba554b24] [^afc8d454].

## Clinical classification of vertigo

Vertigo is classified into **three main categories** based on clinical presentation:

| **Category** | **Description** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Peripheral vertigo | Originates in the inner ear or vestibular nerve | - Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) <br/> - Vestibular neuritis <br/> - Ménière's disease <br/> - Labyrinthitis [^4f91cf15] |
| Central vertigo | Originates in the brainstem or cerebellum | - Stroke <br/> - Multiple sclerosis <br/> - Tumors <br/> - Vestibular migraine [^4f91cf15] |
| Psychogenic vertigo | Functional or psychiatric origin | - Anxiety disorders <br/> - Panic disorder <br/> - Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) [^7c6aae50] |

---

## Essential elements of history taking

A thorough history is critical and should follow the **TiTrATE approach** (Timing, Triggers, And Targeted Examination) [^4f91cf15]:

- **Timing**: Determine whether vertigo is continuous (minutes to hours) or episodic (seconds to minutes).
- **Triggers**: Identify positional changes, head movements, stress, or migraine-associated factors.
- **Associated symptoms**: Ask about nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness, neurologic symptoms (focal deficits, dysarthria, diplopia), and psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, panic attacks) [^4f91cf15].
- **Medical history**: Review hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, migraine, recent infections, trauma, medications, and alcohol use [^notfound].

---

## Key physical examination components

The physical examination should include:

- **Vital signs**: Orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate measurements [^4f91cf15].
- **Head and neck examination**: Otoscopy for otitis media or effusion, Weber and Rinne tests for hearing assessment, and examination of the tympanic membranes [^3f61defc].
- **Neurologic examination**: Cranial nerves, including visual fields, eye movements, limb coordination, and gait assessment [^e97b4b1a].
- **Vestibular tests**: Dix-Hallpike maneuver for BPPV, head impulse test, nystagmus assessment, and test of skew (HINTS) for acute vestibular syndrome [^7f118857] [^9b8a75f1].

---

## Diagnostic tests and imaging

Routine laboratory tests are generally not required unless indicated by history or examination. Imaging is reserved for cases with **red flags** or atypical features:

- **MRI brain**: Indicated for central vertigo, persistent vertigo with neurologic symptoms, or when initial evaluation is inconclusive [^afc8d454].
- **CT scan**: Limited utility due to low sensitivity for posterior fossa lesions; reserved for acute settings when MRI is unavailable or contraindicated [^7b1afc98].
- **Audiometry**: Essential for suspected Ménière's disease or unexplained hearing loss [^ba554b24].

---

## Common causes and their distinguishing features

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic tests** |
|-|-|-|
| BPPV | Brief, positional vertigo with latency and fatigability | Dix-Hallpike maneuver [^7f118857] |
| Vestibular neuritis | Continuous vertigo without hearing loss | HINTS examination [^9b8a75f1] |
| Ménière's disease | Episodic vertigo with hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness | Audiometry [^ba554b24] |
| Vestibular migraine | Episodic vertigo with migraine features | Clinical diagnosis [^fb84c489] |
| Central vertigo | Persistent vertigo with neurologic deficits | MRI brain [^f44714c1] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **BPPV**: Canalith repositioning maneuvers (Epley, Semont) are highly effective [^e5306638].
- **Vestibular neuritis**: Supportive care, vestibular suppressants short-term, and vestibular rehabilitation [^20e05d93].
- **Ménière's disease**: Salt restriction, diuretics, and vestibular rehabilitation [^notfound].
- **Central vertigo**: Treat the underlying cause (e.g. stroke, multiple sclerosis) [^notfound].
- **Psychogenic vertigo**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, vestibular rehabilitation, and management of anxiety or depression [^notfound].

---

## Follow-up and referral

Follow-up should reassess symptoms, functional status, and treatment response, with **re-evaluation at 1 month** for BPPV and persistent cases [^9f25ee06]. Referral to ENT, neurology, or vestibular rehabilitation is indicated for refractory cases, diagnostic uncertainty, or significant functional impairment [^6a2bb31a].

---

Vertigo evaluation should be **structured around timing, triggers, and targeted examination** (TiTrATE) to distinguish peripheral from central causes and guide testing and treatment. Most cases are peripheral and can be diagnosed at the bedside with Dix-Hallpike, HINTS, and gait testing; routine labs or imaging are not needed unless red flags or atypical features are present. BPPV is treated with canalith repositioning maneuvers (Epley), vestibular neuritis with supportive care and vestibular rehabilitation, and Ménière's with salt restriction and diuretics; persistent or atypical cases warrant MRI and specialty referral.

Diagnostic paradigm and terminology — the traditional diagnostic paradigm, developed 50 years ago, based on symptom quality and asking the patient "What do you mean by dizzy?", suggests basing the differential diagnosis and clinical evaluation on the patient's description, but this paradigm was never properly validated, has significant methodological flaws, and does not reliably predict underlying causes; the Barany Society has developed formal international consensus criteria, terminology, and definitions for many vestibular disorders, and the writing committee has tried to use terms aligned with these consensus definitions that make sense to frontline clinicians.

The diagnosis and management of vertigo remains a challenge for clinicians, including general neurology. In recent years there have been advances in the understanding of established vestibular syndromes, and the development of treatments for existing vestibular diagnoses. In this 'update' I will review how our understanding of previously "unexplained" dizziness in the elderly is changing, explore novel insights into the pathophysiology of vestibular migraine, and its relationship to the newly coined term 'persistent postural perceptual dizziness', and finally discuss how a simple bedside oculomotor assessment may help identify vestibular presentations of stroke.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 3 (GRACE-3): acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department [^13be9e4e]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This third Guideline for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department (GRACE-3) from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine is on the topic adult patients with acute dizziness and vertigo in the emergency department (ED). A multidisciplinary guideline panel applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations regarding five questions for adult ED patients with acute dizziness of less than 2weeks' duration. The intended population is adults presenting to the ED with acute dizziness or vertigo. The panel derived 15 evidence-based recommendations based on the timing and triggers of the dizziness but recognizes that alternative diagnostic approaches exist, such as the STANDING protocol and nystagmus examination in combination with gait unsteadiness or the presence of vascular risk factors. As an overarching recommendation, (1) emergency clinicians should receive training in bedside physical examination techniques for patients with the acute vestibular syndrome (AVS; HINTS) and the diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV; Dix-Hallpike test and Epley maneuver). To help distinguish central from peripheral causes in patients with the AVS, we recommend: (2) use HINTS (for clinicians trained in its use) in patients with nystagmus, (3) use finger rub to further aid in excluding stroke in patients with nystagmus, (4) use severity of gait unsteadiness in patients without nystagmus, (5) do not use brain computed tomography (CT), (6) do not use routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a first-line test if a clinician trained in HINTS is available, and (7) use MRI as a confirmatory test in patients with central or equivocal HINTS examinations. In patients with the spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome: (8) search for symptoms or signs of cerebral ischemia, (9) do not use CT, and (10) use CT angiography or MRI angiography if there is concern for transient ischemic attack. In patients with the triggered (positional) episodic vestibular syndrome, (11) use the Dix-Hallpike test to diagnose posterior canal BPPV (pc-BPPV), (12) do not use CT, and (13) do not use MRI routinely, unless atypical clinical features are present. In patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, (14) consider short-term steroids as a treatment option. In patients diagnosed with pc-BPPV, (15) treat with the Epley maneuver. It is clear that as of 2023, when applied in routine practice by emergency clinicians without special training, HINTS testing is inaccurate, partly due to use in the wrong patients and partly due to issues with its interpretation. Most emergency physicians have not received training in use of HINTS. As such, it is not standard of care, either in the legal sense of that term ("what the average physician would do in similar circumstances") or in the common parlance sense ("the standard action typically used by physicians in routine practice").

Classification of evidence-based statements — principles and interpretation emphasize that guidelines aim to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes, and minimize harm, with statements reflecting both quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment and may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinical discretion; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than for a recommendation, whereas options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that best serves their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations, and guidelines represent the best judgment of a team addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^ea92652d]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Vestibular migraine is an underdiagnosed but increasingly recognized neurological condition that causes episodic vertigo associated with other features of migraine. It is now thought to be the most common cause of spontaneous (non-positional) episodic vertigo, affecting up to 1% of the population. A meta-analysis of preventative treatments for vestibular migraine was published in 2021, but the authors were unable to establish a preferred treatment strategy due to low quality of evidence and heterogeneity of study design and outcome reporting. Therefore, there remains a clinical need for pragmatic management guidelines specific to vestibular migraine using the available evidence. Here, we provide a practical review utilizing a systematic qualitative assessment of the evidence for abortive and preventative interventions in adults. The overall evidence base for vestibular migraine treatment is of low quality. Nevertheless, we provide practical treatment recommendations based on the available evidence and our experience to help guide clinicians treating patients with vestibular migraine. We also discuss how future clinical trials could be designed to improve the quality of evidence in this condition.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^313dbbd1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Vestibular migraine is a form of migraine where one of the main features is recurrent attacks of vertigo. These episodes are often associated with other features of migraine, including headache and sensitivity to light or sound. These unpredictable and severe attacks of vertigo can lead to a considerable reduction in quality of life. The condition is estimated to affect just under 1% of the population, although many people remain undiagnosed. A number of pharmacological interventions have been used or proposed to be used as prophylaxis for this condition, to help reduce the frequency of the attacks. These are predominantly based on treatments that are in use for headache migraine, with the belief that the underlying pathophysiology of these conditions is similar.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological treatments used for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with definite or probable vestibular migraine comparing beta‐blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptics, antidepressants, diuretics, monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin gene‐related peptide (or its receptor), botulinum toxin or hormonal modification with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with a cross‐over design, unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) improvement in headache, 6) improvement in other migrainous symptoms and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: < 3 months, 3 to < 6 months, > 6 to 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included three studies with a total of 209 participants. One evaluated beta‐blockers and the other two evaluated calcium channel blockers. We did not identify any evidence for the remaining interventions of interest.

Beta‐blockers versus placebo

One study (including 130 participants, 61% female) evaluated the use of 95 mg metoprolol once daily for six months, compared to placebo. The proportion of people who reported improvement in vertigo was not assessed in this study. Some data were reported on the frequency of vertigo attacks at six months and the occurrence of serious adverse effects. However, this is a single, small study and for all outcomes the certainty of evidence was low or very low. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results.

Calcium channel blockers versus no treatment

Two studies, which included a total of 79 participants (72% female), assessed the use of 10 mg flunarizine once daily for three months, compared to no intervention. All of the evidence for this comparison was of very low certainty. Most of our outcomes were only reported by a single study, therefore we were unable to conduct any meta‐analysis. Some data were reported on improvement in vertigo and change in vertigo, but no information was available regarding serious adverse events. We are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results, as these data come from single, small studies and the certainty of the evidence was very low.

Authors' conclusions

There is very limited evidence from placebo‐controlled randomised trials regarding the efficacy and potential harms of pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine. We only identified evidence for two of our interventions of interest (beta‐blockers and calcium channel blockers) and all evidence was of low or very low certainty. Further research is necessary to identify whether these treatments are effective at improving symptoms and whether there are any harms associated with their use.

### Vertigo and dizziness in the emergency room [^7b1afc98]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide an update on diagnostic algorithms for differential diagnosis of acute vertigo and dizziness and swift identification of potentially harmful causes.

Recent Findings

About 25% of patients with acute vertigo and dizziness have a potentially life-threatening diagnosis, including stroke in 4–15%. Diagnostic work-up relies on the combination of symptom features (triggers, duration, history of vertigo/dizziness, accompanying symptoms) and a comprehensive vestibular, ocular motor, and balance exam. The latter includes head impulse, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, gaze-holding, smooth pursuit, skew deviation, and Romberg's test. Recent standardized diagnostic algorithms (e.g. HINTS, TriAGe+) suggest the combination of several elements to achieve a good diagnostic accuracy in differentiation of central and peripheral vestibular causes. Neuroimaging with MRI must be applied and interpreted with caution, as small strokes are frequently overlooked, especially in the acute setting (false-negative rate of up to 50%).

Summary

Diagnostic differentiation of acute vertigo and dizziness remains a complex task, which can be tackled by a structured clinical assessment focusing on symptom characteristics and constellations of ocular motor and vestibular findings. Specific challenges arise in cases of transient or atypical vestibular syndromes.

Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease — history and examination emphasize that the history and physical examination should evaluate for neurologic, neurotologic/otologic, oncologic, inflammatory, infectious, or vascular causes, and clinicians should ask patients detailed questions about attack onset and duration (second, minutes, hours, or entire day) and concurrent otologic symptoms. Vertigo should first be confirmed as the hallmark symptom of MD and is defined as a false sensation of self-motion and that the visual surrounding is spinning or flowing, while "dizziness" is disturbed spatial orientation without a false or distorted sense of motion. Clinicians should inquire about head position triggers to rule out BPPV and about falls (drop attacks), and loss of consciousness is never a symptom of MD. A thorough otologic history should be addressed when evaluating suspected MD.

This paper presents an evidence-based introduction to assessing and managing the dizzy patient. It is based upon a literature review highlighting current best practice and the clinical experience of the author. Dizziness is common, often chronic and largely untreated, resulting in great personal and economic loss. Serious pathological causes of dizziness may be quickly and effectively screened by a simple ocular motor examination, differentiating these from peripheral vestibular lesions. A triage, differentiating dizziness into either acute onset, intermittent episodes or continuous symptoms is proposed, along with management strategies for the commonest causes of dizziness. Vestibular suppressant medication should be restricted to the acute phase of a vestibular episode. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the most effective treatment for continuous or chronic dizziness.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^86a0846d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV.

Purpose

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and to promote the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel made recommendations against 1) radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV, unless the diagnosis is uncertain or there are additional symptoms or signs unrelated to BPPV that warrant testing; and 2) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines or benzodiazepines. The panel made recommendations that 1) if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test is negative, clinicians should perform a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV; 2) clinicians should differentiate BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; 3) clinicians should question patients with BPPV for factors that modify management including impaired mobility or balance, CNS disorders, lack of home support, and increased risk for falling; 4) clinicians should treat patients with posterior canal BPPV with a particle repositioning maneuver (PRM); 5) clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to confirm symptom resolution; 6) clinicians should evaluate patients with BPPV who are initial treatment failures for persistent BPPV or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders; and 7) clinicians should counsel patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, for the initial treatment of BPPV and 2) clinicians may offer observation as initial management for patients with BPPV and with assurance of follow-up. The panel made no recommendation concerning audiometric testing in patients diagnosed with BPPV.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgement or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Health care utilization, prognosis and outcomes of vestibular disease in primary care settings: systematic review [^69812fc6]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

In conclusion, diagnosis and management of vertigo and dizziness needs to be streamlined for primary care. Practical algorithms should be developed and implemented that take into account time and resource restrictions of PCPs, but give pragmatic instructions how to proceed with dizzy patients and to make correct referral and treatment decisions so that those with manageable disease will receive timely treatment, and those who are in risk for serious illness or benefit from specialist consultation will be forwarded to tertiary care. Close cooperation with specialists and other health professions should be part of the routine. Studies are needed to investigate current practice of care across countries and health systems in a systematic way and to test PCP-based education and training interventions that improve patient-reported outcomes.

### Etiologic distribution of dizziness / vertigo in a neurological outpatient clinic according to the criteria of the international classification of vestibular disorders: a single-center study [^0fbd993f]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

However, during the process of the diagnosis and treatment of vertigo, even if a diagnostic paradigm based on the determination of the lesion lateralization, localization, and nature of symptoms is adopted with the use of the existing vestibular evaluation techniques, it is still difficult to clarify whether the vestibular system is involved in a considerable number of patients. Moreover, the results from large-sample studies on the etiology of dizziness/vertigo vary widely, this may be related to the differences in disease severity among patients included in different studies, the level of diagnosis among hospitals of different levels, and the sample size. Given this background, this study aimed to determine the etiologic distribution of dizziness/vertigo in patients visiting the vertigo outpatient clinic of the neurology department of our hospital to validate and enrich the spectrum of dizziness/vertigo-related vestibular disorders based on the diagnostic framework as defined in the ICD-11. We hope to provide clinicians with a reference on the diagnosis and treatment of dizziness/vertigo.

### A systematic review of clinical vestibular symptom triage, tools, and algorithms [^fc315856]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The evaluation of peripheral vestibular disorders in clinical practice is an especially difficult endeavor, particularly for the inexperienced clinician. The goal of this systematic review is thus to evaluate the design, approaches, and outcomes for clinical vestibular symptom triage and decision support tools reported in contemporary published literature.

Data Sources

A comprehensive search of existing literature in August 2020 was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE using terms of desired diagnostic tools such as algorithm, protocol, and questionnaire as well as an exhaustive set of terms to encompass vestibular disorders.

Review Methods

Study characteristics, tool metrics, and performance were extracted using a standardized form. Quality assessment was conducted using a modified version of the Quality of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) assessment tool.

Results

A total of 18 articles each reporting a novel tool for the evaluation of vestibular disorders were identified. Tools were organized into 3 discrete categories, including self-administered questionnaires, health care professional administered tools, and decision support systems. Most tools could differentiate between specific vestibular pathologies, with outcome measures including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

Conclusion

A multitude of tools have been published to aid with the evaluation of vertiginous patients. Our systematic review identified several low-evidence reports of triage and decision support tools for the evaluation of vestibular disorders.

### Dizziness: approach to evaluation and management… [^6be7b140]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

TITRATE THE EVALUATION TiTrATE is a novel diagnostic approach to determining the probable etiology of dizziness or vertigo. 2 The approach uses the Timing of the symptom, the Triggers that provoke the symptom, And a Targeted Examination. The responses place the dizziness into one of three clinical scenarios: episodic triggered, spontaneous episodic, or continuous vestibular. If vertigo is described, physicians should ask about hearing loss, which could suggest Meniere disease. 10 Diagnostic criteria for Meniere disease include episodic vertigo associated with documented low- to medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss by audiometric testing in the affected ear and tinnitus or aural fullness in the affected ear. 10 The auditory symptoms are initially unilateral. The patient's gait should be observed and a Romberg test performed. Patients with an unsteady gait should be assessed for peripheral neuropathy.

18 A positive Romberg test suggests an abnormality with proprioception receptors or their pathway. The use of the HINTS examination can help distinguish a possible stroke from acute vestibular syndrome. Test of Skew. Test of skew is assessed by asking the patient to look straight ahead, then cover and uncover each eye. Vertical deviation of the covered eye after uncovering is an abnormal result. Although this is a less sensitive test for central pathology, an abnormal result is fairly specific for brainstem involvement. BPPV is diagnosed with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. 16 Routine imaging is not indicated. 1 However, any abnormal neurologic finding, including asymmetric or unilateral hearing loss, requires computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate for cerebrovascular disease. Hearing loss with vertigo and normal neuroimaging suggests Meniere disease.

Treatment of BPPV consists of a canalith repositioning procedure such as the Epley maneuver, which repositions the canalith from the semicircular canal into the vestibule. The diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine include at least five episodes of vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity lasting five minutes to 72 hours; current or previous history of migraine headache; one or more migraine features, and at least 50% with vestibular symptoms; and no other cause of vestibular symptoms. 51.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^f10f2058]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^5907f865]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Vestibular testing in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — Clinicians should not order vestibular testing in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, with recommendation against vestibular testing based on diagnostic studies with limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C and level of confidence is Medium; benefits include facilitating timely treatment by avoiding unnecessary testing associated with low-yield and potential false-positive diagnoses, avoiding patient discomfort from nausea and vomiting from vestibular testing, and reduced costs from unnecessary testing; risks/harms/costs are noted as none; benefits-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm; the policy level is recommendation against; and exceptions are patients who have separate indications for vestibular testing aside from confirming a diagnosis of BPPV. The diagnosis of BPPV is based on the clinical history and physical examination with a positive result on the Dix-Hallpike test, which can be accomplished by a trained clinician without specialized testing equipment, and an appropriate CRP can be implemented immediately. Comprehensive vestibular testing is unnecessary for patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of BPPV, and this does not imply that the use of video-oculographic technology with or without recording should not be used when available to help in identification and differentiation of types of BPPV. Comprehensive vestibular testing may have a role if the clinical presentation is atypical, if Dix-Hallpike testing is equivocal or shows unusual nystagmus, if the diagnosis is unclear, or if additional symptoms aside from those attributable to BPPV are present. In a retrospective chart review of 100 consecutive patients referred for vestibular assessment, a 9% reduction in referrals for specialized testing could be realized if the initial provider obtained a thorough case history and completed a Dix-Hallpike test, and among complex patients referred for subspecialty evaluation of BPPV, atypical or unclear nystagmus findings may approach 13% among patients with diagnoses suspicious for BPPV.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^0f3ee1ec]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline implementation — dissemination plans and barriers are noted with proposed countermeasures. The guideline will be presented at clinical meetings, existing AAO-HNSF materials will be updated, and a visual diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm is presented in Figure 8 that emphasizes diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of BPPV with CRPs. Anticipated barriers include clinician unfamiliarity with positional maneuvers (Dix-Hallpike and supine roll tests) and preferences for ordering diagnostic tests even when BPPV criteria are met; clinicians may feel obligated to order CNS imaging or vestibular testing. The guideline's current strong recommendation for CRP with its anticipated high, almost immediate symptom resolution rate is anticipated to decrease such expectations and tendencies, and point-of-care decision support tools, informational pamphlets, and clinician and patient education with counseling on proper follow-up may offset these issues.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^4f91cf15]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

Patients often report symptoms of headache and dizziness concomitantly. Symptoms of dizziness can be explored with a comprehensive vestibular assessment, allowing for the investigation of central and peripheral vestibular system contributions to symptoms of dizziness. Patients who report both symptoms of headache and dizziness demonstrate abnormalities of the vestibular system which can be measured quantitatively. Completion of comprehensive vestibular testing can help to guide diagnosis and strategies for intervention.

Data synthesis

Meta‐analysis of numerical data

Where possible and appropriate (if participants, interventions, comparisons and outcomes were sufficiently similar in the studies identified) we conducted a quantitative synthesis of results. We conducted all meta‐analyses using RevMan 2020. We anticipated that the underlying effect of the intervention may vary between studies, as there are likely to be differences between participants, settings and the interventions used for each study. We therefore planned to use a random‐effects method for meta‐analysis. However, as the only outcomes which we were able to meta‐analyse had few events, this necessitated the use of the fixed effect Peto odds ratio for analysis. We therefore explored whether the use of a random‐effects model substantially altered the effect estimates (see Sensitivity analysis).

For dichotomous data, we analysed treatment differences as a risk ratio (RR) calculated using the Mantel‐Haenszel methods (or using a Peto odds ratio, as described above). We did not conduct any meta‐analysis for continuous data in this review.

Improvement in vertigo symptoms may be assessed using a variety of methods, which consider different aspects of vertigo. These include:

frequency of vertigo episodes;
duration of vertigo episodes;
severity/intensity of vertigo episodes;
a composite measure of all of these aspects: for example, assessed with a global score ‐ such as "how troublesome are your vertigo symptoms?", rated on an ordinal scale.

For the outcomes "improvement in vertigo" and "change in vertigo", we prioritised outcome measures that use a composite score ‐ encompassing aspects of vertigo frequency, duration and severity/intensity. Examples of this include a global rating scale of vertigo impact (rated from 0 to 10, where 0 is defined as no symptoms, and 10 is defined as the most troublesome symptoms) or the vertigo/balance subscale of the Vertigo Symptom Scale (Yardley 1992), or Vertigo Symptom Scale Short Form (Yardley 1998). Where data from composite scores were not available, we included data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure.

Synthesis using other methods

If we were unable to pool numerical data in a meta‐analysis for one or more outcomes we planned to provide a synthesis of the results using alternative methods, following the guidance in Chapter 12 of the Handbook 2021. However, this was not necessary, as results were typically provided by a single study.

### Validation of the sudbury vertigo risk score to risk stratify for a serious cause of vertigo [^91bf86c5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Vanni et al.developed the STANDING algorithm, which consists of the (1) discrimination between spontaneous and positional nystagmus, (2) evaluation of the nystagmus direction, (3) head impulse test, and (4) evaluation of equilibrium, the first and second of which are components of the HINTS examination. A 2022 systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies of this algorithm reported sensitivity for identifying a serious cause of dizziness from 93.4% to 100% and specificity from 71.8% to 94.3%. The review found all three studies of this algorithm were at a high risk of bias. The only external validation study found a sensitivity of 93.6% (95% CI 84.3–98.2) and a specificity of 74.8% (95% CI 84.3–98.2), with all physicians rating confidence in assessing the nystagmus and head impulse test as low.

Comparatively, the Sudbury Vertigo Risk Score has a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 96.5%–100%) and a specificity of 69.2% (95% CI 67.8%–70.5%). This fulfills accuracy requirements identified by emergency physicians, achieving a posttest probability of < 0.5% for a serious diagnosis.

Two guidelines offer advice on the risk stratification of patients presenting with dizziness for a serious outcome. The ACEP clinical policy, although not specifically directed at patients with dizziness, does offer advice for this patient population. It promotes the use of history and physical examination assessment to help risk stratify patients and, if trained, the use of the HINTS examination. The GRACE‐3 guidelines endorse the approach that includes the use of the HINTS examination, STANDING algorithm and assessment of BPPV. As often is the case of clinical guidelines neither approach as diagnostic algorithms have been externally validated for accuracy or impact on clinical practice. That being said both guidelines offer a reasonable a practical approach to the risk stratification of patients with dizziness.

### Computerized clinical decision system and mobile application with expert support to optimize management of vertigo in primary care: study protocol for a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial [^752dfec0]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vertigo and dizziness are amongst the most common symptoms in medicine and often have a major impact on activities of daily life. Although many causes of vertigo and dizziness can easily be recognized, patients often receive inappropriate and ineffective treatment. The reasons for this are various. Because vertigo/dizziness is an interdisciplinary symptom and there is a lack of standardised diagnostic tools, it is easy to lose the overview of the possible differential diagnoses. There is evidence though, that the management of patients with vertigo/dizziness can be optimized using standardized care pathways with digital support. The present study (within the framework of "PoiSe — prevention, online feedback, and interdisciplinary therapy of acute vestibular syndromes by e-health") aims to evaluate the implementation of a program with several interlocking components. The three main components are a computerized clinical decision system, a mobile application, a counselling and interdisciplinary educational program developed by the German Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders (DSGZ). The study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design, as well as a detailed process evaluation. Clusters comprise of primary care physician practices in Bavaria, Germany. In the scope of the study the effectiveness, acceptability and efficiency of the intervention will be evaluated. It is anticipated that the intervention will improve the quality and efficiency of the management of dizzy patients. A higher diagnostic accuracy, optimized treatment, and disease progression monitoring is expected to improve patient-relevant outcomes and reduce health-care costs.

### Intratympanic gentamicin for Ménière's disease [^4e3fba30]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. Aminoglycosides are sometimes administered directly into the middle ear to treat this condition. The aim of this treatment is to partially or completely destroy the balance function of the affected ear. The efficacy of this intervention in preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of intratympanic aminoglycosides versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing intratympanic aminoglycosides with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow‐up of less than three months, or with a cross‐over design (unless data from the first phase of the study could be identified).

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included five RCTs with a total of 137 participants. All studies compared the use of gentamicin to either placebo or no treatment. Due to the very small numbers of participants in these trials, and concerns over the conduct and reporting of some studies, we considered all the evidence in this review to be very low‐certainty.

Improvement in vertigo

This outcome was assessed by only two studies, and they used different time periods for reporting. Improvement in vertigo was reported by more participants who received gentamicin at both 6 to ≤ 12 months (16/16 participants who received gentamicin, compared to 0/16 participants with no intervention; risk ratio (RR) 33.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.15 to 507; 1 study; 32 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and at > 12 months follow‐up (12/12 participants receiving gentamicin, compared to 6/10 participants receiving placebo; RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.69; 1 study; 22 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). However, we were unable to conduct any meta‐analysis for this outcome, the certainty of the evidence was very low and we cannot draw any meaningful conclusions from the results.

Change in vertigo

Again, two studies assessed this outcome, but used different methods of measuring vertigo and assessed the outcome at different time points. We were therefore unable to carry out any meta‐analysis or draw any meaningful conclusions from the results. Global scores of vertigo were lower for those who received gentamicin at both 6 to ≤ 12 months (mean difference (MD) ‐1 point, 95% CI ‐1.68 to ‐0.32; 1 study; 26 participants; very low‐certainty evidence; four‐point scale; minimally clinically important difference presumed to be one point) and at > 12 months (MD ‐1.8 points, 95% CI ‐2.49 to ‐1.11; 1 study; 26 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). Vertigo frequency was also lower at > 12 months for those who received gentamicin (0 attacks per year in participants receiving gentamicin compared to 11 attacks per year for those receiving placebo; 1 study; 22 participants; very low‐certainty evidence).

Serious adverse events

None of the included studies provided information on the total number of participants who experienced a serious adverse event. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or because they were not assessed or reported.

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for the use of intratympanic gentamicin in the treatment of Ménière's disease is very uncertain. This is primarily due to the fact that there are few published RCTs in this area, and all the studies we identified enrolled a very small number of participants. As the studies assessed different outcomes, using different methods, and reported at different time points, we were not able to pool the results to obtain more reliable estimates of the efficacy of this treatment. More people may report an improvement in vertigo following gentamicin treatment, and scores of vertigo symptoms may also improve. However, the limitations of the evidence mean that we cannot be sure of these effects. Although there is the potential for intratympanic gentamicin to cause harm (for example, hearing loss) we did not find any information about the risks of treatment in this review.

Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta‐analysis of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Pharmacological interventions for prophylaxis of vestibular migraine [^04f75677]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary outcomes

Improvement in vertigo Measured as a dichotomous outcome (improved/not improved), according to self‐report, or according to a change of a specified score (as described by the study authors) on a vertigo rating scale.
Change in vertigo Measured as a continuous outcome, to identify the extent of change in vertigo symptoms.
Serious adverse events Including any event that caused death, was life‐threatening, required hospitalisation, resulted in disability or permanent damage, or in congenital abnormality. Measured as the number of participants who experienced at least one serious adverse event during the follow‐up period.

Vertigo symptoms comprise a variety of different features, including frequency of episodes, duration of episodes and severity/intensity of the episodes. Where possible, we included data for the vertigo outcomes that encompassed all of these three aspects (frequency, duration and severity/intensity of symptoms). However, we anticipated that these data may not be available from all studies. If they were unavailable, then we extracted data on the frequency of vertigo episodes as an alternative measure for these outcomes.

### Prospective quantitative evaluation of gait and stance in patients with acute vertigo and dizziness [^28a92beb]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute vertigo and dizziness are the leading symptoms of about 4% of all patient visits to the emergency department (ED). With approximately 13% of the neurological consultations in the ED, it is the third most common complaint after headache and sensorimotor deficits. In previous ED cohorts, 4–10% of patients with acute vertigo and dizziness were found to have a stroke as the underlying cause. Diagnostic approaches for patients with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) are mostly based on the assessment of vestibulo-ocular reflex function and central ocular motor signs established in the head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew (HINTS) triad. For these parameters, a quantitative assessment by video-oculography has become accessible, enhancing the sensitivity for the differentiation between peripheral and central etiologies. In contrast, assessment of posture and gait in acute vertigo and dizziness in previous studies was limited to course-grained clinical evaluation schemes such as the Gait and Truncal ataxia Index (GTI). These studies claim a high diagnostic accuracy of GTI grades 2 and 3 for vestibular stroke against acute unilateral vestibulopathy. A recent meta-analysis indicated that GTI had only a moderate diagnostic accuracy to detect acute central vestibular disorders with a sensitivity of GTI 2/3 of 70.8%, which was inferior to HINTS. Importantly, quantitative assessments of stance and gait during the acute stage of symptoms are almost completely missing to date.

A more standardized evaluation of postural and locomotor function may be justified by the fact that a relevant proportion of patients with acute vertigo and dizziness do mainly present with gait and stance imbalance and ataxia (recently named acute imbalance syndrome, AIS). Prioritizing the development of a diagnostic algorithm tailored to differentiate the etiologies in patients with a predominant AIS phenotype of AVS in the ED is imperative. This process benefits from a systematic evaluation of stance and gait parameters, which could be both reliable and easily applicable in the acute stage of symptoms (preferably already in the ED).

Given these considerations, we conducted the current study with the aim to prospectively gather objective markers of gait and stance based on established quantitative tests such as Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Functional Gait Assessment (FGA), and mobile posturography in patients presenting with acute isolated vertigo and dizziness (without other central symptoms) during the acute stage. We posed the question, if the extent of impairment reflected by these tests could help separate central from peripheral etiologies of acute isolated vertigo and dizziness.

Benefits include accuracy of diagnosis, avoiding unnecessary treatments or testing, more appropriate treatment, patient education, and promoting multidisciplinary care, while the risk/cost is extra time for assessment. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C with Low confidence, and VM is a common cause of dizziness that can closely mimic MD; appropriate assessment could lead to more appropriate treatment. Supporting text notes VM patients are typically younger and more likely to be female than those with MD; a multidisciplinary panel has established diagnostic criteria for VM with migraine features in at least 50% of the vestibular episodes, and VM may present with short (< 15 minutes) or prolonged (> 24 hours) vertigo; conversely, MD should be diagnosed when characteristic audiometric hearing loss is identified on audiograms even when migraine features are present.

### Telling friend from foe in emergency vertigo and dizziness: does season and daytime of presentation help in the differential diagnosis? [^4fbd2e5e]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients presenting to the emergency room (ER) must be diagnosed quickly to identify those needing urgent treatment. The diagnostic algorithm varies according to the leading symptoms upon presentation and possible differential diagnoses. Vertigo and dizziness (VD) are among the most frequent symptoms reported by patients at ER consultations. In neurological ER services, VD accounts for > 10% of patients and is the third most common leading symptom after headache (20%) and motor deficit (13%), respectively, after cerebrovascular disorders (28%) and headache (22%). VD may present as acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) in unilateral vestibular dysfunction (peripheral or central), but other diagnoses have to be kept in mind from benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) to anxiety related dizziness. Patients presenting to the ER are diverse with regard to presenting symptoms, underlying pathologies, pre-existing conditions, age and socioeconomic background. The major concern for ER physicians is to differentiate between potential life-threatening central symptoms and disorders that are more benign. Over the last years, algorithms have been suggested to distinguish between posterior circulation stroke and vestibular neuritis in AVS, i.e. in patients presenting with rotational vertigo, horizontal-rotatory spontaneous nystagmus, postural imbalance with directional falls, nausea, and vomiting. For clinical evaluation, the HINTS procedure (head impulse test, gaze evoked nystagmus, skew deviation) is now widely applied but its usability is still under discussion. In addition, there is growing evidence for predictive factors in non-AVS VD. For the current study we asked the following questions: (1) which patient groups present to the ER and how does the spectrum of disorders differ between ER and a tertiary care outpatient dizziness clinic?; (2) how is the usage of diagnostic/imaging procedures to differentiate between benign and serious causes of VD?; and (3) does the seasonal and circadian distribution of presentation differ between diagnoses? To address these questions, we performed a retrospective chart analysis of all non-surgical patients presenting in a 1-year period to the ER of a tertiary care university hospital in Germany. We hypothesized to see (1) more AVS patients compared to a tertiary care dizziness clinic in the ER; (2) a high number of diagnostic imaging without any pathologic correlate; and (3) a peak of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in morning hours, presentation of stroke/transitoric ischemic attack (TIA) without specific circadian peaks, and a seasonal preponderance of vestibular neuritis (UVH) in spring and autumn because of the suspected viral etiology.

### Central etiologies… [^daee1707]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

TITRATE THE EVALUATION TiTrATE is a novel diagnostic approach to determining the probable etiology of dizziness or vertigo. 2 The approach uses the Timing of the symptom, the Triggers that provoke the symptom, And a Targeted Examination. The responses place the dizziness into one of three clinical scenarios: episodic triggered, spontaneous episodic, or continuous vestibular. If vertigo is described, physicians should ask about hearing loss, which could suggest Meniere disease. 10 Diagnostic criteria for Meniere disease include episodic vertigo associated with documented low- to medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss by audiometric testing in the affected ear and tinnitus or aural fullness in the affected ear. 10 The auditory symptoms are initially unilateral. The patient's gait should be observed and a Romberg test performed. Patients with an unsteady gait should be assessed for peripheral neuropathy.

18 A positive Romberg test suggests an abnormality with proprioception receptors or their pathway. The use of the HINTS examination can help distinguish a possible stroke from acute vestibular syndrome. Test of Skew. Test of skew is assessed by asking the patient to look straight ahead, then cover and uncover each eye. Vertical deviation of the covered eye after uncovering is an abnormal result. Although this is a less sensitive test for central pathology, an abnormal result is fairly specific for brainstem involvement. BPPV is diagnosed with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. 16 Routine imaging is not indicated. 1 However, any abnormal neurologic finding, including asymmetric or unilateral hearing loss, requires computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate for cerebrovascular disease. Hearing loss with vertigo and normal neuroimaging suggests Meniere disease.

Treatment of BPPV consists of a canalith repositioning procedure such as the Epley maneuver, which repositions the canalith from the semicircular canal into the vestibule. The diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine include at least five episodes of vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity lasting five minutes to 72 hours; current or previous history of migraine headache; one or more migraine features, and at least 50% with vestibular symptoms; and no other cause of vestibular symptoms. 51.

### Can emergency physicians accurately rule out a central cause of vertigo using the HINTS examination? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^396c84cd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Dizziness is a common complaint presented in the emergency department (ED). A subset of these patients will present with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS). AVS is a clinical syndrome defined by the presence of vertigo, nystagmus, head motion intolerance, ataxia, and nausea/vomiting. These symptoms are most often due to benign vestibular neuritis; however, they can be a sign of a dangerous central cause, i.e., vertebrobasilar stroke. The Head Impulse test, Nystagmus, Test of Skew (HINTS) examination has been proposed as a bedside test for frontline clinicians to rule out stroke in those presenting with AVS. Our objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the HINTS examination to rule out a central cause of vertigo in an adult population presenting to the ED with AVS. Our aim was to assess the diagnostic accuracy when performed by emergency physicians versus neurologists.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane database, and relevant conference abstracts from 2009 to September 2019 and performed hand searches. No restrictions for language or study type were imposed. Prospective studies with patients presenting with AVS using criterion standard of computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging were selected for review. Two independent reviewers extracted data from relevant studies. Studies were combined if low clinical and statistical heterogeneity was present. Study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Random effects meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5 and SAS 9.3.

Results

A total of five studies with 617 participants met the inclusion criteria. The mean (± SD) study length was 5.3 (± 3.3) years. Prevalence of vertebrobasilar stroke ranged 9.3% to 44% (mean ± SD = 39.1% ± 17.1%). The most common diagnoses were vertebrobasilar stroke (mean ± SD = 34.8% ± 17.1%), peripheral cause (mean ± SD = 30.9% ± 16%), and intracerebral hemorrhage (mean ± SD = 2.2% ± 0.5%). The HINTS examination, when performed by neurologists, had a sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI = 93.1% to 98.5%, I² = 0%) and specificity of 94.8% (95% CI = 91% to 97.1%, I² = 0%). When performed by a cohort of physicians including both emergency physicians (board certified) and neurologists (fellowship trained in neurootology or vascular neurology) the sensitivity was 83% (95% CI = 63% to 95%) and specificity was 44% (95% CI = 36% to 51%).

Conclusions

The HINTS examination, when used in isolation by emergency physicians, has not been shown to be sufficiently accurate to rule out a stroke in those presenting with AVS.

### How age matters in the assessment of vertigo in the pediatric emergency department: a 10-year age-stratified etiology survey [^5a324001]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Vertigo is a relatively frequent cause for referral to the pediatric emergency department, and it is usually caused by benign or self-limiting etiology. However, it could be difficult to evaluate especially in the younger child and could also conceal serious illness as encephalitis or cerebellitis. Our survey collected in a 10-year period 757 children assessed in pediatric emergency department for vertigo and stratified this population for etiology and for group of age: younger than 6 years (113, 14.9%), between 7 and 12 years (251, 33.2%), and older than 12 years (393, 51.9%). In addition, associated signs and symptoms, evaluation by a neurologist or an otorhinolaryngologist, and instrumental investigations were recorded. We found that age is the most important variable to assess the possibility of a central nervous system disease as etiology cause of vertigo with a significant difference of incidence between the younger group (younger than 6 years, 23%) and older groups (3% and 1%; P < 0.001). This finding should reinforce the index of suspicion for a central nervous system illness as cause of vertigo in the preschool children with an accurate workup including evaluation by a neurologist or an otorhinolaryngologist and instrumental investigations as needed.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^a2757978]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) research needs include conducting diagnostic and cost-effectiveness studies to identify which patient subsets warrant additional vestibular testing and/or radiographic imaging, alongside evaluating the utility and costs of audiometry in the diagnostic evaluation of BPPV. Priorities also include determining whether education and application of clinical diagnostic criteria change physician ordering of diagnostic tests and defining the optimal number of CRPs and the time interval between CRPs for posterior canal BPPV. Additional needs are cost-effectiveness analyses of earlier intervention with expedient CRPs, extended cohort studies testing self-performance of CRP or longitudinal VR for reducing recurrence or complications such as falls, and evaluating whether vestibular therapy after CRP offers added benefit. Studies are needed on functional impacts (home safety, work safety and absences, and driving risks) and epidemiologic rates of falls with BPPV, as well as assessing quality of life, developing and validating a disease-specific quality-of-life measure, and comparing structured versus "as needed" follow-up regimens. Further needs include clarifying and standardizing terminology for lateral canal repositioning maneuvers, evaluating mastoid vibration in treatment, characterizing risk factors for development of BPPV (including osteoporosis, dental procedures, and cranial vibration devices), and identifying patient- and treatment-related risk factors for recurrent BPPV. Finally, needs include evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of examination maneuvers for anterior semicircular canal BPPV laterality and characterizing the accuracy of diagnostic maneuvers for posterior and lateral canal BPPV and treatment outcomes in nonspecialty settings.

### European guideline on chronic nausea and vomiting – A UEG and ESNM consensus for clinical management [^fcb9cb1a]. United European Gastroenterology Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nausea and vomiting, more specifically with respect to evaluation of chronic nausea and vomiting, ESNM/UEG 2025 guidelines recommend to consider evaluating for vestibular disorders if chronic nausea and vomiting are accompanied by dizziness and/or vertigo, headache, hearing loss, tinnitus, impaired vision, focal weakness, and difficulty walking.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^901af98a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — radiographic testing is addressed as follows: Clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging. Recommendation against radiographic imaging based on diagnostic studies with limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity: Reduce unnecessary testing and costs, reduce unnecessary radiation and radiographic contrast exposure (National Quality Strategy domains: safety, affordable quality care). Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C based on observational studies for radiographic imaging. Level of confidence in evidence: Medium. Benefits: Facilitate timely treatment by avoiding unnecessary testing associated with low-yield and potential false-positive diagnoses; avoid radiation exposure and adverse reactions to testing. Risks, harms, costs: None. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments: The panel placed heavy value in the accuracy of the BPPV diagnosis at the outset in that a diagnosis made by appropriate history and Dix-Hallpike is adequate to proceed with management without further testing. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: Patients who have separate indications for radiographic or vestibular testing aside from confirming a diagnosis of BPPV. Policy level: Recommendation against. Differences of opinion: None. Routine radiographic imaging is unnecessary for patients who already meet clinical criteria for the diagnosis of BPPV (Table 6). Radiographic imaging of the CNS should be reserved for patients who present with a clinical history compatible with BPPV but who also demonstrate additional neurologic symptoms atypical for BPPV.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^7f118857]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dizziness and vertigo, more specifically with respect to Dix-Hallpike maneuver (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2017 guidelines recommend to perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45 degrees to one side and the neck extended 20 degrees with the affected ear down) to elicit provoked vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus for the diagnosis of posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Repeat the maneuver with the opposite ear down if the initial maneuver is negative.

### History… [^3f61defc]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION The cranial nerves should be examined for signs of palsies, sensorineural hearing loss, and nystagmus. Vertical nystagmus is 80 percent sensitive for vestibular nuclear or cerebellar vermis lesions. 1, 3, 19 may be the most helpful test to perform on patients with vertigo. It has a positive predictive value of 83 percent and a negative predictive value of 52 percent for the diagnosis of BPPV. 7, 10 After the initial test, the intensity of induced symptoms typically wanes with repeated maneuvers in peripheral vertigo but does so less often in central vertigo. 15 The combination of a positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver and a history of vertigo or vomiting suggests a peripheral vestibular disorder.

22 If the maneuver provokes purely vertical or torsional nystagmus without a latent period of at least a few seconds, and does not wane with repeated maneuvers, this suggests a central cause for vertigo such as a posterior fossa tumor or hemorrhage. 14, 15. HEAD AND NECK EXAMINATION The tympanic membranes should be examined for vesicles or cholesteatoma. Hennebert's sign indicates the presence of a perilymphatic fistula. CARDIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION Orthostatic changes in systolic blood pressure and pulse in patients with vertigo upon standing may identify problems with dehydration or autonomic dysfunction.

10 Carotid sinus stimulation should not be performed; it has been shown to be not useful diagnostically 22 and potentially is dangerous. 26Magnetic resonance or conventional angiography of the posterior fossa vasculature may be useful in diagnosing vascular causes of vertigo such as vertebrobasilar insufficiency, thrombosis of the labyrinthine artery, anterior or posterior inferior cerebellar artery insufficiency, and subclavian steal syndrome. 26 Neuroimaging studies can be used to rule out extensive bacterial infections, neoplasms, or developmental abnormalities if other symptoms suggest one of those diagnoses.

### Validation of a comprehensive diagnostic algorithm for patients with acute vertigo and dizziness [^7c6aae50]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Vertigo and dizziness are common complaints in emergency departments and primary care, and pose major diagnostic challenges due to their various underlying etiologies. Most supportive diagnostic algorithms concentrate on either identifying cerebrovascular events (CVEs) or diagnosing specific vestibular disorders or are restricted to specific patient subgroups. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate a comprehenisve algorithm for identifying patients with CVE and classifying the most common vestibular disorders.

Methods

The study was conducted within the scope of the "PoiSe" project (Prevention, Online feedback, and Interdisciplinary Therapy of Acute Vestibular Syndromes by e-health). A three-level algorithm was developed according to international guidelines and scientific evidence, addressing both the detection of CVEs and the classification of non-vascular vestibular disorders (unilateral vestibulopathy, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular paroxysmia, Menière's disease, vestibular migraine, functional dizziness). The algorithm was validated in a prospectively collected dataset of 407 patients with acute vertigo and dizziness presenting to the Emergency Department at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich.

Results

The algorithm assigned 287 of 407 patients to the correct diagnosis, corresponding to an overall accuracy of 71%. CVEs were identified with high sensitivity of 94%. The six most common vestibular disorders were classified with high specificity, above 95%. Random forest identified presence of a paresis, sensory loss, central ocular motor and vestibular signs (HINTS [head impulse test, nystagmus assessment, and test of skew deviation]), and older age as the most important variables indicating a cerebrovascular event.

Conclusions

The proposed diagnostic algorithm can correctly classify the most common vestibular disorders based on a comprehensive set of key questions and clinical examinations. It is easily applied, not limited to subgroups, and might therefore be transferred to broad clinical settings such as primary healthcare.
