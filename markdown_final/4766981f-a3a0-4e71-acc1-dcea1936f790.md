What is the best prescription medication for a person who is already on multiple medications?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the best prescription medication for a person who is already on multiple medications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there even is a single "best" drug in the context of polypharmacy. Then, I should verify the harms of inappropriate polypharmacy and the role of deprescribing. Next, I will review validated tools and frameworks for medication review. After that, I need to weigh the risks and benefits of adding versus removing drugs, consider disease-specific exceptions where adding is required, account for system-level barriers, and synthesize an actionable, patient-centered plan with monitoring and follow-up [^114DhJK8] [^115QLgsF].

> Let me first confirm the premise: is there a universal "best" medication for someone already on many medicines? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — high-quality evidence emphasizes that polypharmacy appropriateness is contextual and individualized; the goal is not more or fewer drugs per se, but the right drugs at the right doses for the right indications, aligned with patient goals [^114DhJK8] [^115kUZ1n].

> I need to check the core principles that guide safe prescribing in polypharmacy. The principle of appropriateness over abundance is key; interventions should improve appropriate polypharmacy, not merely reduce counts. I should confirm that deprescribing is itself a therapeutic intervention, supervised and goal-directed, and that patient-centered decision-making is essential to success — yes, both are consistently supported by rigorous geriatric pharmacotherapy guidance and systematic reviews [^114DhJK8] [^115QLgsF].

> Next, I should review which evaluation frameworks are recommended and their limitations. Wait, let me verify — tools such as Beers Criteria, STOPP/START, and the Medication Appropriateness Index can identify potentially inappropriate medications but no single tool is proven superior for improving hard outcomes, so clinician judgment remains critical while using these aids within a structured review [^114DhJK8] [^113KBHYv] [^1153pQV7].

> I will now examine the components of a systematic medication review. Let me think about the sequence: comprehensive reconciliation of all prescription, OTC, and supplements; for each drug, confirm indication, estimate benefit given current status, assess harms and monitoring burden, screen for drug–drug and drug–disease interactions, consider regimen complexity and adherence, and align the plan with the patient's goals, followed by monitored implementation and iterative follow-up. I should double-check that multidisciplinary and patient-centered approaches are recommended — yes, they are consistently endorsed in high-quality overviews of optimizing medications in older and complex patients [^114DhJK8] [^115kUZ1n].

> Before proposing additions, I need to ensure I understand the risks of polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is associated with increased adverse drug events including falls, fractures, impaired cognition, loss of autonomy, hospitalization, and death; the risk escalates with hyperpolypharmacy and with the accumulation of potentially inappropriate medications, particularly around transitions of care and following hospital discharge [^115QLgsF] [^111WhYKP] [^111H68sw].

> But wait — should the default be adding or removing a medication? Evidence suggests we should often prioritize deprescribing when risks outweigh benefits, with emerging data indicating that structured deprescribing can improve appropriateness without clear signals of harm, although effects on hard outcomes vary across studies; when adding a high-risk medicine is necessary, robust safety protocols and risk mitigation are non-negotiable, as illustrated by the stringent precautions required for transmucosal fentanyl in opioid-tolerant cancer pain [^114DhJK8] [^1153pQV7] [^114QxvGz].

> Let me consider important disease-specific exceptions where adding medications is indicated despite polypharmacy. For active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, initiating or escalating disease-modifying therapy is guideline-supported, with safety monitoring for PML risk and MRI surveillance tailored to individual risk, and longitudinal assessment of adherence and adverse effects is recommended; this shows that "best" can mean the disease-appropriate agent plus structured monitoring rather than avoidance of therapy [^116TL2uj] [^1175W9dD] [^114SP7uE] [^114CcHrD]. For cardiovascular disease, improving adherence to evidence-based classes while simplifying regimens is crucial, underscoring that appropriateness includes both what we prescribe and how we help patients take it [^112UNqtd].

> I should confirm system-level barriers that can derail even a good plan. Fragmented care with multiple prescribers increases the risk of inappropriate prescribing and complicates deprescribing; electronic alerts and pharmacist-led reviews can help but are underutilized, and clinicians with geriatric expertise demonstrate lower PIM rates — so coordinating prescribers and leveraging specialized input can materially improve appropriateness [^116MBKE9] [^1153pQV7] [^116JWiuu].

> Next, I should review medication adherence and regimen complexity, because the "best" medication fails if it is not taken correctly. Nonadherence is common and difficult to detect; combining patient report with pharmacy and, when necessary, objective testing can improve detection, and simplifying to once-daily dosing, using combination pills, structured education, reminders, and, in select cases, dispensing technologies can enhance adherence without adding risk [^114uKWuH] [^112UNqtd] [^116fQPzM] [^113ZrATw].

> I need to ensure I convert these principles into an actionable, stepwise approach. Let me outline it clearly: reconcile all therapies across sources; perform a tool-guided, clinician-judgment–informed review of indication, benefit, harm, and interactions; align with patient priorities; prioritize deprescribing where risks exceed benefits; if adding a drug is necessary, choose options with lower interaction potential and simpler dosing, provide clear education, and establish explicit monitoring and stop criteria; coordinate across prescribers and include pharmacists and caregivers; and schedule follow-up to reassess outcomes and iterate the plan [^114DhJK8] [^115kUZ1n] [^116fQPzM].

> Hold on, I should verify that we also guard against prescribing cascades. Recognizing when a new symptom may be an adverse drug reaction — rather than a new disease — prevents layering additional medications that compound risk; systematically screening for common cascades is a practical safeguard during every medication review [^111X2xHF].

> Hmm, wait a minute — my first instinct was to name a "best" drug class, perhaps a statin for cardiovascular risk or an SSRI for mood, but that would be a mistake here because the correct choice depends entirely on the patient's conditions, goals, interactions, and current harms; let me reconsider and correct that framing by emphasizing that, in some contexts like dialysis or complex multimorbidity, success is less about reducing the number of drugs and more about ensuring each one is appropriate, effective, safe, and convenient within a coordinated plan [^112UNqtd] [^116zqYkS] [^115kUZ1n].

> Therefore, I should conclude that there is no single "best" prescription medication for someone already on multiple medicines; the best "medication" is the one that survives rigorous, individualized scrutiny within a structured, patient-centered process, which often leads to deprescribing and, when additions are necessary, demands disease-specific evidence, simple regimens, cross-prescriber coordination, and proactive safety monitoring [^114DhJK8] [^115QLgsF] [^112UNqtd].

---

There is no single "best" prescription medication for patients on multiple medications; the safest approach is to **individualize therapy** [^113KBHYv] and **minimize interactions**. Use the **lowest effective dose**, prefer once-daily regimens [^112UNqtd], and avoid drugs with high interaction risk (e.g. CYP3A4 substrates/inhibitors, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, opioids, and QT-prolonging agents) [^113KBHYv] [^114QxvGz]. Apply Beers and STOPP/START criteria, perform **regular medication reviews**, and deprescribe when possible [^114DhJK8]. Prioritize medications with simple dosing, low interaction potential, and clear benefit; consider combination pills to reduce pill burden and improve adherence [^113KDgri] [^116fQPzM].

## General principles for prescribing in polypharmacy

When prescribing for patients on multiple medications, clinicians should adhere to the following **general principles**:

- **Individualized therapy**: Tailor medication choices to the patient's specific clinical conditions, comorbidities, and treatment goals [^111Bfrou].

- **Minimize drug interactions**: Carefully evaluate potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and avoid medications with high interaction potential [^114uKWuH].

- **Simplify regimens**: Prefer medications with once-daily dosing, fixed-dose combinations, or long-acting formulations to reduce pill burden and improve adherence [^116fQPzM].

- **Regular medication review**: Conduct periodic medication reviews to identify and discontinue unnecessary or potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) [^116pSQif].

- **Patient education**: Ensure patients understand their medication regimens, potential side effects, and the importance of adherence [^112UNqtd].

---

## Medications with low interaction potential and favorable safety profiles

Certain medication classes are generally considered safer for patients on multiple medications due to their **low interaction potential** and favorable safety profiles:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Antihypertensives | - ACE inhibitors (e.g. lisinopril) <br/> - ARBs (e.g. losartan) <br/> - Calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine) | - Low interaction potential <br/> - Favorable safety profiles |
| Statins | - Pravastatin <br/> - Rosuvastatin | - Minimal CYP450 interactions <br/> - Low risk of muscle toxicity compared to other statins |
| Antidepressants | - Sertraline <br/> - Escitalopram | - Low interaction potential <br/> - Favorable safety profiles |
| Antidiabetic agents | - Metformin <br/> - DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g. sitagliptin) | - Low interaction potential <br/> - Favorable safety profiles |
| Proton pump inhibitors | - Pantoprazole | - Minimal CYP450 interactions <br/> - Favorable safety profile |

---

## Medications to avoid or use with caution

Certain medications should be **avoided or used with caution** in patients on multiple medications due to their high interaction potential and risk of adverse effects:

- **CYP3A4 substrates/inhibitors**: Medications metabolized by or inhibiting CYP3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole, clarithromycin, amiodarone) can cause significant DDIs.

- **Anticholinergic medications**: These can cause cognitive impairment, falls, and other adverse effects, particularly in older adults [^111WhYKP].

- **Benzodiazepines and opioids**: High risk of sedation, respiratory depression, and dependence [^114QxvGz] [^113wDqQ9].

- **QT-prolonging medications**: Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

---

## Strategies to minimize adverse drug interactions

Clinicians can minimize adverse drug interactions by performing **comprehensive medication reconciliation** [^116zqYkS] that captures and routinely updates all prescription, over-the-counter, and herbal products. Using **clinical decision support** within electronic prescribing to check interactions [^114uKWuH], **systematically deprescribing** unnecessary or potentially harmful agents [^114DhJK8], and providing **patient education and adherence support** [^112UNqtd] further reduce risk.

---

## Clinical guidelines and tools for safe prescribing

Several **clinical guidelines and tools** are available to assist clinicians in prescribing safely for patients on multiple medications [^113KBHYv]:

- **Beers criteria**: Identifies potentially inappropriate medications in older adults [^111WhYKP].

- **STOPP/START criteria**: Provides guidance on medications to stop or start in older adults [^114DhJK8].

- **Medication Appropriateness Index (MAI)**: Assesses medication appropriateness [^116pSQif].

- **Comprehensive medication management (CMM)**: A patient-centered approach involving pharmacists and other healthcare professionals [^116zqYkS].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing medication choice

In older adults, age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes often necessitate **dose adjustments** [^116CH2wc]. Comorbidities, such as renal or hepatic impairment, require careful medication selection and dosing modifications [^116zqYkS]. Because complex regimens can reduce adherence, **simplification is essential**, and **patient values and preferences** should guide final medication choices [^112UNqtd].

---

## Role of healthcare professionals in managing polypharmacy

Pharmacists conduct **medication reviews**, identify drug–drug interactions, and provide patient education [^1153pQV7]. Physicians regularly review and adjust medication regimens and coordinate care among specialists; **nurses** monitor adherence, provide education, and support medication management [^114DhJK8] [^116fQPzM].

---

## Evidence-based interventions to improve medication adherence

Evidence-based approaches include **patient education** with clear information about medications and their importance [^113KDgri], and the use of **reminders** (e.g. electronic prompts or pill organizers) [^113ZrATw]. **Simplifying regimens** by reducing pill burden and dosing frequency [^112UNqtd], and involving **clinical pharmacists** in medication management, further improve adherence [^114DhJK8].

---

There is no single "best" prescription medication for patients on multiple medications. The safest and most effective approach is to **individualize therapy**, minimize drug interactions, and regularly review and adjust medication regimens [^113KBHYv].

### Polypharmacy: Evaluating risks and deprescribing [^113KBHYv]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Polypharmacy, defined as the regular use of at least five medications, is common in older adults and younger at-risk populations. It increases the risk of adverse medical outcomes. Several risk factors can lead to polypharmacy:

- **Patient-related factors**: Having multiple medical conditions managed by multiple subspecialist physicians, having chronic mental health conditions, and residing in a long-term care facility.
- **Systems-level factors**: Poorly updated medical records, automated refill services, and prescribing to meet disease-specific quality metrics.

Tools that help identify potentially inappropriate medication use include the Beers criteria, STOPP (Screening Tool of Older People's Prescriptions), START (Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment) criteria, and the Medication Appropriateness Index. No single tool or strategy has been shown to be superior in improving patient-related outcomes and decreasing polypharmacy risks.

Monitoring patients' active medication lists and deprescribing any unnecessary medications are recommended to reduce pill burden, the risks of adverse drug events, and financial hardship. Physicians should view deprescribing as a therapeutic intervention similar to initiating clinically appropriate therapy. When deprescribing, physicians should consider patient and caregiver perspectives on goals of therapy, including views on medications and chronic conditions, as well as preferences and priorities regarding prescribing to slow disease progression, prevent health decline, and address symptoms. Point-of-care tools can aid physicians in deprescribing.

### Prevalence and factors associated with polypharmacy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1153pQV7]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Identifying any polypharmacy is the first step towards assessing whether it is inappropriate. Several strategies can be employed to reduce inappropriate prescribing or polypharmacy:

- **Medication review**: Conducted by pharmacists, physicians, or multidisciplinary teams, this has been found effective for reducing polypharmacy in various populations.

- **Education and training**: Providing education and training to healthcare professionals can contribute to reducing inappropriate prescribing.

- **Screening tools**: Tools such as the Screening Tool of Older Persons' Potentially Inappropriate Prescription (STOPP) are effective in identifying potentially inappropriate prescribing.

Digital technologies, such as automatically generated alerts in electronic prescribing programs, have shown promising results in lowering polypharmacy in various settings, although they have not been widely adopted or investigated. Most studies focus on interventions in settings of greatest concern, such as among older adults or those in residential care. However, interventions to reduce polypharmacy vary widely, and the most effective aspects are still unclear.

Deprescribing does not appear to increase adverse outcomes, but whether reducing polypharmacy results in improved outcomes is less clear. Studies incorporating clinical outcomes have had mixed findings regarding the effects of deprescribing on quality of life, falls, disease-specific outcomes, and hospitalizations. Several reviews of interventions to reduce polypharmacy have found no effect on all-cause mortality.

Polypharmacy is a complex issue and may differ in appropriateness and implications for medically complex individuals.

### Interventions to improve medication adherence: A review [^113KDgri]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Among adults with chronic illness, 30% to 50% of medications are not taken as prescribed. In the United States, it is estimated that medication nonadherence is associated with 125,000 deaths, 10% of hospitalizations, and $100 billion in health care services annually.

PubMed was searched from January 1, 2000, to September 6, 2018, for English-language randomized clinical trials of interventions to improve medication adherence. Trials of patients younger than 18 years, trials that used self-report as the primary adherence outcome, and trials with follow-up periods less than 6 months were excluded; 49 trials were included. The most common methods of identifying patients at risk for nonadherence were patient self-report, electronic drug monitors (pill bottles), or pharmacy claims data to measure gaps in supply. Patient self-report is the most practical method of identifying nonadherent patients in the context of clinical care but may overestimate adherence compared with objective methods such as electronic drug monitors and pharmacy claims data.

Six categories of interventions, and characteristics of successful interventions within each category, were identified:

- **Patient education**: Personalized telephone counseling sessions with health educators.
- **Medication regimen management**: Using combination pills to reduce the number of pills patients take daily.
- **Clinical pharmacist consultation for chronic disease co-management**: Includes education, increased frequency of disease monitoring via telephone or in-person follow-up visits, and refill management.

Regarding medical management for multiple sclerosis, specifically in relation to disease-modifying therapies, the 2018 guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend considering the initiation of azathioprine or cladribine in patients with relapsing forms of MS who do not have access to approved disease-modifying therapies.

### ECTRIMS/EAN guideline on the pharmacological treatment of people with multiple sclerosis [^1175W9dD]. Multiple Sclerosis (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and specifically with respect to indications for monitoring, the EAN/ECTRIMS 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a standardized reference brain MRI to monitor treatment safety in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with disease-modifying drugs:

- **Low risk for PML**: Conduct MRI every year.
- **High risk for PML (JC virus-positive, natalizumab treatment duration > 18 months)**: Conduct MRI more frequently, on a 3–6 monthly basis.
- **High risk for PML and switching drugs**: Conduct MRI at the time the treatment is discontinued and after the new treatment is started.

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^1161RK51]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

While, to the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to examine patient factors for the new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in older multimorbid adults with polypharmacy, there are several limitations. First, the data are from several years ago (owing, in part, to an administrative lag in Medicare data and linking with EHR data); however, prescribing rates of PIMs have not changed since 2007–2014. Consequently, we expect the exploration of risk factors to remain highly relevant.

Second, due to the criterion-based rather than judgment-based nature of the Beers list, medications indicated in certain circumstances (e.g. use as a last resort) may have been flagged as potentially inappropriate. Despite this, the Beers criteria are the most commonly used tool for defining PIM use in the US, and restricting the analyses to medications with a medium and high level of evidence did not change the results.

Despite our data covering the period from 2007 to 2014, we used the 2019 Beers list to inform medical decision-making. This comes with a modest limitation that some medications included in the Beers list were excluded in the meantime and some new ones were added. Overall, however, these changes only concerned a small number of medications listed in Table 2 of the Beers criteria (e.g. in the 2015 version of the Beers criteria, four medications were removed and three were added; in the 2019 version of the Beers criteria, two medications were removed and three were added).

Furthermore, we were not able to adjust our models for the number and types of pres…

### Effect of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation on multiple atherosclerotic risk factors in patients taking antidepressant medication [^114Ccwik]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Antidepressants might increase compliance with cardiovascular disease risk reduction interventions; however, they have been linked to deleterious metabolic effects. In the present multicenter study, we sought to determine whether patients who take antidepressants derive the expected benefits from cardiac rehabilitation in terms of improvements in multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.

A cohort of 26,957 patients who had completed a baseline assessment before participating in an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program constituted the study population. The patients were stratified into three cohorts (nondepressed, depressed unmedicated, and depressed medicated) at baseline, according to a self-reported history of depression and the use of antidepressants. Risk factors were assessed at baseline and after approximately 12 weeks of program participation.

A self-reported history of depression was present at baseline in 5,172 patients (19.2%). Of these patients, 2,147 (41.5%) were taking antidepressants. Patients in the nondepressed cohort (49.4% completion) were more likely (p 0.05) in patients taking antidepressants and those who were not.

In conclusion, patients taking antidepressants benefit similarly from exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation as those not taking these medications, indicating that antidepressants do not hinder the effectiveness of such programs.

### Criteria to report adverse drug withdrawal events in clinical trials: A systematic review [^115QLgsF]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Polypharmacy, often defined as the concurrent use of five or more medications, is common among older adults. While the use of multiple prescription medications is often necessary to manage various health conditions associated with aging, polypharmacy can also carry important risks. For example, people taking multiple medications are more likely to experience adverse drug events (ADEs), which can include falls, fractures, impaired cognition, loss of autonomy, hospitalization, and death. ADEs also impose a significant burden on healthcare systems, as ADE-induced hospitalizations are associated with longer stays, higher costs, and increased mortality rates.

Deprescribing, the clinically supervised process of tapering or stopping medications that are no longer beneficial, where there are side effects, or where the risk of harm may outweigh the benefits, might reduce some of the associated risks of polypharmacy. The optimal interventions and processes for deprescribing are still being created, refined, and evaluated. The success of deprescribing-related clinical trials is often measured by the extent to which medications are discontinued, reductions in ADEs, and sustained or improved quality of life.

### Avandamet [^113kRv9f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

There are multiple medications available to treat type 2 diabetes. The benefits and risks of each available diabetes medication should be taken into account when choosing a particular diabetes medication for a given patient. Patients should be informed of the risks and benefits of Avandamet. Avandamet should only be taken by adults with type 2 diabetes who are already taking rosiglitazone, or who are not already taking rosiglitazone and are unable to achieve adequate glycemic control on other diabetes medications, and, in consultation with their healthcare provider, have decided not to take pioglitazone (Actos) or pioglitazone-containing medications (Actoplus Met, Actoplus Met XR, Duetact) for medical reasons.

- **Patient advice**: The risks of lactic acidosis, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development, as noted in the warnings and precautions sections, should be explained to patients. Patients should be advised to discontinue Avandamet immediately and promptly notify their health practitioner if unexplained hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, unusual somnolence, or other nonspecific symptoms occur. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of Avandamet, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of metformin therapy, are unlikely to be drug-related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Avoid excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, while receiving Avandamet.

Avandamet is not recommended for patients with…

### The impact of polypharmacy on the health of Canadian seniors [^116CH2wc]. Family Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Prescription medication use increases with age. Seniors face an increased risk of adverse drug reactions from medications, partly because the kidneys and liver can lose functional ability with increasing age, resulting in the need for changes in dosage.

- **Objective**: To use population survey data to understand the extent and impact of multiple medication use and adverse drug events among Canadian seniors.

- **Methods**: This study consists of analysis of data from the Canadian Survey of Experiences with Primary Health Care, which was conducted through telephone by Statistics Canada in 2008. These analyses focused on the 3132 respondents who were ≥ 65 years of age.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven percent of seniors reported taking five or more medications on a regular basis. Within the past year, 12% of seniors taking five or more medications experienced a side effect that required medical attention compared with 5% of seniors taking only one or two medications. Even when controlling for age and number of chronic conditions, the number of prescription medications was associated with the rate of emergency department use. Less than half of all seniors reported having received medication reviews and having the possible side effects of their prescription medications explained to them by their physician.

- **Conclusions**: Many Canadian seniors have an elevated risk of adverse events due to taking a high number of prescription medications and not having the potential side effects and drug interactions explained to them. There are interventions that can potentially reduce polypharmacy and…

### Potentially inappropriate medication use and polypharmacy before and after admission to internal medicine for older patients [^111WhYKP]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

With the aging of the population and the increase in chronic diseases, there is an inherent risk of polypharmacy and inappropriate medication use. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of potentially inappropriate medication use and its correlation with polypharmacy.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study among patients aged ≥ 65 years, hospitalized at The National University Hospital of Iceland from 2010 to 2020. Data on medication usage were retrieved from the National Prescription Medicine Registry. Based on the number of medications filled in the year prior to admission and post-discharge, participants were categorized as non-polypharmacy (< 5), polypharmacy (5–9), and hyper-polypharmacy (≥ 10). The prevalence and incidence of potentially inappropriate medication use were assessed based on the 2019 Beers criteria. Regression models were used to correlate sociodemographic, clinical, and pharmacoepidemiologic variables with the odds of new potentially inappropriate medication use.

- **Results**: The cohort comprised 55,859 patients (48.5% male) with a median [interquartile range] age of 80 [73–86] years. The prevalence of inappropriate medication use in the year preceding admission was 34.0%, 77.7%, and 96.4% for patients with non-polypharmacy, polypharmacy, and hyper-polypharmacy, respectively. The incidence of new potentially inappropriate medication use was 46.7% (95% confidence interval 45.6%-47.6%) among those with no potentially inappropriate medication use pre-admission. Factors associated with higher odds of new potentially inappropriate medication use included…

### Deprescribing interventions and their impact on medication adherence in community-dwelling older adults with polypharmacy: A systematic review [^113ow4Xn]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The management of many chronic diseases depends chiefly on the assumption that the medications prescribed by the clinician are taken by the individual being treated. Medication adherence is defined as the extent to which prescribed medications are taken according to the dosage and frequency recommended by the provider. It is estimated, however, that between 30% and 50% of people do not take their medications as prescribed. Theories as to the causes of non-adherence generally recognize socio-economic, healthcare system, condition, and patient-related factors. Methods to combat non-adherence are wide-ranging, from practical interventions to behavior change interventions targeting psychological barriers to medication use. The resulting costs of non-adherence are both human, with individuals not gaining the benefit of treatment, and economic, resulting in unused medication, for example. Older people are particularly susceptible to non-adherence due to multi-morbidity associated with polypharmacy, and due to particular constraints such as physical, cognitive, or sensory impairments.

In this review, polypharmacy is defined as the taking of any medication that is potentially inappropriate, rather than exceeding a defined number of drugs. Adherence to an inappropriate medication can lead to harm. However, available evidence regarding polypharmacy and drug adherence in the older population living at home is scarce. Most studies have focused on improving adherence to one drug group, and thus have limited applicability to the older population who commonly use multiple medications.

### Frail elderly patients' experiences of information on medication. A qualitative study [^112Z79gn]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Frail older people often receive treatment that entails a daily intake of several medicines. It is of utmost importance and also a legally binding regulation that the patients receive the optimal amount of information on a suitable level that will allow them to manage their medication.

Inadequate information and limited medical knowledge can lead to poorer adherence to prescribed medication. Not taking one's medicines in the prescribed way can lead to a reduced therapeutic effect or overdose-related problems, which in turn can result in further medication, unnecessary investigations, or hospitalization. Elderly patients taking cardiovascular medication are more vulnerable to noncompliant behavior since they often require multiple and long-term therapy. Taking several medicines can lead to difficulty in remembering the indications or possible adverse effects of each medication and in deciding when to seek help. These individuals are also more vulnerable due to diminished plasticity caused by their illnesses and age.

### Application of evidence-based medical therapy is associated with improved outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention and is a valid quality indicator [^116Hb2bd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

We sought to determine whether the prescription of evidence-based medications at discharge after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can predict long-term clinical outcomes. The association of standard-of-care drug utilization with long-term mortality and morbidity after PCI is not well studied.

We performed a retrospective cohort study of successful PCI procedures on 7,745 patients between March 1, 1998, and December 31, 2004. Discharge medications were analyzed, and a medication score (MEDS) was developed. A MEDS of 1 was assigned for each of the following medication classes: 1) antiplatelet, 2) lipid-lowering, 3) beta-blocker, and 4) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The outcomes measured were long-term death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization.

Patients with a MEDS of 3 to 4 had higher-risk profiles based on standard clinical and angiographic criteria. Despite this, at a median follow-up of 36 months, patients with a MEDS of 3 or 4 were at a lower risk of death than those with a MEDS of 0 or 1 (8.9%, 7.5%, and 13% for MEDS of 4, 3, and 0 to 1, respectively; p = 0.014). After adjustment for covariates, a MEDS of 3 to 4 was associated with significantly lower mortality or myocardial infarction in follow-up than a MEDS of 0 to 1 (hazard ratios of 0.72 and 0.67 for MEDS of 3 and 4, respectively; p < 0.01). There was no association between MEDS and target vessel revascularization.

After successful PCI, the use of multiple evidence-based classes of cardiovascular medication is indicative of improved outcomes.

### Defining optimal length of opioid pain medication prescription after common surgical procedures [^116zAYNA]. JAMA Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The overprescription of pain medications has been implicated as a driver of the burgeoning opioid epidemic; however, few guidelines exist regarding the appropriateness of opioid pain medication prescriptions after surgery. This study seeks to describe patterns of opioid pain medication prescriptions after common surgical procedures and determine the appropriateness of the prescription as indicated by the rate of refills.

The Department of Defense Military Health System Data Repository was used to identify opioid-naive individuals aged 18 to 64 who had undergone one of eight common surgical procedures between January 1, 2005, and September 30, 2014. The adjusted risk of refilling an opioid prescription based on the number of days of the initial prescription was modeled using a generalized additive model with spline smoothing.

- **Exposures**: Length of initial prescription for opioid pain medication.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Need for an additional subsequent prescription for opioid pain medication or a refill.

Of the 215,140 individuals (107,588 women and 107,552 men; mean [SD] age, 40.1 [12.8] years) who underwent a procedure within the study time frame and received and filled at least one prescription for opioid pain medication within 14 days of their index procedure, 41,107 (19.1%) received at least one refill prescription. The median prescription lengths were 4 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3–5 days) for appendectomy and cholecystectomy, 5 days (IQR, 3–6 days) for inguinal hernia repair, and 4 days (IQR, 3–5 days) for hysterectomy.

### Use of potentially inappropriate medication and polypharmacy in older adults: A repeated cross-sectional study [^113WhoK6]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Low credibility.

One of the most common forms of treatment, especially in older adults (≥ 75 years), is medication treatment. The goal of medication therapy is to prevent, treat, or cure disease or symptoms of disease. For older adults with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, the effect of medications may not always be positive among this group of patients. Advances in medication development in recent decades have resulted in the healthcare system's ability to prevent, treat, and cure more symptoms and diseases than ever before. Developments in medical practice and medication development have significantly contributed to the increase in life expectancy observed today.

The morbidity burden of the older population increases due to longer life expectancy. With increased multimorbidity in the population, the use of medications also increases, as does the risk of adverse drug events (ADE). Multimorbidity, measured as the number of chronic conditions together with the number of medications, has been found to be of importance concerning the risk of hospitalization in an older population. However, very few studies include a morbidity measurement when evaluating the quality of drug treatment.

Use of multiple medications simultaneously is known as polypharmacy and is commonly defined as the use of five or more medications at the same time. Polypharmacy has been found to be an independent risk factor for adverse drug events and hospitalizations in an older population. Adverse drug events from interactions and contraindications can be misinterpreted as new symptoms or diagnoses and generate further prescriptions.

### Optimisation of medications used in residential aged care facilities: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115kUZ1n]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). High credibility.

Inappropriate medication prescription encompasses misprescribing, overprescribing, and underprescribing. Misprescribing involves the use of medication that significantly increases the risk of adverse drug events (ADEs) and involves incorrect dose, frequency, administration, and duration. The use of medications that are likely to cause drug-drug interactions or drug-disease interactions is also an aspect of misprescribing. Overprescribing involves the use of medications without clear indications. Underprescribing is the omission of clinically indicated medication that may have potential benefit for treatment of the disease.

Residents of aged care facilities (RACFs) are often frail and have multiple comorbidities. On average, RACF residents take more medications than younger age groups and more than community-dwelling elderly with similar disease complications. They are frequently prescribed multiple medications that can increase the risk of ADEs, morbidity, and mortality. Moreover, the majority of these residents have dementia, and the use of psychotropic drugs is typically high. Age-related changes in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, multiple comorbidities, and the presence of polypharmacy are the main factors often associated with ageing that make optimisation of drug therapy a complex task.

Previous studies indicate that about 40% of prescriptions for RACF residents may be suboptimal or inappropriate. Consequently, there is a heightened risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), hospitalisations, and medical expenses. Therefore, there is an urgent need for…

### Adherence to osteoporosis treatments: Room for improvement [^1133yuTU]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a growing problem worldwide, with the greatest burden resulting from fractures. Currently available are several treatment options that are effective in reducing fracture risk. Patient adherence to these medications is required for benefit to be seen; yet, similar to other chronic asymptomatic diseases, adherence to osteoporosis therapies is poor. The reasons for suboptimal adherence are multiple but include fear of possible side effects, dosing requirements, and an unwillingness to take medication for a 'silent' disease. Poor adherence leads to reduced effectiveness, increased morbidity, and increased medical costs.

Efforts to improve adherence to osteoporosis treatments are ongoing. The first obstacle in improving adherence is determining the causes of poor adherence. Despite several identifiable causes, improving adherence is difficult. Passive patient education with printed information alone does not appear very effective. Physician-patient interaction, including discussion of bone mineral density results, discussion of osteoporosis medication benefits, and feedback on treatment effects, may be more effective.

Improved patient education, better tolerated and less frequently dosed medications, and more healthcare provider-patient interaction may improve adherence and lead to greater fracture reduction.

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^113hELkE]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of all patients overall and by whether they were newly prescribed a potentially inappropriate medication (PIM). In the entire cohort, the average age was 78 years (SD = 7.5), and 58.6% of patients were female. Patients newly prescribed a PIM differed from those who were not prescribed a PIM; for example, new PIM prescribing was higher among men and those with greater prior healthcare services use. The types of chronic conditions were relatively comparable between the two groups at baseline, except for congestive heart failure.

- **Baseline characteristics, by whether the participants had a new prescription of a potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) during the 90-day follow-up period**: Missing data was less than 2% for all variables listed. Comorbidities were defined using coding algorithms for defining Elixhauser comorbidities in ICD-9 administrative data [Quan et al, 2005], with ≥ 2 ICD-9 codes per category. Hypertension and diabetes categories were merged, as well as the different cancer categories. Drug abuse, alcohol abuse, obesity, weight loss, HIV/AIDS, paralysis, other neurological disorders, blood loss anemia, and deficiency anemia were not presented. Due to the cohort definition, all patients had at least one ambulatory visit during the baseline period.

### Management of polypharmacy in dialysis patients [^116zqYkS]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Most patients receiving dialysis have other common chronic conditions in addition to end-stage renal disease, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mineral and bone disorder, all of which require long-term medication management. Dialysis patients take an average of 10–12 prescribed and over-the-counter medications from an average of 4.7 prescribers and consume an average of 19 pills per day. Thus, reducing polypharmacy is not adequate as a medication therapy goal for these patients. Instead, the dialysis community should focus on ensuring that all patients receive medications that are appropriate, effective, safe, and convenient.

Barriers to this include a fragmented healthcare system with inadequate communication between multiple prescribers and pharmacies, and frequent care transitions between ambulatory care sites (dialysis centers, ambulatory primary care practices, ambulatory specialty practices) and the hospital, skilled nursing facilities, or long-term care facilities.

Three distinct processes are necessary to prevent and solve the resultant medication-related problems and reduce polypharmacy:

- **Medication reconciliation**: Creating an accurate medication list that reflects all medications the patient is taking and how they are being taken.

- **Medication review**: Evaluating the list for appropriateness, effectiveness, safety, and convenience in conjunction with the patient's health status.

- **Ongoing patient-centered medication therapy management**: Developing treatment plans centered on each patient's medication-related goals.

A team approach involving healthcare professionals is essential to address these medication-related challenges effectively.

### Actiq [^114QxvGz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Actiq is a strong prescription pain medication containing an opioid (narcotic) used to manage breakthrough pain in adults (16 years and older) with cancer, who are already taking other opioid pain medicines around-the-clock for cancer pain. Actiq is started only after you have been taking other opioid pain medicines and your body has become used to them (you are opioid tolerant). Do not use Actiq if you are not opioid tolerant.

An opioid pain medicine can put you at risk for overdose and death. Even if you take your dose correctly as prescribed, you are at risk for opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse that can lead to death.

- **Important information about Actiq**: Get emergency help or call 911 immediately if you take too much Actiq (overdose). When you first start taking Actiq, when your dose is changed, or if you take too much, serious or life-threatening breathing problems that can lead to death may occur. Talk to your healthcare provider about naloxone, a medicine for the emergency treatment of an opioid overdose.

- **Taking Actiq with other medicines** that may make you sleepy, such as other pain medicines, anti-depressants, sleeping pills, anti-anxiety medicines, antihistamines, or tranquilizers, or with alcohol or street drugs, can cause severe drowsiness, confusion, breathing problems, coma, and death. Never give anyone else your Actiq; they could die from taking it. Selling or giving away Actiq is against the law. Store Actiq securely, out of sight.

### Medication adherence in cardiovascular medicine [^112UNqtd]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally. While pharmacological advancements have improved the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease, non-adherence to prescribed treatment remains a significant barrier to improved patient outcomes. A variety of strategies to improve medication adherence have been tested in clinical trials and include the following categories:

- **Improving patient education**: Providing patients with better education about their medications and the importance of adherence can significantly enhance compliance.

- **Implementing medication reminders**: Tools such as alarms, apps, and pillboxes can prompt patients to take their medications on time.

- **Testing cognitive behavioral interventions**: These interventions aim to address psychological barriers and enhance motivation for adherence.

- **Reducing medication costs**: Lowering costs can remove financial barriers that prevent patients from consistently acquiring their medications.

- **Utilizing healthcare team members**: Engaging multiple healthcare providers can offer support and reinforce adherence strategies.

- **Streamlining medication dosing regimens**: Simplifying complex dosing schedules can reduce confusion and improve adherence.

In this review, we describe specific trials within each of these categories and highlight the impact of each on medication adherence. We also examine ongoing trials and future lines of inquiry for improving medication adherence in patients with cardiovascular diseases.

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^115vifqU]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) is common in older adults and is associated with potential negative consequences, such as falls and cognitive decline. Our objective was to investigate measurable patient factors associated with new outpatient prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in older multimorbid adults already using multiple medications.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective US cohort study, we used linked Medicare pharmacy and medical claims and electronic health record data from a large healthcare system in Massachusetts between 2007 and 2014. We identified patients aged ≥ 65 years with an office visit who had not been prescribed or used a PIM in the prior 180 days. PIMs were defined using the 2019 Beers criteria of the American Geriatrics Society. To specifically evaluate factors in patients with polypharmacy and multimorbidity, we selected those who filled medications for ≥ 90 days (i.e. chronic use) from ≥ 5 pharmaceutical classes in the prior 180 days and had ≥ 2 chronic conditions. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the association between baseline demographic and clinical characteristics on the probability of being prescribed a PIM in the 90-day follow-up period.

- **Results**: In total, we identified 17,912 patients aged ≥ 65 years with multimorbidity and polypharmacy who were naïve to a PIM in the prior 180 days. Of those, 10,497 (58.6%) were female, and the mean age was 78 (SD = 7.5). On average, patients had 5.1 (SD = 2.3) chronic conditions and previously filled 6.1 (SD = 1.4) chronic medications. In total…

### Impact of medication nonadherence and drug-drug interaction testing on the management of primary care patients with polypharmacy: a randomized controlled trial [^114uKWuH]. BMC Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Clinical management of patients with chronic cardiometabolic disease is complicated by polypharmacy, defined as the concomitant administration of five or more medications. The prevalence of polypharmacy among adults in the United States (U.S.) is highest among those with heart disease and has risen dramatically from 40.6% (95% confidence interval, 34.5–46.7) between 1999 and 2000 to 61.7% (95% CI, 55.2–68.2) between 2017 and 2018. Consequently, when clinicians are confronted with diagnosing the etiology of a patient's clinical deterioration, they are challenged to distinguish polypharmacy-related factors, such as medication nonadherence and drug-drug interactions (DDIs), from the natural progression of the underlying chronic diseases.

Medication nonadherence rates in a recent meta-analysis ranged from 7.0 to 83.5%, with the highest rates among adults taking medications for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. This systematic review of 178 studies revealed that medication nonadherence was detected better, although incompletely, by self-report (76.5%) than by reliance on pharmacy data (69.4%) or electronic monitoring (44.1%), providing further evidence that the detection of medication nonadherence remains a diagnostic challenge. For example, measurements of drugs or drug metabolites in body fluid (most commonly blood or urine) and the direct observation of drug ingestion accurately detect systemic drug presence. However, these methods may be invasive or impractical for patients with multiple comorbidities and/or polypharmacy. Indirect detection methods, such as monitoring for medication refills or changes in clinical biomarkers, offer alternative strategies but may not provide the precision required for optimal disease management.

### Developing a measure of polypharmacy appropriateness in primary care: Systematic review and expert consensus study [^116pSQif]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The importance of a regular full review of prescribed medications was formulated as a new indicator specifically following panel discussion. Systematically conducted medication reviews have been shown to be of particular importance to patients with polypharmacy and have been recommended for those over 75 taking multiple drugs. Not conducting regular medication reviews, particularly for those prescribed multiple drugs, places patients at greater risk of potential harm. However, evidence is limited on the clinical effectiveness of systematically conducted medication reviews for reducing the suboptimal use of medicines and improving patient-reported outcomes.

Cost-effectiveness was included in a number of identified instruments, including the MAI, but was discarded by our panel. Their view was that cost-effectiveness in prescribing (typically defined as ensuring that medication is both clinically and economically appropriate for the conditions) was not, in itself, a marker of polypharmacy appropriateness. Instead, they viewed cost-effectiveness as a potentially positive consequence of patient-centered medicines optimization. Our patient panel also echoed this opinion, agreeing simply that prescribing generic drugs, when available and when cheaper than branded products, was a sensible approach.

### Medication adherence support of an in-home electronic medication dispensing system for individuals living with chronic conditions: A pilot randomized controlled trial [^113ZrATw]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). High credibility.

The evidence from this study suggests that the medication dispensing system (MDS) can be an effective, long-term solution to medication non-adherence in community-dwelling older adults experiencing chronic conditions and taking multiple medications. The technology induces better consistency and improvement in medication-taking behavior than simple, non-technological interventions. Future, large-scale research is warranted to demonstrate medication dispensing technology's potential in enhancing older patients' health outcomes and reducing healthcare system utilization and costs.

### Interventions for improving medication-taking ability and adherence in older adults prescribed multiple medications [^116fQPzM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Older people taking multiple medications represent a large and growing proportion of the population. Managing multiple medications can be challenging, especially for older people who have higher rates of comorbidity and physical and cognitive impairment than younger adults. Good medication-taking ability and medication adherence are necessary to ensure the safe and effective use of medications.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve medication-taking ability and/or medication adherence in older community-dwelling adults prescribed multiple long-term medications.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from inception until June 2019. We also searched grey literature, online trial registries, and reference lists of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster-RCTs. Eligible studies tested interventions aimed at improving medication-taking ability and/or medication adherence among people aged ≥ 65 years (or of mean/median age > 65 years), living in the community or being discharged from the hospital back into the community, and taking four or more regular prescription medications (or with a group mean/median of more than four medications). Interventions targeting carers of older people who met these criteria were also included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently reviewed abstracts and full texts.

### Tencon [^112TaT7i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Tencon (butalbital and acetaminophen) tablets are indicated for the relief of the symptom complex of tension (or muscle contraction) headaches. Evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of this combination product in the treatment of multiple headaches is unavailable. Caution is required in this regard because butalbital is habit-forming and potentially abusable.

### Medication usage change in older people (65+) in England over 20 years: Findings from CFAS I and CFAS II [^11522jSH]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Medical practice has changed over the last decades, reflecting the ageing population, where multi-morbidity requiring multiple medications is more common.

- **Objective**: Describe and quantify self-reported medicine use, including both prescription and over-the-counter medicines, in two comparable population-based studies of older people (65+) in England as well as assess the nature and scale of polypharmacy.

- **Methods**: Data were used from two separate population-based studies, the Cognitive Function Ageing Study I and II. Descriptive analyses were performed to summarise and quantify general medicine use. Negative binomial regression models were fitted to determine factors associated with the number of medicines used.

- **Results**: Medication use, including both prescribed medicines and over-the-counter products, has increased dramatically over the last two decades. The number of people taking five or more items quadrupled from 12% to 49%, while the proportion of people who did not take any medication decreased from around 1 in 5 to 1 in 13. Cardiovascular drugs were the most frequently taken medications. Polypharmacy is associated with increases in the number of diagnosed long-term conditions.

- **Conclusions**: Comparison between CFAS I and II reveals marked increases in medication usage and polypharmacy in the older population. The influence of healthcare organisation, introduction of new guidelines, and technology changes leading to earlier diagnosis of milder chronic diseases and treatment may be contributing to this changing pattern. Further research is needed to develop practical solutions.

### ECTRIMS/EAN guideline on the pharmacological treatment of people with multiple sclerosis [^116TL2uj]. Multiple Sclerosis (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for multiple sclerosis, especially concerning disease-modifying therapies, the EAN/ECTRIMS 2018 guidelines recommend initiating treatment for patients with active relapsing-remitting MS. The choice of agent depends on patient characteristics, comorbidities, disease severity/activity, drug safety profile, and drug accessibility, which should be decided in discussion with the patient:

- **Interferons**: Interferon β-1b, interferon β-1a (subcutaneous, intramuscular).
- **Peginterferon**: Peginterferon β-1a.
- **Other agents**: Glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, cladribine, fingolimod, daclizumab, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, and alemtuzumab.

### Deprescribing medications among patients with multiple prescribers: A socioecological model [^116MBKE9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Low credibility.

Deprescribing is the intentional dose reduction or discontinuation of a medication. The development of deprescribing interventions should take into consideration important organizational, interprofessional, and patient-specific barriers that can be further complicated by the presence of multiple prescribers involved in a patient's care. Patients who receive care from an increasing number of prescribers may experience disruptions in the timely transfer of relevant healthcare information, increasing the risk of exposure to drug-drug interactions and other medication-related problems.

Furthermore, the fragmentation of healthcare information across health systems can contribute to the refilling of discontinued medications, reducing the effectiveness of deprescribing interventions. Thus, deprescribing interventions must carefully consider the unique characteristics of patients and their prescribers to ensure interventions are successfully implemented.

In this special article, an international working group of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, epidemiologists, and researchers from the United States Deprescribing Research Network (USDeN) developed a socioecological model to understand how multiple prescribers may influence the implementation of a deprescribing intervention at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, and societal level. This manuscript also includes a description of the concept of multiple prescribers and outlines a research agenda for future investigations to consider. The information contained in this manuscript should be used as a framework for future deprescribing research efforts.

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^1174R3JU]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Use of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) is common in older adults and is associated with negative consequences, such as falls and cognitive decline. Our objective was to investigate measurable patient factors associated with new outpatient prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in older multimorbid adults already using multiple medications.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective US cohort study, we used linked Medicare pharmacy and medical claims and electronic health record data from a large healthcare system in Massachusetts between 2007 and 2014. We identified patients aged ≥ 65 years with an office visit who had not been prescribed or used a PIM in the prior 180 days. PIMs were defined using the 2019 Beers criteria of the American Geriatrics Society. To specifically evaluate factors in patients with polypharmacy and multimorbidity, we selected those who filled medications for ≥ 90 days (i.e. chronic use) from ≥ 5 pharmaceutical classes in the prior 180 days and had ≥ 2 chronic conditions. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the association between baseline demographic and clinical characteristics on the probability of being prescribed a PIM in the 90-day follow-up period.

- **Results**: In total, we identified 17,912 patients aged ≥ 65 years with multimorbidity and polypharmacy who were naïve to a PIM in the prior 180 days. Of those, 10,497 (58.6%) were female, and the mean age was 78 (SD = 7.5). On average, patients had 5.1 (SD = 2.3) chronic conditions and previously filled 6.1 (SD = 1.4) chronic medications.

### Medication adherence behavior and priorities among older adults with CKD: A semistructured interview study [^113rgTLr]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) typically use more than five medications and have multiple prescribing physicians. However, little is known about how they prioritize their medical conditions or decide which medications to take.

- **Methods**: Semistructured interviews (average length, 40 minutes) were conducted with 20 community-dwelling adults with CKD stages 3–5D receiving nephrology care at a tertiary referral center. Respondents were asked about their medications, prescribing physicians, and medication-taking behaviors. We performed thematic analysis to explain patients' decisions regarding medication prioritization, understanding, and adherence decisions.

- **Results**: Participants (age range, 55–84 years; mean, 72 years) used 5–14 prescribed medications, had 2–9 physicians, and had 5–11 comorbid conditions. All had assigned implicit priorities to their medications. Although most expressed the intention to be adherent, many regularly skipped medications they considered less important. Most participants identified the prescribing physician and indication for each medication, but there often was substantial discordance between beliefs about medications and conventional medical opinion. Respondents prioritized medications based on the salience of the particular condition, perceived effects of the treatment, and barriers (physical, logistic, or financial) to using the prescribed drug. Side effects of medications were common and anxiety-provoking, but discussions with the prescribing physician often were delayed or unfulfilling for the patient.

- **Conclusions**: Polypharmacy in patients with CKD is a complex issue influenced by numerous factors including the perceived importance of conditions, the effects of treatments, and external barriers faced by patients.

### How much do elders with chronic conditions know about their medications [^115c8a6t]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

According to the World Health Organization's multidimensional adherence model (MAM), medication adherence is shown to be multifactorial. The five dimensions of MAM include socioeconomic factors, health care system-related factors, condition-related factors, treatment-related factors, and patient-related factors, of which knowledge of medication is an important component of appropriate medication use. Patients with chronic diseases often undertake multiple medication regimes to manage their conditions, prevent complications, and maintain their quality of life. Many patients with chronic disease conditions are elderly and may struggle in following medication instructions, such as taking the prescribed dosage and following the administration schedule.

A patient's medication knowledge has been defined as the awareness of the drug name, purpose, administration schedule, adverse effects or side-effects, or special administration instructions. Patients who need to take multiple medications are usually deficient in medication knowledge, especially the elderly. A study of patients aged 65 years or above found that 62% showed understanding of their medication regimens, but those with the most complex regimens had difficulty naming and explaining the purpose of their medications. Another study found that 75% of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart failure were adherent to their prescribed medicines, but their medication knowledge was low. For ambulatory cardiovascular patients, a study showed that they had the highest scores for knowledge.

### Opioid prescribing by multiple providers in Medicare: Retrospective observational study of insurance claims [^113wDqQ9]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Despite its limitations, our study suggests that prescribing of opioids by multiple providers is common among Medicare beneficiaries and is associated with higher rates of hospital admissions related to use. Educating patients about the risks of obtaining prescription opioids from multiple providers, combined with enhancing state efforts to monitor prescription drugs — allowing access by providers to prescription databases at the point of care — might be useful in curbing this practice.

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: What are their effects on the lipid profile [^114ViDfq]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Many medications widely prescribed for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) influence, to varying degrees, selected components of the routine lipid profile (i.e. LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG levels) and, consequently, potentially the risk for ASCVD. While some effects may be significant, many medications are associated with relatively small changes in the lipid profile and are therefore unlikely to affect ASCVD risk by themselves. However, the cumulative effect in patients taking multiple medications may be significant and should not be overlooked.

The net effects of these medications on the lipid profile, in addition to effects on other factors related to cardiovascular health, should be anticipated, and their overall potential impact on ASCVD risk should be considered. Therefore, clinicians can help to ensure optimal care and avoid putting patients at unnecessary risk by performing ongoing lipid-panel monitoring, taking into account potential effects of commonly prescribed medications. Ultimately, lifestyle recommendations and lipid-lowering agents are required to target atherogenic cholesterol and achieve the appropriate goals determined by the absolute risk for an individual, especially those with a relatively higher absolute risk (i.e. patients with diabetes).

### Geriatricians, general internists, and potentially inappropriate medications for a national sample of older adults [^116JWiuu]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). High credibility.

Older adults are often prescribed medications that are potentially dangerous, and geriatricians have specialized training in treating polypharmacy, which may benefit these patients. To examine this, we compared potentially inappropriate medication (PIM) prescribing rates between geriatricians and similar general internists in the United States.

- **Methods**: Using national cross-sectional data from 2013 to 2019, we compared annual PIM prescribing rates between 2,815 outpatient geriatricians, certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine from 1994 to 2018, and general internists matched 1:1 on internal medicine (IM) certification exam score and year, residency exam pass rate, gender, and US birth and/or US medical school. PIM prescribing was based on the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) PIM physician annual prescribing measures, which consider medications flagged as potentially inappropriate in the American Geriatric Society Beers Criteria® guideline. We also examined the prescribing of appropriate alternative medications. Prescribing rates were calculated as the percentage of a physician's patients with Medicare fee-for-service Part D enrollment seen in the outpatient setting in a given year (mean: 150 patients per physician) with a PIM prescription they prescribed.

- **Results**: Across 30,677 physician-year observations, geriatricians were 16.7% less likely (95% confidence interval (CI): -19.8 to -13.7, p < 0.001) to prescribe a PIM (7.2% versus 8.7% of patients, respectively) and 2.7% more likely (95% CI: 0.8 to 4.5, p = 0.004) to prescribe an appropriate alternative medication.

### Interventions to improve the appropriate use of polypharmacy for older people [^114DhJK8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Inappropriate polypharmacy is a particular concern in older people and is associated with negative health outcomes. Choosing the best interventions to improve appropriate polypharmacy is a priority so that many medicines may be used to achieve better clinical outcomes for patients. This is the third update of this Cochrane Review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of interventions, alone or in combination, in improving the appropriate use of polypharmacy and reducing medication-related problems in older people.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and two trial registers up until January 13, 2021, together with handsearching of reference lists to identify additional studies. We ran updated searches in February 2023 and have added potentially eligible studies to the 'Characteristics of studies awaiting classification'.

- **Selection criteria**: For this update, we included randomized trials only. Eligible studies described interventions affecting prescribing aimed at improving appropriate polypharmacy (four or more medicines) in people aged 65 years and older, which used a validated tool to assess prescribing appropriateness. These tools can be classified as either implicit tools (judgement-based/based on expert professional judgement) or explicit tools (criterion-based, comprising lists of drugs to be avoided in older people).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Four review authors independently reviewed abstracts of eligible studies, and two authors extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We pooled study-specific estimates.

### A population study on factors associated with unintentional falls among Iranian older adults [^111H68sw]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). High credibility.

Medications are usually a solvable risk factor in older adults. Older adults are prone to take multiple medications due to multi-morbidity. They are often sensitive to some medications, which can affect their balance or ability to think clearly. Taking too many medications can lead to side effects such as confusion, thus increasing the prevalence of poisoning and injuries among older adults. Older adults, especially when taking several drugs simultaneously, are more exposed to the risks of side effects and drug interactions. Furthermore, physiological changes following aging reduce older adults' ability to metabolize and eliminate the side effects of drugs. Other scenarios of intoxication in older adults include repeated doses, unintentional use of the wrong medication due to poor eyesight, medication of other family members, and eating non-edible items.

Some medications are well-known for side effects that increase a person's risk of falling. The more drugs older adults take, the greater the chance that a combination of them will make a fall more likely to occur. According to our results, using four or more prescription medications is considered an established risk factor for falls in older adults. The risk of hospitalization due to falls increased with polypharmacy. Anti-hypertensive medications and those that suppress the central nervous system (reducing alertness and causing slower reactions and movements) are among those most likely to contribute to falling.

### Developing a measure of polypharmacy appropriateness in primary care: Systematic review and expert consensus study [^115GsL9K]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Use of multiple medications in a single individual, known as polypharmacy, is a global phenomenon creating new challenges for many health services. This is driven by increasing levels of multimorbidity and a culture of single-condition guideline-based prescribing.

Polypharmacy is associated with several undesirable consequences. However, it has been demonstrated that the association between polypharmacy and adverse outcomes is attenuated in the most multimorbid individuals. This suggests that overly simplistic analyses, which relate simple medication counts to adverse outcomes, may be misleading. Polypharmacy is typically measured using arbitrary numeric thresholds, but these fail to capture medication appropriateness. Therefore, more sophisticated approaches that account for clinical context are required.

A number of prescribing indicators assess medication appropriateness and are considered to have face validity. They may have value in improving quality and reducing adverse outcomes. However, such indicators generally do not account for multiple drug use and do not measure polypharmacy per se. Explicit 'drug specific' indicators, such as the Beers criteria, do not apply to all patients, and implicit measures, like the Medication Appropriateness Index, require time-consuming input from an experienced clinician.

There is a need to develop a valid and reliable means of measuring polypharmacy that accounts for clinical appropriateness. Furthermore, framing polypharmacy appropriateness, rather than simply categorizing it as appropriate or inappropriate, is essential.

### Identifying and quantifying potentially problematic prescribing cascades in clinical practice: A mixed-methods study [^111X2xHF]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). High credibility.

A prescribing cascade occurs when medication causes an adverse drug reaction (ADR) that leads to the prescription of additional medication. This can be intentional to manage the ADR, but it is not the case when the ADR is misinterpreted as a new condition. Although some intentional prescribing cascades can be appropriate or even recommended, many are considered problematic. Prescribing cascades are problematic when the benefits of prescribing additional medication do not outweigh the risks. These cascades can lead to an excess medication burden, which is a particular concern for older adults. Nonetheless, prescribing cascades can occur at any age and are more likely in people using multiple medications. Multimorbidity, polypharmacy, and aging can complicate the recognition of ADRs, making it difficult to identify these cascades.

Previous studies have identified and assessed prescribing cascades, but few aimed to summarize those relevant for clinical practice. A scoping review identified 281 signals for potential prescribing cascades based on medication prescription sequences. This included potential prescribing cascades for which there was no prior evidence that the condition treated was an ADR, limiting their clinical relevance. Another review identified 94 prescribing cascades, some of which might be considered appropriate while others lacked evidence for the potential ADR. In another study, an expert panel assessed 139 potential prescribing cascades and classified nine of them.

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^114wULuN]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

We used information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the classification of medications into different pharmaceutical classes (e.g. anticholinergics) to define polypharmacy. We measured medication use at the class level, as medications with structural similarities, such as statins, are generally considered interchangeable. Medication classes with ≥ 90 days' supply were considered as being used chronically. We measured days' supply from claims conservatively to ascertain long-term polypharmacy.

First, we assumed continuous utilization if there were multiple fills for the same class on the same day, and if the recorded days' supply differed, the medication with the longest duration was selected. Next, a limited shift of supply (30 days) was used for overlapping utilization in the case of non-continuous fills. We defined patients as having polypharmacy when they filled medications from ≥ 5 pharmaceutical classes with ≥ 90 days' supply each, in line with commonly used definitions for polypharmacy and previously used approaches for measuring chronic use.

### Prevention bingo: Reducing medication and alcohol use risks for older adults [^113SW6Fa]. Aging & Mental Health (2010). Low credibility.

Older adults are a population vulnerable to the effects of alcohol, medication-to-alcohol interactions, and combining multiple medications. This study examines the effectiveness of a prevention program to increase older adults' knowledge about these risks.

- **Methods**: Older adults (N = 348) participated in a prevention program and took pre- and post-tests measuring their knowledge about the risks of taking multiple medications and alcohol use as one ages. A subsample of the group (N = 60) was followed 30 days post-program participation and completed a survey on how the program affected their attitudes and choices regarding medications and alcohol use.

- **Results**: Results showed a significant increase in knowledge about older adults' risks related to medication and alcohol use from pre- to post-test. The majority of the group sampled at 30 days post-participation agreed or strongly agreed that their attitudes had changed. They reported increased awareness and understanding of the importance of knowing their risks related to medication use, medication interactions, polypharmacy, and alcohol.

- **Conclusion**: As a result of this intervention, older adults gained knowledge about their own risks related to medication use, medication interactions, polypharmacy, and alcohol use. Further research is needed to replicate these findings and to determine how prevention education can reduce these risks for older adults.

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^112GDi56]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Our results were mixed on whether there is an association between the new prescribing of PIMs and age. In our main model, we observed that those ≥ 85 years had a lower risk of new PIM prescribing, but this was no longer significant in some sensitivity analyses. Similarly, while some previous studies did not observe any association, others also found a protective factor of age. Furthermore, when examining Black race, we found mixed results, as Black race was no longer significantly associated with PIM prescribing after adjusting for the types of chronic conditions. Prior research in more general populations of older adults has, in fact, found a positive association between white race and greater PIM prescribing.

We found that an above median number of ambulatory care visits and the number of prescribing orders were positively associated with PIM prescribing, which could be indicators of clinical complexity. Literature on PIM prescribing and health services use is mixed: one study found an association between inpatient stays, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits, while another did not find an association between PIM prescribing and outpatient visits. There is some evidence that PIM prescribing may be positively associated with the number of prescribers. Contrasted with patient demographic and health services use factors, the presence of specific chronic comorbidities was generally not found to be associated with new PIM prescribing. This aligns with previous research.

Overall, we observed that patients who were newly prescribed a PIM during the fo

### Opioid prescribing by multiple providers in Medicare: Retrospective observational study of insurance claims [^1111hoqv]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Amid national concerns over opioid misuse and adverse effects of legitimate use, the frequency with which patients obtain opioid prescriptions from multiple healthcare providers — such as physicians, dentists, or, less commonly, physician assistants — rather than a single healthcare provider has received increasing attention in the US, not only because it might reflect the illicit procurement of opioids by patients intentionally seeking out multiple providers (that is, "doctor shopping") but because it might indicate fragmented patient care. Although much of the focus on multiple provider opioid prescribing has centered on opioid diversion (in which legally obtained opioids are transferred from a licit to an illicit channel of distribution or use), the ability of patients to receive opioid prescriptions from multiple physicians who do not or cannot communicate with one another can lead to fragmented prescribing of opioids. This is particularly concerning among elderly patients, due to increased adverse events associated with opioid use and high rates of polypharmacy in this population.

Despite this concern, however, there are no national estimates of the frequency of opioid prescribing by multiple providers in the US Medicare population, the characteristics of patients and physicians involved, and patient outcomes associated with multiple provider opioid prescribing. The US Medicare program is the primary source of insurance for Americans above the age of 65, and in 2012 insured nearly 50 million Americans, of whom about 83% were above the age of 65.

### Starting two or more drugs concurrently in primary care: How often is it done, how often is it needed [^114tkXKi]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

There is growing awareness of the need for more cautious, conservative prescribing. One conservative prescribing principle urges prescribers, whenever possible, to start only one new medication at a time. Little is known about how often primary care physicians (PCPs) start multiple medications at the same time and when that is needed.

- **Objective**: To describe how frequently PCPs start multiple prescriptions at the same time, evaluate evidence supporting the necessity of initiating multiple prescriptions concurrently, and describe PCP and clinical sites' prescribing variability.

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study.

- **Participants**: PCPs at four sites who wrote prescriptions during January 2017-December 2018.

- **Main measures**: Frequency of initiating two or more new prescriptions during the same session.

- **Key results**: Across the four sites, 4,646 PCPs wrote 7,849,914 new prescriptions. The Veterans Administration (VA) site had the highest percentage of encounters with multiple new drug starts (27.2%), followed by Northwestern (NW) (19.7%), Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) (16.1%), and University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) (14.0%). Within each site, there was wide variation among PCPs in the percentage of encounters where they prescribed multiple new medications. Interquartile range varied: 11.0–18.5% (BWH), 15.1–22% (NW), 11.0–15.8% (UIC), and 22.9–31.0% (VA). Reviewing the most frequent combinations, only 0.6% had strong evidence for starting them concurrently. Most were drugs either recommended to be taken together (16.8%) or reasonable to be taken together.

### Patient factors associated with new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in multimorbid US older adults using multiple medications [^113Xspzr]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Several demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with the new prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in older patients who were naïve to PIMs, such as being aged ≥ 85 years, male sex, and having a higher number of ambulatory visits. This also indicates that patients with more complex health problems may be at a higher risk of new PIM prescribing.

Central nervous system drugs, cardiovascular drugs, anticholinergics, and endocrine drugs were the most commonly prescribed PIMs during the 90-day follow-up period. Due to the potential negative outcomes associated with the use of PIMs, these study findings should inform the creation of interventions to improve the coordination of care and reduce the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications in older multimorbid adults with polypharmacy.

### Opioid prescribing by multiple providers in Medicare: Retrospective observational study of insurance claims [^116qzzJf]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

Using prescription claims data from a national sample of US Medicare beneficiaries in 2010, we found that prescribing of opioids by multiple providers was common. More importantly, patients' receipt of prescription opioids from multiple providers was strongly associated with higher rates of admission to hospital related to opioid use. For example, among patients utilizing the same quantity of prescribed opioid drugs over the course of a year, those who received prescription opioids from four or more unique providers had twice the annual rate of admission than those who received prescription opioids from only one provider (3.2% vs. 1.6% admitted in a year). Multiple provider opioid prescribing was highest among younger beneficiaries, black patients, and those who filled prescriptions for stimulants, other central nervous system drugs, non-narcotic analgesic drugs, neuromuscular drugs, or antineoplastic drugs.

- **Interpretation of findings**: While patients might appropriately fill opioid prescriptions from multiple providers for reasons such as a change in their primary opioid provider, prescribing by a covering physician, or prescribing in settings such as a dentist's office or emergency room, multiple provider prescribing might also reflect fragmented care — whereby no specific physician is solely responsible for a patient's needs for opioid prescription — or intentional doctor shopping by patients. Although prior studies of multiple provider opioid prescribing have specifically attempted to identify patterns of doctor shopping in younger adult populations, such practices still pose significant risks.

### Managing medications in clinically complex elders: "There's got to be a happy medium" [^111Bfrou]. JAMA (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple medication use is common in older adults and may ameliorate symptoms, improve and extend quality of life, and occasionally cure disease. Unfortunately, multiple medication use is also a major risk factor for prescribing and adherence problems, adverse drug events, and other adverse health outcomes.

Using the case of an older patient taking multiple medications, this article summarizes the evidence-based literature about improving medication use and withdrawing specific drugs and drug classes. It also describes a systematic approach for how health professionals can assess and improve medication regimens to benefit patients and their caregivers and families.

### Medication-taking behaviors and perceptions among adults with heart failure (from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke Study) [^113yBEwz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Medication regimens in adults with heart failure (HF) are complex, potentially complicating patient adherence. Individuals with HF frequently use beta blockers (BBs) for multiple indications, including hypertension and HF, but BBs can have significant side effects that may affect their use. This study examined medication-taking behaviors and perceptions in individuals with HF, with a particular focus on BBs. A mailed survey on medication use was administered to US adults with HF enrolled in the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke Study.

Among 518 respondents, 357 (69%) reported taking a BB. Nearly half (42%) reported taking ten or more medications per day. However, 45% indicated that they did not miss any days taking medications, and over 85% reported a willingness to take additional medications to prevent further healthcare encounters. Participants' perceptions of BB symptoms varied, but 56% of those who reported experiencing symptoms did not discuss this with their healthcare providers.

Adults who experienced HF hospitalization had higher odds of reporting taking BBs to treat HF (odds ratio 1.51, 95% confidence interval 1.19, 1.91). Adults with hypertension were also likely to report taking BBs to treat high blood pressure (odds ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.79, 3.26). In conclusion, despite extensive medication regimens, individuals with HF were willing to take additional medications for their disease. Participant recognition of BB use for treating HF and co-morbidities was high, yet many do not report side effects to healthcare providers.
