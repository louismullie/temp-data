## Question

What are the contraindications to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the contraindications to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, distinguishing absolute from relative factors, technique-specific issues, and viable alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical context for PEG indications and how that frames contraindications. Then, I should classify absolute versus relative contraindications with precise source support. Next, I will examine technique-dependent considerations (pull vs push) and tumor seeding risk. After that, I need to review high-risk scenarios that are not strict contraindications but mandate precautions. Finally, I will synthesize alternatives when PEG is unsuitable and outline a practical decision framework with citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication window because contraindication strength often depends on why PEG is being considered. PEG is the preferred route when enteral nutrition is anticipated beyond roughly four weeks, with the gastric route generally favored unless specific anatomic or motility issues warrant jejunal access, and in oncologic cachexia, expert guidance also prefers PEG over nasogastric feeding when long-term support is needed, which anchors when we even entertain PEG candidacy [^115Gpyc7] [^115eesPN] [^115w79xF].

> Now, I need to delineate absolute contraindications, but I should double-check definitions because some texts blur "absolute" and "strong relative". Authoritative summaries list as absolute: inability to safely appose the anterior gastric wall to the abdominal wall, complete pharyngeal or esophageal obstruction that precludes endoscope and tube passage, active peritonitis, and uncorrectable coagulopathy; many also include very limited life expectancy on ethical grounds, recognizing this as an absolute from a decision-making standpoint rather than solely technical risk, and I should note that absent transillumination markedly elevates risk and often functions as a de facto procedural stop unless alternatives are used [^112YWVCk] [^114BrcPN].

> Hold on, I initially wrote that hemodynamic or respiratory instability is an ESGE "strong recommendation" with moderate-quality evidence as a contraindication, but wait, let me verify the statement strength. The ESGE actually frames hemodynamic or respiratory instability as a contraindication with a weak recommendation and low-quality evidence, so I should correct that grade even though the clinical common sense remains to defer PEG until stabilization [^115Gpyc7].

> Next, I should review technique-dependent contraindications, especially situations that contraindicate the standard "pull" technique but permit a "push"/direct introducer approach. Severe esophageal stenosis and head and neck or esophageal cancers raise concerns for tumor seeding or impossible passage with the pull method; in these settings, ESGE recommends the direct percutaneous introducer ("push") technique as an alternative, even though the evidence quality is low, which means I need to explicitly flag this as technique-specific rather than a global PEG contraindication [^112iLp31].

> Let me consider relative contraindications and where careful risk-benefit analysis is warranted instead of a blanket "no". Prior abdominal surgery is a classic example; it increases the risk of adhesion-related interposition, but if safe transillumination and finger indentation are achieved, outcomes approximate those in intact abdomens; similarly, trauma laparotomy increases technical failure but not necessarily complications when basic safety principles are respected, so prior laparotomy status alone should not be treated as absolute [^111HBQs3] [^115V8qzY].

> Cirrhosis with ascites is another high-risk scenario; I see a 30-day mortality signal near 38% in a small series, largely driven by patients with ascites at the time of PEG, so I should treat tense ascites as a strong relative contraindication and seek optimization, including consideration of pre-procedural paracentesis in selected cases to mitigate leakage and infection, but wait, I previously implied that ESMO guidelines flag ascites as a risk factor; that was imprecise — ESGE cautions that ascites increases infectious risk and mandates careful consideration, whereas ESMO cachexia guidance addresses the feeding route choice rather than ascites risk per se, so I should correct the guideline attribution here [^114Y1kki] [^115Gpyc7] [^115eesPN].

> I should verify next the implication of failed transillumination. Inability to transilluminate is not an absolute prohibition of enteral access, but it is a relative contraindication to standard PEG because of interposed bowel risk; alternatives such as EUS-guided PEG or mini-laparoscopic assistance can rescue access in carefully selected patients when expertise is available, so I should explicitly frame this as a relative contraindication for standard technique with viable workarounds [^114BrcPN] [^112TuW6d].

> Recent peptic ulcer bleeding with a residual risk of rebleeding is another scenario where I need to avoid overcalling; ESGE suggests treating this as a relative contraindication and timing the procedure after stabilization and risk reduction rather than declaring PEG impossible, which aligns with prudent periprocedural risk control [^115Gpyc7].

> I need to check the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) issue carefully because the infection signal is sequence-dependent rather than an all-or-none contraindication. The best-available synthesis suggests higher VPS infection when PEG precedes or is simultaneous with VPS, whereas VPS first followed by PEG carries lower infection risk; ESGE also flags VPS as an infection risk factor, so the practical move is to sequence VPS before PEG whenever feasible and apply meticulous sterile technique [^117YCZDm] [^115Gpyc7].

> Severe obesity has been traditionally labeled a relative contraindication because of poor transillumination and apposition, but wait, I should double-check contemporary data. Large series demonstrate high technical success and low mortality in overweight and obese patients when landmarks are obtainable, indicating that obesity per se is not a true contraindication if the technical prerequisites are satisfied, though I should still counsel on a higher rate of aborted attempts when landmarks are inadequate [^112RpeoB].

> Next, I should review risk factors that are not contraindications but predict poor outcomes and thus require enhanced precautions, goal-concordant discussions, and sometimes deferment. Advanced age, lower BMI, and diabetes mellitus predict higher 30-day mortality after PEG, and in geriatric cohorts, illness acuity, comorbid burden, and frailty markers correlate with early mortality, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and expectation setting rather than reflexive tube placement [^112PWUbN] [^1164k9UB].

> But wait, I should also remember the ethical dimension in advanced dementia and limited life expectancy. Multiple reviews and cohort data suggest limited or no survival or rehospitalization benefit from PEG in advanced dementia, reinforcing that very limited prognosis is an ethical absolute contraindication in many institutional frameworks and that decisions should be multidisciplinary and goal-concordant rather than purely technical [^116Gmgob] [^1132vLKc] [^112YWVCk].

> When PEG is contraindicated or not technically feasible, I need to lay out alternatives and their trade-offs. PRG achieves similar technical success and mortality compared with PEG in RCT-focused meta-analysis, albeit with longer procedure times and different complication profiles; large meta-analyses variably suggest higher tube-related events with PRG, though overall mortality and infections are comparable, and in selected anatomies or oncology scenarios, PTEG or mini-laparoscopic assistance can provide safe access without traversing the upper aerodigestive tract, so the choice should be individualized to anatomy, tumor location, and sedation tolerance [^116t6LFb] [^1155ddu3] [^115P7Btn] [^112TuW6d].

> Let me now construct a practical decision framework and double-check that each category aligns with evidence. Absolute no-go conditions include inability to safely appose stomach to abdominal wall, complete pharyngeal or esophageal obstruction preventing endoscope passage, active peritonitis, uncorrectable coagulopathy, hemodynamic or respiratory instability pending correction, and ethically defined very limited life expectancy; relative high-risk conditions include cirrhosis with significant ascites, prior abdominal or trauma surgery without safe transillumination, recent peptic ulcer bleeding at high rebleed risk, VPS in place or planned (sequence VPS first), and failure of transillumination for the standard technique; technique-dependent contraindications to pull that can pivot to push include severe esophageal stenosis and head and neck or esophageal cancers due to tumor seeding risk [^112YWVCk] [^115Gpyc7] [^112iLp31] [^114Y1kki] [^111HBQs3] [^115V8qzY] [^117YCZDm] [^114BrcPN].

> Finally, synthesizing the answer succinctly, contraindications to PEG placement are best framed as follows: absolute contraindications are the inability to appose the gastric and abdominal walls; uncorrectable coagulopathy; active peritonitis; complete pharyngoesophageal obstruction precluding passage; hemodynamic or respiratory instability until stabilized; and situations of very limited life expectancy where goals of care do not support PEG; relative contraindications include cirrhosis with significant ascites (optimize or defer), prior abdominal surgery without safe transillumination, recent peptic ulcer bleeding at nontrivial rebleed risk, ventriculoperitoneal shunt with attention to sequencing, and absent transillumination for standard PEG; technique-specific considerations mean the standard pull method is contraindicated in severe esophageal stenosis and in head and neck or esophageal cancers, where a push technique should be used instead, and note that obesity alone is not a true contraindication if landmarks are adequate, with alternatives such as PRG, EUS-guided PEG, mini-laparoscopic assistance, or PTEG considered when standard PEG is unsafe or unfeasible [^112YWVCk] [^115Gpyc7] [^112iLp31] [^114Y1kki] [^112RpeoB] [^116t6LFb] [^114BrcPN] [^112TuW6d] [^115P7Btn].

PEG placement has **absolute contraindications** including uncorrectable coagulopathy, active peritonitis, severe sepsis, hemodynamic instability [^115Gpyc7], and inability to appose the stomach to the abdominal wall [^112YWVCk]. Relative contraindications include **ascites** [^114Y1kki], **peritoneal carcinomatosis**, **severe obesity** [^112RpeoB], **prior upper abdominal surgery** [^111HBQs3], and **severe respiratory compromise** [^115Gpyc7]. Advanced dementia [^1132vLKc] [^116Gmgob], terminal illness, and severe malnutrition are not absolute contraindications but require careful consideration due to limited benefit and high risk [^112PWUbN] [^1164k9UB]. Alternatives such as radiologic gastrostomy [^116t6LFb], surgical gastrostomy [^111qgNfc] [^115vg8Js], or nasojejunal feeding [^115Gpyc7] should be considered when contraindications are present [^113F9ayi].

---

## Absolute contraindications

Absolute contraindications are conditions in which PEG placement is **strictly prohibited** due to unacceptable risk:

- **Uncorrectable coagulopathy**: Platelet count < 50,000/µL, INR > 1.5, or aPTT > 50 seconds.

- **Active peritonitis or severe intra-abdominal infection**: Ongoing infection significantly increases morbidity and mortality [^112YWVCk] [^115Gpyc7].

- **Severe sepsis or hemodynamic instability**: Unstable patients are at high risk for procedural complications [^115Gpyc7].

- **Inability to appose the stomach to the abdominal wall**: Due to interposed organs, severe adhesions, or anatomical distortion [^114BrcPN] [^112YWVCk].

---

## Relative contraindications

Relative contraindications are conditions in which PEG placement may be considered only after **careful risk-benefit analysis** and with appropriate precautions:

- **Ascites**: Particularly malignant or refractory ascites, increases risk of infection, leakage, and peritonitis [^114Y1kki].

- **Peritoneal carcinomatosis**: Associated with high complication rates and limited benefit.

- **Severe obesity**: Technical challenges due to impaired transillumination [^114BrcPN] and difficulty approximating the stomach to the abdominal wall [^112RpeoB].

- **Prior upper abdominal surgery**: Adhesions and altered anatomy increase risk of complications [^115V8qzY] [^111HBQs3].

- **Severe respiratory compromise**: Patients with significant respiratory insufficiency are at increased risk of peri-procedural complications [^115Gpyc7].

---

## Patient populations requiring special consideration

Certain patient populations require **careful evaluation** because of increased risk or limited benefit:

- **Advanced dementia**: PEG placement does not improve nutritional status or survival and is associated with worse outcomes [^1132vLKc] [^116Gmgob].

- **Terminal illness or severe malnutrition**: High mortality and limited benefit; careful patient selection is essential [^1164k9UB] [^112PWUbN].

- **Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)**: Timing of PEG placement is critical; early placement before significant respiratory compromise is recommended.

---

## Alternative feeding methods

When PEG placement is contraindicated, **alternative feeding methods** should be considered:

| **Alternative method** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) | - Severe obesity <br/> - Prior abdominal surgery <br/> - Anatomical distortion | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Effective | Higher tube-related complications [^1155ddu3] [^116t6LFb] [^1123RaPz] |
| Surgical gastrostomy | - Severe adhesions <br/> - Anatomical distortion <br/> - Failed PEG | - Direct visualization <br/> - Effective | - More invasive <br/> - Higher complication rates [^111qgNfc] [^115vg8Js] |
| Nasojejunal feeding | - Short-term feeding <br/> - High aspiration risk | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Temporary | - Discomfort <br/> - Frequent replacement [^115Gpyc7] |

---

## Summary table of contraindications

| **Absolute contraindications** | **Relative contraindications** |
|-|-|
| Uncorrectable coagulopathy | Ascites |
| Active peritonitis | Peritoneal carcinomatosis |
| Severe sepsis or hemodynamic instability | Severe obesity |
| Inability to appose stomach to abdominal wall | Prior upper abdominal surgery |
| ∅ | Severe respiratory compromise |

---

PEG placement has clear absolute and relative contraindications; **careful patient selection and risk assessment** are essential [^115Gpyc7]. When contraindications are present, alternative feeding methods should be considered.

### Endoscopic management of enteral tubes in adult patients - part 2: Peri- and post-procedural management. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^112iLp31]. Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The ESGE recommends the "pull" technique as the standard method for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. This comes as a strong recommendation, despite the low quality of evidence. In instances where the "pull" method is contraindicated, such as severe esophageal stenosis or in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) or esophageal cancer, the ESGE advises the direct percutaneous introducer ("push") technique for PEG placement. This too is a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence.

The ESGE also recommends the intravenous administration of a prophylactic single dose of a beta-lactam antibiotic, or an appropriate alternative if there is an allergy, to reduce the risk of post-procedural wound infection. This advice is strongly recommended with moderate quality evidence.

The ESGE views the inadvertent insertion of a nasogastric tube (NGT) into the respiratory tract as a serious but avoidable adverse event. Strong recommendation, low quality evidence. To confirm the correct placement of NGTs placed "blindly" at the patient's bedside, the ESGE advises that each institution should have a dedicated protocol. This should include radiography, pH testing of the aspirate, and end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, excluding auscultation alone.

In high-risk patients, such as those in the intensive care unit (ICU) or those with altered consciousness or an absent gag/cough reflex, the ESGE strongly recommends confirmation of correct NGT placement by radiography.

The ESGE recommends that enteral nutrition (EN) may be started within 3–4 hours after the uncomplicated placement of a PEG or PEG-J.

### PEG insertion in patients with dementia does not improve nutritional status and has worse outcomes as compared with PEG insertion for other indications [^1132vLKc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are commonly utilized as a method of enteral feeding in patients unable to obtain adequate oral nutrition. Although some studies have shown improved mortality in select populations, the safety and effectiveness of PEG insertion in patients with dementia compared with those with other neurological diseases or head and neck malignancy remains less well defined.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the nutritional effectiveness, rate of rehospitalization, and risk of mortality among patients with dementia compared with patients with other neurological diseases or head and neck cancers who undergo PEG placement.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis from a prospective database of patients who underwent PEG placement at an academic tertiary center between 2008 and 2013. The following data were collected: indication for PEG, patient demographics, biochemical markers of nutritional status, rehospitalization, and survival rates.

- **Results**: During the study period, 392 patients underwent PEG tube placement. Indications for PEG were dementia (N = 165, group A), cerebrovascular accident (N = 124, group B), and other indications such as oropharyngeal cancers and motor neuron disease (N = 103, group C). The mean follow-up time after PEG was 18 months (range, 3 to 36 months). No differences in baseline demographics were noted. PEG insertion in the dementia group (group A) neither reduced the rehospitalization rate 6 months post-procedure compared with groups B and C (2.45 vs. 1.86 and 1.65, respectively; P = 0.05), nor reduced the mortality rate.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: A safe and effective bridge for enteral nutrition in neurological or non-neurological conditions [^112YWVCk]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is one of the most commonly used methods for nutritional support in patients who are unable to take food orally. Traditional surgical gastrostomy, percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy, and laparoscopic gastrostomy are the alternatives. The most common indication is neurogenic dysphagia, followed by obstructive causes such as head and neck tumors.

Ethically justified and clinically comprehensive guidelines should be followed during the decision-making process for PEG tube placement. Absolute contraindications include limited life expectancy; technical difficulties, such as the inability to bring the anterior gastric wall in apposition to the abdominal wall; or pharyngeal/esophageal obstruction, which compromises tube insertion, peritonitis, and uncorrectable coagulopathy.

The "pull method" is the first described and still the most performed technique of PEG tube placement. The procedure is simple, safe, and effective, fulfilling all requirements to provide an ideal route for nutritional support. This article summarizes the reported experience on PEG in the literature and discusses its utility in patients with neurological conditions.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy after abdominal surgery [^111HBQs3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has been established as a minimally invasive and safe procedure to provide nutritional support in patients unable to swallow food properly. However, a relative contraindication for the procedure is the existence of previous abdominal surgery.

- **Method**: We described our experience in performing PEG on 37 patients who had undergone surgery for upper abdominal diseases 10 days to 25 years previously. This group of 37 patients, 22 of whom had been subjected to laparotomy in the previous 2 weeks, was compared with 291 patients who had an intact abdomen regarding failure of the procedure to be performed, major and minor complications, and mortality.

- **Results**: The two groups were found to be comparable: failure rates of 2.71% (1/37) and 1.72% (5/291), no major complications, no mortality, and minor complication rates of 2.77% (1/36) and 2.44% (7/286).

- **Conclusions**: The PEG procedure is associated with minimal risk even in patients previously subjected to upper abdominal surgery, as long as transillumination of the stomach and finger palpation are seen clearly during endoscopy.

### Interventional radiology techniques for provision of enteral feeding [^113F9ayi]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy placement in patients unable to maintain oral nutrition has been attempted using various techniques over the past century, including surgical, endoscopic, and more recently, percutaneous radiologically guided methods. Surgical gastrostomy was the preferred choice for nearly a hundred years but has been superseded by both endoscopic and radiological placements.

- **Indications and contraindications**: There are numerous indications for gastrostomy placement in clinical practice today, with fewer contraindications due to recent advances in technique placement and gastrostomy catheter type. We describe the technique of gastrostomy placement used in our institution, including appropriate indications and contraindications.

- **Catheter types**: A wide variety of catheter types are available, each with perceived advantages. We will also address the debate regarding gastropexy performance and the use of primary gastrojejunal catheters.

Moreover, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the three major types of gastrostomy placement currently available — surgical, endoscopic, and radiological — and their associated complications.

### Predictive factors of mortality after PEG insertion: Guidance for clinical practice [^112PWUbN]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is considered the preferred route for long-term enteral feeding. The aim of this study was to determine predictors of an increased mortality risk after PEG insertion.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study was conducted over a 13-year period in the gastroenterology department of Erlangen University Hospital. The authors completed a questionnaire with details of demographic data, diagnosis, indication for PEG, type of tube, and cause of death. Patients were contacted regularly at scheduled appointments.

- **Results**: In total, 787 patients (574 male [72.9%]) underwent PEG placement by the pull technique. The main underlying disease was malignant (75.6%). By the end of the study period, 614 patients had died. The average survival time was 720 days. The 30-, 60-, 90-day and 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality rates amounted to 6.5%, 9.8%, 13%, 32.1%, 59.3%, and 69.8%, respectively. Predictive factors of increased 30-day mortality were higher age, lower body mass index (BMI), and the presence of diabetes mellitus. The presence of all three variables served as an indicator to detect high-risk patients, with a sensitivity of 0.80 and a specificity of 0.64.

- **Conclusion**: Mortality predictors for patients after PEG insertion are higher age, lower BMI, and the presence of diabetes mellitus. To avoid unnecessary and dangerous examinations in high-risk patients, the above-mentioned predictive factors of mortality should be checked before PEG placement.

### Endoscopic management of enteral tubes in adult patients - part 1: Definitions and indications. European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guideline [^115Gpyc7]. Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

The ESGE recommends considering the following indications for enteral tube insertion: (i) clinical conditions that make oral intake impossible, such as neurological conditions and obstructive causes; (ii) acute and/or chronic diseases that result in a catabolic state where oral intake becomes insufficient; and (iii) chronic small-bowel obstruction requiring a decompression gastrostomy. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

The ESGE recommends the use of temporary feeding tubes placed through a natural orifice (either nostril) in patients expected to require enteral nutrition (EN) for less than 4 weeks. If it is anticipated that EN will be required for more than 4 weeks, percutaneous access should be considered, depending on the clinical setting. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

The ESGE recommends the gastric route as the primary option in patients in need of EN support. The jejunal route should only be chosen in patients with altered/unfavorable gastric anatomy (e.g. after previous surgery), impaired gastric emptying, intolerance to gastric feeding, or a high risk of aspiration. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

The ESGE suggests that recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease with a risk of rebleeding should be considered a relative contraindication to percutaneous enteral access procedures. Hemodynamic or respiratory instability should also be viewed as contraindications. Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

Additionally, the presence of ascites and ventriculoperitoneal shunts should be considered additional risk factors for infection, and therefore require careful consideration.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement in the overweight and obese patient [^112RpeoB]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Traditionally, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement in the obese patient has been considered a relative contraindication due to the impedance of gastric transillumination and the inability to approximate the abdominal and gastric wall. The aim of this study was to determine the overall success rate, morbidity, and PEG-related mortality in overweight and obese patients.

- **Methods**: Three hundred fifty-five consecutive patients were retrospectively evaluated over a 1-year period at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center for postprocedure-related PEG and PEG/jejunostomy (J) complications. One hundred thirty-four patients were considered overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 27 kg/m²). Of those, 80 patients were found to be obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) with a BMI ranging from 30 to 63 kg/m².

- **Results**: Gastrostomy placement was successful in 130 of 134 (97%) overweight patients (p < .05). The overall procedure-related mortality was 0%. The rate of significant complications in overweight and obese patients remained 0% when compared with those of patients with a normal BMI. Out of 355 patients, 14 failed to receive a PEG; 3 of these were obese and 1 was overweight. These 4 procedures were aborted due to a paucity of anatomical landmarks and failure to transilluminate the abdominal wall.

- **Conclusions**: We believe that PEG placement in the overweight and obese patient can be a technically safe procedure according to our success rate of 100%, with a procedure-related mortality rate of 0%.

### Factors predicting early discharge and mortality in post-percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy patients [^112FkTGc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Since its introduction in 1980, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become increasingly popular and has supplanted surgical gastrostomy as the procedure of choice for enteral nutrition in patients unable to partake of adequate oral feeds due to impairment of swallowing function or dementia.

Despite its popularity, the beneficial effect of PEG is uncertain or limited to selected patients. The utility of PEG in stroke patients has not been validated. One study indicated that stroke patients with PEGs were more likely to have a higher complication rate and mortality when compared to those without PEGs. Likewise, PEG insertion has not shown to provide a survival benefit in patients with dementia.

In patients with head and neck cancer, early placement of a PEG may enhance nutritional status and facilitate treatment, but even this subset suffers from an overuse of PEGs.

Notwithstanding its narrow scope of benefit, PEGs continue to be placed in significant numbers; over 200,000 PEGs are performed annually in the United States.

Driving these numbers is an ethical nuance. Artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) is ethically and legally accepted as medical treatment. Healthcare providers therefore feel obligated to provide this "medical" treatment, and family members are more likely to equate withholding ANH with "starving a person to death".

Apart from ethical and medical considerations, a logistic factor has been added to the equation, making a complex issue even more complicated. Nursing homes are increasingly insisting on PEG placement prior to…

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy versus nasogastric tube feeding for adults with swallowing disturbances [^115xyoVK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

A number of conditions compromise the passage of food along the digestive tract. Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is a classic, time-proven technique, although its prolonged use can lead to complications such as lesions to the nasal wing, chronic sinusitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia. Another method of infusion, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), is generally used when there is a need for enteral nutrition for a longer time period. There is a high demand for PEG in patients with swallowing disorders, although there is no consistent evidence about its effectiveness and safety as compared to NGT.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PEG as compared to NGT for adults with swallowing disturbances, by updating our previous Cochrane review.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS from inception to September 2011, as well as contacting main authors in the subject area. There was no language restriction in the search.

- **Selection criteria**: We planned to include randomised controlled trials comparing PEG versus NGT for adults with swallowing disturbances or dysphagia and indications for nutritional support, with any underlying diseases. The primary outcome was intervention failure (e.g. feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the tube, no adherence to treatment).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review authors performed selection, data extraction, and evaluation of methodological quality of studies. For dichotomous and continuous variables, we used risk ratio (RR) and mean difference.

### Mini-laparoscopically guided percutaneous gastrostomy and jejunostomy [^112TuW6d]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic tube placement can be problematic under certain circumstances: absence of transillumination of the abdominal wall, percutaneous jejunostomy in patients with a PEG tube and re-aspiration, enteral feeding access after gastrectomy, and obstruction of the upper GI tract. As an alternative in these problematic situations, a technique was developed for placing feeding tubes under visual control by using mini-laparoscopy.

- **Methods**: Placement of a feeding tube with mini-laparoscopy with the patient under conscious sedation was considered for 17 patients in whom standard PEG placement was impossible. Techniques used were the following: combined mini-laparoscopy/endoscopy for placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy or jejunostomy, and mini-laparoscopic-guided direct tube placement in cases of obstruction of the upper GI tract.

- **Observations**: In 13 patients, mini-laparoscopic-assisted tube placement was successful. In 4 patients, adhesions or peritoneal carcinomatosis prevented laparoscopic visualization of the stomach or small bowel. The combined mini-laparoscopic/endoscopic approach allowed a successful insertion of gastric tubes in 6 patients and jejunal tubes in 4 patients. Direct insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy tube without enteroscopy was feasible in all 3 patients with obstruction of the upper GI tract. No complications occurred.

- **Conclusions**: Mini-laparoscopy-assisted tube placement is a simple and safe alternative when endoscopic percutaneous tube placement is problematic or not feasible.

### Percutaneous transesophageal gastro-tubing (PTEG) as an alternative long-term tube feeding procedure when gastrostomy is not feasible [^115P7Btn]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Esophagostomy via PTEG is a feasible procedure for patients requiring long-term tube feeding but who are not suitable candidates for gastrostomy tube placement. It is effective as an alternative long-term tube feeding procedure and should be offered to patients as a more comfortable option instead of relying on nasogastric tubing alone. Since enteral nutrition is largely recognized as the route of choice when gut integrity is intact, PTEG is an alternative worth exploring when PEG is not possible.

### To pull or to scope: A prospective safety and cost-effectiveness of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement methods [^1115g3hL]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are routinely used as an effective method for providing enteral nutrition, and the need for their exchange is common. This study aimed to examine the comparative safety and cost-effectiveness of the PEG percutaneous counter-traction "pulling" approach versus the endoscopically guided retrieval.

A prospective study included 215 consecutive patients undergoing PEG tube insertion, with 50 patients excluded. Patients were evaluated for demographics, indications for PEG replacement, procedure-related complications, and procedural costs.

- **Results**:
	- Group A included 70 patients (42%) whose PEG tubes were replaced endoscopically, whereas Group B included 95 patients (58%) with tubes replaced percutaneously. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups (P = NS). Immediate complication rates were similar, including four patients in Group B (4.2%) and two patients in Group A (2.8%) (P = 0.24). Complications included a conservatively managed esophageal perforation and self-limited mild bleeding in groups A and B, respectively. The mean procedure cost was significantly higher for endoscopic PEG replacement compared to percutaneous replacement ($650 vs. $350, respectively).

The conclusion is that percutaneous PEG replacement appears as safe as endoscopic replacement; however, percutaneous tube exchange is less costly.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a case series with a multidisciplinary, team-based approach [^115zybdW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease that leads to a progressive decline of motor functions at the spinal and bulbar level. In advanced disease, the main bulbar symptoms include dysphagia and dysarthria, which ultimately lead to malnutrition, weight loss, risk of aspiration, and increased morbidity and mortality. Other risk factors for malnutrition in patients with ALS include anxiety, cognitive impairment, difficulty with self-feeding or meal preparation, and respiratory insufficiency. Malnutrition is common in ALS, with a prevalence ranging between 16% and 55%. To maintain adequate oral intake, as well as provide an alternative route for medications, gastrostomy placement is recommended.

There are multiple methods of gastrostomy insertion, including surgical gastrostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG), and per-oral image-guided gastrostomy (PIG).

- **Surgical gastrostomy**: Whether open or through laparoscopy, this method is rarely used. It has been shown to be associated with higher complication rates and greater mortality, typically reserved for patients who undergo abdominal surgery, or when other approaches are not possible.

- **Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)**: Gastroenterologists insert PEG tubes using endoscopy under conscious sedation.

- **Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) and per-oral image-guided gastrostomy (PIG)**: Interventional radiologists perform these procedures under fluoroscopic guidance. PRG does not use conscious sedation but only allows small-bore tube placement. PIG allows for large-bore tube insertion, yet requires minimal sedation and is a more complex procedure.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: Patients' outcomes, adequacy and quality of information given to decision-makers and procedure acceptance [^1118rmt5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

In our study, more than 80% of the decision-makers considered they were adequately informed prior to PEG tube placement, but less than half felt they were adequately informed about the complications of the procedure. Furthermore, 71% of the relatives complained about inadequate information given to them regarding alternative feeding methods. This figure is almost three times the one (25%) reported in the 2002 study, while the rest of our results regarding informed consent procedures have not improved since 2002.

Similar to our reports, published studies indicate that the information given before PEG placement is often inadequate. In the study by Callahan et al, nearly half of the patients undergoing gastrostomy placement (or their relatives) reported that no alternatives had been discussed before the procedure. In another study, the potential complications of PEG were not discussed with the decision-makers in 46% of the cases. Most recently, a survey from the United Kingdom showed that patients and caregivers might not be given even the choice to decide for PEG, while only 40% of the patients reported receiving sufficient information regarding the intervention. Moreover, in a population of geriatric patients in Israel, only 40% of the family members received complete information about PEG, 35% received information about alternative feeding methods, and only a quarter were fully informed about the procedure's complications. More importantly, almost 60% of the family members felt they were pressured to consent for PEG.

### Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy versus percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for enteral feeding: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116t6LFb]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Percutaneous radiological gastrostomy (PRG) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) are minimally invasive gastrostomy techniques for individuals requiring prolonged enteral feeding. Recent meta-analyses concerning their efficacy and safety mainly included retrospective studies and yielded conflicting results. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to compare efficacy, safety, and procedure time between PRG and PEG for enteral feeding.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for eligible RCTs comparing PRG and PEG for enteral feeding through February 23, 2024. The primary outcome was technical success. The secondary outcomes were (1) adverse events (AEs), (2) mortality, and (3) procedure time. We used the random-effects model to calculate pooled risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively.

- **Results**: Five RCTs with 544 patients (268 PRG and 276 PEG) were included. There was similar technical success (RR = 1.02; 95% CI = 0.98–1.05; I² = 35%; moderate certainty of evidence because of inconsistency), overall mortality (RR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.63–2.47; I² = 47%; very low certainty of evidence because of inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision), and overall AEs risk (RR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.63–1.76; I² = 81%; low certainty of evidence because of inconsistency and imprecision) between the two groups. However, compared with PEG, the procedure time was longer in the PRG group (MD = 19.35 min; 95% CI = 0.95–37.75 min; I² = 98%; very low certainty of evidence).

### Safety of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy after trauma laparotomy [^115V8qzY]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). Low credibility.

Trauma patients frequently require long-term enteral access due to injuries to the head, neck, or gastrointestinal tract. Noninvasive methods for gastrostomy placement include percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous radiographic gastrostomy (PRG). In patients with recent trauma laparotomy, PEG placement is considered relatively contraindicated because of concerns about altered anatomy. We hypothesize that there is no increased rate of complications related to PEG placement in patients with trauma laparotomy compared to those without laparotomy, provided that basic safety principles are followed.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective study evaluates all percutaneous gastrostomies (both PEG and PRG) placed in trauma patients admitted to a level I trauma center between January 1, 2007, and March 30, 2010. The electronic medical records of the 354 patients were reviewed through 30 days after the procedure, and patients were further subdivided by the history of laparotomy. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test or a two-tailed t-test, as appropriate.

- **Results**: In patients with no prior trauma laparotomy, successful PEG placement occurred in 92.2% of patients, while the remainder underwent PRG placement. Of the patients with prior trauma laparotomy, 82.4% had successful PEG placement. Two percent of attempted PEG placements failed in patients with no previous trauma laparotomy, whereas 11.8% failed in patients with recent trauma laparotomy. The overall complication rate was 2.0%, with no recorded complications in patients with trauma.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in the open abdomen patient [^116TEmGi]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Nutrition support of critically ill patients is an integral element of their multimodal care. We describe the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for long-term enteral access in a patient with an open abdomen. To our knowledge, this is the third successfully reported case that demonstrates the viability of PEG in this uncommon population. In critically ill and malnourished surgical patients with contraindications for immediate abdominal closure, PEG should be strongly considered as a procedure for enteral feedings.

### Complications of percutaneous endoscopic and radiologic gastrostomy tube insertion: a KASID (Korean Association for the Study of Intestinal Diseases) study [^112L5UPH]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy tube insertion is beneficial for selected patients, with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous radiological gastrostomy (PRG) being two frequently used methods. This study aimed to investigate the indications and complications of both PEG and PRG.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective multicenter cohort study. Patients who underwent initial PEG or PRG tube insertion for nutritional purposes between January 2010 and December 2015 at five university hospitals were included. We analyzed the indications and all complications related to gastrostomy, which were categorized as major (systemic or life-threatening) and minor (local and non-life-threatening).

- **Results**: A total of 418 patients who underwent PEG (n = 324) and PRG (n = 94) were reviewed. The indications for gastrostomy tube insertion differed: the PEG group primarily had neurological diseases (n = 240, 74.1%), such as cerebrovascular accidents (n = 119, 36.7%), while the PRG group primarily had surgical diseases (n = 28, 29.8%), such as head and neck cancer (n = 16, 17.0%) [p = 0.05]. There were no significant differences in minor (16.4% vs. 19.1%, p = 0.52) and major (12.3% vs. 14.9%, p = 0.51) complication rates between the PEG and PRG groups. Risk factors for complications included age (yearly increments; odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–1.06), tube diameter (1-Fr increments; OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.01–1.58), insertion time (1-min increments; OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01–1.13), and neurological disease as the gastrostomy indication (versus surgical disease).

### Impact of antithrombotic medications on postprocedural outcomes of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a US collaborative network study [^111HtDNE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an essential procedure for patients who require long-term enteral nutrition but are unable to eat orally. However, it carries a risk of bleeding, particularly in patients on anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This study aimed to assess the bleeding risk associated with continuing anticoagulation or DAPT during PEG placement.

- **Methods**: Using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network Database, we analyzed four cohorts: patients on anticoagulants, patients not on anticoagulants, patients on DAPT, and patients on aspirin (ASP). We focused on gastrostomy-related bleeding within 7 and 30 days, along with secondary outcomes such as mortality and the need for blood transfusion or endoscopic reintervention.

- **Results**: Our analysis showed no statistically significant difference in the 7-day bleeding risk between the anticoagulant and no anticoagulant groups. However, a higher 30-day bleeding risk was observed in the anticoagulant group (0.9% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in the incidence of severe bleeding events requiring endoscopic intervention or blood transfusion. Additionally, the difference in the bleeding risk between the DAPT and ASP groups was not statistically significant within 7 and 30 days.

- **Conclusion**: These findings suggest that while anticoagulant use increases the risk of minor post-PEG bleeding, it does not lead to a higher incidence of severe bleeding. Furthermore, the continuation of DAPT was not associated with a statistically significant increase in bleeding risk.

### Use of a large-diameter 30-French venting gastrostomy tube is effective and safe for symptom palliation in patients with malignant bowel obstruction [^1126wDgk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Treatment options for malignant bowel obstruction are limited, particularly in poor surgical candidates. Standard percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes used for venting are of small caliber, limiting success. This study examines outcomes in patients who received larger-caliber 30-Fr PEGs for the treatment of malignant bowel obstruction.

- **Method**: Retrospective chart review for all patients who received large-caliber venting PEGs for malignant bowel obstruction in a series of patients at a single institution.

- **Results**: Thirty-six patients were included. The most common primary cancer diagnoses were ovarian (22%), mucinous appendiceal (19%), and colorectal (17%). Symptom relief was achieved in all patients (100%). Four patients (11%) sought medical care for symptoms due to an incorrect venting technique. Large-caliber venting PEGs were placed on the first admission for obstruction in 17 patients (47%), and were used to replace standard caliber PEGs in 8 patients because of persistent symptoms (22%). Significant ascites was observed in 12 patients (33%), but paracenteses were performed in only 3 of these patients prior to PEG placement. Most large-caliber venting PEGs were placed during hospital admission (34/36, 94%), and facilitated hospital discharge (33/34, 97%). Two significant (6%) and two minor adverse events (6%) occurred.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates the efficacy and safety of large-caliber venting PEGs for malignant bowel obstruction. This facilitated hospital discharge in almost all patients and prevented readmissions when a correct venting technique was used.

### Updates in percutaneous tracheostomy and gastrostomy: Should we strive for combined placement during one procedure [^117WDeW2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Percutaneous tracheostomy and gastrostomy are minimally invasive procedures among the most common performed in intensive care units. Practices across centres vary considerably, and questions remain about the optimal timing, performance, and postoperative care related to these procedures.

- **Recent findings**: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a reevaluation of the practice of percutaneous tracheostomy and gastrostomy in the ICU. Combined percutaneous tracheostomy and gastrostomy at the bedside have potential benefits, including improved nutrition, decreased exposure to anaesthetics, decreased patient transport, and decreased hospital costs. Percutaneous ultrasound gastrostomy is a novel technique that eliminates the need for an endoscope, which may allow intensivists to perform gastrostomy at the bedside.

- **Summary**: Multidisciplinary care is essential for the follow-up of critically ill patients receiving tracheostomy and gastrostomy. Combined tracheostomy and gastrostomy have numerous potential benefits for patients and hospital systems. Interventional pulmonologists are uniquely qualified to perform both procedures and serve on a tracheostomy and gastrostomy team.

### Comparative outcomes of endoscopic and radiological gastrostomy tube placement: A systematic review and meta-analysis with GRADE analysis [^115P2fBB]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Aspiration pneumonia was reported as an outcome in eight studies. The pooled incidence rates of aspiration pneumonia were 1.2% (12/976) in the PEG group and 3.4% (17/495) in the PRG group. The pooled odds ratio (OR) did not show any significant difference in the aspiration pneumonia rate between the two procedures (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.28–1.21; P = 0.114; I² = 0%).

Tube-related complications were reported as an outcome in twenty-two studies. The pooled incidence rates were 2.8% (7,705/274,214) in the PEG group and 3.5% (6,791/191,991) in the PRG group. The pooled OR was 0.56 (95% CI 0.33–0.95; P = 0.032; I² = 95%).

Data from 19 high-quality studies demonstrated an OR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.35–1.09; P = 0.07; I² = 96%). No publication bias was observed on the funnel plot, and the test of funnel plot asymmetry was non-significant (P = 0.758). A "leave-one-out" meta-analysis demonstrated that omission of studies by Cherian et al. or Desport et al. led to a statistically lower OR of complications with PEG. Both studies reported a statistically significantly greater incidence of tube-related complications with PEG on univariate analysis. However, subsequent multivariate analysis by Cherian et al. reported an OR of 5.4 for tube dislodgement with PRG compared to PEG, noting that the method of gastrostomy insertion was the only predictor for dislodgement. Multivariate analysis was not performed in the study by Desport et al. Exclusion of both studies from the meta-analysis resulted in statistically significantly fewer tube-related adverse events with PEG (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.29–0.74; P = 0.00).

### Basic geriatric assessment does not predict in-hospital mortality after PEG placement [^1164k9UB]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a common, safe, and relatively economic procedure for long-term nutrition. However, some studies have underlined the importance of proper patient selection because mortality has been shown to be relatively high in acute illness and certain patient groups, such as geriatric patients. The 1-month mortality rates range from 6.5% to 23.9%, and 1-year mortality rates of more than 50% have been reported. A recent British study observed that of those patients dying within 1 month after feeding tube placement, 40% died within the first week after the procedure. The authors assumed that this mortality was most probably related to acute disease and underlying comorbidities and not to the procedure itself. Improper patient selection was held responsible for futile insertions and high morbidity. This conclusion is supported by Janes et al, who reported a steeply increasing number of PEG placements in the last decade, resulting in higher mortality rates despite improved placement techniques and pointing towards a more liberal indication.

A variety of studies have tried to identify patient groups that may not benefit from PEG placement by analyzing differences in short-term mortality. Patient characteristics that have been shown to be associated with worse outcomes after feeding tube placement include high age, an increased number of comorbidities, hypoalbuminemia, elevated inflammatory markers, and a low body mass index. Most data on risk factors imply that disease severity may be responsible for high short-term mortality rates.

### Eus-guided percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for enteral feeding tube placement [^114BrcPN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Patients without adequate abdominal-wall transillumination are at a high risk of developing complications after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

- **Objective**: We evaluated the feasibility and utility of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to guide PEG in patients lacking abdominal-wall transillumination.

- **Design**: Single-center case series.

- **Setting**: Tertiary-referral center.

- **Patients**: Six patients who lacked adequate abdominal-wall transillumination and two patients with a large laparotomy scar deemed to be at high risk of developing complications after PEG.

- **Interventions**: Patients underwent EUS-guided PEG and deployment of a standard enteral feeding tube.

- **Main outcome measurements**: Technical success and complication rates.

- **Results**: PEG was successful under EUS guidance in five out of eight patients. Causes of failure included an inadequate EUS window due to a prior Billroth 1 gastrectomy in one patient and suspected bowel interposition in two patients. There were no complications.

- **Limitations**: A small number of patients, uncontrolled study, and short follow-up period.

- **Conclusions**: This technique may facilitate the deployment of PEG in patients who lack adequate abdominal-wall transillumination.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: Complications and suggestions to avoid them [^113iaizJ]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes have become an excellent alternative for the long-term management of patients with proximal obstructions of the gastrointestinal tract. However, their use has limitations and can be associated with serious complications; therefore, we studied the frequency and severity of complications related to the use of PEG tubes in our clinic.

- **Design**: All adults (aged 18 years and above) in whom a PEG tube was placed between January 1, 1994, and January 1, 1999, at the Free University Hospital in Amsterdam were included in this study. Initially, the indication and procedure were individually judged according to a liberal protocol. However, after several major complications, a strict procedure protocol was implemented in September 1996.

- **Results**: During the study period, 263 PEG tubes were placed in 254 patients with head and neck cancer (n = 183; 70%), neurological disorders (n = 52; 20%), or severe upper gastrointestinal motility disorders (n = 28; 11%). In period I, 167 PEG tubes were placed, and in period II, 96 PEG tubes were inserted. Patients were followed for a median of 111 days. Minor complications occurred in 13% of the patients, while major complications occurred in 8% of the patients. In period I, the percentage of major complications was higher than in period II (9.5% versus 6%).

- **Conclusion**: PEG tube placement is a safe procedure when performed according to strict guidelines. By doing so, PEG tubes allow optimal feeding for prolonged periods with the occasional need for replacement of the tube.

### Systematic review of ventricular peritoneal shunt and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a safe combination [^117YCZDm]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Various international and national gastrointestinal guidelines take different positions on whether ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) insertion is a contraindication to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The objective of this meta-analysis was to determine whether VPS insertion is a contraindication to PEG.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Electronic databases PubMed and Embase were searched using variations of the terms "ventriculo-peritoneal shunt" and "percutaneous (endoscopic) gastrostomy". This search resulted in 70 studies, 9 of which were relevant. These were cross-referenced, and 1 additional study was found, resulting in 10 studies in this systematic review.

- **Results**: The 10 relevant studies in adult cohorts included 208 patients. All studies, save one, were retrospective and generally of poor quality. Among the studies with relevant data, there were 26 (12.5% of 208 cases) VPS infections and 4 (4.4% of 90 cases) VPSs that malfunctioned. In 137 patients, the VPS had been placed before the PEG tube, with a VPS infection rate of 4.4%. More VPS infections occurred among the 55 patients who first had a PEG and a subsequent VPS (21.8%) and in the 16 patients who had simultaneous PEG tube and VPS placement (50%). The heterogeneity of the studies in this analysis prohibited statistical comparisons of the timing of VPS and PEG tube placement.

- **Conclusions**: This systematic review indicated that VPS placement in combination with PEG may be associated with varying infection rates depending on the sequence and timing of the procedures.

### Basic geriatric assessment does not predict in-hospital mortality after PEG placement [^112wekPC]. BMC Geriatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an established procedure for long-term nutrition. However, studies have underlined the importance of proper patient selection as mortality has been shown to be relatively high in acute illness and certain patient groups, including geriatric patients. The objective of the study was to gather information about geriatric patients receiving PEG and to identify risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality after PEG placement.

- **Methods**: All patients from the GEMIDAS database undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in acute geriatric wards from 2006 to 2010 were included in a retrospective database analysis. Data on age, gender, main diagnosis leading to hospital admission, death in hospital, care level, and legal incapacitation were extracted from the main database of the Geriatric Minimum Data Set. Self-care capacity was assessed by the Barthel index, and cognitive status was rated with the Mini Mental State Examination or subjectively judged by the clinician. Descriptive statistics and group comparisons were chosen according to distribution and scale of measurement. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the influence of various factors on hospital mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 1,232 patients (60.4% women) with a median age of 82 years (range 60 to 99 years) were included. The mean Barthel index at admission was 9.5 ± 14.0 points. Assessment of cognitive status was available in about half of the patients (n = 664), with 20% being mildly impaired and almost 70% being moderately to severely impaired.

### When is feeding via a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy indicated [^116Gmgob]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). High credibility.

This review addresses controversies regarding appropriate indications for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion. Specific indications discussed include dementia, stroke, aspiration, motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and head and neck cancer. We recommend practical strategies for improving patient selection.

There is now a general consensus in the United States that PEG feeding does not benefit patients with advanced dementia. 'Early' PEG insertion following stroke is similarly of no benefit. It is currently unclear whether patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and head and neck tumors should have PEG or radiologically inserted gastrostomy.

Decisions relating to PEG insertion remain difficult. The gastroenterologist, working as a member of a multidisciplinary nutrition team, needs to take a lead role in this regard, rather than functioning as a technician.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy; evidence of different prognosis in various patient subgroups [^113csDfy]. Age and Ageing (2005). Low credibility.

As there are no prospective randomised trials about percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion, the medical staff and caregivers encounter great difficulty in deciding when and if to perform this procedure.

- **Objective**: To explore which variables are associated with increased mortality after PEG insertion.

- **Design**: Prospective observational study.

- **Setting**: Gastroenterological unit of a 500-bed community hospital.

- **Subjects**: All patients over the age of 50 years referred for PEG insertion between January 1992 and December 2002.

- **Methods**: Patients were studied for their indication for PEG insertion as well as their main medical problems. Demographic details and medical records were reviewed yearly until mortality.

- **Results**: 674 patients were enrolled (mean age 80.1 years, 42% men). The median survival was worst in diabetic patients (128 days, P < 0.05), patients referred from hospital (161 days, P < 0.01), and patients over the age of 80 years with dementia (171 days, P < 0.001). The best median survival was found among demented patients under the age of 80 (467 days, P < 0.05) and women under the age of 80 referred from nursing homes (780 days, P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: The outcome after PEG insertion is variable, with survival of over a year in many of the patients. These data are important for the medical staff, the patients, and their caregivers when deciding about PEG placement.

### Safety of endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement compared with radiologic or surgical gastrostomy: Nationwide inpatient assessment [^115vg8Js]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2021). Low credibility.

A gastrostomy tube is often required for inpatients needing long-term nutritional access. This study compared the safety and outcomes of three techniques for performing a gastrostomy: percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), fluoroscopy-guided gastrostomy by an interventional radiologist (IR-gastrostomy), and open gastrostomy performed by a surgeon (surgical gastrostomy).

Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, patients who underwent a gastrostomy from 2016 to 2017 were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System. The selected patients were divided into three cohorts: PEG (0DH64UZ), IR-gastrostomy (0DH63UZ), and open surgical gastrostomy (0DH60UZ). Adjusted odds ratios for adverse events associated with each technique were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Of the 184,068 patients meeting the selection criteria, the distribution of gastrostomy tube placement was as follows: PEG, 16,384 (53.7 ± 29.0 years); IR-gastrostomy, 154,007 (67.2 ± 17.5 years); and surgical gastrostomy, 13,677 (57.9 ± 24.3 years). Compared with PEG, the odds for colon perforation using IR-gastrostomy and surgical gastrostomy, respectively, were 1.90 (95% confidence interval, 1.26–2.86; p = 0.002) and 6.65 (95% CI, 4.38–10.12; P < .001); for infection of the gastrostomy, 1.28 (95% CI, 1.07–1.53; p = 0.006) and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.29–2.01; P < .001); for hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion, 1.84 (95% CI, 1.26–2.68; p = 0.002) and 1.09 (95% CI, .64–1.86; p = 0.746).

### Benefits and risks of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for decompression in patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction [^116eB2Bn]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal obstruction presents many burdens for patients with end-stage abdominal cancer, such as nausea and vomiting. Few detailed data on the efficacy of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for decompression exists. This retrospective cohort study investigates the quantity of symptom relief realized with PEG and the corresponding complications.

Chart reviews of 75 patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction, who received a PEG for decompression, were performed. Abstracted data includes symptoms (vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain) and medication up to 7 days before and after the intervention, complications, demographics, potential influencing factors, and survival. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) models determined symptom reduction.

PEG decreased the mean frequency of vomiting per day from 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7–2.7) to 0.4 (95% CI 0.3–0.6) (p < 0.001). The probability of the occurrence of nausea on a given day was 80% (95% CI 74–85%) prior to the PEG placement and 40% (95% CI 34–47%) afterwards (p < 0.001). One hundred twelve complications were reported in 56 patients (none 19/75 patients (25%), minor 52/75 (69%), major 18/75 (24%)). Stomal leakage (18/75 patients), mild wound pain (17/75), and tube occlusion (13/75) occurred most frequently. The failure of the first attempt of the PEG placement (7/75) presented as the leading major complication.

The PEG for decompression significantly reduces vomiting and nausea in patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction (p < 0.001).

### Utility of esophageal gastroduodenoscopy at the time of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in trauma patients [^115DjSBF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

General surgeons specializing in trauma and critical care appear able to safely place tubes. In our series, PEG placement was successful in 98% of patients, and a full endoscopic survey was successful 99% of the time. This is comparable to the 97% successful PEG placement and 99% successful endoscopic survey reported from our own institution when PEGs were performed by the surgical endoscopy service. EGD and PEG placement are basic skills that should be mastered by any well-trained surgeon.

Adding full surveillance endoscopy to the examination at the time of PEG placement should only add a few additional minutes to the procedure and requires basic endoscopic maneuvers most of the time. This does not require advanced endoscopic skills or intervention, which almost certainly should be performed by a specially trained endoscopist.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy versus nasogastric tube feeding for adults with swallowing disturbances [^114Gji56]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

A number of conditions compromise the passage of food along the digestive tract. Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is a classic, time-proven technique; however, its prolonged use can lead to complications such as lesions to the nasal wing, chronic sinusitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and aspiration pneumonia. Another method of infusion, percutaneous endoscopy gastrostomy (PEG), is generally used when there is a need for enteral nutrition over a longer period. There is high demand for PEG in patients with swallowing disorders, although there is no consistent evidence regarding its effectiveness and safety compared to NGT.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PEG compared with NGT for adults with swallowing disturbances.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS from inception to January 2014, contacting the main authors in the subject area. No language restrictions were applied in the search.

- **Selection criteria**: We planned to include randomized controlled trials comparing PEG versus NGT for adults with swallowing disturbances or dysphagia and indications for nutritional support, with any underlying diseases. The primary outcome was intervention failure (e.g. feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the tube, no adherence to treatment).

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. For dichotomous and continuous variables, we used risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD), respectively, with the random-effects statistical model and 95% confidence intervals.

### Endoscopic repair of gastrostomy after inadvertent removal of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube [^116ugWzF]. Surgical Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

The placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes has become the preferred method of enteral feeding for many patients. Neurologic disease and cancer are the most frequent indications for PEG tube placement. Additionally, PEG tubes are increasingly used in trauma patients for the early initiation of enteral feeding. Inadvertent removal of PEG tubes is a well-known complication, and patients undergoing PEG tube placement are often malnourished and in poor general medical condition. This predisposes them to a relatively high risk for surgical intervention. Historically, after early inadvertent removal of a PEG tube, patients underwent laparotomy for surgical repair of the gastrostomy site. More recently, laparoscopic replacement of the PEG tube has been described. This paper presents a new technique for endoscopic repair of the gastrostomy site using hemoclip placement, followed by subsequent PEG tube placement.

### Complication rate lower after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy than after surgical gastrostomy: a prospective, randomized trial [^111qgNfc]. Surgical Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has increasingly replaced surgical gastrostomy (SG) as the primary procedure for the long-term nutrition of patients with swallowing disorders. This prospective randomized study compares PEG with SG in terms of effectiveness and safety.

- **Methods**: This study enrolled 70 patients with swallowing disorders, mainly attributable to neurologic impairment. All the patients, eligible for both techniques, were randomized to PEG (pull method) or SG. The groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, and underlying diseases. Complications were reported 7 and 30 days after the operative procedure.

- **Results**: The procedures were successfully completed for all the patients. The median operative time was 15 minutes for PEG and 35 minutes for SG (p < 0.001). The rate of complications was lower for PEG (42.9%) than for SG (74.3%; p < 0.01). The 30-day mortality rates were 5.7% for PEG and 14.3% for SG, which was not a significant difference.

- **Conclusion**: The findings show PEG to be an efficient method for gastrostomy tube placement with a lower complication rate than SG. In addition, PEG is faster to perform and requires fewer medical resources. The authors consider PEG to be the primary procedure for gastrostomy tube placement.

### Mortality after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in patients with cirrhosis: a case series [^114Y1kki]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement can improve the nutritional status and the ability of a patient with cirrhosis to recover from surgery, such as orthotopic liver transplantation. However, cirrhosis has been considered a significant contraindication to PEG tube placement.

- **Objective**: Our aim in this study was to describe the mortality and complications in a series of cirrhotic patients who underwent PEG at our institution.

- **Design**: Retrospective, single-institution case series.

- **Patients**: This study involved 26 consecutive patients with cirrhosis who underwent PEG between 1995 and 2005.

- **Intervention**: PEG tube placement.

- **Main outcome measurements and results**: The 30-day mortality of the series of patients was 10 of 26 (38.5%), whereas the 90-day mortality was 11 of 26 (42.3%). Nine of the 10 patients who died in the first 30 days had ascites at the time of PEG tube placement. Two patients died as a direct consequence of complications from the PEG procedure, whereas the other deaths were related to progression of liver disease or factors not directly related to the PEG.

- **Limitations**: The patients in this case series had varying levels of illness and reasons for PEG tube placement, such that a generalization of outcomes may not be possible.

- **Conclusions**: The overall mortality of patients with cirrhosis who underwent PEG is high. Although there is an increased risk, PEG tube placement in cirrhotic patients without ascites may be less risky. The benefits of PEG tube placement in patients with cirrhosis should be weighed heavily against the risk.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis on outcomes and complications of percutaneous endoscopic versus radiologic gastrostomy for enteral feeding [^1155ddu3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The optimal technique for long-term enteral feeding has not yet been established. Both percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) are widely used. The aim was to extensively review the outcomes of PEG and PRG.

- **Materials and methods**: A systematic review using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane was performed, employing standardized tools for assessing bias. The main outcomes focused on infectious and tube-related complications, procedure-related and 30-day mortality. Pooled risk differences (RDs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using random effects. Arcsine transformations were applied.

- **Results**: In total, 344 studies were identified, of which 16 were included, reporting on 934 PEGs and 1093 PRGs. No differences were found for infectious complications [RD, 0.03 (-0.05 to 0.11)], procedure-related mortality [RD, 0.01 (-0.04 to 0.06)], or 30-day mortality [RD, 0.06 (-0.01 to 0.13)]. Tube-related complications were higher in PRG [RD, 0.16 (0.06–0.26)]. Subgroup analysis was performed for head and neck cancer (HNC) and motor neuron disease. In HNC, this revealed significantly lower tube-related complications and procedure-related mortality after PEG. In motor neuron disease, no differences were seen. The level of evidence appears sufficient considering the low degree of heterogeneity.

- **Conclusions**: No differences were found with regard to mortality or infectious complications. PEG showed a lower risk of tube-related complications. Subgroup analysis revealed PEG to be favorable in HNC based on lower rates of procedure-related mortality and tube-related complications.

### Prediction of risk of adverse events related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a retrospective study [^117LjJ3f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a popular method for long-term enteral feeding. Our aim was to determine potential risk factors for adverse events related to PEG, as well as consequent prolonged hospitalization.

- **Methods**: Data were retrospectively collected from the admission records of a tertiary center between July 2015 and June 2018. Possible predictors of the three following outcomes were evaluated: minor PEG-related adverse events, major PEG-related adverse events, and length of hospital stay. Data were tested for correlation using the Spearman coefficient and for association using Kruskal-Wallis tests for significance.

- **Results**: A total of 362 admissions involving 146 patients were included in the study. Of the admissions, 221 (61.0%) had only minor adverse events, 100 (27.6%) had only major adverse events, and 41 (11.3%) had both. Eighty (22.1%) had PEG-site infection and 128 (35%) had aspiration pneumonia. Serum albumin levels at presentation were negatively correlated with the length of hospitalization (P < 0.001), which also differed between patients presenting with major and minor adverse events (P < 0.001 and P = 0.026). The Charlson comorbidity index was positively correlated with the duration of hospitalization (P < 0.001). Higher index scores were found more among patients presenting with aspiration pneumonia (P = 0.004) and lower scores were found among patients presenting with PEG site infection and inadvertent PEG removal compared with those presenting with a major complication (P < 0.001).

### Prediction of risk of adverse events related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a retrospective study [^11411yfm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is among the many different approaches used to establish enteral feeding for patients who cannot tolerate oral intake for prolonged periods. First introduced in 1980 by Ponsky and Gauderer, the procedure has gradually gained preference over the already established surgical and subsequently developed radiological techniques, as several studies have shown its superiority in terms of fewer adverse events as well as reduced mortality rates.

Despite its feasibility and minimally invasive techniques, this approach is not without risk of adverse events. Several adverse events, either procedure-related or post-procedural, may develop. Post-procedural adverse events can be broadly divided into major and minor categories. Major adverse events are systemic, life-threatening, and can include aspiration pneumonia, massive PEG-related gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, colocutaneous fistula, abdominal wall abscess, and buried bumper syndrome. Minor adverse events include PEG-site infection, peristomal leakage, inadvertent PEG removal, minor GI-related bleeding, blocked PEG tube, and ileus.

The incidence of adverse events reviewed in the literature varies considerably. Some studies have attempted to identify markers that would predict the risk of adverse events and early mortality in patients undergoing PEG placement. These were aimed at risk-stratifying patients to facilitate proper patient selection and timing for the procedure. Most studies concerning risk prediction for PEG-related adverse events were a reflection of the center's own data and experiences.

### Comparative outcomes of endoscopic and radiological gastrostomy tube placement: A systematic review and meta-analysis with GRADE analysis [^1123RaPz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that PEG was associated with a significantly lower risk of 30-day all-cause mortality, colon perforation, and peritonitis compared to PRG, while having a comparable technical failure rate. Therefore, PEG should be considered the first-line technique for obtaining enteral access in appropriate patients.

- **Summary box**:
	- **What is already known**: Percutaneous endoscopic (PEG) and radiological (PRG) gastrostomy are complementary procedures performed for enteral access.
	- **What the new findings are**: In our systematic review and meta-analysis of 33 studies, PEG was associated with significantly lower odds of colon perforation, peritonitis, and all-cause mortality at 30 days compared to PRG.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: Patients' outcomes, adequacy and quality of information given to decision-makers and procedure acceptance [^115HWiSq]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Beyond just prolonging life, quality of living is more important. Measuring quality of life is always difficult. Most researchers assess health-related quality of life using specific questionnaires that address its most important components, which include physical, psychological, and social domains of health. Although objective dimensions are important in defining a patient's degree of health, for the purpose of this study, we decided to ask specific questions on caregivers' subjective perceptions and expectations. This approach translates the assessment into the actual quality of life experienced by them or expected for their patient. Overall, less than half of the respondents considered that PEG tube placement improved the patient's and family's quality of life, which aligns with the results of a 2002 study.

- **Patient nutrition and illness**:
	- The majority of relatives anticipated that the intervention improved the patient's nutrition and understood that PEG did not improve the patient's underlying illness.

- **Care resources and skepticism**:
	- Many were skeptical regarding the resources required, in terms of time and money, by the family for the care of the patient after PEG tube insertion. This contrasts with the results of the 2002 study, where relatives said that after PEG, it was easier to manage the patient (96%), the time for patient care was diminished (62%), and the cost of care was reduced (11%). However, there is no explanation for this discrepancy.

### Prediction of risk of adverse events related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a retrospective study [^112cWjmR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

PEG is the standard method of establishing prolonged enteral feeding for patients unable to sustain oral intake. Despite its feasibility, simple techniques for placement, and the added benefit of improved nutrition, it has been associated with a risk of adverse events. The number of admissions due to PEG-related adverse events in our center was 125 of a total of 3227 admissions (3.87%) per year in the general internal medicine, gastroenterology, and geriatric departments. This apparently high percentage can be explained by the fact that our center is the major tertiary center in the city. Many of these patients underwent PEG insertion at other centers and came to us as referrals from other secondary and primary centers.

The incidence of adverse events reviewed in the literature differs significantly. Blomberg et al. found a one-month postoperative incidence of adverse events of 39%, dropping to 28% a month later. Gang and Kim reported a higher incidence of short-term adverse events in pediatrics, reaching 84.6%. Ermis et al. followed up with patients for a year after PEG insertion and demonstrated an 18% rate of adverse events. Lockett, in an earlier study, showed a comparable 16% rate of adverse events. Other studies have recorded complication rates ranging between 19–31%. This variation in the reported adverse events can be explained by the small sample sizes and the short follow-up durations in these studies. On the other hand, the mortality rate in these studies ranged between 33% and 3.3%.

We conducted the present study after analyzing data presented in e

### Prediction of risk of adverse events related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a retrospective study [^116tu9xY]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Patients and methods:

- **Patient selection**: From a 625-bed capacity tertiary center, a total of 311 patients with 661 admissions were recruited into the study. These admissions represented 6.8% of the total admissions in the included departments. The recruited cases covered all PEG-related adverse events from admissions during a 3-year period, from July 2015 through June 2018. Patients who underwent PEG insertion both inside and outside the center were included; consequently, this study does not merely reflect our center's own experience.

Data were retrospectively retrieved from electronic medical records. International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10) codes for PEG status, as well as all the other PEG-related adverse events (including aspiration pneumonia), were used to extract records from the medical informatics unit. The codes included the following: K94.1, K94.2, J69.0, Z93.1, and Z43.1.

Cases admitted under services outside general internal medicine, geriatrics, and gastroenterology were excluded for logistical reasons. Aspiration pneumonia not related to PEG feed as well as dependent admissions, i.e. admissions with hospital-acquired infections, were likewise excluded. Finally, a total of 146 patients with 362 admission entries were included in the data analysis. The study design was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A case series with a multidisciplinary, team-based approach [^113Nkyg6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons. When bulbar symptoms impair oral nutritional uptake, guidelines recommend percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. Studies evaluating the appropriate timing and procedural method of placement of gastrostomy tubes have been published; however, no study has been published that evaluated outcomes from a team-based approach to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate 26 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with various respiratory statuses, who had percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes placed using a multidisciplinary approach that included neurology, anesthesia, general surgery, and gastroenterology. Preprocedural risks and postprocedural outcomes were compared with previously published studies.

- **Results**: The mean age at percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement was 66 years. The mean forced vital capacity was 54%, and 18 patients (72%) were on noninvasive ventilation. There were three minor complications and no major complications prior to index discharge. The mean length of hospital stay was three days. There were no delayed complications or deaths. All patients alive at six months and one year were using their gastrostomy tubes without problems.

- **Conclusions**: Compared to previously published studies, a multidisciplinary approach to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement had a better placement rate, fewer minor and major complications, and a comparative length of stay.

### Severe recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding following percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement: A rare complication [^111N4Knp]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Severe bleeding requiring blood transfusions following endoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement is a rare complication. We describe a case of severe hemorrhage presenting as bright red blood from the rectum, resulting from endoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement, which ultimately required removal of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: Patients' outcomes, adequacy and quality of information given to decision-makers and procedure acceptance [^112wiB1h]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

In conclusion, our results show that patients' outcomes after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement are favorable. However, several deficiencies in the decision-making process have been identified and must be addressed properly. These deficiencies violate patients' and/or decision-makers' self-determination, negatively influence the doctor-patient partnership, and might lead to malpractice claims. Although some decision-makers believe that PEG feeding improved patients' and families' quality of life, they are skeptical of re-consenting for PEG, which limits the acceptance of the intervention at the same time.

### Comparative outcomes of endoscopic and radiological gastrostomy tube placement: A systematic review and meta-analysis with GRADE analysis [^112WHEzo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Enteral access through a gastrostomy tube is often required in patients unable to maintain adequate volitional intake of food. The most common techniques for performing a gastrostomy include percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and percutaneous radiological gastrostomy (PRG). PEG is often performed by gastroenterologists and surgeons using an endoscope placed within the stomach. PRG, on the other hand, is typically performed by radiologists using fluoroscopy and administration of oral contrast. Both techniques are considered safe and effective. However, in general, gastrostomy tube placement is associated with a significant risk of adverse outcomes, including perforation, infections, peritonitis, and death.

There are conflicting data regarding the comparative safety of PEG and PRG. Most of the data are restricted to single-center retrospective analyses that were underpowered to conclusively determine the comparative outcomes and adverse events. Hence, the preferred technique for safely performing a gastrostomy remains undetermined.

A prior systematic review and meta-analysis by Strijbos et al. was limited to 16 studies reporting data on only 934 PEG and 1,093 PRG procedures. The authors noted no difference for 30-day mortality or infectious complications, whereas tube-related complications were higher in the PRG group. However, recent studies from large, nationally representative databases encompassing multiple hospitals nationwide have reported a statistically significantly greater risk of 30-day mortality for PRG compared to PEG. Given the significant risk associated with these procedures, careful consideration of the method used for gastrostomy is necessary.

### Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy in the dementia patient: Helpful or hindering [^114y7F2V]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a common technique performed worldwide. Recently, the use of PEG in dementia patients with dysphagia for nutrition support has been called into question. Some reviews have reported no improvement in survival with PEG tubes in this population. Higaki and colleagues now present a large review of PEG tube placement in patients with dementia, which demonstrates a similar survival rate in patients without dementia receiving PEG tubes. The utility of PEG tube placement for nutrition support in the dementia population requires an organized, prospective analysis to concretely answer the question.

### Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy [^114byQYe]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Gastrostomy is a preferred method of nutrition in patients with impaired ability to eat. Although surgical gastrostomy is a well-established method and has been widely performed in the last century, since the early 1980s, percutaneous gastrostomy techniques, either endoscopic or radiologic, have gained wide acceptance. Percutaneous methods have been shown to be effective, safe, easy to perform, and low-cost techniques with low morbidity and mortality rates. Nowadays, percutaneous gastrostomy is the first method of choice for nutrition in patients with a functioning gut.

In this article, the authors review the technique of percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy, as well as its indications, contraindications, variations of technique, ethical considerations, controversies, and comparison with surgical and endoscopic methods.
