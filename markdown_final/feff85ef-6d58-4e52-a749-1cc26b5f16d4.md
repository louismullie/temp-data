## Question

Methylphenidate dosing for adolescents

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about methylphenidate dosing for adolescents with ADHD. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the adolescent-specific considerations. Then, I should verify formulation-specific starting doses and titration rules. Next, I will review the evidence base for dose-response and the role of flexible titration. After that, I need to check safety ceilings, monitoring, and when to consider doses beyond labeled maxima. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and note special populations and comorbidities, ensuring each point is anchored to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why adolescent dosing needs careful attention. Adolescents often have higher stimulant exposure needs due to academic demands, driving, and evening activities, and they may metabolize and respond differently than younger children; guidelines emphasize individualized titration to maximal benefit with tolerable side effects rather than fixed mg/kg dosing, which is not reliably predictive in pediatrics [^1132vEEd] [^112BUW8u]. Hold on, I should verify the evidence base: meta-analyses show meaningful symptom improvement with methylphenidate but with very low certainty and frequent non-serious adverse effects, reinforcing the need for careful, response-guided titration and monitoring in this age group [^115BuZ5J] [^117NtF7x].

> Now, I will examine formulation-specific starting doses and titration intervals, but wait, let me verify the product labels before I commit to numbers. For osmotic-release oral system (OROS, Concerta), the FDA-labeled starting dose for patients new to methylphenidate is 18 mg once daily in the morning, with 18 mg weekly increments up to a studied maximum of 54 mg in children and 72 mg in adolescents; doses above 72 mg are not recommended by the label [^113uB4dN]. For immediate-release methylphenidate, the traditional pediatric start is 5 mg twice daily with 5–10 mg weekly increments, with a labeled maximum of 60 mg/day in children and adolescents; I initially thought this applied universally, but hold on, I should verify formulation nuances — some extended-release products have different labeled maxima, so I need to be precise by formulation [^112QebJY] [^114kAp2Z]. For transdermal methylphenidate (Daytrana), dosing is by patch size delivering 10–30 mg over 9 hours, titrated to effect, with adolescent exposure generally lower than in children at the same patch size, which matters for dose selection and tolerability [^112NnBcx] [^114HUwGW].

> Next, I should review the dose-response evidence and the principle of flexible titration. Meta-analytic data indicate that in fixed-dose trials, incremental efficacy diminishes beyond about 30 mg total daily methylphenidate, whereas in flexible-dose trials, efficacy continues to improve across the licensed dose range because clinicians can adjust to response and tolerability; this supports a titration-to-response strategy rather than stopping prematurely at a low or moderate dose [^113qYmYt]. Let me consider neurocognitive correlates as well: dose-related improvements are seen for lower-order processes like processing speed and variability, but not for higher-order executive functions, which helps explain why some adolescents still benefit clinically even when simple dose–response curves appear to plateau [^115fmCMS].

> I need to ensure I am clear about safety ceilings and monitoring. The FDA labeling for OROS sets 54 mg/day as the studied maximum in children and 72 mg/day in adolescents, and doses above 72 mg are not recommended; for IR methylphenidate, the labeled maximum is 60 mg/day in children and adolescents, though some international formularies and expert guidance allow higher doses under specialist supervision in select cases [^113uB4dN] [^112QebJY]. Wait, let me verify the rationale for exceeding labeled maxima: a meta-analysis of titration studies found no scientifically justified universal maximum, and some adolescents with partial response and good tolerability may benefit from higher doses, but this requires specialist oversight, careful cardiovascular screening, and vigilant monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, height, weight, sleep, and appetite [^1121eNFn] [^113rA9Gf] [^116ZHTCW]. I should double-check the psychosis signal: large pharmacoepidemiologic data suggest a small but real increase in psychotic events after methylphenidate initiation in adolescents and young adults, so any history of psychosis or significant mood symptoms warrants caution and close monitoring if stimulants are used [^116uVh6z].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise dosing algorithm while keeping verification checkpoints. Start with formulation choice based on coverage needs and prior exposure: OROS 18 mg qAM for stimulant-naïve adolescents, IR 5 mg BID if a short-acting trial is preferred, or transdermal 10 mg/9 hr if avoidance of oral dosing is desired; then titrate in 18 mg weekly steps for OROS, 5–10 mg weekly steps for IR, or by patch size for transdermal, reassessing efficacy and tolerability each week whenever feasible [^113uB4dN] [^112QebJY] [^112NnBcx]. Hold on, I should verify the ceiling I apply: for most adolescents, I will aim to optimize within labeled maxima (OROS up to 72 mg, IR up to 60 mg), but if there is a partial response with good tolerability, I will consider cautious escalation beyond labeled maxima only with informed consent, specialist involvement, and enhanced monitoring, recognizing that evidence beyond 72 mg is limited and decisions should be individualized [^113rA9Gf] [^116ZHTCW]. If no meaningful benefit is observed after an adequate trial and titration period (often 4–8 weeks total), I should reconsider diagnosis, comorbidity, adherence, or formulation, and consider switching class or adding behavioral interventions rather than pushing dose indefinitely [^1132vEEd] [^115cKWxp].

> I will now examine special populations and comorbidities that modify dosing decisions. In adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, stimulant response rates are lower and sensitivity to adverse effects may be higher, so I should start lower, go slower, and consider alpha-2 agonists if stimulants are not tolerated or effective; evidence suggests possible benefit on hyperactivity but limited effects on social communication, reinforcing the need for careful target selection and measurement [^111mt4Kk] [^113oaxn7]. For adolescents with tics or a family history of tics, I should confirm that methylphenidate is generally acceptable with monitoring, as modern data do not strongly support a tic-worsening signal at usual doses, though individual responses vary and shared decision-making is key [^113oaxn7]. But wait, what if there is a history of psychosis or mania? Given the observed association between stimulant initiation and psychotic events in youth, I should screen carefully, document baseline psychiatric history, and if stimulants are used, monitor closely for emergent psychotic or manic symptoms, adjusting or discontinuing promptly if they arise [^116uVh6z].

> Next, I should review real-world titration patterns to ensure my plan aligns with observed practice. Large retrospective cohorts show that most adolescents start OROS at 18 mg/day, many titrate upward within the first few months, and a minority exceed labeled maxima; importantly, dose decreases become more common once patients reach higher dose levels, suggesting self-correction of overtitration in routine care, which supports careful, feedback-driven titration rather than rigid algorithms [^115HdVMA] [^114uGVPY] [^117LXnGA]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that exceeding 72 mg is rare; in fact, Japanese data show a nontrivial proportion exceeding 54 mg, and some adolescents exceed 72 mg, underscoring the need for explicit monitoring plans when off-label dosing is pursued [^117LXnGA].

> I should confirm the monitoring cadence and what to track. At each visit, I will assess ADHD symptom control across the day (morning, school, homework/evening), sleep latency and quality, appetite and weight trajectory, blood pressure and heart rate, and any emergent mood or psychotic symptoms; periodic height checks are prudent given small average effects of stimulants on growth velocity, and I will plan medication holidays when appropriate to reassess ongoing need and minimize long-term exposure if benefits wane [^1132vEEd] [^112iHc3j] [^114NQAX5]. Hold on, I should verify the cardiovascular stance: routine ECG is not required for all adolescents, but a careful cardiac history, family history of sudden death or arrhythmias, and exam are essential before initiation, with further cardiology evaluation if red flags are present [^114NQAX5].

> Finally, I need to ensure the long-term plan includes reassessment of need and potential discontinuation. Guidelines recommend periodic trials off medication to determine continued benefit, and a randomized discontinuation study suggests that some adolescents can taper without deterioration while others clearly relapse, supporting individualized, data-informed continuation decisions rather than indefinite treatment by default [^1132vEEd] [^116nnCBB]. Let me reconsider the overall message: adolescent methylphenidate dosing should be individualized, formulation-specific, and response-driven within labeled ranges whenever possible, with cautious, specialist-supervised extension beyond maxima only for compelling partial responders with excellent tolerability, and with vigilant monitoring for efficacy, growth, cardiovascular parameters, sleep, appetite, and psychiatric adverse effects at every step [^112BUW8u] [^113qYmYt].

Methylphenidate dosing for adolescents with ADHD should be **individualized and titrated to effect** [^1132vEEd], starting with a low dose and increasing every 1–2 weeks until symptoms are controlled or side effects emerge [^1132vEEd]. Typical starting doses are 18 mg once daily for extended-release formulations (e.g. Concerta) [^113uB4dN] or 5 mg twice daily for immediate-release formulations [^112QebJY], with weekly increments of 18 mg (ER) or 5–10 mg (IR) as needed [^113uB4dN] [^114kAp2Z]. The usual effective range is **18–54 mg/day for ER** and **20–60 mg/day for IR**, not to exceed 72 mg/day for ER or 60 mg/day for IR. Monitor for adverse effects — especially appetite suppression, insomnia, and cardiovascular effects — and adjust the dose accordingly [^112iHc3j] [^1121eNFn].

---

## Recommended starting doses and titration schedules

Key starting doses, titration steps, and maximum doses by formulation:

| **Aspect** | **Extended-release formulations (e.g. Concerta)** | **Immediate-release formulations (e.g. Ritalin)** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | 18 mg once daily in the morning [^113uB4dN] | 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) [^112QebJY] |
| Titration | Increase by 18 mg increments at weekly intervals based on clinical response and tolerability [^113uB4dN] | Increase by 5–10 mg weekly based on clinical response and tolerability [^114kAp2Z] |
| Maximum dose | 72 mg/day (not recommended to exceed this dose) [^notfound] | 60 mg/day (not recommended to exceed this dose) [^112QebJY] |

---

## Typical effective dose ranges

| **Formulation** | **Typical effective dose range** |
|-|-|
| Extended-release (ER) | 18–54 mg/day |
| Immediate-release (IR) | 20–60 mg/day |

---

These ranges are **general guidelines**; individual responses vary, and doses should be tailored to clinical response and tolerability [^1132vEEd].

---

## Factors influencing dosing decisions

Several factors influence **methylphenidate dosing in adolescents**:

- **Age and weight**: Younger or lighter adolescents may require lower doses, whereas older or heavier adolescents may need higher doses [^117LXnGA].
- **Severity of ADHD symptoms**: More severe symptoms may necessitate higher doses within the recommended range [^113qYmYt].
- **Comorbidities**: Anxiety, depression, or tic disorders may influence dosing decisions and require careful monitoring [^113oaxn7].
- **Previous medication response**: History of stimulant use or non-response may guide dosing adjustments [^115cKWxp].

---

## Clinical efficacy and safety considerations

Methylphenidate is effective in reducing ADHD symptoms in adolescents, with **moderate effect sizes observed in clinical trials** [^115BuZ5J]. However, it is associated with non-serious adverse effects such as decreased appetite, insomnia, and headaches [^1121eNFn]. Serious adverse events are rare but may include cardiovascular events and psychiatric symptoms (e.g. psychosis, mania) [^116uVh6z].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of dosage

Regular monitoring is essential to ensure **optimal therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse effects**. Clinicians should:

- **Monitor growth**: Track height, weight, and cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure, heart rate) regularly [^116ZHTCW].
- **Assess efficacy**: Use standardized rating scales (e.g. ADHD Rating Scale) to evaluate symptom control and functional improvement [^111zgEDZ].
- **Adjust dosage**: Modify the dose based on clinical response, side effects, and patient feedback [^114vRQSV].

---

## Special considerations and precautions

- **Cardiovascular health**: Assess cardiovascular history and monitor for hypertension or arrhythmias [^113uB4dN].
- **Psychiatric comorbidities**: Monitor for emergence or exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, particularly anxiety, depression, or psychosis [^112D5XXm].
- **Substance abuse**: Methylphenidate has abuse potential; monitor for signs of misuse or diversion [^116VwbNc].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Start low**: Begin with low doses and titrate gradually based on clinical response and tolerability [^1132vEEd].
- **Monitor regularly**: Conduct regular follow-up visits to assess efficacy, side effects, and adherence [^1132vEEd].
- **Individualize dosing**: Tailor doses to individual patient characteristics, including age, weight, symptom severity, and comorbidities [^112QebJY].
- **Stay within recommended limits**: Do not exceed 72 mg/day for extended-release formulations or 60 mg/day for immediate-release formulations [^113uB4dN] [^112QebJY].

### The effects of stimulant dose and dosing strategy on treatment outcomes in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: a meta-analysis [^113qYmYt]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines currently recommend practitioners titrate stimulant medications, i.e., methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamines (AMP), to the dose that maximizes symptom control without eliciting intolerable adverse events (AEs) when treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in school-aged children/adolescents. However, robust evidence-base regarding the effects of doses and dosing strategies of stimulants on clinical outcomes in the treatment of children/adolescents with ADHD is currently lacking and stimulants are often underdosed in clinical practice. To address this gap and provide rigorous evidence-base in relation to the dose and dosing strategy of stimulants, we conducted the largest systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis examining change in ADHD symptoms (efficacy), and treatment discontinuations due to AEs (tolerability) and any reason (acceptability). We conducted one-stage random-effects dose-response meta-analyses examining MPH and AMP separately, stratifying trials based on fixed-dose and flexible-dose design. Daily doses of stimulants were converted to MPH- and AMP-equivalent doses by adjusting for different pharmacokinetics across formulations. We also conducted pairwise meta-analyses to provide indirect comparisons between flexible-dose versus fixed-dose trials. Our study included 65 RCTs involving 7 877 children/adolescents. Meta-analyses of fixed-dose trials for both MPH and AMP demonstrated increased efficacy and increased likelihood of discontinuation due to AEs with increasing doses of stimulants. The incremental benefits of stimulants in terms of efficacy decreased beyond 30mg of MPH or 20mg of AMP in fixed-dosed trials. In contrast, meta-analyses of flexible-dose trials for both MPH and AMP demonstrated increased efficacy and reduced likelihood of discontinuations for any reason with increasing stimulant doses. The incremental benefits of stimulants in terms of efficacy remained constant across the FDA-licensed dose range for MPH and AMP in flexible-dose trials. Our results suggest that flexible titration as needed, i.e., considering the presence of ADHD symptoms, and tolerated, i.e., considering the presence of dose-limiting AEs, to higher doses of stimulants is associated with both improved efficacy and acceptability because practitioners can increase/reduce doses based on control of ADHD symptoms/dose-limiting AEs. Although fixed-dose trials that are required by the FDA are valuable to characterize dose-dependency, they may underestimate the true potential benefit of trialing dose-increases of stimulants in clinical practice by not allowing dose adjustment based on response and tolerability. Additional research is required to investigate potential long-term effects of using high doses of stimulants in clinical practice.

Methylphenidate Hydrochloride should be initiated in small doses, with gradual weekly increments. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended.

If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, the drug should be discontinued.

Start with 5 mg twice daily (before breakfast and lunch) with gradual increments of 5 to 10 mg weekly.

If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse effects occur, reduce dosage, or, if necessary, discontinue the drug.

Methylphenidate Hydrochloride should be periodically discontinued to assess the child's condition. Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued.

Drug treatment should not and need not be indefinite and usually may be discontinued after puberty.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^117NtF7x]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Is treatment with methylphenidate associated with benefits or harms for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

Bottom Line

Methylphenidate is associated with improvement in ADHD symptoms, general behavior, and quality of life; however, due to the very low quality of the evidence, the magnitude of the associated improvement is uncertain. Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of nonserious adverse events. There are too few data to assess the association with serious adverse events.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^112dVqdC]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

We used the teacher rated symptoms of ADHD from parallel group or first period of crossover trials as our primary analysis to test the robustness of this estimate with several subgroup analyses:

Type of scale.
Dose of methylphenidate (low dose: ≤ 20 mg/day or ≤ 0.6 mg/kg/day compared to moderate or high dose: > 20 mg/day or > 0.6 mg/kg/day).
Design (parallel group trials compared to first phase and end of trial of crossover trials).
Drug status before randomisation — "drug naïve" (if > 80% of participants were naive) compared to "previous use of drug" (> 80% of participants used the drug previously).
Risk of bias (low risk of bias trials compared to high risk of bias trials).
Age — comparing trials of participants aged 2 to 6 years to those of participants aged 7 to 11 years and to those aged 12 to 18 years.
Sex — boys compared to girls.
Comorbidity — participants with comorbid disorders compared to participants without comorbid disorders.
Type of ADHD — predominantly participants with inattentive type compared to participants with combined type.
Types of raters — parents compared to observers compared to teachers.
Trials with cohort selection bias of all participants compared to trials without cohort selection bias of all participants.
Trials using fixed doses compared to trials using initial titration.

Sensitivity analyses

We conducted sensitivity analyses to ascertain whether our findings were sensitive to decisions during the review (for example, our assessment of clinical heterogeneity), the combination of both change scores and end of trial scores in one meta-analysis, and inclusion of studies with participants of IQ less than 70 or aged more than 18 years.

Consequently we undertook sensitivity analyses excluding trials using change scores, trials with participants of IQ less than 70, and trials including some participants aged more than 18 years.

No valid method exists for combining the results of trials rated as high risk and low risk of bias. We performed sensitivity analyses grouping together the trials with similar classifications of bias and investigated the impact on intervention effects.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^111N3rU7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention, they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the drug most often prescribed to treat children and adolescents with ADHD but, despite its widespread use, this is the first comprehensive systematic review of its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

In February 2015 we searched six databases (CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Conference Proceedings Citations Index), and two trials registers. We checked for additional trials in the reference lists of relevant reviews and included trials. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture methylphenidate to request published and unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. At least 75% of participants needed to have an intellectual quotient of at least 70 (i.e. normal intellectual functioning). Outcomes assessed included ADHD symptoms, serious adverse events, non-serious adverse events, general behaviour and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Seventeen review authors participated in data extraction and risk of bias assessment, and two review authors independently performed all tasks. We used standard methodological procedures expected within Cochrane. Data from parallel-group trials and first period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses; separate analyses were undertaken using post-cross-over data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity and publication bias.

Main Results

The studies. We included 38 parallel-group trials (5111 participants randomised) and 147 cross-over trials (7134 participants randomised). Participants included individuals of both sexes, at a boys-to-girls ratio of 5:1, and participants' ages ranged from 3 to 18 years across most studies (in two studies ages ranged from 3 to 21 years). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. Most participants were from high-income countries. The duration of methylphenidate treatment ranged from 1 to 425 days, with an average duration of 75 days. Methylphenidate was compared to placebo (175 trials) or no intervention (10 trials). Risk of Bias. All 185 trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias. Primary outcomes. Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.90 to -0.64; 19 trials, 1698 participants; very low-quality evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -9.6 points (95% CI -13.75 to -6.38) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points; DuPaul 1991a). A change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS is considered clinically to represent the minimal relevant difference. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious (e.g. life threatening) adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.22; 9 trials, 1532 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.02 to 33.2).

Secondary Outcomes

Among those prescribed methylphenidate, 526 per 1000 (range 448 to 615) experienced non-serious adverse events, compared with 408 per 1000 in the control group. This equates to a 29% increase in the overall risk of any non-serious adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; 21 trials, 3132 participants; very low-quality evidence). The Trial Sequential Analysis-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.29 (CI 1.06 to 1.56). The most common non-serious adverse events were sleep problems and decreased appetite. Children in the methylphenidate group were at 60% greater risk for trouble sleeping/sleep problems (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.23; 13 trials, 2416 participants), and 266% greater risk for decreased appetite (RR 3.66, 95% CI 2.56 to 5.23; 16 trials, 2962 participants) than children in the control group. Teacher-rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD -0.87, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.71; 5 trials, 668 participants; very low-quality evidence). A change of seven points on the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ; range 0 to 100 points; Landgraf 1998) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a MD of 8.0 points (95% CI 5.49 to 10.46) on the CHQ, which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent-reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.80; 3 trials, 514 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The results of meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate may improve teacher-reported ADHD symptoms, teacher-reported general behaviour, and parent-reported quality of life among children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. However, the low quality of the underpinning evidence means that we cannot be certain of the magnitude of the effects. Within the short follow-up periods typical of the included trials, there is some evidence that methylphenidate is associated with increased risk of non-serious adverse events, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite, but no evidence that it increases risk of serious adverse events. Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Given the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, 'nocebo tablet' controlled trials. These use a placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. However, for ethical reasons, such trials should first be conducted with adults, who can give their informed consent. Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to age, sex, comorbidity, type of ADHD and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large RCTs of non-pharmacological treatments.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [^115BuZ5J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated psychiatric disorders in childhood. Typically, children and adolescents with ADHD find it difficult to pay attention and they are hyperactive and impulsive. Methylphenidate is the psychostimulant most often prescribed, but the evidence on benefits and harms is uncertain. This is an update of our comprehensive systematic review on benefits and harms published in 2015.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of methylphenidate for children and adolescents with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases and two trials registers up to March 2022. In addition, we checked reference lists and requested published and unpublished data from manufacturers of methylphenidate.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents aged 18 years and younger with a diagnosis of ADHD. The search was not limited by publication year or language, but trial inclusion required that 75% or more of participants had a normal intellectual quotient (IQ > 70). We assessed two primary outcomes, ADHD symptoms and serious adverse events, and three secondary outcomes, adverse events considered non-serious, general behaviour, and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment for each trial. Six review authors including two review authors from the original publication participated in the update in 2022. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Data from parallel-group trials and first-period data from cross-over trials formed the basis of our primary analyses. We undertook separate analyses using end-of-last period data from cross-over trials. We used Trial Sequential Analyses (TSA) to control for type I (5%) and type II (20%) errors, and we assessed and downgraded evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 212 trials (16,302 participants randomised); 55 parallel-group trials (8104 participants randomised), and 156 cross-over trials (8033 participants randomised) as well as one trial with a parallel phase (114 participants randomised) and a cross-over phase (165 participants randomised). The mean age of participants was 9.8 years ranging from 3 to 18 years (two trials from 3 to 21 years). The male-female ratio was 3:1. Most trials were carried out in high-income countries, and 86/212 included trials (41%) were funded or partly funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Methylphenidate treatment duration ranged from 1 to 425 days, with a mean duration of 28.8 days. Trials compared methylphenidate with placebo (200 trials) and with no intervention (12 trials). Only 165/212 trials included usable data on one or more outcomes from 14,271 participants. Of the 212 trials, we assessed 191 at high risk of bias and 21 at low risk of bias. If, however, deblinding of methylphenidate due to typical adverse events is considered, then all 212 trials were at high risk of bias.

Primary Outcomes

methylphenidate versus placebo or no intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.88 to -0.61; I² = 38%; 21 trials; 1728 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to a mean difference (MD) of -10.58 (95% CI -12.58 to -8.72) on the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; range 0 to 72 points). The minimal clinically relevant difference is considered to be a change of 6.6 points on the ADHD-RS. Methylphenidate may not affect serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.67; I² = 0%; 26 trials, 3673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 0.91 (CI 0.31 to 2.68).

Secondary Outcomes

methylphenidate may cause more adverse events considered non-serious versus placebo or no intervention (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.37; I² = 72%; 35 trials 5342 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The TSA-adjusted intervention effect was RR 1.22 (CI 1.08 to 1.43). Methylphenidate may improve teacher-rated general behaviour versus placebo (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.33; I² = 68%; 7 trials 792 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but may not affect quality of life (SMD 0.40, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.83; I² = 81%; 4 trials, 608 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The majority of our conclusions from the 2015 version of this review still apply. Our updated meta-analyses suggest that methylphenidate versus placebo or no-intervention may improve teacher-rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour in children and adolescents with ADHD. There may be no effects on serious adverse events and quality of life. Methylphenidate may be associated with an increased risk of adverse events considered non-serious, such as sleep problems and decreased appetite. However, the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes is very low and therefore the true magnitude of effects remain unclear. Due to the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the blinding of participants and outcome assessors is particularly challenging. To accommodate this challenge, an active placebo should be sought and utilised. It may be difficult to find such a drug, but identifying a substance that could mimic the easily recognised adverse effects of methylphenidate would avert the unblinding that detrimentally affects current randomised trials. Future systematic reviews should investigate the subgroups of patients with ADHD that may benefit most and least from methylphenidate. This could be done with individual participant data to investigate predictors and modifiers like age, comorbidity, and ADHD subtypes.

### Evaluation of methylphenidate safety and maximum-dose titration rationale in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analysis [^1121eNFn]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Evidence on the titration of stimulant medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is lacking. However, this lack of evidence has not prevented medication guidelines from specifying apparently arbitrary dose limitations, which could discourage clinicians from titrating methylphenidate to higher and, perhaps for some patients, more efficacious doses.

Objective

To determine the evidence on dose titration and adverse events associated with dose titration of stimulants for ADHD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE from 1946, Embase from 1974, and PsycINFO from 1806 through April 1, 2019, were searched to identify relevant articles.

Study Selection

The inclusion criteria were that (1) the study was conducted on children up to 18 years of age; (2) children had a diagnosis of ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or hyperkinetic disorder according to the International Classification of Diseases codes; and (3) the dose of methylphenidate was determined by titration.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data and assessing data quality and validity were followed. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Jadad scoring system. Statistical analysis was undertaken using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcomes of interest were (1) the doses used in published clinical trials, (2) the clinical justification given by researchers for their selected dose range, and (3) the adverse effects associated with methylphenidate when the dose is established by titration.

Results

A total of 11 randomized clinical trials and 38 cohort studies were analyzed. The randomized clinical trials involved 1304 participants treated with methylphenidate and 887 controls; the 38 cohort studies included 5524 participants. Maximum doses of methylphenidate ranged from 0.8 to 1.8 mg/kg/d. Some studies detailed their method of titration, including starting dose, titration interval, increment dose, and maximum dose. Not all of these studies reported justification for the chosen dose range. Common adverse effects of methylphenidate included insomnia (odds ratio, 4.66; 95% CI, 1.99–10.92; P < .001), anorexia (5.11 higher than for those who took placebo; 95% CI, 1.99–13.14; P < .001), abdominal pain (1.9 times more likely; 95% CI, 0.77–4.77; p = 0.16), and headache (14% of participants; 95% CI, 10%-20%; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

A range of maximum doses for methylphenidate was recommended in clinical studies; no discernable scientific justification for any particular dose was given. Reports of life-threatening adverse events were absent; further studies of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of methylphenidate titrated purely on clinical grounds, without reference to any set maximum dose, are needed.

Regarding medical management for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, methylphenidate, AAP 2019 guidelines recommend to consider offering methylphenidate in pediatric patients aged 4–5 years if behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is a moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in the patient's functioning. Weigh the risks of initiating medication before the age of 6 years against the harm of delaying treatment in areas where evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available.

### Methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents-assessment of adverse events in non-randomised studies [^116uVh6z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. The psychostimulant methylphenidate is the most frequently used medication to treat it. Several studies have investigated the benefits of methylphenidate, showing possible favourable effects on ADHD symptoms, but the true magnitude of the effect is unknown. Concerning adverse events associated with the treatment, our systematic review of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated no increase in serious adverse events, but a high proportion of participants suffered a range of non-serious adverse events.

Objectives

To assess the adverse events associated with methylphenidate treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD in non-randomised studies.

Search Methods

In January 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 12 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted authors and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included non-randomised study designs. These comprised comparative and non-comparative cohort studies, patient-control studies, patient reports/series and cross-sectional studies of methylphenidate administered at any dosage or formulation. We also included methylphenidate groups from RCTs assessing methylphenidate versus other interventions for ADHD as well as data from follow-up periods in RCTs. Participants had to have an ADHD diagnosis (from the 3rd to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the 9th or 10th edition of theInternational Classification of Diseases, with or without comorbid diagnoses. We required that at least 75% of participants had a normal intellectual capacity (intelligence quotient of more than 70 points) and were aged below 20 years. We excluded studies that used another ADHD drug as a co-intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Fourteen review authors selected studies independently. Two review authors assessed risk of bias independently using the ROBINS-I tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised studies of interventions. All review authors extracted data. We defined serious adverse events according to the International Committee of Harmonization as any lethal, life-threatening or life-changing event. We considered all other adverse events to be non-serious adverse events and conducted meta-analyses of data from comparative studies. We calculated meta-analytic estimates of prevalence from non-comparative cohorts studies and synthesised data from patient reports/series qualitatively. We investigated heterogeneity by conducting subgroup analyses, and we also conducted sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

We included a total of 260 studies: 7 comparative cohort studies, 6 of which compared 968 patients who were exposed to methylphenidate to 166 controls, and 1 which assessed 1224 patients that were exposed or not exposed to methylphenidate during different time periods; 4 patient-control studies (53,192 exposed to methylphenidate and 19,906 controls); 177 non-comparative cohort studies (2,207,751 participants); 2 cross-sectional studies (96 participants) and 70 patient reports/series (206 participants). Participants' ages ranged from 3 years to 20 years. Risk of bias in the included comparative studies ranged from moderate to critical, with most studies showing critical risk of bias. We evaluated all non-comparative studies at critical risk of bias. The GRADE quality rating of the evidence was very low. Primary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate increased the risk ratio (RR) of serious adverse events (RR 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.57; 2 studies, 72,005 participants); any psychotic disorder (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.57; 1 study, 71,771 participants); and arrhythmia (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.74; 1 study, 1224 participants) compared to no intervention. In the non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate experiencing any serious adverse event was 1.20% (95% CI 0.70% to 2.00%; 50 studies, 162,422 participants). Withdrawal from methylphenidate due to any serious adverse events occurred in 1.20% (95% CI 0.60% to 2.30%; 7 studies, 1173 participants) and adverse events of unknown severity led to withdrawal in 7.30% of participants (95% CI 5.30% to 10.0%; 22 studies, 3708 participants). Secondary outcomesIn the comparative studies, methylphenidate, compared to no intervention, increased the RR of insomnia and sleep problems (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.24 to 5.34; 3 studies, 425 participants) and decreased appetite (RR 15.06, 95% CI 2.12 to 106.83; 1 study, 335 participants). With non-comparative cohort studies, the proportion of participants on methylphenidate with any non-serious adverse events was 51.2% (95% CI 41.2% to 61.1%; 49 studies, 13,978 participants). These included difficulty falling asleep, 17.9% (95% CI 14.7% to 21.6%; 82 studies, 11,507 participants); headache, 14.4% (95% CI 11.3% to 18.3%; 90 studies, 13,469 participants); abdominal pain, 10.7% (95% CI 8.60% to 13.3%; 79 studies, 11,750 participants); and decreased appetite, 31.1% (95% CI 26.5% to 36.2%; 84 studies, 11,594 participants). Withdrawal of methylphenidate due to non-serious adverse events occurred in 6.20% (95% CI 4.80% to 7.90%; 37 studies, 7142 participants), and 16.2% were withdrawn for unknown reasons (95% CI 13.0% to 19.9%; 57 studies, 8340 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings suggest that methylphenidate may be associated with a number of serious adverse events as well as a large number of non-serious adverse events in children and adolescents, which often lead to withdrawal of methylphenidate. Our certainty in the evidence is very low, and accordingly, it is not possible to accurately estimate the actual risk of adverse events. It might be higher than reported here. Given the possible association between methylphenidate and the adverse events identified, it may be important to identify people who are most susceptible to adverse events. To do this we must undertake large-scale, high-quality RCTs, along with studies aimed at identifying responders and non-responders.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^113Ei3Ai]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Study question Is methylphenidate beneficial or harmful for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents?

Methods Electronic databases were searched up to February 2015 for parallel and crossover randomised clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents with ADHD. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) were conducted. Quality was assessed using GRADE. Teachers, parents, and observers rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour.

Study answer and limitations The analyses included 38 parallel group trials (n = 5111, median treatment duration 49 days) and 147 crossover trials (n = 7134, 14 days). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. The analysis suggested a beneficial effect of methylphenidate on teacher rated symptoms in 19 parallel group trials (standardised mean difference (SMD) −0.77, n = 1698), corresponding to a mean difference of −9.6 points on the ADHD rating scale. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious adverse events (risk ratio 0.98, nine trials, n = 1532; TSA adjusted intervention effect RR 0.91). Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (1.29, 21 trials, n = 3132; TSA adjusted RR 1.29). Teacher rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD −0.87, five trials, n = 668) A change of 7 points on the child health questionnaire (CHQ) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a mean difference of 8.0 points on the CHQ (range 0–100 points), which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, three trials, n = 514). 96.8% of trials were considered high risk of bias trials according to the Cochrane guidelines. All outcomes were assessed very low quality according to GRADE.

What this study adds The results suggest that among children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD, methylphenidate may improve teacher reported symptoms of ADHD and general behaviour and parent reported quality of life. However, given the risk of bias in the included studies, and the very low quality of outcomes, the magnitude of the effects is uncertain. Methylphenidate is associated with an increased risk of non-serious but not serious adverse events.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride [^112CEn2H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release for the treatment of ADHD was established in a randomized, double-blind, single center, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose, cross-over trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years and a second randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, fixed–dose trial in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years.

Pediatric Patients

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose, cross-over, analog classroom study (Study 1) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years (N = 26) who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for ADHD inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive or combined inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive subtypes.

Following a 2 to 4 week open-label dose optimization phase in which patients received flexible-dose methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, or 40 mg administered once daily in the morning, patients were randomly assigned to methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (dose from open-label phase) or placebo. After 1-week of treatment, patients were evaluated over a period of 12 hours. Subsequently, patients were given the opposite treatment for 1-week and returned for the second evaluation. Patients could then enter an open-label extension phase for up to 21 months.

Symptoms of ADHD

Data on symptoms of ADHD in our analyses were available from 25 parallel group trials and 74 crossover trials (53.0%) reporting on such symptoms. The results showed an effect of methylphenidate on teacher rated symptoms in the parallel group trials (standardised mean difference −0.77, 95% confidence interval −0.90 to −0.64, 19 trials, 1698 participants, fig 2). This corresponds to a mean difference of −9.6 points (95% confidence interval −13.75 to −6.38) on the ADHD rating scale, which was larger than the minimal clinical relevant difference of −6.6 points. No publication bias was detected (Egger's test P = 0.81). All the trials had high risk of bias, primarily as a result of vested interest, lack of blinding of participants, lack of outcome assessor blinding, selective outcome reporting, or selection bias. Some but not all bias risks were present in most studies. The result of the GRADE assessment was "very low quality" owing to high risks of bias and heterogeneity. The intervention effect was significantly influenced by choice of scale (test for subgroup differences, P = 0.006). Long term trials had a smaller effect (standardised mean difference −0.47, 95% confidence interval −0.72 to −0.22, one trial, 253 participants) compared to short term trials (−0.81, −0.94 to −0.68, 18 trials, 1445 participants; test for subgroup difference, P = 0.02). Trials including participants with previous use of drugs before randomisation resulted in a larger effect (−1.06, −1.33 to −0.79, two trials, 286 participants) compared to trials including participants naive to the drugs (−0.63, −0.94 to −0.31, four trials, 431 participants; test for subgroup difference, P = 0.04). However, no significant influences on the observed treatment effects were found according to dose, trial design, cohort selection bias (trials with optimal titration, exclusion of non-responders, placebo responders, or participants with methylphenidate adverse events before randomisation) and trials with initial titration or fixed doses. One trial included in the meta-analysis reported change from baselines scoresrather than endpoint data. Removing this trial did not change the estimate noticeably.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115CzWuW]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Preschool-aged children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — medication evidence, indications, and dosing: Evidence regarding dextroamphetamine's use in preschool-aged children with ADHD is not adequate to recommend it as an initial ADHD medication treatment at this time, and no nonstimulant medication has sufficient rigorous study to be recommended for treatment of ADHD of children 4 through 5 years of age. Although methylphenidate has the strongest evidence for safety and efficacy in preschool-aged children, it has not yet met the level needed for FDA approval; evidence includes 1 multisite study of 165 children and 10 other smaller, single-site studies ranging from 11 to 59 children, for a total of 269 children, with seven of the 10 single-site studies revealing efficacy, and its use remains on an off-label basis. Before initiating medication, the clinician should assess the severity of the child's ADHD; only preschool-aged children with ADHD and moderate-to-severe dysfunction should be considered, defined by symptoms that have persisted for at least 9 months, dysfunction in both home and other settings, and dysfunction that has not responded adequately to PTBM. For dosing, the rate of metabolizing methylphenidate is slower in children 4 through 5 years of age, so a low dose should be given to start with increases in smaller increments, and maximum doses have not been adequately studied in preschool-aged children.

KAS 6 — The PCC should titrate doses of medication for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to achieve maximum benefit with tolerable side effects (Grade B: strong recommendation.), with benefits noting that the optimal dose of medication is required to reduce core symptoms to, or close to, the levels of children without ADHD and the benefit-harm assessment stating that the importance of adequately treating ADHD outweighs the risk of adverse effects, while risks include that higher levels of medication increase the chances of side effects; in the MTA study comparing 4 groups (optimal medication management, optimal behavioral management, combined medication and behavioral management, or community treatment), children in the optimal medication management and combined medication and behavioral management groups underwent a systematic trial with 4 different doses of methylphenidate, with results suggesting that when this full range of doses is administered, more than 70% of children and adolescents with ADHD are methylphenidate responders, and authors of other reports suggest that more than 90% of patients will have a beneficial response to 1 of the psychostimulants if a range of medications from both the methylphenidate and amphetamine and/or dextroamphetamine classes.

Study Question

Is methylphenidate beneficial or harmful for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents?

Methods

Electronic databases were searched up to February 2015 for parallel and crossover randomised clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents with ADHD. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) were conducted. Quality was assessed using GRADE. Teachers, parents, and observers rated ADHD symptoms and general behaviour.

Study Answer and Limitations

The analyses included 38 parallel group trials (n = 5111, median treatment duration 49 days) and 147 crossover trials (n = 7134, 14 days). The average age across all studies was 9.7 years. The analysis suggested a beneficial effect of methylphenidate on teacher rated symptoms in 19 parallel group trials (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.77, n = 1698), corresponding to a mean difference of -9.6 points on the ADHD rating scale. There was no evidence that methylphenidate was associated with an increase in serious adverse events (risk ratio 0.98, nine trials, n = 1532; TSA adjusted intervention effect RR 0.91). Methylphenidate was associated with an increased risk of non-serious adverse events (1.29, 21 trials, n = 3132; TSA adjusted RR 1.29). Teacher rated general behaviour seemed to improve with methylphenidate (SMD -0.87, five trials, n = 668) A change of 7 points on the child health questionnaire (CHQ) has been deemed a minimal clinically relevant difference. The change reported in a meta-analysis of three trials corresponds to a mean difference of 8.0 points on the CHQ (range 0–100 points), which suggests that methylphenidate may improve parent reported quality of life (SMD 0.61, three trials, n = 514). 96.8% of trials were considered high risk of bias trials according to the Cochrane guidelines. All outcomes were assessed very low quality according to GRADE.

What This Study Adds

The results suggest that among children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ADHD, methylphenidate may improve teacher reported symptoms of ADHD and general behaviour and parent reported quality of life. However, given the risk of bias in the included studies, and the very low quality of outcomes, the magnitude of the effects is uncertain. Methylphenidate is associated with an increased risk of non-serious but not serious adverse events.

Quality of evidence

For each included trial, data extractors independently evaluated all risk of bias domains (listed below), resolving any disagreements by discussion. We assigned each bias domain to one of three categories: low risk of bias, uncertain risk of bias, or high risk of bias, according to the Cochrane guidelines. Owing to the risk of overestimation of beneficial intervention effects and underestimation of harmful intervention effects in randomised clinical trials with unclear or high risk of bias, we assessed the influence of the risk of bias on our results (see subgroup analyses). We used the following domains to assess the risk of bias in the included trials: generation of allocation sequence, allocation of concealment, blinding of participants and staff, blinding of outcome assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and vested interest (trial was funded by parties that might have had a conflict of interest (for example, a manufacturer of methylphenidate) or there were potential conflicts of interests among authors because they had been working for companies producing or selling methylphenidate, or both). We considered trials with low risk of bias in all domains to be at low risk of bias and trials with one or more unclear or inadequate component to be at high risk of bias. For 32% (59/185) of the included trials we noted a specific type of bias occurring before randomisation. Non-responders to methylphenidate, responders to placebo, or participants who had adverse events due to the drug were excluded as a consequence of exclusion criteria or after a titration phase. Such trials have limited external validity and, to identify whether this cohort selection bias had an effect on estimates of effects, we did subgroup analyses (see above).

We assessed and graded the evidence according to the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) for high risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, heterogeneity, and publication bias. The analyses were conducted with Review Manager 5.3 (Review Manager 2014) and the trial sequential analysis program.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^112ZLrM5]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most commonly diagnosed and treated childhood psychiatric disorders, with a prevalence of 3.4%. It is increasingly seen as a developmental disorder, which has high comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders. Diagnosis is made through recognition of excessive inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in children before 12 years of age, which impairs their functioning or development.

Methylphenidate has been used for the treatment of ADHD for over 50 years and is now globally the most common drug treatment for the disorder. Despite the widespread use of methylphenidate no comprehensive systematic review has been done of both benefits and harms. Fifteen reviews of the effect of methylphenidate on the symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents have been published. None of them were conducted using Cochrane methodology and none prepublished a peer reviewed protocol. Thirteen did not undertake subgroup analyses on comorbidity influencing treatment effectsnor did they control for the treatment effect on subtypes of ADHD. Ten did not consider dosage. Seven meta-analyses combined outcome data across raters and observersand eight did not separate outcomes for inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity. Nine failed to present spontaneous adverse eventsand 14 did not report adverse events measured by rating scales. Eleven reviewsdid not follow 'gold standard' guidelines — that is, the Cochrane Handbook or the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Risk of random errors, risk of bias, and trial quality were not systematically assessed in 11 reviews. Language bias (exclusion of non-English publications) was present in four reviews, and narrow or unreported search strategies in four reviewsmay have compromised data collection and, ultimately the meta-analyses.

To avoid these flaws we conducted a systematic review of the benefits and harms of methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD using the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines. This article presents the results of a systematic review focusing on the benefits and harms of methylphenidate in randomised clinical trials. A second systematic review will focus on harms in non-randomised studies.

### Methylphenidate [^112cRnkF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Methylphenidate is a CNS stimulant. Its mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d - and l -enantiomers. The d -enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l -enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate transdermal system when applied to the hip for 9 hours have been studied in ADHD patients 6 to 17 years old.

Absorption

The amount of methylphenidate absorbed systemically is a function of both wear time and transdermal system size. In patients with ADHD, peak plasma levels of methylphenidate are reached at about 10 hours after single application and 8 hours after repeat transdermal system applications (12.5 cm2to 37.5 cm2) when worn up to 9 hours.

On single dosing of children or adolescents with methylphenidate transdermal system, there was a delay of, on average, 2 hours before d -methylphenidate was detectable in the circulation. On repeat dosing, low concentrations (1.2–3.0 ng/mL in children and 0.5–1.7 ng/mL in adolescents, on average across the dose range) were observed earlier in the profile, due to carry-over effect. Following the application of methylphenidate transdermal system once daily with a 9-hour wear time, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters of d -methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD after 4 weeks of therapy are summarized in Table 3.

Following administration of methylphenidate transdermal system 12.5 cm2to pediatric and adolescent ADHD patients daily for 7 days, there were 13% and 14% increases, respectively, in steady state area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCss) relative to that anticipated on the basis of single dose pharmacokinetics (AUC0-∞); after 28 days administration, these increments increased to 64% and 76%, respectively. Cmaxincreased by nearly 69% and 100% within 4 weeks of daily administration of the starting dose in children and adolescents, respectively.

Stimulant titration and monitoring in pediatric ADHD emphasize individualized dosing and timely follow-up: "it is recommended to titrate from a low dose to one that achieves a maximum, optimal effect in controlling symptoms without adverse effects". "Calculating the dose on the basis of milligrams per kilogram has not usually been helpful because variations in dose have not been found to be related to height or weight". "Stimulant medications can be effectively titrated on a 7-day basis, but in urgent situations, they may be effectively titrated in as few as 3 days". "The PCC should alert parents and children that changing medication dose and occasionally changing a medication may be necessary for optimal medication management, may require a few months to achieve optimal success, and that medication efficacy should be monitored at regular intervals".

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^113RrqKf]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Implications for research

Better designed trials are needed to assess the benefits of methylphenidate. Because of the frequency of non-serious adverse events associated with methylphenidate, the particular difficulties for blinding of participants and outcome assessors point to the advantage of large, "nocebo tablet" controlled trials. These use a placebo-like substance that causes adverse events in the control arm that are comparable to those associated with methylphenidate. Such trials ought first to be conducted in adults with ADHD. We also acknowledge that investigators can directly carry out nocebo controlled trials in children and adolescents if they can argue that young people with ADHD are different from adults with the disorder.

Future trials should publish depersonalised individual participant data and report all outcomes, including adverse events. This will enable researchers conducting systematic reviews to assess differences between intervention effects according to sex, age, type of ADHD, presence of co-morbidities and dose. Finally, the findings highlight the urgent need for large randomised trials of non-pharmacological treatments.

Conclusions

Methylphenidate use in children and adolescents may improve the symptoms of ADHD, general behaviour, and quality of life. It does not seem to cause an increased risk of serious adverse events in the short term but was associated with a relatively high risks of non-serious adverse events. These findings should be interpreted in the light of several limitations, including the lack of blinding, outcome reporting bias, heterogeneity, and the consequent very low quality of evidence for all outcomes. More long term randomised nocebo tablet (active placebo) controlled clinical trials without risks of bias are necessary to allow firm decisions on methylphenidate treatment in children and adolescents with ADHD. We believe that nocebo controlled trials should be conducted first in adults with ADHD.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride — methylphenidate hydrochloride — LA [^112bJeLJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1 Children and Adolescents

Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical study in which 134 children, ages 6 to 12, with DSM-IV diagnoses of ADHD received a single morning dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA)in the range of 10 to 40 mg/day, or placebo, for up to 2 weeks. The doses used were the optimal doses established in a previous individual dose titration phase. In that titration phase, 53 of 164 patients (32%) started on a daily dose of 10 mg and 111 of 164 patients (68%) started on a daily dose of 20 mg or higher. The patient's regular schoolteacher completed the Conners ADHD/DSM-IV Scale for Teachers (CADS-T) at baseline and the end of each week. The CADS-T assesses symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention. The change from baseline of the (CADS-T) scores during the last week of treatment was analyzed as the primary efficacy parameter. Patients treated with methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) showed a statistically significant improvement in symptom scores from baseline [Mean (final score - baseline) = -10.7 points)] over patients who received placebo [Mean (final score - baseline) = +2.8 points]. The lower the final score on the CADS-T scale from baseline, the less severe the disease is. This demonstrates that a single morning dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) exerts a treatment effect in ADHD.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part I [^113rA9Gf]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Optimising the treatment

While the maximum licensed dose of methylphenidate for children (except for osmotic release and prolonged release formulations, see below) is 60 mg/day in many countries, some guidelines (e.g. those from the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (CADDRA), caddra.ca) and other documents recommend higher doses. For instance, the British National Formulary (BNF;) recommends a dose of up to 90 mg/day, under the direction of a specialist. For osmotic-release and prolonged-release formulations of methylphenidate, the maximum license dose is 54 mg/day, but the BNF mentions a maximum of 108 mg/day for Concerta XL ® in children (as well as in adults).

Some prescribers may fail to optimise the dose of treatment to reach the maximum benefit with the highest tolerated dose, being satisfied with a moderate improvement in the severity of the symptoms. Meta-analytic evidence based on flexible-dose trials for both methylphenidate and amphetamines shows increased efficacy and reduced likelihood of discontinuations for any reason with increasing stimulant doses, up to the maximum FDA-licensed dose. Also, meta-analytic evidence in adults (not available in children) shows that, at the group level, doses beyond the licensed ones are generally not associated with a favourable benefit–risk profile, even though it is important to appreciate that individual patients may benefit from, and tolerate well, doses beyond the licensed ones. While it should not be a standard practice, using doses beyond the maximum recommended ones could be considered when the patient has presented with a partial response, there is only some degree of improvement at the maximum recommended dose, and tolerability is good. It should be noted that, in some countries, special authorisation may be necessary for doses exceeding the maximum licensed amount, subject to local regulations.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Concerta) [^113uB4dN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Pretreatment Screening

Prior to treating patients with CONCERTA, assess:

for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
the family history and clinically evaluate patients for motor or verbal tics or Tourette's syndrome before initiating CONCERTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

2.2 Recommended Dosage

CONCERTA should be administered orally once daily in the morning with or without food.

CONCERTA must be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids, and must not be chewed, divided, or crushed [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

2.3 Patients New to Methylphenidate

The recommended starting dose of CONCERTA for patients who are not currently taking methylphenidate or stimulants other than methylphenidate is 18 mg once daily for children and adolescents and 18 or 36 mg once daily for adults (see Table 1).

2.4 Patients Currently Using Methylphenidate

The recommended dose of CONCERTA for patients who are currently taking methylphenidate twice daily or three times daily at doses of 10 to 60 mg/day is provided in Table 2. Dosing recommendations are based on current dose regimen and clinical judgment. Conversion dosage should not exceed 72 mg daily.

Other methylphenidate regimens: Clinical judgment should be used when selecting the starting dose.

2.5 Dose Titration

Doses may be increased in 18 mg increments at weekly intervals for patients who have not achieved an optimal response at a lower dose. Daily dosages above 54 mg in children and 72 mg in adolescents have not been studied and are not recommended. Daily dosages above 72 mg in adults are not recommended.

A 27 mg dosage strength is available for physicians who wish to prescribe between the 18 mg and 36 mg dosages.

2.6 Dosage Reduction and Discontinuation

If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse reactions occur, reduce dosage or, if necessary, discontinue CONCERTA.

If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a one-month period, discontinue CONCERTA.

### Adverse events during dosing of delayed-release / extended-release methylphenidate: learnings from the open-label phase of a registration trial and a real-world postmarketing surveillance program [^111kfS7x]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Delayed-release/extended-release methylphenidate (DR/ER-MPH) (formerly HLD200) is an evening-dosed agent used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Postmarketing surveillance data from approximately 74,000 patients exposed to DR/ER-MPH (up to June 17, 2022) were reported and compared with the open-label, treatment-optimization phase of a Phase III clinical trial to derive possible learnings on how to approach adverse events (AEs) that emerge during dose titration.

Methods

An analysis of AEs spontaneously reported to Ironshore in postmarketing surveillance included, where available, age, dose, timing, and discontinuations. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics.

Findings

A total of 395 children, adolescents, and adults reported 601 AEs in postmarketing surveillance. Five AEs were classified as serious. AEs preceded drug use discontinuation in 172 patients. Many AEs occurred early (52% were reported within 30 days) and at lower doses (54% were reported at 20 to 40 mg), similar to the trial data. Reported AEs included those similar in type but orders of magnitude lower in number than those from the clinical trial.

Implications

No new safety concerns were revealed in this real-world setting compared with the safety profile identified in DR/ER-MPH trial data. In real-world practices, clinicians tended to discontinue DR/ER-MPH treatment after AE onset, whereas trial investigators continued to optimize treatment and found that AEs were generally tolerable, suggesting that health care practitioners may consider developing strategies to manage tolerability issues with DR/ER-MPH treatment on AE emergence rather than immediately discontinuing use of the drug to provide optimal therapeutic benefit.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our study described real-world OROS-MPH treatment patterns in patients with ADHD in the US and Japan. While we observed some differences in drug use and dose titration patterns in the two countries, the majority of patients were treated according to recommendations provided in the product labels, suggesting that these recommendations are relevant in real world clinical practice. Additional real-world studies could provide information about clinical reasoning underlying dose selection and titration patterns, and would provide useful information to support clinical decisions.

### Methylphenidate (methylphenidate transdermal system) [^114HUwGW]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Transdermal administration of methylphenidate exhibits much less first pass effect than oral administration. Consequently, a much lower dose of Methylphenidate Transdermal System on a mg/kg basis compared to oral dosages may still produce higher exposures of d -MPH with transdermal administration compared to oral administration. In addition, very little, if any, l -methylphenidate is systemically available after oral administration due to first pass metabolism, whereas after transdermal administration of racemic methylphenidate exposure to l -methylphenidate is nearly as high as to d -methylphenidate.

The mean elimination t1/2from plasma of d -methylphenidate after removal of Methylphenidate Transdermal System in children aged 6 to 12 years and adolescents aged 13–17 years was approximately 4 to 5 hours. The t1/2of l -methylphenidate was shorter than for d -methylphenidate and ranged from 1.4 to 2.9 hours, on average.

The Cmax and AUC of d -methylphenidate were approximately 50% lower in adolescents, compared to children, following either a 1-day or 7-day administration of Methylphenidate Transdermal System (10mg/9hr). Multiple-dose administration of Methylphenidate Transdermal System did not result in significant accumulation of methylphenidate; following 7 days of Methylphenidate Transdermal System administration (10mg/9hr) in children and adolescents, the accumulation index of methylphenidate was 1.1, based on the mean steady state area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCss) relative to that anticipated on the basis of single dose pharmacokinetics (AUC0-∞).

### Methylphenidate (methylphenidate transdermal system) [^112EfG7e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Methylphenidate is a CNS stimulant. Its mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d -and l -enantiomers. The d -enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l -enantiomer. Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increases the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of Methylphenidate Transdermal System when applied to the hip for 9 hours have been studied in ADHD patients 6 to 17 years old.

Absorption

The amount of methylphenidate absorbed systemically is a function of both wear time and transdermal system size. In patients with ADHD, peak plasma levels of methylphenidate are reached at about 10 hours after single application and 8 hours after repeat transdermal system applications (12.5cm2to 37.5cm2) when worn up to 9 hours.

On single dosing of children or adolescents with Methylphenidate Transdermal System, there was a delay of, on average, 2 hours before d -methylphenidate was detectable in the circulation. On repeat dosing, low concentrations (1.2–3.0 ng/mL in children and 0.5–1.7ng/mL in adolescents, on average across the dose range) were observed earlier in the profile, due to carry-over effect. Following the application of Methylphenidate Transdermal System once daily with a 9-hour wear time, the mean pharmacokinetic parameters of d -methylphenidate in children and adolescents with ADHD after 4 weeks of therapy are summarized in Table 3.

Following administration of Methylphenidate Transdermal System 12.5cm2to pediatric and adolescent ADHD patients daily for 7 days, there were 13% and 14% increases, respectively, in steady state area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCss) relative to that anticipated on the basis of single dose pharmacokinetics (AUC0-∞); after 28 days administration, these increments increased to 64% and 76%, respectively. Cmaxincreased by nearly 69% and 100% within 4 weeks of daily administration of the starting dose in children and adolescents, respectively.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder

Can I use doses of psychostimulants beyond the maximum licensed or recommended ones?

The maximum recommended doses of psychostimulants (which act by inhibiting the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine and, for amphetamines, inducing their release) for the treatment of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in guidelines or formularies may be higher than the maximum licensed doses by regulatory agencies such the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Agency. More specifically, the maximum licensed dose of methylphenidate for children (except for osmotic release and prolonged release formulations, see below) is 60 mg/day, while the British National formulary (BNF) recommends a dose of up to 90 mg/day, under the direction of a specialist. For osmotic-release (Concerta® XL, Janseen Cilag, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK) and prolonged-release (e.g. Xaggitin® XL, Ethypharm, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK and Delmosart® prolonged-release tablet, Accord UK Ltd, Barnstaple, Devon, UK) formulations of methylphenidate, the maximum license dose is 54 mg/day, but the BNF mentions a maximum of 108 mg/day for Concerta® XL, in line with other clinical guidelines, for example, those from the Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance (caddra.ca). For lisdexamfetamine, both the maximum licensed and the BNF recommended dose is 70 mg/day.

Many prescribers will use doses above the maximum licensed ones. Some of them will also use doses beyond the maximum recommended in guidelines/formularies. Currently, there is no solid, meta-analytic evidence to inform if, and to what extent, doses beyond the recommended ones are safe and bring additional efficacy/effectiveness. Some experts agree that, while it should not be a standard, routine practice, using doses beyond the maximum recommended ones could be considered when the patient has presented with a partial response, there is only some degree of improvement at the maximum recommended dose, tolerability is good, and the aim is to optimise the response. This could be considered particularly in patients with overweight when a partial response was obtained at the licensed dose. If doses beyond those recommended are used, a careful monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, height and weight should be implemented.

Preschool-aged children with ADHD — medication initiation should follow severity-based criteria and evidence. Before initiating medications, "the physician should assess the severity of the child's ADHD", and "only those preschool-aged children with ADHD who have moderate-to-severe dysfunction should be considered for medication", with severity defined as "symptoms that have persisted for at least 9 months", "dysfunction… in both the home and other settings", and lack of adequate response to behavior therapy; if behavior therapy is insufficient, "medication can be prescribed". For dosing, metabolism is slower "in children 4 through 5 years of age", so "they should be given a lower dose to start" with "smaller increments", and "Maximum doses have not been adequately studied". Regarding agents and evidence, "Dextroamphetamine is the only medication approved by the FDA for use in children younger than 6 years of age", but despite on-label status "does not make it possible to recommend at this time", while most evidence is from methylphenidate: "1 multisite study of 165 children and 10 other smaller single-site studies… (total of 269 children); 7 of the 10 single-site studies found significant efficacy", though its use in preschoolers "remains off-label".

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Concerta) [^116irrBY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Dose Proportionality

Following administration of CONCERTA in single doses of 18, 36, and 54 mg/day to healthy adults, Cmaxand AUC(0–inf)of d-methylphenidate were proportional to dose, whereas l-methylphenidate Cmaxand AUC(0–inf)increased disproportionately with respect to dose. Following administration of CONCERTA, plasma concentrations of the l-isomer were approximately 1/40 the plasma concentrations of the d-isomer.

In healthy adults, single and multiple dosing of once-daily CONCERTA doses from 54 to 144 mg/day resulted in linear and dose-proportional increases in Cmaxand AUCinffor total methylphenidate (MPH) and its major metabolite, α-phenyl-piperidine acetic acid (PPAA). There was no time dependency in the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate. The ratio of metabolite (PPAA) to parent drug (MPH) was constant across doses from 54 to 144 mg/day, both after single dose and upon multiple dosing.

In a multiple-dose study in adolescent ADHD patients aged 13 to 16 administered their prescribed dose (18 to 72 mg/day) of CONCERTA, mean Cmaxand AUCTAUof d- and total methylphenidate increased proportionally with respect to dose.

Distribution

Plasma methylphenidate concentrations in adults and adolescents decline biexponentially following oral administration. The half-life of methylphenidate in adults and adolescents following oral administration of CONCERTA was approximately 3.5 hours.

Metabolism and Excretion

In humans, methylphenidate is metabolized primarily by de-esterification to PPAA, which has little or no pharmacologic activity. In adults the metabolism of CONCERTA once daily as evaluated by metabolism to PPAA is similar to that of methylphenidate three times daily. The metabolism of single and repeated once-daily doses of CONCERTA is similar.

After oral dosing of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans, about 90% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine. The main urinary metabolite was PPAA, accounting for approximately 80% of the dose.

Food Effects

In patients, there were no differences in either the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamic performance of CONCERTA when administered after a high-fat breakfast. There is no evidence of dose dumping in the presence or absence of food.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^115cKWxp]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

What shall I do if a patient does not respond to psychostimulants?

Following poor response to two psychostimulants (methylphenidate, MPH and amphetamines, AMPH – including lisdexamfetamine, LDX), some clinicians would consider second- or third-line approved compounds, unlicensed medications for ADHD, or combinations of different agents. However, a number of factors should be assessed before switching to alternative medications or using polypharmacy. Indeed, it should be highlighted that the majority of patients with ADHD respond to one or both classes of psychostimulants, when used properly. A comparative review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that approximately 41% of children treated with immediate-release stimulants responded equally well to AMPH or MPH, 28% responded better to AMPH, 16% had a better response to MPH and 15% did not respond to either medication. A more recent review concluded that approximately 91% of individuals with ADHD respond to either or both class of stimulants. (We note that, as RCTs often exclude participants with specific comorbidities that decrease the rate of response, the response rate in patients seen in daily clinical practice may be lower.) Therefore, before considering alternative agents and/or polypharmacy, the following should be considered: (a) Have I titrated properly? While some patients will respond well to low or moderate doses, others will need higher ones, regardless of their age and weight. Of note, meta-analytic evidence from flexible-dose trials for both MPH and AMPH demonstrated increased efficacy and reduced likelihood of discontinuations for any reason with increasing stimulant doses; (b) Is this drug/preparation working well at any times during the day or do I need to change the dose or preparation to get a more comprehensive coverage? Sometimes, poor response may be detected only in specific periods of the day, when the medication effect has worn off; (c) Am I targeting the right symptoms? Psychostimulants are in general highly efficacious/effective on the core symptoms of ADHD (i.e. inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), not necessarily on other problems (e.g. oppositional behaviour/emotional dysregulation); (d) Is the patient showing tolerance? Evidence from clinical studies, for example, shows the need to increase the dose of stimulants over time in order to maintain therapeutic response. Additionally, neuroimaging studies (e.g. PET studies;) point to an increase in dopamine reuptake receptors in adults with ADHD treated for up to 12 months with stimulants. This evidence suggests that tolerance may happen during treatment with psychostimulants, even though more research is needed to gain a better understanding of the exact percentage of patients who develop tolerance, their clinical characteristics and how to manage tolerance effectively. Some experts, for example, suggest decreasing the dose or temporarily (for a few weeks) stop the psychostimulant to overcome the tolerance issues; (e) What else is going on in patient's life/family life? A comprehensive formulation, beyond diagnosis, is key here; (f) Have I missed any comorbidity? Some comorbidities, for example, autism spectrum disorder, are associated with lower chances of response; (g) Is the diagnosis correct?

### Meta-analysis: dose-dependent effects of methylphenidate on neurocognitive functioning in children with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^115fmCMS]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Neurocognitive deficits are at the heart of explanatory models of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and lead to significant impairments in daily life. Determining the dosing effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on a broad range of neurocognitive functions and investigating possible impairing effects of high doses is therefore important.

Method

Placebo-controlled trials were included that investigated MPH dosing effects on neurocognitive functions in children and adolescents (aged 5–18 years) diagnosed with ADHD. Effect sizes (standardized mean differences [SMDs]) were calculated for different neurocognitive functions (baseline speed, variability in responding, nonexecutive memory and executive memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility) and, if available, for ADHD symptoms. Meta-regression analysis were used to investigate linear effects of dose (mg/kg/dose), and separate meta-analyses compared SMDs for 3 MPH dose ranges: low (0.10–0.30 mg/kg/dose), medium (0.31–0.60 mg/kg/dose), and high (0.61–1.00 mg/kg/dose).

Results

A total of 31 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria, comprising 804 children with ADHD. Methylphenidate had beneficial effects on all neurocognitive functions (d = 0.20–0.73). Significant linear dosing effects were found for ADHD symptoms and lower-order neurocognitive functions (baseline speed, variability in responding, nonexecutive memory), with greater enhancement of functioning with increasing dose. No dosing effects were found for higher-order neurocognitive functions (executive memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility). No detrimental effects of MPH were found on any of the investigated functions.

Conclusion

Methylphenidate was superior to placebo in improving ADHD symptoms and a broad range of neurocognitive functions; however, effects sizes regarding the effects of dose vary substantially between functions. Our data highlight the importance of considering both neurocognitive and symptomatic aspects of ADHD in clinical practice.

### Once-a-day concerta methylphenidate versus three-times-daily methylphenidate in laboratory and natural settings [^114Gsvdv]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Methylphenidate (MPH), the most commonly prescribed drug for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has a short half-life, which necessitates multiple daily doses. The need for multiple doses produces problems with medication administration during school and after-school hours, and therefore with compliance. Previous long-acting stimulants and preparations have shown effects equivalent to twice-daily dosing of MPH. This study tests the efficacy and duration of action, in natural and laboratory settings, of an extended-release MPH preparation designed to last 12 hours and therefore be equivalent to 3-times-daily dosing.

Methods

Sixty-eight children with ADHD, 6 to 12 years old, participated in a within-subject, double-blind comparison of placebo, immediate-release (IR) MPH 3 times a day (tid), and Concerta, a once-daily MPH formulation. Three dosing levels of medication were used: 5 mg IR MPH tid/18 mg Concerta once a day (qd); 10 mg IR MPH tid/36 mg Concerta qd; and 15 mg IR MPH tid/54 mg Concerta qd. All children were currently medicated with MPH at enrollment, and each child's dose level was based on that child's MPH dosing before the study. The doses of Concerta were selected to be comparable to the daily doses of MPH that each child received. To achieve the ascending rate of MPH delivery determined by initial investigations to provide the necessary continuous coverage, Concerta doses were 20% higher on a daily basis than a comparable tid regimen of IR MPH. Children received each medication condition for 7 days. The investigation was conducted in the context of a background clinical behavioral intervention in both the natural environment and the laboratory setting. Parents received behavioral parent training and teachers were taught to establish a school-home daily report card (DRC). A DRC is a list of individual target behaviors that represent a child's most salient areas of impairment. Teachers set daily goals for each child's impairment targets, and parents provided rewards at home for goal attainment. Each weekday, teachers completed the DRC, and it was used as a dependent measure of individualized medication response. Teachers and parents also completed weekly standardized ratings of behavior and treatment effectiveness. To evaluate the time course of medication effects, children spent 12 hours in a laboratory setting on Saturdays and medication effects were measured using procedures and methods adapted from our summer treatment program. Measures of classroom behavior and academic productivity/accuracy were taken in a laboratory classroom setting during which children completed independent math and reading worksheets. Measures of social behavior were taken in structured, small-group board game settings and unstructured recess settings. Measures included behavior frequency counts, academic problems completed and accuracy, independent observations, teacher and counselor ratings, and individualized behavioral target goals. Reports of adverse events, sleep quality, and appetite were collected.

Results

On virtually all measures in all settings, both drug conditions were significantly different from placebo, and the 2 drugs were not different from each other. In children's regular school settings, both medications improved behavior as measured by teacher ratings and individualized target behaviors (the DRC); these effects were seen into the evening as measured by parent ratings. In the laboratory setting, effects of Concerta were equivalent to tid MPH and lasted at least through 12 hours after dosing. Concerta was significantly superior to tid MPH on 2 parent rating scores, and when asked, more parents preferred Concerta than preferred tid IR MPH or placebo. Side effects on children's sleep and appetite were similar for the 2 preparations. In the lab setting, both medications improved productivity and accuracy on arithmetic seatwork assignments, disruptive and on-task behavior, and classroom rule following. Both medications improved children's rule following and negative behavior in small group board games, as well as in unstructured recess settings. Individual target behaviors also showed significant improvement with medication across domains in the laboratory setting. Children's behavior across settings deteriorated across the laboratory day, and the primary effect of medication was to prevent this deterioration as the day wore on. Results support the use of background behavioral treatment in clinical trials of stimulant medication, and illustrate the utility of a measure of individualized daily target goals (ie, the DRC) as an objective measure of medication response in both the laboratory and natural school settings.

Conclusion

This investigation clearly supports the efficacy of the Concerta long-acting formulation of MPH for parents who desire to have medication benefits for their child throughout the day and early evening. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

### Efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in 45 adults with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder. A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over trial [^115ZnZWZ]. Psychological Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Data on the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in adults with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are lacking in Europe. This study was undertaken to report on the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate in an adult out-patient population with ADHD, and to compare results with US data.

Method

A double-blind randomized cross-over trial comparing methylphenidate and placebo in 45 adults with ADHD with childhood onset was performed in a dose-titration design. Methylphenidate was titrated from 0.5 mg/kg per day in week 1 up to 1.0 mg/kg per day in week 3.

Results

Response rates using methylphenidate varied between 38 and 51%, and using placebo between 7 and 18% (p < 0.05), depending on outcome measure used. Although the overall percentage of subjects having any side effect on both methylphenidate and placebo was rather high, side effects on methylphenidate over and above those on placebo were few and mild.

Conclusions

Methylphenidate proves to be an effective and well tolerated treatment for symptoms of ADHD in adults in the short term. Future research should study the long-term response and clarify the impact of gender, co-morbidity, socio-economic status and IQ on response rates in adults with ADHD.

### Dose titration of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^1159e1up]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder among children, affecting around 5–7% of the population younger than 18 years of age worldwide. Although symptom onset is typically during early to mid-childhood, the disorder may persist into adolescence or adulthood. Even though the estimated prevalence of ADHD varies little between North America and Asia, the prevalence of ADHD medication use in Asia has been reported to be much lower than in North America (2010: 4.5% in North America vs. 1.0% in Asia). Medications available for the treatment of ADHD include psychostimulants and non-psychostimulants. For school-age populations with ADHD, psychostimulants are recommended for first-line treatment and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) ranks methylphenidate (MPH) over other psychostimulants. A multi-country population-based observational study covering 150 million individuals reported that MPH was the most widely used ADHD medication in most countries, including the United States (US) (US Medicaid population) and Japan. Non-psychostimulants are used for second-line treatment if psychostimulants prove inadequate or intolerable.

### Is age-at-onset criterion relevant for the response to methylphenidate in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder? [^111k1KyK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Since DSM-IV criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) require that some symptoms causing impairment must be present before 7 years of age, clinicians are faced with a diagnostic and treatment dilemma on how to proceed with late-onset ADHD patients. We aimed to compare the response to methylphenidate between a group of patients fulfilling all DSM-IV ADHD criteria (full ADHD diagnosis) and a group of patients fulfilling all DSM-IV criteria except the age-at-onset criterion (late-onset ADHD).

Method

We evaluated 180 children and adolescents (4–17 years old) and 111 adults from our ADHD unit. All ADHD diagnoses were assessed using DSM-IV criteria. Methylphenidate was administered twice daily (8 a.m. and noon), but an extra dose was allowed between 5 and 6 p.m. for children and adolescents needing extra coverage in the evening. The minimum dose was 0.30 mg/kg/day. Response to treatment was assessed in methylphenidatenaive subjects using the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Scale-version IV (SNAP-IV) at baseline and after 1 month of treatment. Data were collected from January 2000 to January 2006.

Results

In both samples, subjects with the full ADHD diagnosis did not have a better response to methylphenidate at doses around 0.5 mg/kg/day than the late-onset ADHD subjects. In fact, adults with late-onset ADHD had a better response to methylphenidate than adults with the full diagnosis, even after adjustment for confounders (baseline SNAP-IV total score and ADHD types) (children and adolescents: F = 0.865, p = .354; adults: F = 5.760, p = .018).

Conclusion

These results concur with recent literature questioning the validity of the DSM-IV age-at-onset criterion for the diagnosis of ADHD and suggest that clinicians should consider implementing methylphenidate treatment for subjects with late-onset ADHD.

### Clinical response to a single-dose methylphenidate challenge is indicative of treatment response at two months in adults with ADHD [^114Uw63j]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

In a systematic review of studies specifically investigating the association between acute and longer-term stimulant treatment response, we found only a secondary analysis of an RCT (among 63 single-dose identified studies) testing the association between acute and longer-term clinical response. This study included 46 children (aged 6–13) with ADHD and reported that the improvement in clinical severity after a single dose of short-acting MPH (10 mgs) was significantly associated with clinical response at 4 weeks. These preliminary findings are promising but, since that investigation only included children, may not necessarily apply to the adult population. In the present study we therefore tested whether changes in clinico-neuropsychological measures under a single dose of MPH were associated with treatment response post-dose optimization in adults with ADHD.

### Editorial: on the safety of long-term methylphenidate treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in early childhood [^1148wTvZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical manifestations of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often emerge before 6 years of age, and an early onset can portend a more marked and severe clinical course. Given that untreated ADHD can have a negative impact on educational attainment and social functioning, early treatment is indicated, as it might translate into better distal outcomes. For this age group, the current recommendation from clinical guidelines and ADHD experts is to administer behavioral therapy as first-line treatment. Because only limited information has been available on the possible safety implications of long-term pharmacological treatment at young ages, the use of methylphenidate is reserved for cases with impairing ADHD symptoms unresponsive to psychosocial intervention. 1.

### Methylphenidate (methylphenidate transdermal system) [^112NnBcx]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Study 2, conducted in the outpatient setting, Methylphenidate Transdermal System or placebo was blindly administered in a flexible-dose design using doses of 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg / 9 hours to achieve an optimal regimen over 5 weeks, followed by a 2-week maintenance period using the optimal transdermal system dose for each patient. Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by the ADHD-Rating Scale (RS)-IV. Methylphenidate Transdermal System was statistically significantly superior to placebo as measured by the mean change from baseline for the ADHD-RS-IV total score. Although this study was not designed specifically to evaluate dose response, in general there did not appear to be any additional effectiveness accomplished by increasing the transdermal system dose from 20 mg / 9 hours to 30 mg / 9 hours.

In Study 3, conducted in the outpatient setting, Methylphenidate Transdermal System or placebo was blindly administered in a flexible-dose design using doses of 10, 15, 20, and 30 mg / 9 hours during a 5-week dose-optimization phase, followed by a 2-week maintenance period using the optimal transdermal system dose for each patient. Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated using the ADHD-Rating Scale (RS)-IV. Methylphenidate Transdermal System was statistically significantly superior to placebo as measured by the mean change from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV total score.

US child group

In the US child group (Fig. 2 a & Supplementary Table 1), 30,237 patients underwent dose titration, of whom 84.4% increased initial dose and 15.6% decreased initial dose. Among patients who initiated OROS-MPH at 18, 27, 36 or 45 mg/day, upward titrations (e.g. 18➔27 mg/day, 18➔36 mg/day and 27➔36 mg/day) were more observed than downward titrations (e.g. 27➔18 mg/day and 36➔27 mg/day). However, the opposite was observed among patients who initiated OROS-MPH at ≥ 54 mg/day. At the second dose level, 55.1% (16,648/30,237) of patients further titrated to a third dose level, of whom 59.3% had a dose increase and 40.7% had a dose decrease. Among these patients, upward titrations still predominated amongst those whose second dose level was 18, 27 or 36 mg/day, while downward titrations predominated in patients whose second dose level was ≥ 45 mg/day. At the third dose level, 56.2% (9354/16,648) of patients titrated to a fourth dose level, of whom 57.7% had a dose increase and 42.3% had a dose decrease. Among these patients there was a continuing pattern of dose increases in patients taking lower doses and dose decreases in patients at higher doses.

US adolescent group

In the US adolescent group (Fig. 2 b & Supplementary Table 2), 11,365 patients underwent dose titration, of whom 75.4% increased initial dose and 24.6% decreased initial dose. At the second dose level, 46.8% (5320/11,365) of patients further titrated to a third dose level, of whom 56.2% had a dose increase and 43.8% had a dose decrease. At the third dose level, 49.9% (2653/5320) of patients further titrated to a fourth dose level, of whom 53.0% had a dose increase and 47.0% had a dose decrease. At each dose level, titration patterns were similar to the US child group, with upward titration predominating in patients receiving ≤ 36 mg/day and downward titration predominating in patients taking higher doses.

### Dose titration of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^111nDxW2]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Data analyses were conducted in child and adolescent groups separately for the US and Japanese cohorts. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were described. Age was reported as a continuous variable (median, inter-quartile range [IQR]). Gender, comorbid psychiatric disorders and ADHD medication history at baseline were reported as categorical variables.

The OROS-MPH daily dose and overall consumption during the index episode were described. The initial regimen was measured categorically as monotherapy vs. combination (with other ADHD medications). OROS-MPH initial, maintenance, maximum, and average daily doses were summarised as both continuous and categorical variables. The maintenance dose was the daily dose level used continuously for the longest time and at least 60 days. The proportion of patients who had maintenance dose was calculated. Because OROS-MPH tablets need to be swallowed whole, the daily dose should be equal to the dose of one single tablet or the sum of multiple tablets. As a result, initial, maintenance, and maximum daily dose were categorised as 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, and > 54 mg/day, and average daily dose was categorised as < 19, 19–27, 28–36, 37–45, 46–54 and > 54 mg/day. Duration of the index episode was reported both continuously and categorically (< 6 months, 6–12 months, and > 12 months), and the number of OROS-MPH prescriptions were reported categorically (1, 2–3, 4–9, 10–20, and > 20).

Numbers of dose titration for each patient were reported categorically (0, 1, 2 or ≥ 3), and for patients in each category the durations of index episodes were described. OROS-MPH titration pathways were visualised by Sankey diagrams for the patients with at least one dose titration. The graphs were constructed as follows: the first column of bars represents the initial dose level, and patient movement to the second column of bars represents titration to the second dose level, and so on.

Sensitivity analyses were conducted among the US patients who had never been exposed to any generic MPH within 6 months prior to OROS-MPH initiation (i.e. MPH-naive patients) to identify if previous experience with MPH influenced OROS-MPH initial dose and titration pattern.

### Randomized, 6-week, placebo-controlled study of treatment for adult attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: individualized dosing of osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate with a goal of symptom remission [^113jyFTg]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of individualized dosing within the approved dose range for osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate hydrochloride in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Methods

A double-blind, 6-week trial was conducted between July 2009 and February 2010 at 35 US sites. Adults with ADHD (DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) and a screening ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale (AISRS) score > 24 were randomly assigned to OROS methylphenidate 18 mg or matching placebo. Treatment dose could be increased at 18 mg increments, up to 72 mg/d, until an optimal dose was achieved. AISRS score changes from baseline to end point (primary outcome) were analyzed using analysis of covariance.

Results

At baseline, the intent-to-treat population of 169 OROS methylphenidate and 172 placebo subjects (mean age = 35.8 years) had mean (standard deviation [SD]) AISRS scores of 37.8 (6.94) and 37.0 (7.51), respectively. OROS methylphenidate-treated subjects exhibited a significantly greater mean (SD) AISRS score improvement than placebo subjects (-17.1 [12.44] vs -11.7 [13.30]; P < .001). In general, OROS methylphenidate-treated subjects experienced greater improvements than placebo subjects in secondary measures of symptom frequency, cognitive function, work productivity, and quality-of-life. Little effect of OROS methylphenidate was observed in exploratory sleep assessments. The adverse event pattern was similar to previous reports of stimulants in adults with ADHD.

Conclusions

OROS methylphenidate treatment with individualized doses titrated to achieve symptom remission demonstrated greater ADHD symptom reduction than placebo treatment. These data support the overall efficacy of OROS methylphenidate treatment in the management of adults with ADHD and provide new possibilities for additional intervention.

### Sex differences in the response of children with ADHD to once-daily formulations of methylphenidate [^1147fV1s]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Studies of sex differences in methylphenidate response by children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have lacked methodological rigor and statistical power. This paper reports an examination of sex differences based on further analysis of data from a comparison of two once-daily methylphenidate formulations (the COMACS study), which addresses these shortcomings.

Method

Children (184: 48 females; mean [SD] age, 9.58 [1.83] years) entered a double-blind, crossover trial of Concerta, MetadateCD/Equasym XL, or placebo. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms were recorded at seven time points across the school day on the seventh day of treatment, using a laboratory classroom setting.

Results

More females had comorbid anxiety disorder. Males and females did not differ with regard to other characteristics. Observed sex differences in pharmacodynamic symptom profiles persisted after controlling for placebo and time 0 hours attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder scores and the presence of an anxiety disorder. Females had a statistically superior response at 1.5 hours post-dosing and an inferior response at the 12-hour time point relative to their male counterparts, no matter which methylphenidate formulation was being assessed.

Conclusions

Dose titration of once-daily formulations of methylphenidate should ideally be based on systematic evidence of response at different periods across the day. The responses of female patients may require additional assessments later in the day to determine the optimal dose.

### Immediate-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^116vC4sb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention or impulsivity or both, and hyperactivity, which affect children, adolescents, and adults. In some countries, methylphenidate is the first option to treat adults with moderate or severe ADHD. However, evidence on the efficacy and adverse events of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD in adults is limited and controversial.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and harms (adverse events) of IR methylphenidate for treating ADHD in adults.

Search Methods

In January 2020, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight additional databases and three trial registers. We also searched internal reports on the European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration websites. We checked citations of included trials to identify additional trials not captured by the electronic searches.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IR methylphenidate, at any dose, with placebo or other pharmacological interventions (including extended-release formulations of methylphenidate) for ADHD in adults. Primary outcomes comprised changes in the symptoms of ADHD (efficacy) and harms. Secondary outcomes included changes in the clinical impression of severity and improvement, level of functioning, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Outcomes could have been rated by investigators or participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently on the characteristics of the trials, participants, interventions; outcomes and financial conflict of interests. We resolved disagreements by discussion or consulting a third review author. We obtained additional, unpublished information from the authors of one included trial that had reported efficacy data in a graph. We calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardized MDs (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous data reported on the same or different scales, respectively. We summarized dichotomous variables as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CI.

Main Results

We included 10 trials published between 2001 and 2016 involving 497 adults with ADHD. Three trials were conducted in Europe and one in Argentina; the remaining trials did not report their location. The RCTs compared IR methylphenidate with placebo, an osmotic-release oral system (OROS) of methylphenidate (an extended-release formulation), an extended-release formulation of bupropion, lithium, and Pycnogenol® (maritime pine bark extract). Participants comprised outpatients, inpatients in addiction treatment, and adults willing to attend an intensive outpatient program for cocaine dependence. The duration of the follow-up ranged from 6 to 18 weeks. IR methylphenidate versus placebo We found very low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may reduce symptoms of ADHD when measured with investigator-rated scales (MD -20.70, 95% CI -23.97 to -17.43; 1 trial, 146 participants; end scores; Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale (AISRS), scored from 0 to 54), but the evidence is uncertain. The effect of IR methylphenidate on ADHD symptoms when measured with participant-rated scales was moderate, but the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD -0.59, 95% CI -1.25 to 0.06; I² = 69%; 2 trials, 138 participants; end scores). There is very low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may reduce the clinical impression of the severity of ADHD symptoms (MD -0.57, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.28; 2 trials, 139 participants; I² = 0%; change and end scores; Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity scale (scored from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse))). There is low-certainty evidence that, compared with placebo, IR methylphenidate may slightly impact the clinical impression of an improvement in symptoms of ADHD (MD -0.94, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.51; 1 trial, 49 participants; end scores; CGI-Improvement scale (scored from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse))). There is no clear evidence of an effect on anxiety (MD -0.20, 95% CI -4.84 to 4.44; 1 trial, 19 participants; change scores; Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A; scored from 0 to 56); very low-certainty evidence) or depression (MD 2.80, 95% CI -0.09 to 5.69; 1 trial, 19 participants; change scores; Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D; scored from 0 to 52); very low-certainty evidence) in analyses comparing IR methylphenidate with placebo. IR methylphenidate versus lithium Compared with lithium, it is uncertain whether IR methylphenidate increases or decreases symptoms of ADHD (MD 0.60, 95% CI -3.11 to 4.31; 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (scored from 0 to 198); very low-certainty evidence); anxiety (MD -0.80, 95% CI -4.49 to 2.89; 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; HAM-A; very low-certainty evidence); or depression (MD -1.20, 95% CI -3.81 to 1.41, 1 trial, 46 participants; end scores; HAM-D scale; very low-certainty evidence). None of the included trials assessed participant-rated changes in symptoms of ADHD, or clinical impression of severity or improvement in participants treated with IR methylphenidate compared with lithium. Adverse events were poorly assessed and reported. We rated all trials at high risk of bias due to selective outcome reporting of harms and masking of outcome assessors (failure to blind outcome assessor to measure adverse events). Overall, four trials with 203 participants who received IR methylphenidate and 141 participants who received placebo described the occurrence of harms. The use of IR methylphenidate in these trials increased the risk of gastrointestinal complications (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.95) and loss of appetite (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.96). Cardiovascular adverse events were reported inconsistently, preventing a comprehensive analysis. One trial comparing IR methylphenidate to lithium reported five and nine adverse events, respectively. We considered four trials to have notable concerns of vested interests influencing the evidence, and authors from two trials omitted information related to the sources of funding and conflicts of interest.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no certain evidence that IR methylphenidate compared with placebo or lithium can reduce symptoms of ADHD in adults (low- and very low-certainty evidence). Adults treated with IR methylphenidate are at increased risk of gastrointestinal and metabolic-related harms compared with placebo. Clinicians should consider whether it is appropriate to prescribe IR methylphenidate, given its limited efficacy and increased risk of harms. Future RCTs should explore the long-term efficacy and risks of IR methylphenidate, and the influence of conflicts of interest on reported effects.

### Driving performance and ocular activity following acute administration of 10 mg methylphenidate: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^113FECVX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations and future research

Given the relatively low complexity of the simulated highway drive, the demands on gaze behaviour, the necessity for frequent and varied eye movements may be low. Consequently, the repetitive nature of the task may have resulted in a ceiling effect, in which the range of required eye movements is inherently limited, regardless of the internal state of the driver. The outcomes of this study should be contextualised with the recognition that real-world driving involves navigating through a broad spectrum of environments. In naturalistic and more challenging driving scenarios that involve direct safety risk thus demand greater visuospatial attention, such as manoeuvring through urban roads or navigating heavy traffic, a more significant effect of methylphenidate on gaze behaviour and scanning efficiency might become apparent. Furthermore, we used a relatively low, acute dose of methylphenidate in this study, which reflects typical introductory therapeutic doses. Thus, we acknowledge that this may not fully capture alterations associated with higher acute doses or patterns of change following chronic usage, which are arguably more common in real-world misuse scenarios and likely associated with RTCs. The dose-related limitation in the present study is reflective of much of the clinical experimental work assessing acute amphetamine effects, which is limited by complex ethical and methodological constraints. Future research should therefore consider varying the dosing regimens, including higher and repeated doses over extended periods, and incorporating more complex driving simulations to better replicate real-world conditions, and assess the interaction of methylphenidate intoxication with unexpected or rapidly changing road environments. Additionally, incorporating direct markers of cortical and subcortical processing to complement gaze metrics would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms driving behaviour.

### Impairment and deportment responses to different methylphenidate doses in children with ADHD: the MTA titration trial [^115LZA2G]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Results of the NIMH Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) were analyzed to determine whether a double-blind, placebo-controlled methylphenidate (MPH) titration trial identified the best MPH dose for each child with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Children with ADHD assigned to MTA medication treatment groups (n = 289) underwent a controlled 28-day titration protocol that administered different MPH doses (placebo, low, middle, and high) on successive days.

Results

A repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed main effects for MPH dose with greater effects on teacher ratings of impairment and deportment (F3 = 100.6, n = 223, p = .0001; effect sizes 0.8–1.3) than on parent ratings of similar endpoints (F3 = 55.61, n = 253, p = .00001; effect sizes 0.4–0.6). Dose did not interact with period, dose order, comorbid diagnosis, site, or treatment group.

Conclusions

The MTA titration protocol validated the efficacy of weekend MPH dosing and established a total daily dose limit of 35 mg of MPH for children weighing less than 25 kg. It replicated previously reported MPH response rates (77%), distribution of best doses (10–50 mg/day) across subjects, effect sizes on impairment and deportment, as well as dose-related adverse events.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114iYbVF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Amphetamine-type stimulant use disorder — methylphenidate formulations recommendations state that for patients with ATS use disorder, clinicians can consider prescribing a long-acting MPH formulation to promote reduced use of ATS (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians can give long-acting MPH formulations additional consideration for patients with moderate or higher frequency of ATS use at treatment start (ie, 10 or more days per month; Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians can give long-acting MPH formulations additional consideration for patients with co-occurring ADHD, as these medications can also reduce ADHD symptoms (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). When prescribing a long-acting MPH formulation, clinicians can consider dosing at or above the maximum dose approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD to effectively reduce ATS use (Low certainty, Weak Recommendation).

### Advances in understanding and treating ADHD [^114NQAX5]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Research has continued to suggest that osmotic-release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate lessens ADHD symptoms throughout the day and has greater adherence, thought to be associated with the convenience of once-daily dosing. Dexmethylphenidate extended-release (XR) and transdermal methylphenidate also offer this benefit. Dexmethylphenidate comes in capsules that can be opened and mixed with food, and has the earliest onset of efficacy of the long-acting preparations. Transdermal methylphenidate bypasses the oral route entirely, and in short-term studies is associated with efficacy throughout the day, with improved family quality of life, and when carefully titrated, little effect on sleep. Greater absorption of medication occurs when the patch is applied to the buttocks rather than to the subscapular area.

Comorbid anxiety was not found to affect stimulant efficacy in a recent study, and some studies suggest that treatment with stimulants can help to lessen the likelihood of other psychiatric comorbidities during adolescence, including cigarette use and substance abuse. However, meta-analyses of stimulants and other ADHD medications in the treatment of ADHD comorbid with tic disorders concluded that supratherapeutic doses of dextroamphetamine should be avoided in this population. These studies also indicated that methylphenidate gave the best control for ADHD and that α-2-agonists produced the best improvement in both tics and ADHD.

The commonest side-effects of stimulants (decreased appetite, trouble with sleep onset) have also continued to receive recent research interest. Some research suggests that it is difficult to predict which children with ADHD will have adverse effects, based upon demographic and clinical characteristics. Although rare, serious cardiovascular side-effects have been identified with stimulant use; however, the common effects on blood pressure, heart rate and exercise parameters are usually of no clinical significance. Consensus has been reached in the United States, Canada and Europe that routine electrocardiography screening and/or cardiology investigations are needed before starting stimulant use only in those with a positive family or personal cardiac history. Likewise, no cytogenetic side-effects from stimulant use have been reported. However, a recent review article has shown that treatment with stimulants in childhood modestly reduced expected height and weight. These effects were dose-dependent and attenuated over time. The general consensus on cardiovascular side-effects at this point is that the short/medium term side-effects are usually of no clinical significance, but the long-term potential side-effects are less certain.

### Methylphenidate [^1147kMqa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Study 2, conducted in the outpatient setting, methylphenidate transdermal system or placebo was blindly administered in a flexible-dose design using doses of 10 mg/9 hours, 15 mg/9 hours, 20 mg/9 hours, and 30 mg/9 hours to achieve an optimal regimen over 5 weeks, followed by a 2-week maintenance period using the optimal transdermal system dose for each patient. Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by the ADHD-Rating Scale (RS)-IV. Methylphenidate transdermal system was statistically significantly superior to placebo as measured by the mean change from baseline for the ADHD-RS-IV total score. Although this study was not designed specifically to evaluate dose response, in general there did not appear to be any additional effectiveness accomplished by increasing the transdermal system dose from 20 mg/9 hours to 30 mg/9 hours.

In Study 3, conducted in the outpatient setting, methylphenidate transdermal system or placebo was blindly administered in a flexible-dose design using doses of 10 mg/9 hours, 15 mg/9 hours, 20 mg/9 hours, and 30 mg/9 hours during a 5-week dose-optimization phase, followed by a 2-week maintenance period using the optimal transdermal system dose for each patient. Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated using the ADHD-Rating Scale (RS)-IV. Methylphenidate transdermal system was statistically significantly superior to placebo as measured by the mean change from baseline in the ADHD-RS-IV total score.

### Limits of meta-analysis: methylphenidate in the treatment of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^116W7PRC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults advocate methylphenidate as first-line treatment. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of methylphenidate treatment of adult ADHD and to examine the influence of methods on meta-analytic results. Electronic databases were searched to identify clinical trials comparing methylphenidate with placebo in the treatment of adult ADHD. Studies were summarised with meta-analytic methods. Subgroup analyses were conducted with respect to parallel group versus cross-over trials and self versus observer ratings. The relationship between dosage and effect size was explored by weighted regression analysis. The results were tested for publication bias, and several sensitivity analyses were performed. Findings and methods were compared with a previous meta-analysis. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria of which 16 were included in the meta-analysis. The overall effect size (d = 0.42) was significantly different from zero, but was only half the size expected on the basis of a previous meta-analysis. No significant differences could be observed in the subgroup analyses. The regression analysis showed no significant influence of mean daily dose on effect size. These results contradict findings of a previous meta-analysis and challenge guideline recommendations. Methodological issues in meta-analyses are discussed.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^116yqx9z]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We used Cochrane methodology, following our published protocol.

Study selection

We included both parallel and crossover randomised clinical trials comparing all types of methylphenidate with placebo or no intervention in children and adolescents from 3 to 18 years of age (two trials recruited a small number of participants aged 19 to 21) with ADHD. Trials were included irrespective of language, publication year, publication type, or publication status. After the exclusion of duplicates and studies not meeting the inclusion criteria, we obtained full text articles as per protocol.

Inclusion criteria

In one trial the diagnosis used for ADHD had to be determined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (third edition, third edition revised, fourth edition, fourth edition revised, or fifth edition), or according to International Classification of Diseases ninth or 10th revisions (ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes). At least 75% of participants had to be aged less than 19 years and the mean age of the study population had to be less than 19 years. We included trials in which participants had comorbidities; however, at least 75% of the participants were required to have an intellectual quotient in the normal range (IQ > 70).

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2), Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Science and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science & Humanities (Web of Science), ClincalTrials.gov, and WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to February 2015 using two different search strategies, one for efficacy and one for adverse events. The complete search strategy is available in the Cochrane review. We screened reference lists of identified reviews, meta-analyses, and a selection of included trials for additional relevant articles. Furthermore, we contacted pharmaceutical companies, including Shire, Medice (represented in Denmark by HB Pharma), Janssen-Cilag, and Novartis for published and unpublished data. Emails were also sent to experts in the discipline requesting data on unpublished or ongoing studies.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychosis in adolescents and young adults: a population-based cohort study [^116T5iBy]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Longitudinal studies, have shown that attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood is a risk factor for a diagnosis of psychosis in adult life. Research indicates that these disorders share common geneticand environmental aetiologies. A potential mediator of the association between ADHD and psychosis is the prescription of central stimulants for ADHD, which causes considerable concern for clinicians. Clinical guidelinesrecommend stimulant medications, including methylphenidate and dexamphetamine, as first-line treatments for ADHD. Central stimulants act as indirect dopamine agonists and are presumed to amplify neuronal signalling by prompting a marked increase in the extracellular concentration of neurotransmitters in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Increased concentrations of synaptic dopamine have also been implicated in the generation of psychotic symptoms. Hence, the pharmacological mechanism of central stimulant medication can be viewed by clinicians as having the potential to induce psychotic symptoms and disorders.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Clinical concerns have been raised that prescribing methylphenidate, the most common pharmacological treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), might increase the risk of treatment-emergent psychotic events, particularly in young people with a history of psychosis. This perceived risk can lead to clinicians withholding methylphenidate treatment or using less effective alternatives. We searched PubMed for studies published in English on or after Jan 1, 2000, that investigated the association between methylphenidate prescribing, ADHD, and psychosis. We screened abstracts for relevance by use of combinations of the search terms "methylphenidate OR stimulants", "ADHD", and "psychosis". We also reviewed clinical guidelines from national bodies, including the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and relevant Cochrane systematic reviews. There is no clear consensus as to whether methylphenidate treatment, particularly in older adolescents and young adults and in individuals with a history of psychosis, increases the risk of psychotic events. Some observational studies that report an increased risk of psychotic events associated with methylphenidate might be affected by confounding by indication. Clinical trial data is also relatively unhelpful in answering this question because of the routine exclusion of participants with previous psychosis, short follow-up periods, and the low incidence of psychotic events in these studies.

### Methylphenidate in the treatment of children and adolescents with bipolar disorder and attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^116LWzXN]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the short-term efficacy of methylphenidate in the treatment of youths with bipolar disorder (BD) and comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

A 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in youths ages 5 to 17 years was conducted. Subjects met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder and ADHD, were currently receiving a stable dose of at least one thymoleptic, and while euthymic continued to have clinically significant symptoms of ADHD. Patients received 1 week each of placebo, methylphenidate 5 mg twice daily, methylphenidate 10 mg twice daily, and methylphenidate 15 mg twice daily using a crossover design. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of six possible dosing orders. At study's end, and before the blind being broken, a "best dose week" for each subject was determined. The primary outcome measure was the total score on the parent-completed ADHD Rating Scale-IV.

Results

Sixteen patients, with a mean age of 10.43 (SD 3.14) years completed the trial. Lower scores during best dose treatment compared to the week of placebo treatment were found on the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (p < .05), suggesting a therapeutic benefit. A large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.90) was found for methylphenidate. Treatment was generally well tolerated.

Conclusions

Euthymic youths with bipolar disorder and ADHD may benefit from short-term concomitant treatment with methylphenidate.

### Dose titration of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^115Fzmuq]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

MPH comes in immediate release (IR) and extended release (ER) formulations, and ER MPH has become increasingly dominant in recent years. Osmotic release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH, Concerta®; Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc) is an ER-MPH tablet that should be swallowed whole. Due to its once-daily dosing and equivalent effectiveness to other MPH formulations, OROS-MPH has been quickly and widely accepted as the preferred treatment for ADHD in Western countries. In addition, OROS-MPH was the only approved psychostimulant for ADHD indication in Japan until 2019.

MPH should be initiated at a low dose, especially in children due to their slower drug metabolism and variable drug responses. Upward dose titration is recommended to achieve a target dose that optimises effectiveness and minimises side-effects. According to OROS-MPH drug labels in the US and Japan, patients with ADHD younger than 18 years old are recommended to initiate treatment at 18 mg/day, and increase the daily dose in 9 or 18 mg increments when titration is needed. These recommendations derive primarily from clinical trials, however, evidence reflecting the titration strategies for OROS-MPH in real-world settings is limited. To fill this gap, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in children and adolescents with ADHD using two claims databases from the US and Japan, where OROS-MPH has been used for long times and extensive drug utilization experience has been accumulated. We aimed specially to describe OROS-MPH consumption and titration patterns in these two countries and to provide real-world evidence to support clinical decision making.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (methylphenidate hydrochloride CD) [^111ccJok]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

Methylphenidate HCl is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. The mode of therapeutic action in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not known. Methylphenidate is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space. Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d- and l-threo enantiomers. The d-threo enantiomer is more pharmacologically active than the l-threo enantiomer.

Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of the Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD methylphenidate hydrochloride formulation have been studied in healthy adult volunteers and in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Absorption And Distribution

Methylphenidate is readily absorbed. Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD has a plasma/time concentration profile showing two phases of drug release with a sharp, initial slope similar to a methylphenidate immediate-release tablet, and a second rising portion approximately three hours later, followed by a gradual decline. (See Figure 1 below.)

Comparison Of Immediate Release (IR) And Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD Formulations After Repeated Doses Of Methylphenidate HCl In Children With ADHD

Methylphenidate HCl Extended-Release Capsules CD was administered as repeated once-daily doses of 20 mg or 40 mg to children aged 7–12 years with ADHD for one week. After a dose of 20 mg, the mean (± SD) early Cmaxwas 8.6 (± 2.2) ng/mL, the later Cmaxwas 10.9 (± 3.9)1ng/mL and AUC0–9hwas 63.0 (± 16.8) ng∙h/mL. The corresponding values after a 40 mg dose were 16.8 (± 5.1) ng/mL, 15.1 (± 5.8)1ng/mL and 120 (± 39.6) ng∙h/mL, respectively. The early peak concentrations (median) were reached about 1.5 hours after dose intake, and the second peak concentrations (median) were reached about 4.5 hours after dose intake. The means for Cmaxand AUC following a dose of 20 mg were slightly lower than those seen with 10 mg of the immediate-release formulation, dosed at 0 and 4 hours.

### Methylphenidate dosage for children with ADHD over time under controlled conditions: lessons from the MTA [^113NjTVM]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the trajectory of methylphenidate (MPH) dosage over time, following a controlled titration, and to ascertain how accurately the titration was able to predict effective long-term treatment in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Using the 14-month-treatment database of the NIMH Collaborative Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA), the outcome of the initial placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized daily switch titration of MPH was compared with the subsequent maintenance pharmacotherapy. Children received monthly monitoring visits and, when needed, medication adjustments.

Results

Of the 198 children for whom MPH was the optimal treatment at titration (mean ± SD dose: 30.5 ± 14.2 mg/day), 88% were still taking MPH at the end of maintenance (mean dose 34.4 ± 13.3 mg/day). Titration-determined dose and end-of-maintenance dose were significantly correlated (r = 0.52–0.68). Children receiving combined pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatment ended maintenance on a lower dose (31.1 ± 11.7 mg/day) than did children receiving pharmacotherapy only (38.1 ± 14.2 mg/day). Of the 230 children for whom titration identified an optimal treatment, 17% continued both the assigned medication and dosage throughout maintenance. The mean number of pharmacological changes per child was 2.8 ± 1.8 (SD), and time to first change was 4.7 months ± 0.3 (SE).

Conclusions

For most children, initial titration found a dose of MPH in the general range of the effective maintenance dose, but did not prevent the need for subsequent maintenance adjustments. For optimal pharmacological treatment of ADHD, both careful initial titration and ongoing medication management are needed.

### Extended-release methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults [^112tnJo1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis increasingly used in adults. The recommended first-line pharmacological treatment is central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, such as methylphenidate, but uncertainty remains about its benefits and harms.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of extended-release formulations of methylphenidate in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases and four clinical trial registries up to February 2021. We searched 12 drug regulatory databases for clinical trial data up to 13 May 2020. In addition, we cross-referenced all available trial identifiers, handsearched reference lists, searched pharmaceutical company databases, and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind, parallel-group trials comparing extended-release methylphenidate formulations at any dose versus placebo and other ADHD medications in adults diagnosed with ADHD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. We assessed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs), and rating scales and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We meta-analysed the data using a random-effects model. We assessed three design characteristics that may impair the trial results' 'generalisability'; exclusion of participants with psychiatric comorbidity; responder selection based on previous experience with CNS stimulants; and risk of withdrawal effects. Our prespecified primary outcomes were functional outcomes, self-rated ADHD symptoms, and serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes included quality of life, ADHD symptoms rated by investigators and by peers such as family members, cardiovascular variables, severe psychiatric adverse events, and other adverse events.

Main Results

We included 24 trials (5066 participants), of which 21 reported outcome data for this review. We also identified one ongoing study. We included documents from six drug regulatory agencies covering eight trials. Twenty-one trials had an outpatient setting and three were conducted in prisons. They were primarily conducted in North America and Europe. The median participant age was 36 years. Twelve trials (76% of participants) were industry-sponsored, four (14% of participants) were publicly funded with industry involvement, seven (10% of participants) were publicly funded, and one had unclear funding. The median trial duration was eight weeks. One trial was rated at overall unclear risk of bias and 20 trials were rated at overall high risk of bias, primarily due to unclear blinding of participants and investigators, attrition bias, and selective outcome reporting. All trials were impaired in at least one of the three design characteristics related to 'generalisability'; for example, they excluded participants with psychiatric comorbidity such as depression or anxiety, or included participants only with a previous positive response to methylphenidate, or similar drugs. This may limit the trials' usefulness for clinical practice, as they may overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms. Extended-release methylphenidate versus placebo (up to 26 weeks) For the primary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' at 13-week follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.15 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.11 to 1.81; 1 trial, 409 participants) or serious adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, CI 95% CI 0.85 to 2.43; 14 trials, 4078 participants), whereas methylphenidate improved self-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.30; 16 trials, 3799 participants). For secondary outcomes, we found very low-certainty evidence that methylphenidate improved self-rated quality of life (small effect; SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 6 trials, 1888 participants), investigator-rated ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.36; 18 trials, 4183 participants), ADHD symptoms rated by peers such as family members (small-to-moderate effect; SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.14; 3 trials, 1005 participants), and increased the risk of experiencing any adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.37; 14 trials, 4214 participants). We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, primarily due to high risk of bias and 'indirectness of the evidence'. One trial (419 participants) had follow-up at 52 weeks and two trials (314 participants) included active comparators, hence long-term and comparative evidence is limited.

Authors' Conclusions

We found very low-certainty evidence that extended-release methylphenidate compared to placebo improved ADHD symptoms (small-to-moderate effects) measured on rating scales reported by participants, investigators, and peers such as family members. Methylphenidate had no effect on 'days missed at work' or serious adverse events, the effect on quality of life was small, and it increased the risk of several adverse effects. We rated the certainty of the evidence as 'very low' for all outcomes, due to high risk of bias, short trial durations, and limitations to the generalisability of the results. The benefits and harms of extended-release methylphenidate therefore remain uncertain.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Relexxii) [^115HF5X8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 5 demonstrated the effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the treatment of ADHD in adults aged 18 to 65 years at doses from 36 mg once daily to 108 mg once daily based on the change from baseline to final study visit on the Adult ADHD Investigator Rating Scale (AISRS). Of 226 patients who entered the 7-week trial, 110 were randomized to methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 116 were randomized to placebo. Treatment was initiated at 36 mg once daily and patients continued with incremental increases of 18 mg once daily (36 mg to 108 mg once daily) based on meeting specific improvement criteria with acceptable tolerability. At the final study visit, mean change scores (LS Mean, SEM) for the investigator rating on the AISRS demonstrated methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets was statistically significantly superior to placebo.

Study 6 was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-response study (5-week duration) with 3 fixed-dose groups (18 mg, 36 mg, and 72 mg). Patients were randomized to receive methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets administered at doses of 18 mg (n = 101), 36 mg (n = 102), 72 mg once daily (n = 102), or placebo (n = 96). All three doses of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets were statistically significantly more effective than placebo in improving CAARS (Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale) total scores at double-blind end point in adult subjects with ADHD.

### Dose titration of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^115EjQiz]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This retrospective cohort study described OROS-MPH treatment and titration patterns among child and adolescent populations with ADHD in the US and Japan covering study periods of 20 and 12 years respectively. Overall, 160,975 individuals in the US cohort and 6103 individuals in Japanese cohort were included.

Although the US and Japanese cohorts were similar in terms of age and gender, patients' ADHD medication experiences prior to commencing OROS-MPH were markedly different, reflecting drug availability in each country. In the US, generic MPH had been widely used before OROS-MPH availability, however, no psychostimulants were approved for ADHD indications in Japan until the approval of OROS-MPH in 2007. Baseline MPH use affects OROS-MPH initial dose. Drug switching from IR to ER MPH (including OROS-MPH) were observed among prevalent MPH users. The approved labels for OROS-MPH in both countries recommend that patients already receiving MPH initiate OROS-MPH based on current dose regimen and clinical judgment. A study of 6–18 years old patients who switched from IR to OROS-MPH reported that higher than equivalent doses of OROS-MPH might be needed for successful drug switching. This is consistent with our observation of a higher starting OROS-MPH dose in children and adolescents who had previous MPH exposure versus MPH-naïve patients.

### Dose titration of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^115HdVMA]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Osmotic release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) is one of the most commonly used medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), however, real-world knowledge on OROS-MPH dose titration has been limited. This study aims to summarize and visualise the OROS-MPH titration patterns in children and adolescents with ADHD in the United States (US) and Japan.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study used the US IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Claims and Encounters database from 2000 to 2019 and the Japan Medical Data Centre database from 2008 to 2019. New OROS-MPH users with ADHD were identified and split into child (6 to < 13 years) and adolescent (13 to < 18 years) groups according to age at OROS-MPH initiation/reinitiation. Patient characteristics and OROS-MPH treatment patterns were described. OROS-MPH dose titration pathways were visualised by Sankey diagrams.

Results

We included 98,973 children and 62,002 adolescents in the US cohort, and 4595 children and 1508 adolescents in the Japanese cohort. In Japanese cohort, 91.9% of children and 77.9% of adolescents initiated OROS-MPH at the lowest dose (18 mg/day), whereas US patients had a broader distribution of initial doses (e.g. 18–54 mg/day). The US patients had higher daily dose of OROS-MPH than Japanese patients. Overall, a minority (< 40%) of the OROS-MPH users underwent dose titration, and different titration patterns were observed between the US and Japanese patients.

Conclusions

Different treatment and titration patterns of OROS-MPH were observed in the two countries. Additional real-world studies about clinical reasoning underlying dose selection are needed to support clinical decision-making.

### Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Relexxii) [^116JhLCi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of RELEXXII for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years) and adult patients is based upon adequate and well-controlled studies of another formulation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (referred to as "methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets" in the section below). The results of these adequate and well-controlled studies are presented below.

Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets was demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years and two double-blind placebo-controlled studies in adults who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4thedition (DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD.

Pediatric Patients 6 to 12 Years

Three double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 416 pediatric patients 6 to 12 years. The controlled studies compared methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets given once daily (18 mg, 36 mg, or 54 mg), methylphenidate given three times daily over 12 hours (15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg total daily dose), and placebo in two single-center, 3-week crossover studies (Studies 1 and 2) and in a multicenter, 4-week, parallel-group comparison (Study 3). The primary comparison of interest in all three trials was methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets versus placebo.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^111ENR7f]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics ADHD guideline — preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age): For preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age), the primary care clinician should prescribe evidence-based parent- and/or teacher-administered behavior therapy as the first line of treatment (quality of evidence A/strong recommendation) and may prescribe methylphenidate if the behavior interventions do not provide significant improvement and there is moderate-to-severe continuing disturbance in the child's function. In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication at an early age against the harm of delaying diagnosis and treatment (quality of evidence B/recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality: A for behavior; B for methylphenidate. Harms/risks/costs: Both therapies increase the cost of care, and behavior therapy requires a higher level of family involvement, whereas methylphenidate has some potential adverse effects. Benefits-harms assessment: Given the risks of untreated ADHD, the benefits outweigh the risks. Role of patient preferences: Family preference is essential in determining the treatment plan. Strength: strong recommendation.

2.1 Pretreatment Screening

Prior to initiating treatment with central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA), assess for the presence of cardiac disease (i.e., perform a careful history, including family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical examination) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Maintain careful prescription records, educate patients about abuse, monitor for signs of abuse and overdose, and periodically reevaluate the need for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) use [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)].

2.2 General Dosing Information

The recommended starting dose for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) is 20 mg once daily. Increase dosage gradually, in increments of 10 mg weekly. Daily dosage above 60 mg is not recommended. When a lower initial dose is appropriate, patients may begin treatment with 10 mg.

Administer methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) orally once daily in the morning. Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) may be swallowed as whole capsules or may be administered by sprinkling the capsule contents on a small amount of applesauce (see specific instructions below). Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) and/or their contents should not be crushed, chewed, or divided.

The capsules may be carefully opened and the beads sprinkled over a spoonful of applesauce. The applesauce should not be warm because it could affect the modified release properties of this formulation. The mixture of drug and applesauce should be consumed immediately in its entirety. The drug and applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use.

Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods. Periodically reevaluate the long-term use of methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets and methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets, and adjust dosage as needed.

2.3 Patients Currently Using Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Tablets or Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets

The recommended dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) for patients currently taking methylphenidate hydrochloride tablets twice daily or methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (SR) is provided below.

### Methylphenidate for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: cochrane systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of randomised clinical trials [^115gwqov]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Results

We identified 14 431 records. After removal of duplicates and irrelevant references we retrieved 1461 publications in full text for assessment of eligibility. Overall we excluded 691 publications for not meeting the inclusion criteria and eight because they were classified as either awaiting classification or as ongoing studies. In this review we included the remaining 761 publications (69 in non-English languages) describing 185 randomised clinical trials and 243 non-randomised studies (fig 1). When information to assess eligibility or bias was missing or data were missing or unclear we contacted the authors of the studies. Authors of 161 trials were contacted up to two times and answers were received for 92 trials.

Fig 1 Flow of studies through review

Of the 185 randomised clinical trials, 38 were parallel group (n = 5111 participants) and 147 were crossover (n = 7134 participants) trials, with a total of 12 245 participants. Participants of both sexes were included. Participants were aged between 3 and 18 years, but two trials included a small number of participants aged 19 to 21 years. The mean age was 9.7 years. The majority of these trials were conducted in high income countries. The median duration of treatment in the parallel group trials was 49 days (range 1–425 days, mean 75 days) and in the crossover trials was 14 days (1–56 days, mean 16 days). No parallel group trials and only six crossover trials (3.2%, 285 participants) seemed to have low risk of bias in all domains, and accordingly 179 (96.8%) trials were considered high risk of bias trials. By using GRADE, we rated the quality of evidence as being very low for all outcomes.

### Methylphenidate for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder [^111mt4Kk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) frequently present with inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, which are the cardinal symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The effectiveness of methylphenidate, a commonly used ADHD treatment, is therefore of interest in these children.

Objectives

To assess the effects of methylphenidate for symptoms of ADHD (inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity) and ASD (impairments in social interaction and communication, and repetitive, restricted or stereotypical behaviours) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years with ASD.

Search Methods

In November 2016, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, 11 other databases and two trials registers. We also checked reference lists and contacted study authors and pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of methylphenidate versus placebo on the core symptoms of ASD or ADHD-like symptoms, or both, in children aged 6 to 18 years who were diagnosed with ASD or pervasive developmental disorder. The primary outcome was clinical efficacy, defined as an improvement in ADHD-like symptoms (inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity) and in the core symptoms of ASD (impaired social interaction, impaired communication, and stereotypical behaviours), and overall ASD. Secondary outcomes examined were: rate of adverse events; caregiver well-being; need for institutionalisation, special schooling or therapy to achieve learning outcomes; and overall quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We combined outcome measures that used different psychometric scales, where clinically appropriate. We used a coefficient of 0.6 to calculate standard deviations and adjust for the studies' cross-over design. We considered a standardised mean difference (SMD) of 0.52 as the minimum clinically relevant inter-treatment difference. We applied the GRADE rating for strength of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

The studies: we included four cross-over studies, with a total of 113 children aged 5 to 13 years, most of whom (83%) were boys. We included two studies with five-year-old children since we were unable to obtain the disaggregated data for those aged six years and above, and all other participants were in our target age range. All participants resided in the United States. The duration of treatment in the cross-over phase was one week for each dose of methylphenidate. Studies used a range of outcome scales, rated by parents, teachers or both; clinicians; or programme staff. We report parent-rated outcomes separately. Risk of bias: we considered three trials to be at high risk of bias due to selective reporting and all trials to be at unclear risk of bias for blinding of participants and assessors, due to the potential for recognising the side effects of methylphenidate. We judged all trials to be at low or unclear risk of bias for other items. Primary outcomes: the meta-analysis suggested that high-dose methylphenidate (0.43 mg/kg/dose to 0.60 mg/kg/dose) had a significant and clinically relevant benefit on hyperactivity, as rated by teachers (SMD -0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.13 to -0.43; 4 studies, 73 participants; P < 0.001; low-quality evidence) and parents (mean difference (MD) -6.61 points, 95% CI -12.19 to -1.03, rated on the hyperactivity subscale of the Aberrant Behviour Checklist, range 0 to 48; 2 studies, 71 participants; P = 0.02; low-quality evidence). Meta-analysis also showed a significant but not clinically relevant benefit on teacher-rated inattention (MD -2.72 points, 95% CI -5.37 to -0.06, rated on the inattention subscale of the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham, Fourth Version questionnaire, range 0 to 27; 2 studies, 51 participants; P = 0.04; low-quality evidence). There were inadequate data to conduct a meta-analysis on the symptom of impulsivity. There was no evidence that methylphenidate worsens the core symptoms of ASD or benefits social interaction (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.05; 3 studies, 63 participants; P = 0.07; very low-quality evidence), stereotypical behaviours (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.84 to 0.17; 3 studies, 69 participants; P = 0.19; low-quality evidence), or overall ASD (SMD -0.53, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.19; 2 studies, 36 participants; P = 0.15; low-quality evidence), as rated by teachers. There were inadequate data to conduct a meta-analysis on the symptom of impaired communication.

Secondary Outcomes

no data were available for the secondary outcomes of caregiver well-being; need for institutionalisation, special schooling options or therapy to achieve learning outcomes; or overall quality of life. No trials reported serious adverse events. The only adverse effect that was significantly more likely with treatment was reduced appetite as rated by parents (risk ratio 8.28, 95% CI 2.57 to 26.73; 2 studies, 74 participants; P < 0.001; very low-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis by dose did not identify any significant differences in effect on our primary outcomes between low-, medium- or high-dose ranges.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that short-term use of methylphenidate might improve symptoms of hyperactivity and possibly inattention in children with ASD who are tolerant of the medication, although the low quality of evidence means that we cannot be certain of the true magnitude of any effect. There was no evidence that methylphenidate has a negative impact on the core symptoms of ASD, or that it improves social interaction, stereotypical behaviours, or overall ASD. The evidence for adverse events is of very low quality because trials were short and excluded children intolerant of methylphenidate in the test-dose phase. Future RCTs should consider extending the duration of treatment and follow-up. The minimum clinically important difference also needs to be confirmed in children with ASD using outcome scales validated for this population.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The clinical program for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) consisted of 6 studies: 2 controlled clinical studies conducted in children with ADHD aged 6 to 12 years and 4 clinical pharmacology studies conducted in healthy adult volunteers. These studies included a total of 256 subjects; 195 children with ADHD and 61 healthy adult volunteers. The subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) in doses of 10 to 40 mg per day. Safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) was assessed by evaluating frequency and nature of adverse events, routine laboratory tests, vital signs, and body weight. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) in children with ADHD aged 6 to 12 years. All subjects received methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) for up to 4 weeks, and had their dose optimally adjusted, prior to entering the double-blind phase of the trial. In the 2-week double-blind treatment phase of this study, patients received either placebo or methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) at their individually-titrated dose (range, 10 to 40 mg).

Adverse reactions with an incidence greater than 5% during the initial 4-week single-blind methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) titration period of this study were headache, insomnia, upper abdominal pain, appetite decreased, and anorexia.

Adverse reactions with an incidence greater than 2% among methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release capsules (LA) -treated subjects, during the 2-week double-blind phase of the clinical study, are shown in Table 2:

Japanese adolescent group

In the Japanese adolescent group (Fig. 2 d & Supplementary Table 4), 578 patients underwent dose titration, of whom 87.7% increased initial dose and 12.3% decreased initial dose. In this population, 79.1% (457/578) initiated OROS-MPH at 18 mg/day, among which 82.3% (376/457) increased to 27 mg/day. At the second dose level, 58.1% (336/578) of patients further titrated to a third dose level, of whom 49.4% had a dose increase and 50.6% had a dose decrease. And at the third dose level, 61.3% (206/336) of patients had further dose titration, of whom 62.1% had a dose increase and 37.9% had a dose decrease. Among the patients at a second or third dose level of 27 or 36 mg/day, a similar proportion of patients further titrated upwards or downwards. Patients at a dose level of ≥ 45 mg/day were more likely to reduce the daily dose than increase it.

Sensitivity analyses

In the US cohort, 75,407 children and 49,087 adolescents were MPH-naïve, among which 57.8% of children and 32.9% of adolescents initiated OROS-MPH from the lowest dose (18 mg/day). However, among the patients who were not MPH-native, only 35.7% of children and 19.3% of adolescents initiated OROS-MPH from 18 mg/day. On the other hand, among MPH-naive patients, 31.7% of children and 19.4% of adolescents underwent OROS-MPH dose titration, and their titration pathways were similar to the original populations. Sankey diagrams for sensitivity analyses of MPH-naive children and adolescents in the US cohort were shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a &1b (Additional file 1) respectively, derived from data in Supplementary Table 5 & 6 (Additional file 1).

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children, adolescents, and adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111856Kf]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterised by age-inappropriate and impairing levels of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity, or a combination. It is estimated to affect around 5% of school-age children (aged ≤ 18 years)and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Annual incremental costs for ADHD have been estimated at US$143–266 billion in the United Statesand are substantial in other countries. Available pharmacological treatments for ADHD include psychostimulants (eg, methylphenidate and amphetamines) and non-psychostimulant medications (eg, atomoxetine and α2-agonists). In the past few decades, prescriptions for ADHD drugs have increased significantly both in the United Statesand other countries. However, even though recommended in clinical guidelines, the efficacy and safety of ADHD medications remains controversial. Furthermore, current guidelines are inconsistent in their treatment recommendations. Although some guidelines rank methylphenidate over amphetamines (eg, in children), others recommend psychostimulants as first-line treatment without any distinction between methylphenidate and amphetamines being made. Additionally, the non-psychostimulant atomoxetine is variously recommended by available guidelines as third-line, second-line, and potentially first-line treatment. The methods used for sequencing these recommendations are not always specified and most commonly — including the 2018 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines — incorporate national drug licencing regulatory approval and cost-effectiveness with expert opinion in conjunction with the few head-to-head comparisons that are available.

### Dose titration of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^117LXnGA]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Over 90% of patients in our study initiated OROS-MPH as monotherapy, especially for the US cohort in which the proportion of monotherapy was as high as 97%, which is in line with recommendations from major ADHD clinical guidelines. In the Japanese cohort, the percentage of patients receiving combination therapy was 8–10%, and nearly 100% (508/510) of these patients received concomitant non-psychostimulants. Combination of psychostimulant and non-psychostimulant might be considered to improve effectiveness of single psychostimulant therapy or when psychostimulant use was limited by side effects, however, published evidence was still limited.

We observed difference in the treatment patterns employed in the US and Japanese cohorts. In this study, US children and adolescents generally received higher average daily doses of OROS-MPH than the equivalent age groups in Japan. Contributing factors could include previous MPH exposure amongst US patients for which higher OROS-MPH doses are recommended; a higher level of clinical experience using MPH amongst US clinicians versus Japanese clinicians; or higher body weights in US versus Japanese children and adolescents. Body weight is one of the determinants of drug dose and higher body weight has been associated with better tolerability of high MPH doses. Additionally, MPH had been regulated by a third-party committee in Japan since 2008, which could lead to stricter dose control of OROS-MPH in Japan.

In our study populations, the maximum daily dose in the US cohort was higher than the Japanese cohort. Recommended maximum dose of OROS-MPH was derived from clinical trials, but has not been fully justified. The US drug label recommends an upper limit of 54 mg/day OROS-MPH for children and 72 mg/day for adolescents, while the Japanese label recommends 54 mg/day as the upper limit for both children and adolescents. In our study, we observed that the approved maximum dose was exceeded by 4.6% of children and by 11.6% of adolescents in the Japanese cohort. And in another study using the same Japanese database, the maximum dose was exceeded by 11.6% of patients aged 6–65 years. These findings indicated that overdose of OROS-MPH was not rare and there might be a positive association between age and overdose. Some authors have questioned the appropriateness of setting upper does limits, arguing that a small group of patients may benefit from higher-than-approved doses without serious adverse consequences.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Methylphenidate Transdermal System (methylphenidate transdermal system) is indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age.

Limitations of Use

The use of Methylphenidate Transdermal System is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age because they had higher plasma exposure and a higher incidence of adverse reactions (e.g., weight loss) than patients 6 years and older at the same dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Methylphenidate Transdermal System is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age. (1)

Limitations of Use

The use of Methylphenidate Transdermal System is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age because they had higher plasma exposure and a higher incidence of adverse reactions (e.g., weight loss) than patients 6 years and older at the same dosage (5.8, 8.4).

### Dose titration of osmotic release oral system methylphenidate in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a retrospective cohort study [^116dBbhq]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

According to the prescription information, the majority (> 60%) of patients in this study received OROS-MPH only at an initial dose level. In the Japanese cohort, the proportions of patients didn't undergo titration were similar in children and adolescents, whereas, in the US cohort, more adolescents didn't undergo dose titration than children. Among these patients without dose titration, approximately 30% had only one OROS-MPH prescription. ADHD patients who failed to file a second medication prescription could be defined as early cessation of therapy indicating intolerable side-effects. On the other hand, the other 70% of patients without dose titration had two or more prescriptions at the initial dose level, which might indicate acceptable treatment response at this dose level without requiring dose adjustments.

OROS-MPH titration patterns were different between the US and Japanese cohorts in real-world settings. Compared with patients in the US cohort, Japanese patients had more numbers of dose titration, with 14% of Japanese children and adolescents having at least three titrations, versus 9.5% of children and 4.3% of adolescents in the US cohort. Most Japanese patients initiated OROS-MPH at the lowest dose (18 mg/day), whereas US children had a broader distribution of initial doses (18, 27, 36 and 54 mg/day). From the initial to the second dose level, patients in both countries tended to titrate upwards. Form the second to the third dose level, however, different titration trends were observed. US patients at a second dose level of 27 or 36 mg/day tended to continue increasing their dose, whereas a half of Japanese patients at a second dose level of 27 mg/day decreased their dose back to 18 mg/day. US patients most often maintained OROS-MPH at 36 mg/day, versus 18 mg/day for Japanese patients. Results from the sensitivity analyses indicated that prior generic MPH experience didn't influence OROS-MPH titration patterns, although it could affect the initial OROS-MPH dose.

### Methylphenidate and the risk of psychosis in adolescents and young adults: a population-based cohort study [^112D5XXm]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Given these reports of treatment-emergent psychotic events with central stimulant medication, clinicians have been concerned that methylphenidate and other psychostimulants might provoke psychosis. Some clinicians even consider the use of stimulant ADHD medication to be contraindicated in patients with a history of psychosis. The clinical challenge of managing the potential risk of central stimulant treatment-emergent psychosis in patients with ADHD, and especially in those patients with history of a psychosis, has become more pressing with the increasing recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in later adolescence and early adult life. Clinicians face a therapeutic dilemma without clear evidence to guide them when balancing the potential risk of psychotic events with the benefits of stimulants that are the first-line treatment for ADHD in adolescent and adult patients. Therapeutic uncertainty is greatest in patients with a history of psychosis who, theoretically, are assumed to be at greatest risk of stimulant treatment-emergent psychotic eventsbut who are also typically excluded from randomised clinical trials of ADHD medication.

Some observational studies, that report an increased risk of psychotic events associated with methylphenidate might be affected by confounding by indication; that is, patients who receive stimulant medication for ADHD are inherently different from those who do not and could have a greater risk of psychotic events independently of stimulant prescription. In a 2016 study that adjusted for confounding by indication, Man and colleaguesused a within-individual case series design in a population of children and adolescents in Hong Kong, and they found no increased risk of psychotic events during methylphenidate treatment.

However, a Cochrane systematic review, of ten randomised controlled trials (comprising 1103 participants) and 17 non-randomised studies (comprising 76 237 participants) was unable to confirm or refute whether methylphenidate increases the risk of psychotic symptoms in children and adolescents with ADHD.

The aim of our pharmacovigilance study was twofold: first, we aimed to examine the risk of psychotic events immediately after initiation of methylphenidate treatment in adolescents and young adults with and without a previously diagnosed psychotic disorder. Second, we aimed to examine the longer term outcomes of methylphenidate exposure 1 year after treatment initiation on the risk of psychosis.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^113oaxn7]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Medication management and dosing for ADHD

Whether a stimulant or a non-stimulant should be the first-line pharmacotherapy approach for managing ADHD in ASD depends on the profile of the individual patient. Methylphenidate (MPH) and amphetamine (AMP) are the first-line treatments for ADHD in typically developing children and adolescents. Clinicians can choose from among a variety of immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (ER) formulations of MPH and AMP.

Non-stimulants such as α 2 -adrenergic agonists may be preferable for patients with any of the following: significant behavioral or emotional dysregulation beyond ADHD symptoms, anxiety, sleep disturbance, tics, or medical contraindications such as cardiovascular disease or low body weight that stimulants could exacerbate. Although FDA labeling on stimulants warns of their association with the onset or worsening of tics, a 2015 meta-analysis did not substantiate this relationship. Nonetheless, α 2- adrenergic agonists, which are a first-line treatment for tics, may be preferred for patients with ADHD and co-occuring tic disorders.

Weight was decreased significantly by amphetamines (in children and adolescents, SMD −0.71, 95% CI −1.15 to −0.27; in adults, −0.60, −1.03 to −0.18), methylphenidate (in children and adolescents, −0.77, −1.09 to −0.45; in adults, −0.74, −1.20 to −0.28), atomoxetine (in children and adolescents, −0.84, −1.16 to −0.52), and modafinil (in children and adolescents, −0.93, −1.59 to −0.26), compared with placebo (appendix pp 476, 477). Systolic blood pressure was increased with use of amphetamines (SMD 0.09, 95% CI 0.01–0.18) and atomoxetine (0.12, 0.02–0.22) in children and adolescents, and with use of methylphenidate (0.17, 0.05–0.30) in adults, compared with placebo (appendix p 477). Use of amphetamines (0.21, 0.12–0.31), atomoxetine (0.28, 0.18–0.37), and methylphenidate (0.24, 0.14–0.33) in children and adults, and atomoxetine (0.19, 0.08–0.30) and methylphenidate (0.20, 0.08–0.32) in adults, significantly increased diastolic blood pressure compared with placebo (appendix p 478).

For acceptability, compared with placebo, methylphenidate (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.91) in children and adolescents and amphetamines (0.68, 0.49–0.95) in adults were significantly better (appendix p 478).

In subgroup and sensitivity analyses, data were sufficient to assess the effect of study length, comorbidities, IQ, crossover design, unfair dose comparisons, and data imputation. Findings of these analyses were generally robust (appendix pp 479–91). Because of a paucity of data, we could not assess the effect of gender, age (children vs adolescents), low risk of bias, medication status, and industry sponsorship. Sensitivity analyses investigating the effect of different maximum doses confirmed the results of the primary dose analysis (appendix pp 492–575).

### Continued benefits of methylphenidate in ADHD after 2 years in clinical practice: a randomized placebo-controlled discontinuation study [^116nnCBB]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The benefits of long-term use of methylphenidate treatment in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), as frequently prescribed in clinical practice, are unclear. The authors investigated whether methylphenidate remains beneficial after 2 years of use.

Methods

Ninety-four children and adolescents (ages 8–18 years) who had been treated in regular care with methylphenidate for more than 2 years were randomly assigned to double-blind continuation of treatment for 7 weeks (36 or 54 mg/day of extended-release methylphenidate) or gradual withdrawal over 3 weeks, to 4 weeks of placebo. The primary outcome measure was the investigator-rated ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS); secondary outcome measures were the investigator-rated Clinical Global Impressions improvement scale (CGI-I) and the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CTRS-R:S). Continuous ratings were analyzed with mixed model for repeated measures analyses, and the CGI-I with a chi-square test.

Results

The mean ADHD-RS scores at baseline for the continuation and discontinuation groups, respectively, were 21.4 (SD = 9.7) and 19.6 (SD = 8.9); after 7 weeks, the mean scores were 21.9 (SD = 10.8) and 24.7 (SD = 11.4), with a significant between-group difference in change over time of -4.6 (95% CI = -8.7, -0.56) in favor of the group that continued methylphenidate treatment. The ADHD-RS inattention subscale and the CTRS-R:S ADHD index and hyperactivity subscale also deteriorated significantly more in the discontinuation group. The CGI-I indicated worsening in 40.4% of the discontinuation group, compared with 15.9% of the continuation group.

Conclusions

Continued treatment with methylphenidate remains effective after long-term use. Some individual patients may, however, be withdrawn from methylphenidate without deterioration. This finding supports guideline recommendations that patients be assessed periodically to determine whether there is a continued need for methylphenidate treatment.

Amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use disorder — methylphenidate (MPH) formulations: For patients with ATS use disorder, clinicians can consider prescribing a long-acting MPH formulation to promote reduced use of ATS (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians can give long-acting MPH formulations additional consideration for patients with moderate or higher frequency of ATS use at treatment start (ie, 10 or more days per month; Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Clinicians can give long-acting MPH formulations additional consideration for patients with co-occurring ADHD, as these medications can also reduce ADHD symptoms (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). When prescribing a long-acting MPH formulation, clinicians can consider dosing at or above the maximum dose approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD to effectively reduce ATS use (Low certainty, Weak Recommendation).

Figure 3: Laboratory School Teacher SKAMP Ratings: Mean (SEM) of Combined Attention (Studies 1 and 2)

Pediatric Patients 13 to 17 years

In a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (Study 4) involving 177 patients, methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets was demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients aged 13 to 18 years at doses up to 72 mg once daily (1.4 mg/kg/day). Of 220 patients who entered an open 4-week titration phase, 177 were titrated to an individualized dose (maximum of 72 mg once daily) based on meeting specific improvement criteria on the ADHD Rating Scale and the Global Assessment of Effectiveness with acceptable tolerability. Patients who met these criteria were then randomized to receive either their individualized dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets (18 mg to 72 mg once daily, n = 87) or placebo (n = 90) during a two-week double-blind phase. At the end of this phase, mean scores for the investigator rating on the ADHD Rating Scale demonstrated that methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets was statistically significantly superior to placebo.

Adults

Two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 627 adults aged 18 to 65 years. The controlled studies compared methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release tablets administered once daily and placebo in a multicenter, parallel-group, 7-week dose-titration study (Study 5) (36 mg to 108 mg once daily) and in a multicenter, parallel-group, 5-week, fixed-dose study (Study 6) (18 mg, 36 mg, and 72 mg once daily).
