## Question

Mechanical valve replacement to treat anemia of chronic disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether mechanical valve replacement is an appropriate treatment for anemia of chronic disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of anemia of chronic disease, particularly CKD-related anemia. Then, I should verify the indications and consequences of mechanical valve implantation, including hemolysis and anticoagulation requirements. Next, I will examine scenarios where anemia and prosthetic valves coexist and how to manage both conditions. Finally, I need to confirm guideline-based treatment algorithms for CKD anemia and prosthesis-related hemolysis, and synthesize a clear bottom-line answer with safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm what "anemia of chronic disease" entails. In CKD, anemia arises from insufficient erythropoietin production and iron-restricted erythropoiesis, with absolute and functional iron deficiency as common contributors; the standard approach is iron repletion followed by ESA or HIF-PHI if anemia persists, not valve surgery, so I need to keep that distinction clear [^112gMnEy] [^112iouLV].

> Now, I should review what mechanical valves do to red cells. Mechanical prostheses can cause shear-related red cell injury and hemolysis; clinically overt hemolysis is uncommon with modern designs (< 1%), but subclinical hemolysis occurs in about 18–51%, implying a compensatory erythropoietic demand and potential Hb impact over time, especially if a paravalvular leak is present; breath CO studies also show shortened RBC lifespan even with normally functioning new-generation valves, reinforcing that valves are not an anemia remedy [^113NUZ49] [^116akd92].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could valve replacement ever "treat" anemia? Wait, I should verify that the indication for mechanical valves is structural valve disease, not hematologic disorders; major guidelines restrict prosthesis selection to valvular indications, and mechanical valves additionally necessitate lifelong VKA anticoagulation, which can increase bleeding risk and does not correct anemia of chronic disease, so using a mechanical valve to treat ACD would be inappropriate and potentially harmful [^111sXfY6] [^1114GvgC] [^113dva2u].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about anemia that accompanies severe aortic stenosis; could AVR improve it and confuse the issue? Let me reconsider: while anemia correlates with worse prognosis in severe AS and outcomes may improve after AVR, that scenario does not convert mechanical valve replacement into a therapy for anemia of chronic disease; rather, it treats the valve pathology while anemia requires its own evidence-based management, and prosthesis-related hemolysis remains a separate iatrogenic mechanism to monitor and address [^111RScih] [^113NUZ49].

> I will now examine best practices when CKD anemia coexists with a mechanical valve. I should confirm that iron repletion precedes ESA or HIF-PHI initiation; UKKA and KDIGO recommend correcting absolute iron deficiency (ferritin thresholds roughly > 100 mcg/L ND-CKD, > 200 mcg/L HD) and functional deficiency (TSAT > 20%) before starting ESAs or HIF-PHIs, with IV iron favored in hemodialysis and considered in ND-CKD if oral iron fails or is intolerant; this sequence reduces ESA dose needs and optimizes Hb response [^112gMnEy] [^111tr74U] [^116QRdA2] [^114RozD9].

> Next, I should review ESA and HIF-PHI specifics and monitoring. ESAs remain standard once iron replete, with Hb monitored frequently during correction and maintenance phases; HIF-PHIs such as vadadustat are noninferior to ESAs in maintaining Hb in dialysis-dependent CKD and, like ESAs, should not be started until iron deficiency is corrected to avoid hyporesponsiveness and safety issues, with ongoing surveillance for efficacy and risks [^113ubhsj] [^11529EC7] [^113M4ZFs].

> But wait, what if anemia persists despite appropriate CKD-directed therapy? I need to ensure I evaluate for prosthesis-related hemolysis: check LDH, indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, and reticulocyte count, and obtain echocardiography to assess for paravalvular leak; management ranges from supportive care and iron/ESA optimization in subclinical cases to percutaneous or surgical PVL correction when hemolysis is severe or transfusion dependent, recognizing that complete PVL elimination is often required for durable hemolysis resolution [^113vNEAk] [^116Rd1sG] [^114kXtQe].

> Let me think about anticoagulation because it intersects with bleeding and anemia. Mechanical valves require lifelong VKA therapy with INR targets based on valve position and patient risk factors, and guidelines suggest increasing INR targets or adding low-dose aspirin after thromboembolism despite therapeutic INR, while NOACs are contraindicated in mechanical valves; this reinforces that mechanical valves add bleeding risk rather than treating anemia [^111sXfY6] [^111cJ9Nv] [^111nLoCm] [^113dva2u].

> I should double-check heart failure and iron considerations common in this population. In patients with HFrEF and iron deficiency, guideline-directed IV iron improves symptoms and reduces HF hospitalizations regardless of anemia, which may be relevant in CKD patients with valvular disease; this is complementary to CKD anemia management and does not change the fact that the valve is not an anemia therapy [^116ay99v] [^114bLpfE] [^1163xTSW].

> Next, I should review safety details. I need to ensure IV iron is avoided during active infection, monitor iron indices to prevent overload, and maintain structured Hb and iron surveillance per CKD guidelines; concurrently, I should confirm anticoagulation safety strategies in mechanical valve patients, balancing thrombosis and bleeding without presuming anemia benefit from the prosthesis [^115hWtHE] [^116UMtkc] [^11529EC7].

> Synthesis and final check: Mechanical valve replacement is not a treatment for anemia of chronic disease; it treats valve pathology and may itself provoke hemolysis, while anemia of CKD requires iron repletion followed by ESA or HIF-PHI as indicated, plus targeted evaluation and correction of prosthesis-related hemolysis when present; standard mechanical valve anticoagulation must be maintained and individualized according to guideline recommendations [^113NUZ49] [^112gMnEy] [^111sXfY6].

Mechanical valve replacement is **not indicated** to treat anemia of chronic disease (ACD). ACD is managed with iron therapy, ESAs, and treating the underlying cause, not valve surgery [^112gMnEy] [^115vsUu9]. Mechanical valves can cause **hemolytic anemia** from shear stress or paravalvular leaks, potentially worsening anemia [^113NUZ49] [^112fm7RW]. Valve replacement is only considered for **severe, refractory hemolysis due to prosthetic dysfunction**, not for ACD [^114kXtQe], and **mechanical valves require lifelong anticoagulation**, increasing bleeding risk and complicating anemia management [^111sXfY6] [^113dva2u]; therefore, mechanical valve replacement is inappropriate for ACD and may worsen anemia.

---

## Pathophysiology of anemia of chronic disease

ACD is characterized by **impaired iron utilization, reduced erythropoietin production, and shortened red blood cell (RBC) lifespan** due to chronic inflammation [^116xKfSw]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Inflammatory cytokines**: Elevated IL-6 and TNF-α increase hepcidin, reducing iron availability for erythropoiesis [^116xKfSw].

- **Reduced erythropoietin**: Chronic inflammation suppresses erythropoietin production, impairing RBC production.

- **Shortened RBC lifespan**: Inflammation-induced oxidative stress and immune-mediated mechanisms shorten RBC survival [^116xKfSw].

---

## Mechanical valve replacement and anemia

Mechanical valve replacement is primarily indicated for severe valvular heart disease, not for anemia management. Mechanical valves can cause **hemolytic anemia** from shear stress, turbulence, and paravalvular leaks, which destroy RBCs and cause hemolysis [^113NUZ49] [^112fm7RW].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

No clinical evidence or guideline supports mechanical valve replacement as a treatment for **anemia of chronic disease** [^1114GvgC] [^112gMnEy]. Instead, mechanical valves are associated with an increased risk of hemolytic anemia and may exacerbate anemia in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions [^112fm7RW] [^116akd92].

---

## Risks and complications

Mechanical valve replacement carries **significant risks and complications**, particularly for anemia management:

- **Hemolytic anemia**: Mechanical valves can cause hemolysis, worsening anemia [^113NUZ49].

- **Anticoagulation therapy**: Lifelong anticoagulation is required, increasing bleeding risk and complicating anemia management [^111sXfY6].

- **Surgical risks**: Valve replacement surgery carries risks of infection, thromboembolism, and prosthetic valve dysfunction.

---

## Alternative treatments for anemia of chronic disease

Effective management of **anemia of chronic disease** involves addressing the underlying inflammatory condition and using medical therapies:

- **Iron supplementation**: Intravenous iron therapy is recommended to correct iron deficiency and improve anemia [^112xn7j2] [^115vsUu9].

- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)**: ESAs are used to stimulate RBC production, particularly in chronic kidney disease-related anemia [^112gMnEy] [^11529EC7].

- **Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs)**: Emerging oral therapies that stimulate endogenous erythropoietin production and improve iron utilization [^113ubhsj] [^112iouLV] [^114wAW69].

- **Treating underlying inflammation**: Addressing the underlying chronic inflammatory condition is essential for effective anemia management [^116xKfSw].

---

## Conclusion

Mechanical valve replacement is **not indicated** for the treatment of anemia of chronic disease. It may instead exacerbate anemia via hemolysis and complicate management because lifelong anticoagulation is required [^111sXfY6]. Effective management focuses on medical therapies, including iron supplementation, ESAs, and treating the underlying inflammatory condition [^115vsUu9].

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend not initiating ESA therapy in the presence of absolute iron deficiency. This is defined as ferritin levels less than 100 mcg/L in non-dialysis-dependent CKD and less than 200 mcg/L in dialysis-dependent CKD, or functional iron deficiency, characterized by transferrin saturation of less than 20% with normal or elevated ferritin levels, until these issues are corrected and anemia persists. It is advised to administer iron supplements prior to or when initiating ESAs.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^113NUZ49]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The incidence of hemolysis in patients with cardiac prostheses varies widely according to the device type and its indwelling time. Mechanical damage to the RBCs due to increased shear stress is the most widely accepted etiology of cardiac prosthesis-related hemolytic anemia (CPHA). However, causes of this increased shear stress are device- and disease-specific.

- **Hemolysis after open valve surgery**: Hemolytic anemia was a common complication of old generation valves, occurring in up to 15% of surgical valves in the 1960s to 1970s. However, this incidence decreased to less than 1% with modern valve designs. In a study of 301 patients who underwent On-X mechanical valve replacement, clinical hemolysis at long-term occurred in 0% and 0.2% of patients who had aortic and mitral valve replacement, respectively. Several other studies confirmed the rarity of clinical hemolysis after valve replacement with contemporary prostheses. Nonetheless, subclinical hemolysis is not uncommon, occurring in 18% to 51% and in 5% to 10% of contemporary mechanical and tissue prostheses, respectively.

The main mechanism of hemolysis after surgical valve replacement is paravalvular leak (PVL), which may result from suture dehiscence due to heavy annular calcifications, endocarditis, chronic steroids, or suboptimal surgical techniques. Other less common etiologies of hemolysis related to surgical prostheses were previously listed but are omitted here.

### Effects of preoperative intravenous erythropoietin plus iron on outcome in anemic patients after cardiac valve replacement [^114wZ1Bx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia is a risk factor for postoperative morbidity and in-hospital mortality in cardiac surgery. However, it is not known whether treatment of anemia before cardiac surgery by administering recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) plus iron improves postoperative outcomes and decreases red blood cell transfusions in these patients. In 1998, a collection of consecutive data for patients who underwent valve replacement was initiated, with the inclusion criterion being anemia. Treatment with rhEPO was administered at a dose of 500 IU/kg/day every week for 4 weeks, with the fifth dose given 48 hours before valve replacement. During each rhEPO session, patients received intravenous iron sucrose supplementation.

The intervention cohort (2006 to 2011) included 75 patients, while the observation cohort was composed of 59 patients who did not receive any treatment (1998 to 2005). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that administration of combined therapy was independently associated with decreased postoperative morbidity (odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.59, p = 0.008) and in-hospital mortality (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95, p = 0.04) after adjusting for logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation score, type of intervention, time of cardiopulmonary bypass, and year of surgery. Individually, this treatment also decreased postoperative renal failure (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88, p = 0.03). The rate of red blood cell transfusion decreased from 93% in the observation cohort to 67% in the intervention cohort, as did the days of hospitalization.

Regarding the medical management for anemia in chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning iron therapy and monitoring, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend measuring hemoglobin concentration in patients with anemia of CKD when clinically indicated, and at least at the following intervals according to the stage of CKD:

- **Stage 3–5, non-dialysis or peritoneal dialysis**: Every 3 months.
- **Stage 5, on hemodialysis**: Every month.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic heart valves, specifically in the management of thromboembolism, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend considering an increase in the INR goal from 3.0 (range 2.5–3.5) to 4.0 (range 3.5–4.0) or the addition of daily low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg). This recommendation is with an assessment of bleeding risk for patients with a mechanical mitral valve replacement who experience a stroke or systemic embolic event while in therapeutic range on VKA anticoagulation.

### Controversies in optimal anemia management: Conclusions from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^116xKfSw]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

In chronic kidney disease, anemia and disordered iron homeostasis are prevalent and associated with significant adverse consequences. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) issued an anemia guideline for managing the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Since then, new data have accrued from basic research, epidemiological studies, and randomized trials, warranting a re-examination of previous recommendations.

Therefore, in 2019, KDIGO convened two Controversies Conferences to review the latest evidence, explore new and ongoing controversies, assess change implications for the KDIGO anemia guideline, and propose a research agenda. The first conference, described here, focused on iron-related issues, including the contribution of disordered iron homeostasis to the anemia of chronic kidney disease, diagnostic challenges, available and emerging iron therapies, treatment targets, and patient outcomes. The second conference will discuss issues more specifically related to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, including epoetins, and hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors.

Here we provide a concise overview of the consensus points and controversies resulting from the first conference, and prioritize key questions that need to be answered by future research.

Positive urine hemoglobin can be attributed to various causes, including complications of mechanical cardiac valve replacement, drug-induced hemolytic anemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Other causes include paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, malaria infection, March hemoglobinuria, burn injury, snake bite, acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, sickle cell disease, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, Wilson's disease, and Clostridium haemolyticum infection. Additionally, certain medications such as quinine, artesunate, and micafungin can lead to positive urine hemoglobin.

### Erythropoietic effects of vadadustat in patients with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease [^113ubhsj]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop anemia largely because of inappropriately low erythropoietin (EPO) production and insufficient iron available to erythroid precursors. In four phase 3, randomized, open-label clinical trials involving both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD and anemia, the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, vadadustat, was noninferior to the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, darbepoetin alfa, in increasing and maintaining target hemoglobin concentrations. In these trials, vadadustat was shown to increase the concentrations of serum EPO, as well as the numbers of circulating erythrocytes and reticulocytes.

Achieved hemoglobin concentrations were similar in patients treated with either vadadustat or darbepoetin alfa. However, compared to patients receiving darbepoetin alfa, those receiving vadadustat had erythrocytes with increased mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, while the red cell distribution width was decreased. Increased serum transferrin concentrations, as measured by total iron-binding capacity, combined with stable serum iron concentrations, resulted in decreased transferrin saturation in patients randomized to vadadustat compared with those randomized to darbepoetin alfa.

The decreases in transferrin saturation were associated with relatively greater declines in serum hepcidin and ferritin in patients receiving vadadustat compared with those receiving darbepoetin alfa. These results for serum transferrin saturation, hepcidin, ferritin, and erythrocyte indices were consistent across the studies.

### Use of breath carbon monoxide to measure the influence of prosthetic heart valves on erythrocyte survival [^116akd92]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

First-generation prosthetic heart valves commonly caused sufficient red blood cell (RBC) injury to induce hemolytic anemia. Although multiple studies have shown that new-generation valves are not associated with anemia, the extent to which these valves are injurious to RBCs is not known, because RBC survival has not been measured in these subjects. Using a technique that uses breath carbon monoxide (CO) to quantify RBC turnover, this study measured RBC life span in 38 subjects with normally functioning, new-generation valves.

Erythrocyte survival averaged 98.8 ± 23 and 103 ± 15 days, respectively, in 20 subjects with mechanical valves and 18 subjects with bioprosthetic valves (p > 0.05). However, these life spans were significantly (p < 0.01) less than those of healthy subjects (122 ± 23 days) and a group of elderly subjects with osteoarthritis (128 ± 26 days). The mean hemoglobin concentrations of the two groups of valve patients were within normal limits. In conclusion, new-generation heart valves commonly are associated with a small degree of hemolysis that is compensated for by increased RBC production.

### Summary of the KDIGO guideline on anemia and comment: Reading between the (guide)line(s) [^112K6LAb]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is designed to assist healthcare providers in treating CKD patients with anemia. A guideline is not intended to define a standard of care, and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. It is intended to provide information and to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on evidence and expert judgment. Every healthcare professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in any particular clinical situation. Owing to the general nature of a guideline, it is sometimes difficult to translate it to an individual patient's condition. As the primary goal is to improve patient care, we have decided to focus on practical clinical aspects of the KDIGO anemia guideline.

### Clinical practice guidelines for anemia in chronic kidney disease: Problems and solutions. A position statement from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [^116P9nkG]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The development of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease has been instrumental in identifying and reducing variations in the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron replacement. Challenges to the effectiveness and safety of recommendations made in these guidelines were magnified when recent clinical trials showed no benefit or harm with respect to cardiovascular outcomes in subjects randomized to higher target hemoglobin levels.

To address these concerns, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened an international conference to examine the problems and shortcomings of existing anemia guidelines, which are a prime example of duplication of efforts to derive recommendations from a limited evidence base. The meeting was attended by representatives of the major guideline-developing organizations, who agreed to avoid future duplicative efforts and to save resources by generating a common evidence report. These recommendations could then be prioritized and implemented locally.

This is a report to the international nephrology community on the recommendations for and timeline of the next anemia guidelines. It has been reviewed by the conference participants and approved as a position statement by the KDIGO Board of Directors.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic heart valves, specifically in the context of managing bleeding, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend individualized treatment with oral vitamin K. This is alongside the temporary withdrawal of vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with a mechanical prosthetic valve and a supratherapeutic INR (> 5.0) who are not actively bleeding.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^112iWpEq]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning iron therapy and the route of administration, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend deciding on the route of iron administration for patients with non-dialysis CKD who require iron supplementation. This decision should be based on the severity of iron deficiency, availability of venous access, response to prior oral iron therapy, side effects with prior use of oral or IV iron therapy, patient compliance, and cost.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in intermediate- and low-risk patients [^114osG9T]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association focused guideline update on the management of patients with valvular heart disease lowered the age cutoff above which a bioprosthetic valve is reasonable to 50 years with a Class IIa recommendation. In patients under the age of 50 years, the guideline still recommends a mechanical valve unless the patient has a clear contraindication to anticoagulation.

There is nonetheless a trend toward increased use of bioprosthetic surgical valves even in patients under the age of 50 years, often driven by patient preference and desire to avoid long-term anticoagulation. Availability of newer mechanical valves that can safely be maintained with lower-dose warfarin (target INR 1.5–2.0) and low-dose aspirin may convince more patients to select a mechanical prosthesis. Conversely, patients and physicians may feel more comfortable selecting a bioprosthesis because valve‐in‐valve TAVR is now an option if a surgical bioprosthesis fails in the future. Irrespective of whether a mechanical valve or bioprosthesis is selected, aortic root enlargement surgery should be considered in patients with a small aortic annulus to prevent patient–prosthesis mismatch and facilitate TAVR valve‐in‐valve for the future.

### Long-term survival for patients with preoperative renal failure undergoing bioprosthetic or mechanical valve replacement [^114aC2tk]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess short-term and long-term outcomes after valve replacement with biologic or mechanical prostheses in patients with preoperative end-stage renal disease on chronic dialysis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing valve replacement from January 1996 through March 2008 at Emory Healthcare Hospitals was performed. Outcomes were compared using χ² tests and 2-sample t tests. Adjusted long-term survival up to 10 years was assessed with Kaplan-Meier plots and compared between biologic and mechanical replacements using the Cox proportional hazards model.

- **Results**: A total of 202 patients underwent 211 valve replacement operations. Patient age ranged from 20 to 83 years (mean age, 54.8 ± 14.0); 115 of 211 (54.5%) were male. Operations included: 100 of 211 (47.4%) isolated aortic; 49 of 211 (23.2%) isolated mitral; 4 of 211 (1.9%) isolated tricuspid; and 58 of 211 (27.5%) combined replacements. Thirteen (6.2%) patients underwent reoperative valve replacements. Most patients received bioprosthetic valves (143 of 211, 67.8%), while 68 of 211 (32.2%) received mechanical valves. Concomitant coronary artery bypass was performed in 53 of 211 (25.1%) patients. Thirty-day mortality occurred in 42 of 211 (19.9%) patients and was not different between bioprosthetic and mechanical replacements. Overall 10-year survival was 18.1% for all patients and was not influenced by valve type implanted.

- **Conclusions**: For patients with end-stage renal disease treated with dialysis, valve replacement carries significant survival implications.

### A randomized trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of vadadustat in patients with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease receiving hemodialysis [^112iouLV]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Anemia is a frequent complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and may develop early in the course of CKD. Its severity increases with the decline of renal function. Although the pathogenesis of anemia in CKD is multifactorial, a deficiency of erythropoietin (EPO) production is a predominant cause, as the kidneys are unable to secrete sufficient EPO to support erythropoiesis and maintain hemoglobin levels within normal ranges.

The standard of care for the treatment of anemia in CKD involves the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) alone or in combination with iron supplementation. However, ESAs are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and thromboembolic events and require parenteral administration and refrigeration. Thus, oral treatment modalities for anemia associated with CKD may be beneficial.

Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) are an oral treatment alternative for patients with CKD-related anemia. HIF-PHIs have been shown to stabilize HIF, a transcription factor that regulates hypoxia-sensitive genes, stimulating EPO production. This results in an increase in red blood cell (RBC) production and improved iron uptake and utilization.

Vadadustat, an orally bioavailable HIF-PHI, is approved in 37 countries globally for the treatment of CKD-related anemia in dialysis-dependent (DD) patients. It has a starting dose of 300 mg once daily, with dose titration in increments or decrements of 150 mg within the range of 150 to 600 mg to achieve or maintain hemoglobin levels within the desired range.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^114c29Qh]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 2.3 discusses the treatment of anaemia with iron therapy, specifically the route of administration.

- **Treatment recommendations**:
	- We suggest that oral iron will generally be sufficient to maintain, and may also be sufficient to attain, hemoglobin levels within targets for ESA-treated chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who are not yet requiring dialysis and in those on peritoneal dialysis (PD) (2B). For CKD patients not requiring haemodialysis, the choice between oral versus parenteral iron depends on the severity of iron deficiency, previous response and side effects, the availability of venous access, and the need to initiate ESA therapy (2A).

- **Hemodialysis patients**:
	- In contrast, most haemodialysis patients will require intravenous iron (2A).

- **Intravenous iron therapy**:
	- When offering intravenous iron therapy to people not receiving haemodialysis, consider high-dose, low-frequency IV iron as the treatment of choice for adults and young people when trying to achieve iron repletion, taking into account all of the following:
	- The availability of venous access
	- Preferences of the person with anaemia of CKD or, where appropriate, their family or carers
	- Nursing and administration costs
	- Cost of local drug supply
	- Provision of resuscitation facilities

	- Intravenous iron administered at a low dose and high frequency may be more appropriate for adults who are receiving in-centre haemodialysis.

- **Dosage considerations**:
	- High dose, low frequency (HD/LF) is considered to be a maximum of 2 infusions, with a minimum of 500 mg of iron in each infusion for adults. Low dose, high frequency (LD/HF) involves more than 2 infusions, typically with 100–200 mg of iron in each infusion for adults.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^113dva2u]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Valvular heart disease has a prevalence of 2.5% (any valve) in the United States and is equally distributed between men and women. Prosthetic heart valve replacement is recommended for many patients with severe valvular heart disease, and on average, 300,000 prosthetic heart valve replacements are performed every year worldwide, with 100,000 of these in North America. By 2050, the annual number of valve replacements is projected to be 850,000. Mechanical valves are more durable than bioprosthetic valves but typically require lifelong anticoagulation therapy. The use of VKAs provides excellent protection against thromboembolic complications in patients with mechanical heart valves, but its use is bound by the drawbacks previously described.

Although preclinical studies showed a potential role of NOACs in the presence of a mechanical valve, in the RE-ALIGN trial, dabigatran was associated with increased thromboembolic risk. Patients with severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valves were excluded from the major NOAC trials, and thus their results cannot be generalized to this distinct patient population. In vitro studies have demonstrated that dabigatran (1 μmol/L) and high-dose rivaroxaban (300 ng/mL) were as effective as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in preventing thrombus formation on mechanical heart valves. In porcine models of heterotopic mechanical valve implantation, dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been equally effective as enoxaparin in preventing thrombus formation.

### Do all hemolytic anemias that occur after mitral valve repair require surgical treatment [^1178qSqq]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

We report on a 29-year-old woman with severe hemolytic anemia following mitral valve annuloplasty. Although hemolysis due to a mechanical prosthetic mitral valve is well recognized, hemolytic anemia associated with mitral valve repair is an uncommon condition. Reoperation may be considered if the patient experiences serious and persistent anemia. Although valve replacement is suggested as a unique intervention, it may not be the solution every time because of mechanical effects. Various mechanisms of hemolysis related to mitral valve repair have been suggested, but sufficient and precise data is not available. In this case, we aim to emphasize whether all hemolytic anemias that occur after mitral valve repair require surgical treatment.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^112mXwaM]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Refractory LVAD‐related hemolysis: Intensification of antithrombotic therapy can improve or resolve hemolysis in the majority of LVAD patients. However, persistent hemolysis despite maximally tolerated anticoagulation is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of stroke and death. Hence, pump exchange through various surgical techniques (subxiphoid ± thoracotomy or redo sternotomy) should be considered early in these patients.

- **Occluder devices-induced hemolysis**: Severe hemolysis that develops or worsens after transcatheter shunt closure is often due to the residual peri-device shunt. These residual shunts can often be ameliorated with additional occluder devices and/or intra-device coil deployment within the Nitinol cage of the occluder. However, replacement of the involved prosthesis with a different device or conversion to surgical repair is often required.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, specifically related to iron therapy and iron deficiency anemia, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend considering the administration of a trial of intravenous (IV) iron. Alternatively, a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy may be considered in patients with non-dialysis CKD. This is advised for adult patients with CKD and anemia who are not currently on iron or ESA therapy if an increase in hemoglobin concentration is desired without starting ESA treatment. This approach is particularly recommended when transferrin saturation is below 30% and ferritin is less than 500 ng/mL.

Paravalvular leak (PVL) remains an uncommon but serious complication after surgical prosthetic valve implantation. PVL, when associated with congestive heart failure, hemolytic anemia, or infective endocarditis, may require percutaneous treatment. High surgical risk is common in this population. The lack of dedicated devices for PVL often limits optimal treatment options.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^113vNEAk]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The definition of hemolytic anemia does not have a single specific form. However, the diagnosis is typically established when three major criteria are present: (a) unexplained anemia, (b) signs of accelerated red blood cell (RBC) production in the bone marrow, such as a high reticulocyte count, and (c) signs of RBC destruction, including elevated unconjugated bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and low haptoglobin. The term "sub-clinical hemolysis" describes patients who meet the latter two criteria but do not have anemia. In these patients, the bone marrow compensates adequately for the hemolysis, maintaining normal hemoglobin levels. Prosthesis-related hemolytic anemia can be assumed if new hemolysis is diagnosed in patients with cardiac prostheses and/or mechanical assist devices, in the absence of other causes of hemolysis.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^117WjGeS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease provides clinicians with comprehensive evidence-based recommendations to improve patient care. In this commentary, we review these recommendations and the underlying evidence. Most recommendations are well reasoned; however, for some, the evidence is unclear, and the recommendations require some qualification.

While the KDIGO guideline stresses the potential risks of intravenous iron therapy, withholding iron might have its own risks. The recommendation to avoid hemoglobin levels falling below 9 g/dL sets a lower bound of "acceptability" that may increase blood transfusion. Given the lack of research supporting the optimal transfusion strategy for end-stage renal disease patients, it is challenging to weigh the risks and benefits of red blood cell transfusion.

We find a paucity of evidence that hemoglobin concentration targeted between 11 and 11.5 g/dL is associated with a safety risk. Although the evidence that erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use improves patient quality of life is poor, it is possible that the instruments used to measure quality of life may not be well attuned to the needs of chronic kidney disease or dialysis patients. Our last section focuses specifically on the recommendations to treat anemia in children.

### Aortic valve replacement as a trigger of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^116vqvx4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Mechanical hemolysis is a frequent but usually harmless complication of aortic valve replacement. The most common reason is valvular leakage. This report presents atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) as an alternative cause of mechanical hemolysis after this procedure. aHUS is a complement-mediated disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. It necessitates immediate specific treatment, including plasma exchange or complement inhibition, to avoid an adverse outcome. The present case identifies aortic valve replacement as a trigger of aHUS and shows that this disease must be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of hemolysis after valve surgery.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116kEQ6p]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of anaemia with iron therapy - initiation of ESA and iron status**: We suggest that ESA therapy should not be initiated in the presence of absolute iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 microgram/L) until this is corrected and anaemia persists. In patients with functional iron deficiency, iron supplements should be given prior to or when initiating ESA therapy. Low serum ferritin is a useful marker to diagnose absolute iron deficiency. Normal or high serum ferritin values (≥ 100 microgram/L) do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

- **Treatment of anaemia with iron therapy - route of administration**: We suggest that oral iron will, in general, be sufficient to maintain and may be sufficient to attain hemoglobin within targets in ESA-treated CKD patients not yet requiring dialysis and in those on peritoneal dialysis (PD). For CKD patients not requiring haemodialysis, the choice between oral versus parenteral iron depends on the severity of iron deficiency, the previous response and side effects, the availability of venous access, and the need to initiate ESA therapy. In contrast, most haemodialysis patients will require intravenous iron. When offering intravenous iron therapy to people not receiving in-centre haemodialysis, consider high dose, low frequency (HD/LF) IV iron as the treatment of choice for adults and young people when trying to achieve iron repletion, taking into account all of the following: the availability of venous access and preferences of the person with anaemia.

### Severe hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure after mitral valve repair associated with non-endothelialization of artificial chordae tendinae: Case report [^114whHoZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Mechanical hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure are rare complications of mitral valve repair.

- **Case presentation**: We report a unique case of severe hemolytic anemia and severe acute renal failure after mitral valve repair using artificial chordae tendinae. Conservative therapy, including plasmapheresis and blood transfusion, was not effective. The major cause of the mechanical hemolysis was mild mitral regurgitation originating from the center of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring. The hemolytic anemia resolved gradually after the replacement of the mitral valve. The new artificial chordae tendinae was found to be completely non-endothelialized during the surgery. Non-endothelialization of artificial chordae tendinae may also play a role in the genesis of mechanical anemia.

- **Conclusions**: The major cause of the mechanical hemolysis was mild mitral regurgitation originating from the center of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring. Non-endothelialization of foreign materials might be another mechanism of hemolysis after mitral repair.

### Choice of prosthetic heart valves: Update for the next generation [^112NDMcr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Intervention for valvular heart disease poses unique clinical challenges in cardiology because these diseases are of relatively low prevalence, the interventions do not lend themselves to randomized comparative trials, and important clinical endpoints are assessed only after decades of follow-up. In addition, continuing advances in prosthetic heart valve technology create a moving target for follow-up because long-term data, by definition, are available only for older prostheses.

Newer tissue and mechanical prostheses offer superior hemodynamics compared with their older counterparts, and data suggest that durability and patient mortality are superior with newer, compared with older, bioprostheses. Arbitrary cutoffs dictating valve choice based predominantly on patient age may not sufficiently consider individual patient perspectives.

In educating and counseling patients regarding choices in heart valve prostheses, clinicians should help the patient weigh the individual merits of projected mortality, valve durability, and the requirement for anticoagulation. This consideration should be balanced with the associated freedom from re-operation, and the risks of hemorrhagic and thromboembolic events, as well as the impact on lifestyle.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, and at least half of these cases are due to iron deficiency. With the introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade, uncertainty has arisen regarding when these compounds should be administered and under which circumstances oral therapy remains an appropriate and effective treatment.

Numerous guidelines are available, but none delve into the details of therapeutic start and end points or how iron-deficiency anemia should be optimally treated depending on the underlying cause of iron deficiency, or with reference to concomitant underlying or additional diseases.

The study points out major issues that should be considered when revising future guidelines for optimal iron replacement therapy, including how to assess the need for treatment, timing of initiation and cessation of treatment, follow-up for relapse, recommended dosages and types of therapy, and identifying patients who may not require treatment.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^112fm7RW]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiac prosthesis-related hemolytic anemia (CPHA) is a well-described but likely under-recognized phenomenon. This potentially life-threatening complication was first described in the 1950s to 1960s in patients undergoing valve replacement with early-generation surgical prostheses. The incidence of clinically evident hemolysis after surgical valve replacement has since declined due to improved valve design and surgical implantation techniques. However, interest in CPHA has recently been renewed given the increasing number of studies reporting various rates of clinical and subclinical CPHA with mechanical circulatory support devices and transcatheter valvular interventions.

Nonetheless, the management of CPHA is often challenging due to its atypical presentation, lack of standardized definitions or classifications, and the dearth of outcomes data on its various treatment strategies. We sought to provide a contemporary overview of the literature on the incidence, mechanisms, and management strategies of hemolytic anemia associated with various cardiac prostheses.

New hemolysis requiring blood transfusion occurred in 1% to 2% of patients undergoing percutaneous PVL closure in two large registries in the United Kingdom and the United States, likely due to incomplete obliteration of the PVL. Higher profile devices, such as ventricular septal occluders, are associated with more hemolysis than the lower profile Amplatzer vascular plugs. Severe hemolysis has also been reported following percutaneous closure of septal defects and peri-MitraClip regurgitation, mostly due to residual peri-device shunt.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116UMtkc]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Treatment of anaemia with ESA therapy**: We suggest that ESA doses should ideally be decreased rather than withheld when a downward adjustment of Hb level is desirable (2B).

- **Treatment of anaemia with ESA therapy during specific conditions**: We suggest that ESA administration in ESA-dependent patients should continue during acute illness, surgical procedures, or any other cause of hospitalisation, unless there is a clear contraindication, such as accelerated hypertension (2B).

- **Caution in prescribing ESA in certain CKD patient sub-groups**: We suggest exerting extreme caution while prescribing ESA therapy in CKD patients with a history of stroke or malignancy, particularly in those with active malignancy when cure is the anticipated outcome (2C).

- **Monitoring of therapy**:

	- **Monitoring of treatment - Hb during ESA therapy**: We suggest that Hb concentration should be monitored every 2–4 weeks in the correction phase and every 1–3 months for stable patients in the maintenance phase. More frequent monitoring will depend on clinical circumstances (2B).

	- **Monitoring of treatment - iron therapy**: We recommend regular monitoring of iron status (every 1–3 months) in patients receiving intravenous iron to avoid toxicity; a serum ferritin consistently greater than 800 microgram/L with no evidence of inflammation (normal CRP) may be suggestive of iron overload (1B).

	- **Monitoring during intravenous iron administration**: We recommend that resuscitative medication and personnel train.

### Effect of single recombinant human erythropoietin injection on transfusion requirements in preoperatively anemic patients undergoing valvular heart surgery [^112RNkPf]. Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

The authors investigated the effect of a single preoperative bolus of erythropoietin on perioperative transfusion requirements and erythropoiesis in patients with preoperative anemia undergoing valvular heart surgery.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, single-site, single-blinded, randomized, and parallel-arm controlled trial, 74 patients with preoperative anemia were randomly allocated to either the erythropoietin or the control group. The erythropoietin group received 500 IU/kg erythropoietin and 200 mg iron sucrose intravenously 1 day before the surgery. The control group received an equivalent volume of normal saline. The primary endpoint was transfusion requirement, assessed during the surgery and for 4 days postoperatively. Reticulocyte count and iron profiles were measured serially and compared preoperatively and on postoperative days 1, 2, 4, and 7.

- **Results**: Transfusion occurred in 32 patients (86%) of the control group versus 22 patients (59%) of the erythropoietin group (P = 0.009). The mean number of units of packed erythrocytes transfused per patient during the surgery and for 4 postoperative days (mean ± SD) was also significantly decreased in the erythropoietin group compared with the control group (3.3 ± 2.2 vs. 1.0 ± 1.1 units/patient, P = 0.001). The reticulocyte count was significantly greater in the erythropoietin group on postoperative days 4 (P = 0.001) and 7 (P = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: A single intravenous administration of erythropoietin and an iron supplement 1 day before surgery significantly reduced the perioperative transfusion requirement.

Patients in each trial were randomized 1:1 to receive Vafseo with a starting dose of 300 mg once daily, or darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously or intravenously as per the prescribing information for 52 weeks to assess the efficacy endpoints.

	- Vafseo was titrated in increments of 150 mg up to 600 mg to achieve the Hb target. After 52 weeks, patients continued study medication to assess long-term safety until the event-driven major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) endpoints were reached. Efficacy in each study was based on the difference in mean change of Hb from baseline to the primary evaluation period (Weeks 24 to 36). An additional efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean change of Hb from baseline to the secondary evaluation period (Weeks 40 to 52). MACE was defined as all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke, and was evaluated in both trials.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^117X8iNc]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia (CPHA) is an uncommon but important source of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing valve surgery, transcatheter structural heart interventions, and mechanical circulatory support device implantations. Knowledge of the incidence, etiologies, and the various treatment strategies is key for effective management of this rare but potentially life-threatening entity.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^114kXtQe]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Invasive management**: Invasive treatment is reserved for patients with severe symptomatic hemolysis despite maximal medical therapy. The specific invasive treatment differs according to the implicated cardiac prosthesis and the underlying mechanism of hemolysis.

- **Paravalvular leak repair**: The efficacy of transcatheter PVL repair in reducing heart failure symptoms and long‐term mortality has been demonstrated in multiple studies. However, the literature on the role of transcatheter PVL correction in resolving hemolysis is scarce and conflicting. For example, Ruiz et al. reported a substantial decrease in the percentage of patients who required blood transfusion or erythropoietin injections after percutaneous PVL repair, from 56% to 5%. On the contrary, in another study of 168 patients with PVL, blood transfusion requirements decreased only modestly after percutaneous repair, from 34% to 21%.

	- These inconsistencies may be related to the variable definitions of hemolysis and the degree of PVL reduction achieved. Several studies have demonstrated that effective correction of hemolysis in these patients requires complete amelioration of the PVL. Nonetheless, this can be challenging due to various patient and device-specific reasons. Indeed, up to 30% of patients undergoing percutaneous PVL repair have more than mild residual PVL following intervention, even at centers of excellence. Among patients with significant residual leaks, a small percentage will experience worsening of hemolysis, often requiring percutaneous or surgical device interventions.

### Severe hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure after mitral valve repair associated with non-endothelialization of artificial chordae tendinae: Case report [^1134iTSX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Mechanical hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure are rare complications of mitral valve repair.

- **Case presentation**: We report a unique case of severe hemolytic anemia and severe acute renal failure after mitral valve repair using artificial chordae tendinae. Conservative therapy, including plasmapheresis and blood transfusion, was not effective. The major cause of the mechanical hemolysis was mild mitral regurgitation originating from the center of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring. The hemolytic anemia resolved gradually after the replacement of the mitral valve. The new artificial chordae tendinae was found to be completely non-endothelialized during the surgery. Non-endothelialization of artificial chordae tendinae may also play a role in the genesis of mechanical anemia.

- **Conclusions**: The major cause of the mechanical hemolysis was mild mitral regurgitation originating from the center of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring. Non-endothelialization of foreign materials might be another mechanism of hemolysis after mitral repair.

Regarding surgical interventions for prosthetic heart valves, particularly concerning the choice of prosthetic valve, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend individualizing the decision between mechanical and bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement in patients aged 50–65 years who require aortic valve replacement and do not have contraindications to anticoagulation. This recommendation emphasizes taking into account individual patient factors and engaging in informed shared decision-making.

### Anaemia in patients with aortic stenosis: influence on long-term prognosis [^111RScih]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

The prognostic implications of anaemia in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) remain unclear. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic implications of anaemia in AS patients before and after aortic valve replacement (AVR).

- **Methods and results**: A total of 856 AS patients (age 71 ± 12 years, 60.2% male, 47.4% severe AS) were included. The mean haemoglobin (Hb) level was 13.2 ± 1.8 g/dL, and the prevalence of anaemia (Hb < 13.0 g/dL for men, < 12.0 g/dL for women) was 32.0%. The prevalence of anaemia rose with increasing severity of AS (28.9% and 35.6% in moderate and severe AS, respectively, P = 0.048) and was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality in severe AS patients whilst under medical therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29–3.97, P = 0.005]. Similarly, each 1.0 g/dL decrease in Hb was independently associated with increased mortality risk at follow-up (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07–1.47, P = 0.006). However, after AVR surgery, severe AS patients who had anaemia had similar long-term survival as patients with normal Hb (log rank P = 0.19). When all AS patients were included and AVR surgery entered as a covariate, anaemia was still independently associated with increased all-cause mortality irrespective of the severity of AS.

- **Conclusions**: A high prevalence of anaemia in moderate and severe AS patients was observed, and its presence was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality. However, after AVR surgery, anaemic patients had similar survival rates as patients with normal Hb.

Regarding the medical management for prosthetic heart valves, particularly concerning the management of thromboembolism, the ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend considering an increase in the INR goal from 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) to 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5), or the addition of a daily low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg), with an assessment of bleeding risk in patients who have a mechanical aortic valve replacement. This is especially relevant for patients experiencing a stroke or a systemic embolic event while maintaining a therapeutic range on VKA anticoagulation.

### Standard versus higher intensity anticoagulation for patients with mechanical aortic valve replacement and additional risk factors for thromboembolism [^112iLLNY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend targeting an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 to 3.5 for patients with mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and additional risk factors for thromboembolic events. Available literature supporting the higher intensity (INR) goal is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the association of standard and higher intensity anticoagulation on outcomes in this patient population. The Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative database was used to identify patients with mechanical AVR and at least one additional risk factor. Patients were classified into two groups based on INR goals: standard-intensity (INR goal 2.5) or higher-intensity (INR goal 3.0). A Cox-proportional hazard model was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios.

One hundred and forty-six patients were identified, of whom 110 (75.3%) received standard-intensity anticoagulation and 36 (24.7%) received higher intensity anticoagulation. Standard-intensity patients were older and more likely to be on aspirin. Atrial fibrillation was the most common additional risk factor for inclusion. The primary outcome of thromboembolic events, bleeding, or all-cause death was 13.9 and 19.5/100-person-years in the standard-intensity and higher intensity groups, respectively (adjusted HR 2.58, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 5.18). Higher-intensity anticoagulation was significantly associated with any bleeding (adjusted HR 2.52, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 5.00), and there were few thromboembolic events across both groups (5 events total). These results challenge the guideline recommendations.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^111zx63D]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

In the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly regarding iron therapy, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend administering oral iron (or intravenous iron for patients with hemodialysis-dependent CKD) to maintain a transferrin saturation greater than 20% and ferritin levels above 100 ng/mL in pediatric patients with CKD on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy who are not receiving iron therapy.

### Meta-analysis of impact of anemia and hemoglobin level on survival after transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^112GJRPM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

To establish evidence on whether baseline anemia and decreases in baseline hemoglobin levels affect survival after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), we performed a meta-analysis of available studies. Studies considered for inclusion met the following criteria: the design was a comparative study of patients with baseline anemia versus those without baseline anemia, or a cohort study investigating baseline anemia (as a dichotomous variable) or baseline hemoglobin levels (as a continuous variable) as one of the prognostic factors of mortality. The study population comprised patients who underwent TAVI, and the main outcomes included early (30-day or in-hospital) or late (including early) all-cause mortality. Study-specific estimates were combined in the random-effects model.

Our search identified 15 eligible studies, including a total of 11,657 TAVI patients. Pooled analysis demonstrated that baseline anemia was associated with a statistically significant increase in early (p = 0.003) and midterm mortality (p < 0.0001), and that incremental decreases in baseline hemoglobin levels were associated with a statistically significant increase in midterm mortality (p < 0.00001). Pooled analysis of only adjusted estimates indicated that anemia was independently associated with a statistically significant increase in early (p = 0.02) and midterm mortality (p < 0.0001), and that incremental decreases in baseline hemoglobin levels were independently associated with a statistically significant increase in midterm mortality (p < 0.00001).

### Prevalence, factors associated with, and prognostic effects of preoperative anemia on short- and long-term mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^116Li74B]. Circulation. Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

There is scant information on the prevalence and factors associated with preoperative anemia in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and whether it is associated with mortality. We sought to determine the prevalence and factors associated with preoperative anemia, in addition to the prognostic effects of the various levels of preoperative hemoglobin on mortality in patients undergoing TAVI.

- **Methods and results**: A ten-center observational study encompassing 1,696 patients with aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI was conducted. Anemia was defined by the World Health Organization criteria (hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dL in women and < 13.0 g/dL in men). The prevalence of preoperative anemia was 57%. Patient-related factors associated with preoperative anemia were, in descending order of odds ratio [95% confidence interval], as follows: anemia-related medication (4.90 [3.08–7.80]), history of heart failure (1.77 [1.43–2.20]), male sex (1.69 [1.32–2.16]), mitral regurgitation grade ≥ III (1.61 [1.15–2.25]), history of malignancy (1.44 [1.03–2.09]), and peripheral vascular disease (1.33 [1.04–1.70]). The creatinine clearance was inversely associated with preoperative anemia (odds ratio, 0.92 [0.87–0.97]).

In multivariable analyses, preoperative anemia was not associated with 30-day mortality (1.72 [0.96–3.12]; P = 0.073) but showed the strongest association with 1-year mortality with a hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.78 (1.60–4.82) in patients with hemoglobin < 10 g/dL. Patients with anemia received ≥ 1 blood transfusion 2× more often.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111k56ZZ]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically with respect to hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend ensuring patients are iron replete to achieve and maintain the target hemoglobin range in patients receiving ESAs:

- **Iron levels**: Percentage hypochromic red cells should be less than 6% and reticulocyte hemoglobin content greater than 31 pg. Ferritin and transferrin saturation should be greater than 100 mcg/L and more than 20% in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD or on peritoneal dialysis, and greater than 200 mcg/L in patients on hemodialysis.

- **Pediatric considerations**: Ferritin should be greater than 100 mcg/L for children with CKD on dialysis, as well as children with CKD not on ESAs.

- **Iron administration**: Consider administering iron when ferritin is less than 500 mcg/L and/or transferrin saturation is less than 30% to ensure iron repletion.

### Canadian society of nephrology commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^114Rx8E2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2012 clinical practice guideline for anemia management in patients with chronic kidney disease provides the structural and evidence base for the Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on this guideline's relevancy and application to the Canadian health care system. While in general agreement, we provide commentary on 11 of the 61 KDIGO guideline statements. Specifically, we agreed that a therapeutic trial of iron is appropriate in cases in which a reduction in erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dosage or avoidance of ESA and transfusion is desired, transferrin saturations are > 30%, and ferritin concentrations are > 500 μg/L. However, we concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support an upper target or threshold for ferritin and transferrin saturation levels.

We agree with the initiation of ESA treatment when hemoglobin (Hb) level is 90–100 g/L; however, we specifically state that an acceptable range for Hb level is 95–115 g/L, with a target of 100–110 g/L, and add caution to individualization above this range due to concerns regarding the safety of ESAs. We agree that ESAs should be used with considerable caution in patients with active malignancy, history of stroke, or history of malignancy, and we suggest initiating ESA therapy at Hb level of 90 g/L and to aim for a Hb level in the range of 90–105 g/L. The reader is encouraged to note the level of evidence and review the entire KDIGO anemia guideline to interpret the guideline statements and commentary appropriately.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^11133Qhz]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Hemolysis is an unintended consequence of temporary or permanent intracardiac devices. However, limited data exist on the characteristics and treatment of hemolysis in patients with cardiac prostheses. This condition, although uncommon, often poses significant diagnostic and management challenges to clinical cardiologists. In this article, we aim to provide a contemporary overview of the incidence, mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of cardiac prosthesis-related hemolysis.
