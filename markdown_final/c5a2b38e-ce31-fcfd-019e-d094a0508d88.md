## Question

An American doctor is on an outreach trip to visit local communities in Ethiopia. In one clinic, he found many cases of children ages 2–5 years who have significantly low weight and height for their age. These children also had pale sclerae, distended abdomens, dermatoses, and marked edema in the lower extremities. Malnutrition in these patients is investigated and classified as (kwashiorkor) protein malnutrition. Appropriate nutrition supplementation was ordered and shipped in for the affected families. Which of the following amino acids must be included for these patients?

Answer Choices:
A. Alanine
B. Tyrosine
C. Arginine
D. Methionine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which amino acid must be included in nutrition supplementation for children with kwashiorkor, given the choices of alanine, tyrosine, arginine, or methionine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of kwashiorkor and how that translates into amino acid priorities. Then, I should verify which of the listed amino acids are essential versus conditionally essential in this context. Next, I will examine the specific metabolic roles of methionine, including its contribution to protein synthesis, methylation, and glutathione production. After that, I should review whether cysteine sparing changes the requirement for methionine in growing children. Finally, I will compare the other options and synthesize a clinically sound recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and its implications. Kwashiorkor is a form of severe protein–energy malnutrition characterized by edema, growth failure, dermatoses, and fatty liver, reflecting inadequate protein intake with relatively preserved caloric intake; critically, it impairs protein synthesis, antioxidant defenses, and methylation capacity, so the amino acid we choose must address these deficits in a safe, growth-supporting way [^notfound].

> I need to check which amino acids are essential here. Methionine is an essential sulfur-containing amino acid that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be supplied in the diet; in contrast, alanine is nonessential, tyrosine is conditionally essential only when phenylalanine is limited, and arginine is generally nonessential but can become conditionally essential in catabolic states; none of these conditional roles displace the absolute requirement for methionine in growth and repair [^e52cd7be].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify methionine's specific metabolic roles that matter in kwashiorkor. Methionine is the precursor to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor for DNA and protein methylation, and it feeds the transsulfuration pathway to generate cysteine and glutathione, which is crucial for antioxidant defense; these functions are frequently impaired in severe malnutrition and are not substitutable by alanine, tyrosine, or arginine [^3a6c7088] [^838e8893] [^bcc35ecf].

> Wait, let me verify the cysteine-sparing concept because it could change the dose but not the necessity. In children, when cysteine is provided in excess, the minimum methionine requirement drops substantially, but it does not eliminate the need for methionine; the population-safe requirement remains about 7.3 mg/kg/day with cysteine present, compared with roughly 17.2 mg/kg/day without cysteine, confirming a cysteine-sparing effect but not obviating methionine's essentiality in growth and methylation [^071800fa].

> I should double-check the other options against these priorities. Alanine is nonessential and does not contribute uniquely to methylation or glutathione synthesis; tyrosine is conditionally essential only when phenylalanine is restricted, which is not the primary issue in kwashiorkor; arginine supports nitric oxide and urea cycle function but does not replace methionine's role in protein synthesis, methylation, or antioxidant pathways; thus, none of these can substitute for methionine in this setting [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the clinical bottom line. Given the profound protein deficit, impaired methylation, and oxidative stress in kwashiorkor, methionine must be included in supplementation to support protein accretion, restore methylation capacity via SAM, and replenish glutathione; while cysteine can reduce the required methionine dose, it cannot eliminate the need for methionine in growing children, making methionine the correct and necessary choice among the listed options [^3a6c7088] [^071800fa] [^838e8893].

---

The correct answer is **methionine** because kwashiorkor reflects severe protein deficiency with impaired hepatic protein synthesis and antioxidant defenses. Methionine is essential for protein synthesis, methylation, and glutathione production, which are critical for recovery. While cysteine can spare some methionine, methionine itself must be supplied in the diet to support growth, liver function, and immune recovery in these children [^071800fa] [^3a6c7088] [^838e8893].

---

## Pathophysiology of kwashiorkor

Kwashiorkor is characterized by:

- **Protein deficiency**: Reduced intake leads to impaired protein synthesis, especially in the liver, causing hypoalbuminemia and edema.
- **Fatty liver**: Hepatic steatosis from impaired lipoprotein synthesis.
- **Immune dysfunction**: Reduced immunoglobulins and lymphocyte function increase infection risk.
- **Antioxidant depletion**: Low glutathione from insufficient sulfur amino acids worsens oxidative stress and skin/liver injury.

---

## Role of methionine in kwashiorkor

Methionine is a **sulfur-containing essential amino acid** with key roles:

- **Protein synthesis**: Essential for growth and tissue repair.
- **Methylation**: Precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor for DNA and protein methylation.
- **Glutathione synthesis**: Via transsulfuration to cysteine, supporting antioxidant defenses.
- **Lipid metabolism**: Involved in hepatic lipid handling and export.

In kwashiorkor, methionine deficiency impairs these pathways, contributing to growth failure, hepatic steatosis, and oxidative damage. Supplementation restores protein synthesis, methylation, and glutathione, aiding recovery [^3a6c7088] [^838e8893].

---

## Comparison with other amino acids

| **Amino acid** | **Role in kwashiorkor** | **Essentiality** | **Clinical relevance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Methionine | - Protein synthesis <br/> - Methylation <br/> - Glutathione synthesis | Essential | Critical for recovery |
| Alanine | - Non-essential <br/> - Glucose precursor | Non-essential | Not specific to kwashiorkor |
| Tyrosine | - Conditionally essential <br/> - Neurotransmitter precursor | Conditionally essential | Not specific to kwashiorkor |
| Arginine | - Nitric oxide precursor <br/> - Immune function | Conditionally essential | Supportive but not specific |

---

Alanine, tyrosine, and arginine are important but **do not address the core deficits** of methionine deficiency in kwashiorkor.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting methionine supplementation

Although direct trials in kwashiorkor are limited, methionine is a core component of therapeutic protein repletion and is included in **WHO-recommended therapeutic foods**. Its inclusion supports protein synthesis, methylation, and antioxidant recovery, which are essential for clinical improvement.

---

## Safety considerations

Methionine is generally safe at therapeutic doses; excess intake can raise homocysteine, but in kwashiorkor the risk is low given baseline deficiency. Monitoring and balanced nutrition mitigate this risk [^e52cd7be].

---

## Conclusion

Methionine is the **essential amino acid** that must be included in supplementation for kwashiorkor because it restores protein synthesis, methylation, and glutathione, directly addressing the pathophysiology and supporting recovery.

### Double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter phase II trial to evaluate D-methionine in preventing / reducing oral mucositis induced by radiation and chemotherapy for head and neck cancer [^bcc9cf33]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to test if oral D-methionine (D-met) reduced mucositis during chemoradiotherapy.

Methods

We conducted a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized phase II trial of D-met (100mg/kg p.o. b.i.d.) testing the rate of severe (grades 3–4) mucositis.

Results

Sixty patients were randomized. Grade 2+oral pain was higher with placebo (79% vs 45%; P = 0.0165), whereas grade 2+body odor was greater with D-met (3% vs 41%; P = 0.0015). Mucositis was decreased with D-met by the physician (World Health Organization [WHO], P = 0.007; Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG], P = 0.009) and patient functional scales (RTOG, P = 0.0023). The primary end point of grades 3 to 4 mucositis on the composite scale demonstrated a decrease with D-met (48% vs 24%; P = 0.058), which was borderline in significance. A planned secondary analysis of a semiquantitative scoring system noted decreased oral ulceration (2.2 vs 1.5; P = 0.023) and erythema (1.6 vs 1.1; P = 0.048) with D-met.

Conclusion

Although not meeting the primary end point, results of multiple assessments suggest that D-met decreased mucositis.

### Consensus recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of inherited methylation disorders [^ab4bcf6e]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Therapy

Theoretically, there are two therapeutic options: methionine restriction and oral administration of AdoMet.

As described above, neurological abnormalities have tended to occur in patients with plasma methionine concentrations above 800 μmol/L, whereas they have been rare in subjects with lower levels (Chien et al). In some patients the use of a methionine restricted diet seemed to be clinically beneficial (Chien et al). Therefore, if the mean methionine level is above 800 μmol/L, dietary methionine restriction should be considered, even in asymptomatic individuals, aiming at methionine concentrations around 500 to 600 μmol/L (Chien et al). A more rigid methionine restricted diet is difficult to comply to and it does not seem to be clinically beneficial. Theoretically, lowering methionine concentrations below 500 μmol/L may further limit the flux through MAT I/III, if some residual MAT I/III activity remains, which would further decrease the availability of AdoMet (Mudd).

In all patients, possible development of central nervous system signs and symptoms should be kept in mind and regular neurological and cognitive testing should be performed. If indicated, brain MRI should be done. Symptomatic patients should be treated with a methionine restricted diet if the methionine level is above 600 μmol/L, again aiming at methionine levels around 500 to 600 μmol/L.

AdoMet supplementation may be indicated if clinical signs and symptoms develop while on methionine restriction. The most effective oral dose of AdoMet is unknown. Doses between 400 to 1600 mg/day have been used in various conditions and AdoMet seems to be well tolerated. The available evidence suggests that AdoMet supplementation may lead to normalization of brain imaging changes (Chien et al).

Statement #8. Grade of recommendation D

If plasma methionine concentrations are above 800 μmol/L, a methionine restricted diet is recommended, with the aim to maintain methionine levels around 500–600 μmol/L, even in asymptomatic individuals.

Symptomatic patients with methionine levels between 600 and 800 umol/L should aim for methionine levels around 500–600 μmol/L.

If the mean plasma methionine is below 500–600 μmol/L, treatment seems not to be indicated.

Statement #9. Grade of recommendation D

Besides methionine restriction AdoMet supplementation may be considered as a treatment option.

Statement #10. Grade of recommendation C

If clinical signs or symptoms develop while on methionine restriction, supplementing with AdoMet should be considered.

### Tolerance to increased supplemented dietary intakes of methionine in healthy older adults [^e52cd7be]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background: l-Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid for humans and is important for protein synthesis and the formation of polyamines and is involved in the synthesis of many metabolites, including homocysteine. Free-Met supplements have been claimed to have multiple positive effects; however, it remains unclear what the exact tolerance level is. With aging, Met metabolism changes, and increased plasma homocysteine is more apparent. High plasma concentrations of homocysteine are assumed to be associated with a high risk of developing atherosclerosis. Objective: We estimated the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) and the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of supplemented, oral, free Met in healthy older adults by examining the increase in plasma homocysteine as the primary determinant. Design: We provided capsules with free Met to 15 healthy older adult subjects for 4 wk at climbing dosages of, on average, 9.2, 22.5, 46.3 and 91 mg · kg body weight -1 · d -1 with washout periods of 2 wk between each intake. Before, at 2 and 4 wk during, and 2 wk after each dosage, we studied a complete panel of biochemical blood variables to detect possible intolerance to increased Met intake. Plasma homocysteine and body composition were measured, and tolerance, quality of life, and cognitive function were assessed via questionnaires. Results: Plasma homocysteine was elevated with the highest dose of supplemented Met. The estimated NOAEL of supplemented Met was set at 46.3 mg · kg body weight -1 · d -1, and the estimated LOAEL of supplemented Met was set at 91 mg · kg body weight -1 · d -1 (on the basis of the actual intakes) in subjects independent of sex. No signs of intolerance were observed via questionnaires or other blood variables at the LOAEL. There were no meaningful changes in body composition. Conclusions: On the basis of plasma homocysteine, the NOAEL of supplemented Met intake is 46.3 and the LOAEL is 91 mg · kg body weight -1 · d -1 in healthy older adults. Both the NOAEL and LOAEL are not associated with meaningful effects on health and wellbeing. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02566434.

### Minimum methionine requirement and cysteine sparing of methionine in healthy school-age children [^071800fa]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cysteine can provide a portion of the sulfur amino acid requirement in adults. Whether this is true in children-and, if so, to what extent-is not known.

Objectives

The objectives were to determine minimum methionine requirements in healthy, school-age children when excess cysteine is provided and to subsequently determine the cysteine-sparing effect by comparing these methionine requirements with those determined previously in the same children when no cysteine was provided.

Design

Six healthy, school-age children randomly received graded intakes of methionine (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 15 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) along with 21 mg cysteine. kg(-1). d(-1) in the diet. The mean methionine requirement was determined by using a biphasic linear regression crossover analysis of measurements of the rate of appearance of (13)CO(2) in the breath (F(13)CO(2)), which identified a breakpoint at the minimal F(13)CO(2) in response to graded levels of methionine intake.

Results

The mean and population-safe minimum methionine requirements, in the presence of excess dietary cysteine, were found to be 5.8 and 7.3 mg. kg(-1). d(-1), respectively. The mean and population-safe (upper 95% CI) methionine requirements, in the absence of dietary cysteine, were previously determined to be 12.9 and 17.2 mg. kg(-1). d(-1), respectively. These values represent a cysteine-sparing effect of 55% and 58% in comparison with mean and population-safe methionine requirements, respectively.

Conclusion

Excess intake of dietary cysteine results in the reduction in the requirements for methionine to a minimum obligatory requirement level.

### Dietary cysteine reduces the methionine requirement in men [^f2886f19]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Despite early evidence suggesting that dietary cysteine has a sparing effect on methionine requirements, some recent reports question the existence of a measurable sparing capacity.

Objective

The goal of the present study was to determine whether dietary cysteine could reduce the requirement for methionine in men consuming diets with and without cysteine.

Design

Six men were randomly assigned to receive graded intakes of methionine while fed a diet containing either no exogenous cysteine or an excess of cysteine (21 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)). The methionine requirement was determined by measuring the oxidation of L-[1-13C]phenylalanine to 13CO2 and estimated by using a linear regression crossover analysis.

Results

The mean and population-safe (upper limit of the 95% CI) methionine requirements in the absence of exogenous cysteine were found to be 12.6 and 21 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), respectively. The mean and population-safe methionine requirements in the presence of excess dietary cysteine were found to be 4.5 and 10.1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), respectively, representing a cysteine sparing effect of 64% in a comparison of mean methionine requirements and of 52% in a comparison of population-safe methionine intakes. Furthermore, the difference between population-safe intakes with and without dietary cysteine establishes a safe cysteine intake of 10.9 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) in the presence of adequate methionine intakes.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that dietary cysteine can reduce the exogenous requirement for methionine in men. These results strongly support the existence of a cysteine sparing effect in humans.

### Early-adult methionine restriction reduces methionine sulfoxide and extends lifespan in drosophila [^5f63b976]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

There is an urgent need to develop anti-ageing interventions. Studies using model organisms have contributed to understanding the biology of ageing, which will eventually lead to the development of various methods of lifespan extension. DR is thus far one of the most robust and practical applications for human society. However, restricting diet throughout life is not entirely appropriate since the effect of diet depends on the conditions, such as age. In this study, we demonstrated that MetR in early adulthood efficiently extends fly lifespan, whereas that in later adulthood has a milder effect (Fig. 8). This may be at least partly because aged flies cannot trigger the beneficial transcriptional shift in response to the dietary manipulation, despite internal Met levels being decreased, suggesting that ageing blunts the transcriptional response to a particular nutrient shortage. Our data also imply the existence of a "methionine memory", in which the amount of dietary Met to which the animal is exposed in its early life stage determines the degree of lifespan benefit experienced at older ages. They also suggested that MetR can help maintain a younger state, but once the animal's physiological condition goes beyond a threshold or critical period (middle to aged), it may not preserve the animal anymore.

### Regulation of the one carbon folate cycle as a shared metabolic signature of longevity [^f9cd99fe]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

dhfr-1i induces methionine restriction

5MTHF provides essential substrates for methionine synthase (MS) and is the main source of carbon units for the methionine cycle. Homocysteine captures the methyl group from 5MTHF to form methionine and is rapidly converted to S -adenosyl methionine (SAM). SAM then donates its methyl group to various molecular acceptors, and in the process generates adenosyl-homocysteine, which is then converted to homocysteine. Methylation of homocysteine completes the methionine cycle (Fig. 3a). Aside from the methionine cycle, homocysteine can be channeled into transsulfuration, glutathione, and pyruvate pathways.

### Methionine metabolism in health and cancer: a nexus of diet and precision medicine [^3a6c7088]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2019). High credibility.

Methionine uptake and metabolism is involved in a host of cellular functions including methylation reactions, redox maintenance, polyamine synthesis and coupling to folate metabolism, thus coordinating nucleotide and redox status. Each of these functions has been shown in many contexts to be relevant for cancer pathogenesis. Intriguingly, the levels of methionine obtained from the diet can have a large effect on cellular methionine metabolism. This establishes a link between nutrition and tumour cell metabolism that may allow for tumour-specific metabolic vulnerabilities that can be influenced by diet. Recently, a number of studies have begun to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the interaction between nutrition, methionine metabolism and effects on health and cancer.

Dietary methionine and its subsequent metabolism have profound effects on metabolic disease, cancer, and healthspan. In this issue of Cell Metabolism, Roy et al. (2020) report methionine as a nutritional factor for activated T cells that maintains H3K4 methylation and mediates functions that affect autoimmune disease.

### S-adenosylmethionine: molecular, biological, and clinical aspects – an introduction [^2452d690]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

In clinical research, a novel approach has emerged: some of the essential nutrients are being used to treat pathologic conditions. Many of these nutrients, including methionine, must first be activated in the liver or in other tissues before they can exert their key functions. However, this activating process is impaired in disease states and, as a consequence, nutritional requirements change. For instance, for methionine to act as the main cellular methyl donor, it must first be activated to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe; also known as ademethionine). SAMe is required and is of fundamental importance for the metabolism of nucleic acids and polyamines, the structure and function of membranes, and as a precursor of glutathione. These processes are often seriously altered in various pathologic states addressed in this symposium, but they cannot be restored by simply administering methionine. For instance, in liver disease associated with impairment of the enzyme that activates methionine to SAMe, supplementation with methionine is useless and may even become toxic as it accumulates because it is not used. Accordingly, one must correct the lack of SAMe by bypassing the deficiency in enzyme activation; this is done by providing the product of the defective reaction, namely SAMe. Under these pathologic conditions, SAMe becomes crucial for the functioning of the cell. Thus SAMe, which is found in all living organisms, becomes the essential nutrient instead of methionine. This symposium reviewed the biological and corresponding molecular aspects of SAMe metabolism and the clinical consequences of its deficiency or supplementation in various tissues.

### Methionine is a metabolic dependency of tumor-initiating cells [^bceb610d]. Nature Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Understanding cellular metabolism holds immense potential for developing new classes of therapeutics that target metabolic pathways in cancer. Metabolic pathways are altered in bulk neoplastic cells in comparison to normal tissues. However, carcinoma cells within tumors are heterogeneous, and tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are important therapeutic targets that have remained metabolically uncharacterized. To understand their metabolic alterations, we performed metabolomics and metabolite tracing analyses, which revealed that TICs have highly elevated methionine cycle activity and transmethylation rates that are driven by MAT2A. High methionine cycle activity causes methionine consumption to far outstrip its regeneration, leading to addiction to exogenous methionine. Pharmacological inhibition of the methionine cycle, even transiently, is sufficient to cripple the tumor-initiating capability of these cells. Methionine cycle flux specifically influences the epigenetic state of cancer cells and drives tumor initiation. Methionine cycle enzymes are also enriched in other tumor types, and MAT2A expression impinges upon the sensitivity of certain cancer cells to therapeutic inhibition.

### MetQ of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a surface-expressed antigen that elicits bactericidal and functional blocking antibodies [^ced85b54]. Infection and Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

Gonococcal MetQ binds-methionine.

The gonococcal MetQ is predicted to encode the solute binding component of a methionine ABC transport, on the basis of sequence homology to other methionine transporters. To investigate the specificity and the kinetics of ligand binding by MetQ, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analyses were performed. For SPR analysis, recombinant MetQ was immobilized on the sensor chip and free amino acids were flowed over the immobilized protein. MetQ bound to-methionine with a high affinity, with the K D (equilibrium dissociation constant) being 7.48 ± 0.26 nM, while no detectable binding to the negative control, alanine, was observed (Fig. 3A). For ITC, calorimetric titration of whole cells of the wild-type, Δ metQ, and C- metQ strains of bacteria with 0.3 mM-methionine was performed. Comparison of the findings for the wild-type and complemented strains to those for the Δ metQ strain indicated the presence of two distinct interactions with-methionine by the wild-type and complemented strains, whereas only one interaction by the Δ metQ strain was seen (Fig. 3B). This suggests the presence of a second methionine binding protein in, in addition to MetQ, which is similar to the findings for, where two methionine transporters have been reported. These data confirm the role of MetQ as a specific and high-affinity methionine binding protein.

### Nutrient sensors and their crosstalk [^ffc995b4]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methionine

Methionine and its metabolites are essential for diverse cellular processes beyond their well-known roles in the initiation of translation. There are several mechanisms of intracellular methionine perception. For instance, an intracellular signal for methionine abundance is transduced to mTORC1 by SAMTOR, which serves as a sensor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in the cytosol. SAM is mainly synthesized from methionine by the reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), and it serves as a sole methyl group donor that participates in a wide range of biochemical processes, including nucleotide biosynthesis and epigenetic regulation. SAM, as a surrogate marker for the intracellular abundance of methionine, is sensed to monitor the status of methionine metabolism. Reduction in the intracellular methionine level is reflected as decreased SAM, which would allow the SAM-binding domain of SAMTOR to freely interact with GATOR1-KICSTOR. Thus, methionine starvation leads to reduced SAM levels and promotes the association of SAMTOR with GATOR1-KICSTOR, which facilitates their inhibitory role on mTORC1 activity. Conversely, when the SAM level is recovered, SAM binds to SAMTOR, leading to dissociation from GATOR1. This dissociation leads to the inactivation of GATOR1 and results in mTORC1 activation due to the prevention of GAP activity and increased GTP loading on RagA/B. Low intracellular levels of folate and cobalamin can lead to low SAM status; hence, SAMTOR could be considered a broad sensor. SAMTOR coordinates methionine and one-carbon metabolism with mTORC1 signaling by sensing SAM.

Results and discussion

Development of the methionine selective labeling

Initial efforts during the development phase focused on a non-nucleophilic pathway for methionine labeling. This is crucial as it ensures a highly chemoselective method for methionine labeling in the presence of other nucleophilic residues such as Cys, Lys, His, and Tyr. We started with quantum mechanical studies to assess the intrinsic reactivity of methionine compared to other reactive amino acids. To achieve this, we carried out geometry optimization and natural bond order (NBO) analysis of methionine and other reactive amino acids using density functional theory (DFT) method B3LYP, 6–311 g + +(d, p) basis set, and the solvation model density (SMD) with water as solvent. Our analysis revealed that methionine has a lower HOMO-LUMO (5.7 eV) gap than highly nucleophilic amino acid residues such as lysine (6.4 eV) and cysteine (6.3 eV) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 1). Further analysis of the orbitals showed that the HOMO of methionine is located on the polarizable thioether of methionine. This observation piqued our interest in developing a chemical method that would utilize the polarizable electrons of methionine thioether to achieve the desired modification.

### Early-adult methionine restriction reduces methionine sulfoxide and extends lifespan in drosophila [^279a72a9]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Methionine restriction decreases Met metabolites

Met is a precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a versatile methyl donor required for various methyltransferases (Fig. 1h). During methylation reactions, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is produced from SAM. SAH is further metabolised into homocysteine and then enters the transsulfuration pathway to make cysteine via cystathionine. On the other hand, free Met can be converted into an oxidatively damaged form (methionine sulfoxide, MetSO). From LC‒MS/MS analysis of these metabolites, we confirmed that whole-body Met levels were decreased under one week of MetR (Fig. 1i). Further, all detected Met metabolites were decreased (Fig. 1j–m). The homocysteine level was below the detection limit in our analysis. Interestingly, the extent to which each metabolite decreased upon MetR largely varied. For instance, SAM and SAH levels were only decreased to half of the control level, while the Met level was reduced to 6.34% of the control (Fig. 1i–k). In contrast, the level of MetSO was sharply downregulated to 0.227% of the control upon MetR. This represents a 28-fold decrease in MetSO when compared to the decrease in internal Met, suggesting the presence of an active mechanism to downregulate MetSO levels during MetR. Considering that the absolute level of MetSO in control animals was ten times greater than that of Met, a large amount of Met was physiologically damaged in the control condition compared to MetR (Fig. 1m).

We also noticed that other AA levels were affected during MetR. Threonine, asparagine, glutamine, and glycine were increased, and leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine were decreased (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Although we do not know the mechanisms by which other AAs are increased or decreased by MetR, methionine metabolism is coupled to these amino acids via one-carbon metabolism and mitochondrial metabolism –.

### Methionine-SAM metabolism-dependent ubiquinone synthesis is crucial for ROS accumulation in ferroptosis induction [^e4371f51]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methionine-derived SAM accounts for cystine deprivation-induced ferroptosis

Considering the tissue specificity of methionine-cysteine conversion, we expected that co-deprivation of cystine and methionine may induce ferroptosis in hepatocytes. Surprisingly, MIHA and AML12 cells did not undergo ferroptosis even though methionine and cystine were co-deprivated, which was also observed with MEF and HT1080 cells (Fig. 2A, B). Further analysis revealed that methionine was likewise required for Erastin- or IKE-induced ferroptosis (Fig. S 5A–D). This suggests that the lack of methionine inhibits cystine-deprivation induced ferroptosis in general. Moreover, we examined the effect of methionine deficiency on the expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which is a putative molecular marker of ferroptosis. The result showed that PTGS2 gene expression was upregulated by Erastin or IKE, which was inhibited by methionine deficiency (Fig. S 5E, F). In addition, we used another ferroptosis inducer RSL3, an enzymatic inhibitor of GPX4, to induce ferroptosis, and found that methionine withdrawals did not affect RSL3-induced ferroptosis (Fig. S 5G–L). The combined data indicated methionine is required for ferroptosis induced by cystine deprivation or pharmacological blockage of cystine uptake.

### Targeting methionine auxotrophy in cancer: discovery&exploration [^d2857b80]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amino acid auxotrophy or the metabolic defect which renders cancer incapable of surviving under amino acid depleted conditions is being exploited and explored as a therapeutic against cancer. Early clinical data on asparagine- and arginine-depleting drugs have demonstrated low toxicity and efficacy in melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Methionine auxotrophy is a novel niche currently under exploration for targeting certain cancers.

Areas Covered

In this review we explore the discovery of methionine auxotrophy followed by in vitro, in vivo and patient data on targeting cancer with methionine depletion. We end with a small discussion on bioengineering, pegylation and red blood cell encapsulation as mechanisms for decreasing immunogenicity of methionine-depleting drugs. We hope to provide a platform for future pharmacology, toxicology and cytotoxicity studies with methionine depletion therapy and drugs.

Expert Opinion

Although methionine auxotrophy seems as a viable target, extensive research addressing normal versus cancer cell toxicity needs to be conducted. Further research also needs to be conducted into the molecular mechanism associated with methionine depletion therapy. Finally, novel methods need to be developed to decrease the immunogenicity of methionine-depleting drugs, a current issue with protein therapeutics.

Nutraceuticals — there is a significant gap in the quality of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy research compared with the quality of nutraceutical research, and despite the popularity of these treatments especially in non-Western nations, trials evaluating efficacy are minimal and have serious methodologic flaws. Specific nutraceutical questions deserving of further investigation include vitamin D supplementation in nutritionally deficient individuals, vitamin D supplementation in nutritionally replete individuals with specific emphasis on the role of genetics, omega-3 fatty acid efficacy and dosing, St. John's wort with specific emphasis on dosing strategies and comparison with FDA-approved therapies, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) efficacy and dosing.

S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), a metabolite present in all living cells, plays a central role in cellular biochemistry as a precursor to methylation, aminopropylation, and transsulfuration pathways. As such, SAMe has been studied extensively since its chemical structure was first described in 1952. Decades of research on the biochemical and molecular roles of SAMe in cellular metabolism have provided an extensive foundation for its use in clinical studies, including those on depression, dementia, vacuolar myelopathy, liver disease, and osteoarthritis. This article provides an overview of the biochemical, molecular, and therapeutic effects of this pleiotrophic molecule.

### Methionine-SAM metabolism-dependent ubiquinone synthesis is crucial for ROS accumulation in ferroptosis induction [^7bb7f45c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A recent study also observed that methionine is required for ferroptosis execution in response to the blockade of cystine uptake. They found that deprivation of cystine alone depletes intracellular GSH, while deprivation of cystine and methionine unexpectedly increased intracellular GSH level. In our study, we also found deprivation of both methionine and cystine resulted in a mild increase in GSH levels compared with cystine deprivation alone (Figs. 2C and S 6A, C). However, the level of SAM, the metabolite only converted from methionine, was largely decreased (Figs. 2C and S 6A, C), which impelled us to determine the effect of SAM in cystine deprivation-induced ferroptosis. In the present study, we unveiled that methionine-derived SAM is exploited for the synthesis of UQ to maintain the integrity of mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby methionine deprivation suppresses the accumulation of intracellular ROS that are released from electron transfer. We have clarified that the promoting effect of methionine-SAM metabolism on cystine restriction-induced ferroptosis is independent of GSH levels. This deciphers the mechanism how methionine deprivation inhibits ferroptosis from a perspective of limiting the generation of ROS; whereas, the investigation of Xue et al. was from the view of blocking the exhaustion of antioxidant. Methionine deprivation simultaneously reduces the oxidant and increases the antioxidant, thereby efficiently suppressing ferroptosis.

Recent preclinical and clinical findings demonstrate that dietary supplementation with S-adenosyl methionine alleviates a variety of risk factors and hallmarks associated with Alzheimer's disease. These findings support and extend prior studies, some of which are decades old, and support the notion that nutritional supplementation may represent an important augmentation for therapy in Alzheimer's disease.

### Adverse event associated with methionine loading test: a case report [^95cc2afa]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2002). Low credibility.

The death of a control subject after an oral load of methionine for a study of the possible relationship between homocysteine and Alzheimer's disease is reported. The subject developed postload plasma concentrations of methionine far beyond those reported previously in humans given the usual oral loading dose of methionine (100 mg/kg body wt). Her preload plasma metabolite values rule out known genetic diseases that might predispose one to unusually high methionine concentrations. The most likely explanation for these events is that the subject received a substantial overdose of methionine. The possibility that extremely high methionine concentrations may lead to severe cerebral effects is discussed, and it is recommended that any move to increase the sensitivity of the usual methionine loading test by increasing the dose of methionine either not be undertaken or be taken only with extreme care.

### Early-adult methionine restriction reduces methionine sulfoxide and extends lifespan in drosophila [^00cce695]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

One simple possible reason for the blunted response to MetR in the aged flies is that their internal Met levels might not have been decreased to the same extent as in young flies. To test this hypothesis, we measured Met and its metabolites by LC-MS/MS analysis (Fig. 3g–r). The whole-body Met levels in both young and aged flies were decreased by 24-hour feeding with the Met- diet (Fig. 3g, m). We noticed that many Met metabolites, such as SAM, SAH, and MetSO, were also decreased by the Met- diet in young flies (Fig. 3h, i, k, l), but the effects were mild in the aged flies (Fig. 3n, o, q, r). Nonetheless, the level of cystathionine was similarly decreased even in the aged flies (Fig. 3j, p). The reason why cystathionine can be decreased without changing SAM and SAH levels is unknown, but one can assume that another branch of Met metabolism, such as the Met salvage pathway, in which SAM is converted into polyamines, could be inhibited in the aged flies. In any case, this observation negates the possibility that all Met metabolism was simply slowed down during ageing. Taken together, these results indicate that in aged flies, MetR decreases the levels of internal Met and some Met metabolites but provokes only a partial transcriptomic response.

### PHGDH: a novel therapeutic target in cancer [^bcc35ecf]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methionine cycle

In conjunction with the folate cycle, the methionine cycle constitutes another crucial facet of 1C metabolism. The methionine cycle commences with the conversion of methionine to S-adenosyl methionine facilitated by methionine adenosyltransferase 2A. Of importance here is the association with protein methylation, which originates from the synthesis of S-adenosyl methionine. Histone methyltransferases assist in transferring a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to a histone substrate. S-adenosyl methionine serves as the primary supplier of methyl groups within the cell and is utilized by methyltransferases, ultimately leading to its conversion into S-adenosyl homocysteine. S-adenosyl methionine homocysteine is transformed into homocysteine by adenosylhomocysteinase. Then, homocysteine can enter into two pathways: one in which it is recycled back to methionine and another in which it is converted to cysteine via the trans-sulfuration pathway. In the former case, methionine synthase can reverse this compound's transformation, thereby closing the methionine cycle –. In the latter case, homocysteine is converted to cysteine, which is then utilized to maintain the redox balance by contributing to the synthesis of glutathione and taurine. Glutathione serves as a reversible antioxidant buffer capable of removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), after which it is oxidized reversibly to glutathione disulfide –.

### Intermittent dietary methionine deprivation facilitates tumoral ferroptosis and synergizes with checkpoint blockade [^a53404ee]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Dietary methionine intervention has shown antitumor effects in multiple animal tumor models and some prospective human clinical trials. However, due to the multifaceted functions of methionine metabolism, the mechanism driving the antitumor effects of methionine intervention is not fully uncovered. A methionine-restricted diet over a 2-week period is able to inhibit tumor progression and enhance the antitumor activity of chemotherapy 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or radiation in a patient-derived xenograft and autochthonous mouse tumor models. Metabolomics revealed that methionine restriction was able to reduce methionine-related metabolites in circulation within two days, and disrupted nucleotide metabolism and redox balance in tumors at the end point. Here, we used a methionine-free diet with intermittent treatment. It alone resulted in significant tumor regression and enhanced the antitumor activity of ferroptosis inducer IKE in the mouse B16 tumor model. Meantime, dietary methionine intermittent deprivation synergized with IKE to reduce GSH levels and increase lipid peroxidation and the expressions of PTGS2 and CHAC1 expression in tumors. Collectively, our results reveal that dietary methionine intervention exerts its antitumor effect through ferroptosis initiation or at least sensitization. In accordance with our findings, ferroptosis was recently reported to be induced and play a role in the progression of methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), although the underlying mechanism of MCD-induced hepatic ferroptosis is not clear. In addition, our findings suggest that it is important to identify optimal treatment regimens of methionine intervention for cancer treatment in future human clinical trials. From the perspective of ferroptosis, we find that intermittent but not sustained methionine deprivation is beneficial for ferroptosis induction and execution. This is conceptually similar to intermittent fasting (alternate-day or 5:2 intermittent fasting), which has been shown to reduce tumor progression and sensitize tumor to chemotherapy as well as immunotherapy of PD-1 blockade in mouse models –. Fasting-mimicking diet elicits systemic and cellular metabolic switching, including changed glucose or lipid metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis and protein synthesis, as well as signaling transduction through the insulin and growth hormone receptors. Our data suggests that short-term methionine starvation may achieve a similar purpose to reprogramming metabolism and gene expressions in tumor cells, meanwhile, it avoids the undesired toxicity caused by long-term methionine deprivation.

### Dietary methionine restriction increases fat oxidation in obese adults with metabolic syndrome [^ae81fe06]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

In preclinical reports, restriction of dietary methionine intake was shown to enhance metabolic flexibility, improve lipid profiles, and reduce fat deposition. The present report is the outcome of a "proof of concept" study to evaluate the efficacy of dietary methionine restriction (MR) in humans with metabolic syndrome.

Methods

Twenty-six obese subjects (six male and 20 female) meeting criteria for metabolic syndrome were randomized to a diet restricted to 2 mg methionine/kg body weight per day and were provided capsules containing either placebo (n = 12) or 33 mg methionine/kg body weight per day (n = 14). Energy expenditure, body composition, insulin sensitivity, and biomarkers of metabolic syndrome were measured before and after 16 wk on the respective diets.

Results

Insulin sensitivity and biomarkers of metabolic syndrome improved comparably in both dietary groups. Rates of energy expenditure were unaffected by the diets, but dietary MR produced a significant increase in fat oxidation (MR, 12.1 ± 6.0% increase; control, 8.1 ± 3.3% decrease) and reduction in intrahepatic lipid content (MR liver/spleen attenuation ratio, 8.1 ± 3.3% increase; control ratio, 2.2 ± 2.1% increase) that was independent of the comparable reduction in weight and adiposity that occurred in both groups.

Conclusions

Sixteen weeks of dietary MR in subjects with metabolic syndrome produced a shift in fuel oxidation that was independent of the weight loss, decreased adiposity, and improved insulin sensitivity that was common to both diets.

### Methionine-SAM metabolism-dependent ubiquinone synthesis is crucial for ROS accumulation in ferroptosis induction [^4e9d5a77]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Methionine might regulate cystine deprivation-induced ferroptosis through either itself or downstream metabolites. To test, we firstly performed a metabolomics analysis of HT1080 cells that were cultured in medium lacking cystine or lacking both cystine and methionine. The metabolomics results containing full profile of the metabolites was subjected to cluster assay, and the triplicates of each group were automatically clustered together (Fig. S 6A), indicating better homogeneity of the data in each condition. Then, we filtrated the metabolomics data with the threshold fold change (FC) ≥ 2 and p < 0.05. The results showed that the cellular cysteine and GSH levels were expectedly depressed upon cystine limitation (Fig. S 6B, C); meanwhile, cellular SAM level was significantly reduced once methionine restriction (Figs. 2C and S 2C). Then, MEF cells were cultured in methionine-free media supplied with SAM, SAH, Hcy, Cta or cysteine, respectively. We found that only supply of SAM could reverse methionine restriction-inhibited ferroptosis (lipid peroxidation and cell death) that was induced by cystine deprivation (Fig. 2D, E). Likewise, only SAM rescued PTGS2 expression, that was blocked once methionine deprived (Fig. 2F). In a variety of types of cells including HT1080, human OS-RC-2, Caki-1, 786-O and ACHN renal carcinoma cells, human HT29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and mouse HL-1 cardiomyocytes, methionine deprivation significantly impairs ferroptosis, and methionine-derived SAM is required by ferroptosis (Figs. 2G, H and S 6D–G), revealing the universality of the role of methionine metabolism in cystine restriction induced-ferroptosis. Although these results indicated that methionine may regulate ferroptosis through SAM, the possibility that methionine regulates ferroptosis by its own had not been ruled out. Methionine adenosyltransferases 2A (MAT2A), the key enzyme for methionine metabolism, catalyzes the biosynthesis of SAM from methionine and expresses in various tissues (Figs. 1H, I and S 3 and 4). To further confirm that methionine functions through SAM, we sought to analyze the effect of MAT2A on ferroptosis. MAT2A inhibitor FIDAS-5 could significantly inhibit MEF, HT1080, OS-RC-2 and HL-1 cells undergoing ferroptosis that was induced by deprivation of cystine or blockage of cystine uptake in the presence of methionine (Figs. 2I, J and S 7A–D). Likewise, another MAT2A inhibitor PF-9366exhibited the similar effect as expected (Fig. S 7E–H). In addition, we designed siRNA targeting MAT2A and found that knockdown of MAT2A in HT1080 cells suppressed ferroptosis induced by cystine deprivation, which was reversed by SAM compensation (Figs. 2K, L and S 8A). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrated that SAM is the executor in methionine-implicated ferroptosis.

### Concentration-dependent linkage of dietary methionine restriction to the components of its metabolic phenotype [^00219e28]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Restricting dietary methionine to 0.17% produces a series of physiological responses through coordinated transcriptional effects in liver and adipose tissue. The goal of the present work was to determine the threshold concentrations above and below 0.17% at which the beneficial responses to 0.17% dietary methionine are preserved.

Methods

Diets were formulated to restrict methionine to different degrees, followed by evaluation of the transcriptional and physiological responses to the different diets.

Results

Restriction of dietary methionine to 0.25%, but not 0.34%, was partially effective in reproducing the metabolic phenotype produced by restriction of methionine to 0.17%, while restriction of methionine to 0.12% reproduced the responses produced by restriction to 0.17% but failed to support growth and caused excessive weight loss. Restriction beyond 0.12% initiated responses characteristic of essential amino acid deprivation including food aversion and rapid weight loss.

Conclusions

Restriction of dietary methionine to levels above 0.25% was without effect, while restriction to levels below 0.12% produced responses characteristic of essential amino acid deprivation. In addition, although restriction of dietary methionine to 0.12% did not evoke essential amino acid deprivation responses, it provided insufficient methionine to support growth. The ideal range of dietary methionine restriction was from 0.17% to 0.25%.

### Chronic liver diseases and the potential use of S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a hepatoprotector [^6470a2ff]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic liver diseases result in overall deterioration of health status and changes in metabolism. The search for strategies to control and combat these hepatic diseases has witnessed a great boom in the last decades. Nutritional therapy for controlling and managing liver diseases may be a positive influence as it improves the function of the liver. In this review, we focus mainly on describing liver conditions such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and intrahepatic cholestasis as well as using S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a dietary supplement and its potential alternative therapeutic effect to correct the hepatic dysfunction associated with these conditions.

### A protein functionalization platform based on selective reactions at methionine residues [^938a43e9]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

Nature has a remarkable ability to carry out site-selective post-translational modification of proteins, therefore enabling a marked increase in their functional diversity 1. Inspired by this, chemical tools have been developed for the synthetic manipulation of protein structure and function, and have become essential to the continued advancement of chemical biology, molecular biology and medicine. However, the number of chemical transformations that are suitable for effective protein functionalization is limited, because the stringent demands inherent to biological systems preclude the applicability of many potential processes 2. These chemical transformations often need to be selective at a single site on a protein, proceed with very fast reaction rates, operate under biologically ambient conditions and should provide homogeneous products with near-perfect conversion 2–7. Although many bioconjugation methods exist at cysteine, lysine and tyrosine, a method targeting a less-explored amino acid would considerably expand the protein functionalization toolbox. Here we report the development of a multifaceted approach to protein functionalization based on chemoselective labelling at methionine residues. By exploiting the electrophilic reactivity of a bespoke hypervalent iodine reagent, the S-Me group in the side chain of methionine can be targeted. The bioconjugation reaction is fast, selective, operates at low-micromolar concentrations and is complementary to existing bioconjugation strategies. Moreover, it produces a protein conjugate that is itself a high-energy intermediate with reactive properties and can serve as a platform for the development of secondary, visible-light-mediated bioorthogonal protein functionalization processes. The merger of these approaches provides a versatile platform for the development of distinct transformations that deliver information-rich protein conjugates directly from the native biomacromolecules.

### Amino acids in cancer [^502bb8fb]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Amino acids as epigenetic and posttranscriptional regulators

Epigenetic alterations are heritable features that affect cellular phenotypes by modifying gene expression independent of the DNA sequence. Epigenetic control of gene expression is fine-tuned by a balance between enzymes that "write" regulatory marks onto DNA and histone proteins (e.g. DNA- and histone methyltransferases and histone acetyltransferases) and other enzymes that "erase" these same marks (e.g. histone deacetylases, histone demethylases, and DNA demethylases). DNA methylation is mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which catalyze the covalent addition of a methyl group to cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine in the context of CpG dinucleotides. In general, methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions inhibits transcription. Global DNA hypomethylation and hypermethylation of promoters of tumor suppressor genes and homeobox genes is a ubiquitous feature of the cancer genome of DNA –. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) catalyze the transfer of mono- to tri-methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins. Histone methylation can be involved in either activation or repression of gene expression, depending on which residue is modified and how many methyl groups are incorporated. Methionine, by serving as the methyl group donor for methylation, is the major amino acid that contributes to epigenetic regulation (Fig. 3a). Both DNMTs and HMTs utilize S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. SAM is generated in the methionine cycle by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) using methionine and ATP as substrates. After donating a methyl group, SAM becomes S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH), which inhibits both DNMTs and HMTs (Fig. 3a). Consequently, alterations in the SAM/SAH ratio regulate these methyltransferases' activity. The importance of SAM in tumor survival has been observed in various studies where cancer cells' unique requirement for methionine is based on SAM dependence, not methionine dependence. The enhanced methionine cycle leads to an excess supply of SAM. This in turn causes DNA hypermethylation and inappropriate gene silencing as well as aberrant histone methylation, and enhanced tumor growth. Threonine catabolism mediated by threonine dehydrogenase (TDH) can also provide a precursor for SAM (Fig. 3a). Glycine from the TDH reaction facilitates one-carbon metabolism via the glycine cleavage system. Threonine depletion or TDH deletion reduces SAM levels and decreases trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine residue 4 (H3Kme3). Although TDH enzyme function is lost in humans, it certainly suggests that human tumorigenesis can be related to a dysregulation in this metabolic pathway (e.g. upregulation of threonine uptake).

### 14C-methionine uptake as a potential marker of inflammatory processes after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion [^8dc8dec8]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

A relationship between l-[methyl-(11)C]methionine ((11)C-methionine) uptake and angiogenesis has been suggested in gliomas. However, methionine uptake in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion has received little attention. We investigated the serial changes and mechanisms of (14)C-methionine uptake in a rat model of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.

Methods

The left coronary artery was occluded for 30 min, followed by reperfusion for 1–28 d. At the time of the study, (14)C-methionine (0.74 MBq) and (201)Tl (14.8 MBq) were injected intravenously at 20 and 10 min before sacrifice, respectively. One minute before sacrifice, the left coronary artery was reoccluded, and (99m)Tc-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (150–180 MBq) was injected to verify the area at risk. Histologic sections of the heart were immunohistochemically analyzed using anti-CD68, anti-smooth-muscle α-actin (SMA), and antitroponin I and compared with the autoradiography findings.

Results

Both (14)C-methionine (uptake ratio, 0.71 ± 0.13) and (201)Tl uptake were reduced in the area at risk at 1 d after reperfusion. However, 3 d after reperfusion, an increased (14)C-methionine uptake (1.79 ± 0.23) was observed corresponding to the area of still-reduced (201)Tl uptake, and the (14)C-methionine uptake gradually declined until 28 d. The increased (14)C-methionine uptake area at 3 and 7 d corresponded well to the macrophage infiltrations demonstrated by positive CD68 staining. Anti-SMA staining appeared at 7 d, after which CD68 staining was gradually replaced by the SMA staining, suggesting that methionine uptake in the early phase after ischemia and reperfusion might reflect inflammatory activity.

Conclusion

(14)C-methionine accumulated in the infarcted area, and its uptake corresponded closely to macrophage infiltration at 3–7 d after reperfusion. Methionine imaging may be useful for inflammatory imaging early after myocardial infarction.

### Association of methionine to homocysteine status with brain magnetic resonance imaging measures and risk of dementia [^52ae212d]. JAMA Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Impairment of methylation status (ie, methionine to homocysteine ratio) may be a modifiable risk factor for structural brain changes and incident dementia.

Objective

To investigate the association of serum markers of methylation status and sulfur amino acids with risk of incident dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD), and the rate of total brain tissue volume loss during 6 years.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based longitudinal study was performed from March 21, 2001, to October 10, 2010, in a sample of 2570 individuals aged 60 to 102 years from the Swedish Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen who were dementia free at baseline and underwent comprehensive examinations and structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 2 to 3 occasions during 6 years. Data analysis was performed from March 1, 2018, to October 1, 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident dementia, AD, and the rate of total brain volume loss.

Results

This study included 2570 individuals (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [10.4] years; 1331 [56.5%] female). The methionine to homocysteine ratio was higher in individuals who consumed vitamin supplements (median, 1.9; interquartile range [IQR], 1.5–2.6) compared with those who did not (median, 1.8; IQR, 1.3–2.3; P < .001) and increased per each quartile increase of vitamin B12 or folate. In the multiadjusted model, an elevated baseline serum total homocysteine level was associated with an increased risk of dementia and AD during 6 years: for the highest homocysteine quartile compared with the lowest, the hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.60 (95% CI, 1.01–2.55) for dementia and 2.33 (95% CI, 1.26–4.30) for AD. In contrast, elevated concentrations of methionine were associated with a decreased risk of dementia (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36–0.81) for the highest quartile compared with the lowest. Higher values of the methionine to homocysteine ratio were significantly associated with lower risk of dementia and AD: for the fourth methionine-homocysteine quartile compared with the first quartile, the HR was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.27–0.71) for incident dementia and 0.43 (95% CI, 0.23–0.80) for AD. In the multiadjusted linear mixed models, a higher methionine to homocysteine ratio was associated with a decreased rate of total brain tissue volume loss during the study period (β [SE] per 1-SD increase, 0.038 [0.014]; P = 0.007).

Conclusions and Relevance

The methionine to homocysteine status was associated with dementia development and structural brain changes during the 6-year study period, suggesting that a higher methionine to homocysteine ratio may be important in reducing the rate of brain atrophy and decreasing the risk of dementia in older adults.

### Methionine deprivation inhibits glioma proliferation and EMT via the TP53TG1 / miR-96-5p / STK17B ceRNA pathway [^c1fee3e9]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Methionine deprivation exerts inhibitory effects on glioma in vitro and in vivo

We cultured LN229 and U251 glioma cells in regular and methionine-deprived mediums for 48 h to investigate the effect of methionine deprivation on glioma cells. Compared with the group cultured in a normal medium, the viability of glioma cells cultured in a methionine-deprived medium for 48 h showed a significant reduction (Fig. 1A). Methionine deprivation's impact on glioma cell proliferation was confirmed using a colony formation assay. A significant decrease in colony counts of LN229 and U251 cells cultured under methionine-deprived conditions was observed (Fig. 1B). Additional confirmation was attained using the EdU assay, which exhibited a notably lower proportion of green fluorescence (indicating cell proliferation activity) in the methionine-deprived group than in the normal group (Fig. 1C). The transwell assay demonstrated that the malignant migration and invasion abilities of glioma cells were weakened after methionine deprivation (Fig. 1D). To validate these findings in vivo, we established an ectopic planting model in nude mice by inoculating them with LN229 glioma cells. The glioma tissues of the methionine-deprived diet group exhibited evidently smaller volume and lower weight than those of the normal feeding group, confirming the earlier in vitro results (Fig. 1E).

### Copper (I)-nitrene platform for chemoproteomic profiling of methionine [^e8f7f753]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite being often post-translationally excised and having a low abundance of proteins (around 2%), methionine plays an important role in various cell-regulatory processes –. The redox cycle between methionine and methionine sulfoxide provides an excellent antioxidant defense platform against various oxidizing species in cells –. Studies have suggested that impairment of those functions result in varying diseases, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases –. The high importance of methionine in regulating biological processes and its implication in diseases makes methionine extremely valuable in chemoproteomics. However, due to the high kinetic reactivity of methionine to form methionine sulfoxide and its poor hydrophilicity most of the methionine residues are found in the interior hydrophobic core, rendering their labeling difficult. Therefore, to date, only a few strategies have been developed for selective modification of methionine, including S -alkylation, sulfimidation using oxaziridines, and alkylation via α-thiol radicals –. Out of the three strategies, only oxaziridine has been used for chemoproteomic profiling of methionine because other strategies are limited by the requirement of acidic pH (pH~3), and high excess of probes for the efficient protein labeling. As such, we postulate utilizing a transition-metal catalyzed nitrene pathway as an alternative strategy for methionine labeling (Fig. 1a). This mechanistically different methionine labeling technique would lead to the identification and discovery of ligandable proteins and hyperreactive methionine residues at the active sites that has not been discovered before. In this work, we introduce the Copper(I)-nitrene platform (CuNiP) for the sulfonyl sulfimidation of methionine under mild physiological conditions (Fig. 1b). We demonstrate that the reaction is robust, chemoselective, and exhibits broad substrate scope by efficient modification of a range of bioactive peptides, intact proteins of broad molecular weights (6.5–79.5 kDa), complex whole cell lysates and live cells with varying payloads. Most importantly, the resulting sulfonyl sulfimide is extremely stable towards hydrolysis due to the sulfonyl moiety that increases the electron density on nitrogen, thus reducing the electrophilicity of the sulfimide bond towards hydrolysis. The chemoproteomic profiling of human proteome by these mechanistically variable probes led to the discovery of diverse classes of proteins with hyperactive methionine that has not been identified before, thus providing additional ligandable sites (Fig. 1b).

### Methionine restriction-induced sulfur deficiency impairs antitumour immunity partially through gut microbiota [^44cc2f04]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Restriction of methionine (MR), a sulfur-containing essential amino acid, has been reported to repress cancer growth and improve therapeutic responses in several preclinical settings. However, how MR impacts cancer progression in the context of the intact immune system is unknown. Here we report that while inhibiting cancer growth in immunocompromised mice, MR reduces T cell abundance, exacerbates tumour growth and impairs tumour response to immunotherapy in immunocompetent male and female mice. Mechanistically, MR reduces microbial production of hydrogen sulfide, which is critical for immune cell survival/activation. Dietary supplementation of a hydrogen sulfide donor or a precursor, or methionine, stimulates antitumour immunity and suppresses tumour progression. Our findings reveal an unexpected negative interaction between MR, sulfur deficiency and antitumour immunity and further uncover a vital role of gut microbiota in mediating this interaction. Our study suggests that any possible anticancer benefits of MR require careful consideration of both the microbiota and the immune system.

### A comparative study on the uptake and incorporation of radiolabeled methionine, choline and fluorodeoxyglucose in human astrocytoma [^4a0c6376]. Molecular Imaging and Biology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The goal of this investigation was to evaluate uptake and incorporation of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG), 11C-methionine, and 11C-choline in 17 patients suspected of grade-II and grade-III tumors using positron emission tomography (PET) and use in vitro astrocytoma cell lines in order to support in vivo findings.

Methods

Seventeen patients with suspected astrocytomas (9 grade-II and 8 grade-III) were studied by PET with FDG and 11C-methionine; and one patient (grade-III) with FDG, 11C-methionine and 11C-choline. Uptake of PET molecular imaging probe was quantitative based on tumor to corresponding contralateral-region uptake ratio, tumor to mean-cortical-uptake ratio, and tumor to white matter uptake ratio. This was correlated with World Health Organization histology grading system and clinical follow-up. Uptake and incorporation of 3H-methionine, 3H-choline and FDG into lipid, RNA, DNA, and protein were investigated in a grade-III human tumor brain-14 astrocytoma cell line.

Results

A time-dependent increase in the total uptake of 3H-methionine, 3H-choline and FDG was observed in human tumor brain-14 astrocytoma-III cell line. 3H-methionine was incorporated predominantly into proteins (in excess of 40% at 1 h) while 3H-choline incorporated primarily into lipids (in excess of 60% at 1 hr). Total uptake of FDG was accounted for in the free-pool supernatant fraction. In all patients, PET images of 11C-methionine and FDG provided higher tumor to white matter ratios than tumor to corresponding contra-lateral region ratios and tumor to mean cortical uptake ratios. In grade II patients, FDG did not exhibit significant increase in tumor uptake, while 11C-methionine was a good predictor with ratios of approximately 1.50 ± 0.48. In grade III patients, both FDG and 11C-methionine exhibited higher ratios than for grade II, with 11C-methionine being the greatest (ratios of 2.50 ± 0.85), possibly suggesting enhanced protein synthesis. With respect to tumor delineating potential, 11C-choline may be equal to or slightly better than 11C-methionine in the subject evaluated with all three probes.

Conclusions

Results suggest that a combination of FDG and 11C-methionine is useful in the prediction of histological grade of astrocytomas. In addition, 11C-methionine is better than FDG in delineating tumor boundary for low-grade gliomas. In vitro results suggest that 3H-methionine is significantly incorporated into proteins and provides the major driving force in the uptake of 11C-methionine observed in PET images.

### Unveiling the metabolic landscape of pulmonary hypertension: insights from metabolomics [^9cc6130d]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Methionine

Methionine serves as a precursor for various crucial compounds, including succinyl-CoA, homocysteine, cysteine, creatine, and carnitine. Methionine undergoes conversion to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a highly active molecule that serves as a methyl donor. SAM can be metabolized to homocysteine (Hcy). Hcy can be remethylated to methionine. SAM can be converted to adenosine, subsequently regenerating methionine. Recent research has highlighted the regulatory role of methionine in the synthesis of polyamines and glutathione. It has been reported that PH patients exhibit methionine metabolism dysregulation. In a hypoxia-induced PH rat model, the methionine metabolism pathway was the top-ranked pathway. Zhao et al. reported downregulated levels of homoserine and methionine, while adenosine was upregulated. Notably, the second pathway was the betaine metabolism pathway. As is well known, betaine functions as a methyl donor in the methionine cycle. Betaine has been identified as a potential biomarker, and elevated plasma betaine levels are linked to PH severity. However, betaine can improve PH by inhibiting SMC proliferation and exerting anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, the elevation in betaine levels may not be a cause but rather a consequence of disease progression. This phenomenon could be related to the accumulation of low methylation in vivo due to betaine serving as a methyl donor for methionine or acting as an osmolyte.

### Serum S-adenosylmethionine, but not methionine, increases in response to overfeeding in humans [^622f9dd5]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2016). Low credibility.

In summary, serum SAM increased with short-term overfeeding, in proportion to the fat mass gained. This finding extends previously reported cross-sectional associations of SAM with BMI and fat mass, and further documents an interaction of the sulfur amino-acid pathway with energy metabolism. Serum methionine was unchanged, despite increased protein intake, suggesting that conversion to SAM may stabilize methionine levels with high intake. Whether the overfeeding-associated SAM changes have epigenetic consequences, particularly in genes whose methylation pattern is linked to BMI, is an interesting question for further study.

### Alterations of methionine metabolism in hepatocarcinogenesis: the emergent role of glycine N-methyltransferase in liver injury [^a790b54a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Numerous regulatory mechanisms contribute to maintaining an optimal metabolism of folate, methyl groups and homocysteine. The liver is the principal organ in which the excess of methionine is degraded. In it different enzymes, including MATI/III, CBS, BHMT and GNMT, maintain homocysteine at adequate level. Furthermore, the so-called SAM "long-range" interactions, which affect enzymes at distance in the metabolic network, induces CBS activation (Fig. 1); this enhances the transsulfuration pathway and inhibits BHMT and MeTHFR (Fig. 1), thus decreasing homocysteine re-methylation to methionine. Indeed, MATI/III Michaelis constant (K m) is so high that the elevated methionine liver levels produce large amounts of SAM. High SAM levels inhibit MTHFR while stimulating CBS activity (Fig. 1). Therefore, a methionine excess, by producing a SAM excess, induces homocysteine degradation through the transsulfuration pathway, whereas low methionine and SAM levels activate homocysteine re-methylation. Furthermore, SAM allosterically inhibits MeTHFR, thus decreasing the production of 5-methyl-TNF for the subsequent remethylation of homocysteine (Fig. 1). SAM also inhibits homocysteine remethylation by inhibiting the expression of BHMT. These SAM effects are associated with the activation of CBS and consequent homocysteine consumption by transsulfuration pathway (Fig. 1).

GNMT binds DMGDH and SARDH (Fig. 1) and is allosterically inhibited by 5-methyl-THF. In addition to the allosteric regulation, phosphorylation of GNMT represents an additional post-translational control of this protein.

The central role of the methionine and folate cycles in cell metabolism also depends on the multiple interactions of these cycles with cell metabolism. Folate cycle is involved in dTMP synthesis, thus allowing DNA production and synthesis of purine and nucleic acids synthesis. Furthermore, SAM decarboxylation by a specific decarboxylase is a fundamental step of polyamine biosynthesis. 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA), an end-product of this biosynthesis, inhibits SAM-decarboxylase. This control step is regulated by the activity of MTA phosphorylase, which catalyzes the transformation of MTA into 5-methylthioribose and adenine, allowing the methionine resynthesis in the "salvage pathway" (Fig. 1).

### PRMT1 orchestrates with SAMTOR to govern mTORC1 methionine sensing via arg-methylation of NPRL2 [^379277a9]. Cell Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Methionine is an essential branch of diverse nutrient inputs that dictate mTORC1 activation. In the absence of methionine, SAMTOR binds to GATOR1 and inhibits mTORC1 signaling. However, how mTORC1 is activated upon methionine stimulation remains largely elusive. Here, we report that PRMT1 senses methionine/SAM by utilizing SAM as a cofactor for an enzymatic activity-based regulation of mTORC1 signaling. Under methionine-sufficient conditions, elevated cytosolic SAM releases SAMTOR from GATOR1, which confers the association of PRMT1 with GATOR1. Subsequently, SAM-loaded PRMT1 methylates NPRL2, the catalytic subunit of GATOR1, thereby suppressing its GAP activity and leading to mTORC1 activation. Notably, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PRMT1 impedes hepatic methionine sensing by mTORC1 and improves insulin sensitivity in aged mice, establishing the role of PRMT1-mediated methionine sensing at physiological levels. Thus, PRMT1 coordinates with SAMTOR to form the methionine-sensing apparatus of mTORC1 signaling.

### Methionine metabolism shapes T helper cell responses through regulation of epigenetic reprogramming [^978f20b2]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Epigenetic modifications on DNA and histones regulate gene expression by modulating chromatin accessibility to transcription machinery. Here we identify methionine as a key nutrient affecting epigenetic reprogramming in CD4 + T helper (Th) cells. Using metabolomics, we showed that methionine is rapidly taken up by activated T cells and serves as the major substrate for biosynthesis of the universal methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Methionine was required to maintain intracellular SAM pools in T cells. Methionine restriction reduced histone H3K4 methylation (H3K4me3) at the promoter regions of key genes involved in Th17 cell proliferation and cytokine production. Applied to the mouse model of multiple sclerosis (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), dietary methionine restriction reduced the expansion of pathogenic Th17 cells in vivo, leading to reduced T cell-mediated neuroinflammation and disease onset. Our data identify methionine as a key nutritional factor shaping Th cell proliferation and function in part through regulation of histone methylation.

### Alterations of methionine metabolism in hepatocarcinogenesis: the emergent role of glycine N-methyltransferase in liver injury [^8d280d32]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Another source of methionine is the so called "folates cycle" in which 5-tetrahydrofolate (THF) is oxidized to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (MeTHF), in a reaction catalyzed by sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH). MeTHF is transformed to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) by a specific reductase (MeTHFR). Homocysteine plus MTHF leads to methionine and THF in a reaction catalyzed by a 5-methyltetrahydrofolate homocysteine transferase (MHMT) that requires cobalamin as cofactor (Fig. 1).

Glycine methyltransferase (GNMT) plays a fundamental role in methyl group supply, DNA methylation, and nucleotide biosynthesis. GNMT catalyzes the SAM-dependent methylation of glycine to form sarcosine (Fig. 1). SARDH catalyzes glycine resynthesis associated with the formation of MeTHF from THF. GNMT expression regulates the cellular folate status: it binds MTHF and is inhibited by it and increases cellular MTHF retention thus allowing MTHF-dependent remethylation. GNMT and PEMT are among the largest consumers of methyl groups derived from SAM and thus play a major role in homocysteine generation and regulation of methyl group metabolism.

Patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency may also have elevated plasma methionine concentrations. Treatment with CYSTADANE may further increase methionine concentrations due to the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Cerebral edema has been reported in patients with hypermethioninemia, including patients treated with CYSTADANE [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Monitor plasma methionine concentrations in patients with CBS deficiency. Plasma methionine concentrations should be kept below 1,000 micromol/L through dietary modification and, if necessary, a reduction of CYSTADANE dosage.

### Methylation-related metabolic effects of D4 dopamine receptor expression and activation [^c4a7fba1]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Previous studies demonstrated the unique ability of D4 dopamine receptors (D4Rs) to carry out phospholipid methylation (PLM) in response to dopamine stimulation. – PLM activity involves conformation-dependent methyl donation by a methionine side chain in the cytoplasmic extension of transmembrane helix #6 (M313 in the D4.4R), in a cyclic process analogous to the well-described methionine-based methylation cycle (Fig. 1a). The D4R-mediated PLM cycle depends on replenishing methyl groups from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (methylTHF) provided by methionine synthase (MS), and also requires methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH). As illustrated in Fig. 1a, MS transfers a methyl group from methylTHF to restore the D4R methionine residue (D4MET), in addition to its canonical role in converting free homocysteine (HCY) to methionine. These two competing reactions imply that D4R-mediated dopamine-stimulated PLM activity could influence canonical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methionine cycle activity.

Fig. 1
Dopamine-stimulated PLM in D4R-expressing CHO cells.

a The dopamine-stimulated D4R-mediated PLM cycle (lower left) functions in parallel to the canonical methionine cycle (lower right) and is completely dependent on MS activity and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (methylTHF).

What is homocysteine?

Homocysteine is derived from the essential amino acid methionine, which is abundant in animal sources of protein. Methionine is converted to homocysteine via the intermediate S-adenosylmethionine, which acts as a methyl donor, as in several other biochemical processes such as DNA methylation and creatine and phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Homocysteine can be remethylated back to methionine or converted to cysteine by transsulfuration (figure 1).

Our understanding of the pathophysiology of the remethylation disorders and MTHFR deficiency is incomplete. At present, there are five main hypotheses: (A) direct toxicity of metabolites, (B) missing products, (C) impaired methylation capacity, (D) oxidative stress, (E) impaired non-enzymatic protein functions.
(A) Hyperhomocysteinaemias are predominantly associated with neurocognitive and vascular pathology. Homocysteine and its metabolic product, homocysteic acid, have been implicated in provocation of seizures in rats (Kubová et al; Mares et al). Besides its impact on renal function, accumulation of MMA along with dicarboxylic acids like 2-methylcitrate and propionyl-CoA have been found to induce synergistic mitochondrial dysfunction (Morath et al; Zsengellér et al).
(B) Impaired methionine synthase activity with accumulation of intracellular 5-MTHF (folate trap) and subsequent disruption of nucleotide synthesis compromise rapidly proliferating tissues such as bone marrow or epithelia. In MTHFR deficiency, this trapping of folates is not found but 5-methylTHF synthesis is impaired, resulting in low levels of methyl-tetrahydrofolate (CH3-THF) in the central nervous system of unknown significance (Schiff and Blom).
(C) Remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) is an important mechanism that maintains the methylation capacity of the organism and removes excess Hcy. Methylation reactions such as DNA methylation, creatine and myelin synthesis utilise S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a metabolite formed from Met as the methyl group donor. Accordingly, any disorder or disruption of the Met-Hcy-SAM pathway affects methylation capacity by impairing multiple metabolic systems and processes (King et al; Surtees et al).
(D) Enhanced oxidative stress due to a disturbance of glutathione metabolism has been shown in patients with the cblC defect and may contribute to the underlying pathophysiology (Pastore et al).
(E) Recent data suggest that not only the accumulation of metabolites but also the perturbed non-enzymatic functions, e.g. of the MMACHC protein may add to the pathophysiology behind the disease (Moreno-Garcia et al; Brooks et al).

### Effect of L-methionine on hot flashes in postmenopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^e545a290]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Based on a common mechanism of action with gabapentin, we investigated the effects of L-methionine on hot flashes in postmenopausal women.

Methods

After a 1-week baseline period, 51 postmenopausal women experiencing at least five moderate-severe hot flashes per day were randomized to one of three groups in a 13:13:25 ratio: placebo/placebo, placebo/L-methionine, or L-methionine/L-methionine, respectively (phase 1/phase 2). Phase 1 was 12 weeks long, and phase 2 was 8 weeks long. Participants took 1 g PO BID in phase 1 and 2 g PO BID in phase 2 of either L-methionine or placebo. All participants also took folate 1 mg and methylcobalamin 0.5 mg a day to help minimize the L-methionine-induced elevation in serum homocysteine. The primary outcome variable was the percent change in hot flash composite score from baseline to week 12 obtained from participants' daily hot flash diaries.

Results

In phases 1 and 2, there were no significant differences between the L-methionine and placebo groups for any of the hot flash outcome measures. At week 12, there was a mean of 37.4% decrease in hot flash composite score compared with baseline in the L-methionine group and a mean of 33.4% decrease in the placebo group (P = 0.60). There were expected significant increases in fasting serum homocysteine (1.7 and 5.8 micromol/L) and fasting serum methionine (13.9 and 22.3 micromol/L) at weeks 12 and 20, respectively, associated with the two doses of L-methionine therapy relative to placebo therapy.

Conclusions

L-methionine therapy seems to be ineffective in the treatment of hot flashes in postmenopausal women.

Methionine-35 oxidation of Aβ

A second commonly detected Cu 2+ -induced modification of Aβ in plaques is the reversible modification of oxidation-sensitive methionine 35 to its sulfoxide or its further irreversible oxidation product methionine sulfone. APP23 transgenic mice show methionine oxidized forms of Aβ 1–40 and methionine oxidized Aβ is also abundantly detected in AD patient brains. The sulfoxide intermediate can be reduced by the action of peptide–methionine sulfoxide reductase, although levels of this enzyme in the AD brain were reportedly reduced. In line with this observation, upon knock-out of methionine sulfoxide reductase A in a human amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) mouse model, levels of soluble methionine sulfoxide Aβ were increased and associated with defects in mitochondrial respiration and cytochrome c oxidase activity. In turn, exposure of rat neuroblastoma cell line IMR-32 to methionine-oxidized Aβ 1–42 induced an increase in levels of mRNA expression and activity of methionine sulfoxide reductase type A, suggesting that levels of methionine sulfoxide reductase A and methionine-oxidized Aβ 1–42 may affect each other in a bidirectional manner. Somewhat conflicting results have been published on the effect of methionine-35 oxidation on Aβ aggregation. For example, it was shown that H 2 O 2 /Cu 2+ -induced methionine-35 oxidation slows down ThT-positive Aβ fibril formation of commercially derived Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 compared to wild type Aβ without affecting morphological features of the formed Aβ fibrils as observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Marked differences in response to H 2 O 2 induced methionine oxidation of Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 were observed in a different study showing that oxidation of Aβ 1–40 increases fibril formation kinetics while slowing down fibril formation of Aβ 1–42 suggesting an isoform differential effect. Imaging of the resulting fibers using TEM showed that fibers generated by oxidized Aβ 1–40 and Aβ 1–42 were both highly fragmented compared to unoxidized peptide. In another study, methionine 35 of synthesized Aβ 1–42 was oxidized by exposure to H 2 O 2 and oxidation was validated using mass spectrometry. Subsequent atomic force microscopy (AFM) and circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that methionine oxidation in this way hindered the typical random coil to β-sheet conversion and filamentous morphology characteristic for Aβ fibril formation. Early aggregate formation of methionine oxidized Aβ 1–40 was studied using electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry showing that trimer formation was inhibited without affecting dimer assembly. One of the mechanisms suggested to affect the decreased aggregation propensity of Aβ upon oxidation of methionine 35 was that oxidation results in a reduced hydrophobicity of Aβ, while hydrophobicity is one of the main driving forces for Aβ self-assembly. An oxidation-induced change in hydrophobicity was experimentally illustrated for apolipoprotein A-I, which, upon oxidation, affected the ability of this protein to interact with lipids. It is difficult to delineate the precise origin of the diversity in results that have been obtained in aggregation studies of Aβ in response to methionine oxidation, but it is likely that variations in sample preparation, origin and incubation conditions may contribute as aggregation properties are sensitively affected by these parameters.

Treatments and follow-up

Low-methionine diet

Dietary methionine restriction was initiated after diagnosis in all patients. However, compliance was challenging among young patients, resulting in fluctuations in serum methionine concentrations. No marked reductions to normal in methionine concentrations were observed with dietary therapy.

Drug therapy

Eight patients received vitamin B6 before genetic analysis, but no significant effects were observed. Blood methionine levels decreased in six children who received oral ademethionine 1,4-butanedisulfonate (500–1000 mg/day) in addition to a low-methionine diet. Their blood methionine concentrations decreased from 926 to 1685 µmol/L to 502–757 µmol/L after 1 month.

One patient (Patient 2) benefited from newborn screening and was initially managed with dietary control and ademethionine 1,4-butanedisulfonate. However, development and progression of white matter lesions were observed when he was 7 years old. After specialist consultation and obtaining consent from his family, segmental living-donor liver transplantation from his father was performed at the age of 8 years. His blood methionine concentration decreased from 1200 µmol/L to 108 µmol/L one week after liver transplantation, and remained stable thereafter (Fig. 2). At present, he is 11 years old and studying in primary school. His physical and psychomotor development have remained good, and the white matter of his brain has shown significant improvement.

Fig. 2
Blood methionine concentrations of Patient 2 before and after liver transplantation. Before liver transplantation, the blood methionine concentrations of Patient 2 were markedly elevated (418–1200 µmol/L). After liver transplantation, the patient's blood methionine concentration decreased rapidly to the normal level (10–50 µmol/L)

### Regulation of the one carbon folate cycle as a shared metabolic signature of longevity [^e3e56f8e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

What is the mechanism by which dhfr-1i and 5MTHF reduction trigger longevity? Several lines of evidence argue that it acts through methionine restriction (MR) and modulation of methionine cycle intermediates. First, we observed that dhrf-1 knockdown perturbs the methionine cycle, leading to reduced levels of methionine and S -adenosyl methionine and elevated levels of homocysteine. Second, we observed changes in gene expression associated with this process. Third, a comparison of metabolomic profiles from dhfr-1i and metr-1i methionine synthase revealed significant overlap. Fourth, methionine supplementation of dhfr-1i reversed longevity in a dose-dependent manner. Altogether these findings indicate that methionine restriction is causally linked to dhfr-1i life extension. Strikingly we saw similar changes in folate and methionine pools in tissues of Irs1 −/− knockout mice and daf-2/InsR mutant worms, revealing that the control of the folate cycle by insulin/IGF signaling is evolutionarily conserved. Whether these changes are causally connected to life span regulation in mammals remains to be seen.

### Cancer SLC43A2 alters T cell methionine metabolism and histone methylation [^df390e2e]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abnormal epigenetic patterns correlate with effector T cell malfunction in tumours 1–4, but the cause of this link is unknown. Here we show that tumour cells disrupt methionine metabolism in CD8 + T cells, thereby lowering intracellular levels of methionine and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and resulting in loss of dimethylation at lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79me2). Loss of H3K79me2 led to low expression of STAT5 and impaired T cell immunity. Mechanistically, tumour cells avidly consumed methionine and outcompeted T cells for methionine by expressing high levels of the methionine transporter SLC43A2. Genetic and biochemical inhibition of tumour SLC43A2 restored H3K79me2 in T cells, thereby boosting spontaneous and checkpoint-induced tumour immunity. Moreover, methionine supplementation improved the expression of H3K79me2 and STAT5 in T cells, and this was accompanied by increased T cell immunity in tumour-bearing mice and patients with colon cancer. Clinically, tumour SLC43A2 correlated negatively with T cell histone methylation and functional gene signatures. Our results identify a mechanistic connection between methionine metabolism, histone patterns, and T cell immunity in the tumour microenvironment. Thus, cancer methionine consumption is an immune evasion mechanism, and targeting cancer methionine signalling may provide an immunotherapeutic approach.

### Regulation of thrombosis and vascular function by protein methionine oxidation [^2c2ef2db]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Redox biology is fundamental to both normal cellular homeostasis and pathological states associated with excessive oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species function not only as signaling molecules but also as redox regulators of protein function. In the vascular system, redox reactions help regulate key physiologic responses such as cell adhesion, vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis, inflammatory gene expression, and apoptosis. During pathologic states, altered redox balance can cause vascular cell dysfunction and affect the equilibrium between procoagulant and anticoagulant systems, contributing to thrombotic vascular disease. This review focuses on the emerging role of a specific reversible redox reaction, protein methionine oxidation, in vascular disease and thrombosis. A growing number of cardiovascular and hemostatic proteins are recognized to undergo reversible methionine oxidation, in which methionine residues are posttranslationally oxidized to methionine sulfoxide. Protein methionine oxidation can be reversed by the action of stereospecific enzymes known as methionine sulfoxide reductases. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is a prototypical methionine redox sensor that responds to changes in the intracellular redox state via reversible oxidation of tandem methionine residues in its regulatory domain. Several other proteins with oxidation-sensitive methionine residues, including apolipoprotein A-I, thrombomodulin, and von Willebrand factor, may contribute to vascular disease and thrombosis.

Parenteral nutrition (PN) folate requirements and historical issues — investigators described megaloblastic syndrome in PN patients not receiving any alcohol; they found an association with high levels of glycine and methionine, and folate supplementation prevented this syndrome. After supplemental folate was shown to avoid this megaloblastic syndrome, 200 mcg/d was added; this has now been increased to 400 mcg/d of folate monoglutamate to cover patients with longstanding malnutrition and depleted folate stores. Most PN patients have high normal serum folate levels.

### Alterations of methionine metabolism in hepatocarcinogenesis: the emergent role of glycine N-methyltransferase in liver injury [^72e64c86]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Further, GNMT, as a major hepatic folate binding protein, binds to and may be inhibited by MTHF. Therefore, when SAM levels increase, MeTHFR inhibition leads to a decrease in free MTHF and dissociation of the complex GNMT-MTHF. The consequent rise in free GNMT prevents the SAM level from rising excessively. Conversely, when SAM concentration tends to decrease, the amount of free GNMT falls, MeTHFR inhibition is released and more MTHF is available. Thus, GNMT increases the cells' folate content and the remethylation of MTHFR-dependent homocysteine. For this reason, the GNMT pathway may be considered a "salvage pathway".

### Betaine (Cystadane) [^0df63c4a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

CYSTADANE acts as a methyl group donor in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine in patients with homocystinuria. Betaine occurs naturally in the body. It is a metabolite of choline and is present in small amounts in foods such as beets, spinach, cereals, and seafood.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

CYSTADANE was observed to lower plasma homocysteine concentrations in three types of homocystinuria, including CBS deficiency; MTHFR deficiency; and cbl defect. Patients have taken CYSTADANE for many years without evidence of tolerance. There has been no demonstrated correlation between Betaine concentrations and homocysteine concentrations.

In CBS-deficient patients, large increases in methionine concentrations over baseline have been observed. CYSTADANE has also been demonstrated to increase low plasma methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) concentrations in patients with MTHFR deficiency and cbl defect.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic studies of CYSTADANE are not available. Plasma betaine concentrations following administration of CYSTADANE have not been measured in patients and have not been correlated to homocysteine concentrations.

### Hypermethioninemia due to methionine adenosyltransferase I / III deficiency and brain damage [^fef440ce]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency used to be considered a relatively benign disease. This study aims to elucidate the clinical characteristics of methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency patients with neurological manifestations.

Methods

The clinical data, blood amino acids, plasma total homocysteine, gene variants, brain imaging, treatments and outcomes of 15 patients with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

Of these 15 patients, 10 demonstrated neurological abnormalities, with delayed language development, learning difficulties or abnormal brain imaging findings. Eleven patients were identified by newborn screening. Patients with demyelination showed significantly higher blood methionine concentrations at baseline (1102 vs. 396 µmol/L), and their blood methionine remained markedly elevated despite a low-methionine diet. Their plasma total homocysteine was normal to moderate elevated. One patient underwent liver transplantation aged 8 years, which reduced his serum methionine concentration to normal. Compound heterozygous and homozygous MAT1A variants were identified from the patients. Among the 21 variants observed, nine have been reported previously, while 12 were novel.

Conclusions

Methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency is not just a benign disease. Severe persistent hypermethioninemia can cause brain injuries, especially in the white matter. Liver transplantation may be a potential treatment option for refractory methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency.

### Methionine deprivation induces a targetable vulnerability in triple-negative breast cancer cells by enhancing TRAIL receptor-2 expression [^947fd9f0]. Clinical Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Many neoplasms are vulnerable to methionine deficiency by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Because gene profiling studies have revealed that methionine depletion increases TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor-2 (TRAIL-R2) mRNA, we postulated that methionine stress sensitizes breast cancer cells to proapoptotic TRAIL-R2 agonists.

Experimental Design

Human triple (ER/PR/HER2)-negative breast carcinoma cell lines were cultured in control or methionine-free media. The effects of methionine depletion on TRAIL receptor expression and sensitivity to chemotherapy or a humanized agonistic TRAIL-R2 monoclonal antibody (lexatumumab) were determined. The melanoma-associated antigen MAGED2 was silenced to delineate its functional role in sensitizing TNBC cells to methionine stress. An orthotopic TNBC model was utilized to evaluate the effects of dietary methionine deficiency, lexatumumab, or the combination.

Results

Methionine depletion sensitized TNBC cells to lexatumumab-induced caspase activation and apoptosis by increasing TRAIL-R2 mRNA and cell surface expression. MCF-10A cells transformed by oncogenic H-Ras, but not untransformed cells, and matrix-detached TNBC cells were highly sensitive to the combination of lexatumumab and methionine depletion. Proteomics analyses revealed that MAGED2, which has been reported to reduce TRAIL-R2 expression, was suppressed by methionine stress. Silencing MAGED2 recapitulated features of methionine deprivation, including enhanced mRNA and cell surface expression of TRAIL receptors and increased sensitivity to TRAIL receptor agonists. Dietary methionine deprivation enhanced the antitumor effects of lexatumumab in an orthotopic metastatic TNBC model.

Conclusions

Methionine depletion exposes a targetable defect in TNBC cells by increasing TRAIL-R2 expression. Our findings provide the foundation for a clinical trial combining dietary methionine restriction and TRAIL-R2 agonists. Clin Cancer Res; 21(12); 2780–91. ©2015 AACR.

### Methionine and S-adenosylmethionine levels are critical regulators of PP2A activity modulating lipophagy during steatosis [^101a050c]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) expression is decreased in some patients with severe non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Gnmt deficiency in mice (Gnmt-KO) results in abnormally elevated serum levels of methionine and its metabolite S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), and this leads to rapid liver steatosis development. Autophagy plays a critical role in lipid catabolism (lipophagy), and defects in autophagy have been related to liver steatosis development. Since methionine and its metabolite SAMe are well known inactivators of autophagy, we aimed to examine whether high levels of both metabolites could block autophagy-mediated lipid catabolism.

Methods

We examined methionine levels in a cohort of 358 serum samples from steatotic patients. We used hepatocytes cultured with methionine and SAMe, and hepatocytes and livers from Gnmt-KO mice.

Results

We detected a significant increase in serum methionine levels in steatotic patients. We observed that autophagy and lipophagy were impaired in hepatocytes cultured with high methionine and SAMe, and that Gnmt-KO livers were characterized by an impairment in autophagy functionality, likely caused by defects at the lysosomal level. Elevated levels of methionine and SAMe activated PP2A by methylation, while blocking PP2A activity restored autophagy flux in Gnmt-KO hepatocytes, and in hepatocytes treated with SAMe and methionine. Finally, normalization of methionine and SAMe levels in Gnmt-KO mice using a methionine deficient diet normalized the methylation capacity, PP2A methylation, autophagy, and ameliorated liver steatosis.

Conclusions

These data suggest that elevated levels of methionine and SAMe can inhibit autophagic catabolism of lipids contributing to liver steatosis.

### About nutrition… [^a0a0efb6]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Why it matters Good nutrition is essential across life stages, from infant and child growth and brain development to healthy and safer pregnancies and healthy aging. Micronutrients, often referred to as vitamins and minerals, are vital to healthy development, growth, disease prevention, and well-being. Here are six essential micronutrients and why they are important to our health. Breastfeeding helps protect against childhood illnesses. Such illnesses include ear and severe lower respiratory infections, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome. Low levels of certain vitamins and minerals can result in mental impairment and central nervous system defects in infants. Most mothers start out breastfeeding, but about 6 in 10 stop sooner than they planned. Low rates of breastfeeding add more than $3 billion a year to medical costs for women and children in the United States. Adults with healthy eating patterns live longer and are at lower risk for serious, costly health problems.

Examples include heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. What CDC is doing CDC's Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity works with three state and local programs to ensure access to good nutrition for all people:

- State Physical Activity and Nutrition
- High Obesity Program
- Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health. Through the International Micronutrient Malnutrition Prevention and Control Program, we help improve vitamin and mineral nutrition in the United States and globally. We also collaborate with the Nutrition and Obesity Policy Research and Evaluation Network. DNPAO created NOPREN to foster understanding of effective policies to prevent obesity. Prevention efforts of focus are improved access to affordable, healthier foods and beverages in childcare, schools, worksite, and other community settings.

Priorities We encourage state and local organizations to implement policies and activities to:

- Promote food service and nutrition guidelines where food is sold, served, and distributed.
- Coordinate the uptake of and expansion of existing voucher incentive and produce prescription programs.
- Achieve continuity of care for those who breastfeed.
- Improve nutrition, physical activity, and breastfeeding in early care and education settings. Milestones In the United States, the percentage of births in hospitals with recommended maternity care practices to support breastfeeding increased from 3. 8% in 2010 to
28. 9% in 2021. Many states require licensed childcare programs to follow science-based infant feeding and nutrition standards. This affects the meals and snacks of millions of young children.

### Dietary methionine starvation impairs acute myeloid leukemia progression [^a4388431]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Targeting altered tumor cell metabolism might provide an attractive opportunity for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). An amino acid dropout screen on primary leukemic stem cells and progenitor populations revealed a number of amino acid dependencies, of which methionine was one of the strongest. By using various metabolite rescue experiments, nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolite quantifications and 13C-tracing, polysomal profiling, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, we identified that methionine is used predominantly for protein translation and to provide methyl groups to histones via S-adenosylmethionine for epigenetic marking. H3K36me3 was consistently the most heavily impacted mark following loss of methionine. Methionine depletion also reduced total RNA levels, enhanced apoptosis, and induced a cell cycle block. Reactive oxygen species levels were not increased following methionine depletion, and replacement of methionine with glutathione or N-acetylcysteine could not rescue phenotypes, excluding a role for methionine in controlling redox balance control in AML. Although considered to be an essential amino acid, methionine can be recycled from homocysteine. We uncovered that this is primarily performed by the enzyme methionine synthase and only when methionine availability becomes limiting. In vivo, dietary methionine starvation was not only tolerated by mice, but also significantly delayed both cell line and patient-derived AML progression. Finally, we show that inhibition of the H3K36-specific methyltransferase SETD2 phenocopies much of the cytotoxic effects of methionine depletion, providing a more targeted therapeutic approach. In conclusion, we show that methionine depletion is a vulnerability in AML that can be exploited therapeutically, and we provide mechanistic insight into how cells metabolize and recycle methionine.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 193 summary: tubal ectopic pregnancy [^f2322706]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tubal ectopic pregnancy — methotrexate mechanism and alternatives: Methotrexate is a folate antagonist that binds to the catalytic site of dihydrofolate reductase, which interrupts the synthesis of purine nucleotides and the amino acids serine and methionine, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and repair and cell replication. Systemic methotrexate has been used to treat gestational trophoblastic disease since 1956 and was first used to treat ectopic pregnancy in 1982. There are no recommended alternative medical treatment strategies for ectopic pregnancy beyond intramuscular methotrexate, and although oral methotrexate therapy for ectopic pregnancy has been studied, the outcomes data are sparse and indicate that benefits are limited.

### Betaine, anhydrous (Cystadane) [^7a88f941]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

When administered in recommended oral dosage to children or adults, Cystadane acts as a methyl group donor in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine in patients with homocystinuria. As a result, toxic blood levels of homocysteine are reduced in these patients, usually to 20–30 percent or less of pre-treatment levels.

Elevated homocysteine blood levels are associated with clinical problems such as a cardiovascular thrombosis, osteoporosis, skeletal abnormalities, and optic lens dislocation. Plasma levels of homocysteine were decreased in nearly all patients treated with betaine. In observational studies without concurrent controls, clinical improvement was reported by the treating physicians in about three-fourths of patients taking betaine. Many of these patients were also taking other therapies such as vitamin B6(pyridoxine), vitamin B12(cobalamin), and folate with variable biochemical responses. In most cases studied, adding betaine resulted in a further reduction of homocysteine.

Betaine was observed to lower plasma homocysteine levels in the three types of homocystinuria, i.e., cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency; 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency; and cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl) defect.

Betaine has also been demonstrated to increase low plasma methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels in patients with MTHFR deficiency and cbl defect.

In CBS-deficient patients, large increases in methionine levels over baseline have been observed.

Betaine occurs naturally in the body. It is a metabolite of choline and is present in small amounts in foods such as beets, spinach, cereals, and seafood.

Pharmacokinetic studies of betaine are not available. Plasma levels of betaine have not been measured in patients and have not been correlated to homocysteine levels. However, pharmacodynamic measurements, i.e., monitoring of plasma homocysteine levels, have demonstrated that the onset of action of betaine is within several days and that a steady state in response to dosage is achieved within several weeks. Patients have taken betaine for many years without evidence of tolerance.

### Evaluation ofC-methionine PET and anatomic MRI associations in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma [^86b28037]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The role of metabolic imaging in the diagnosis, treatment, and response assessment of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is poorly defined. We investigated the uptake of 11 C-methionine in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed DIPG and evaluated the associations of 11 C-methionine PET metrics with conventional MRI indices and survival outcomes. Methods: Twenty-two patients with newly diagnosed DIPG were prospectively enrolled on an institutional review board-approved investigational study of 11 C-methionine PET. All patients underwent baseline 11 C-methionine PET/CT, and initial treatment-response scans after chemotherapy or radiation therapy were obtained for 17 patients. Typical and atypical DIPGs were assessed clinically and radiographically and defined by multidisciplinary consensus. Three-dimensional regions of interest, reviewed by consensus between a nuclear medicine physician and a radiation oncologist, were delineated after coregistration of PET and MR images. Associations of 11 C-methionine uptake intensity and uniformity with survival, along with associations between 11 C-methionine uptake and conventional MRI tumor indices over time, were evaluated. 11 C-methionine PET voxel values within regions of interest were assessed as threshold values across proportions of the study population, and 11 C-methionine uptake at baseline was assessed relative to MRI-defined tumor progression. Results: 11 C-methionine uptake above that of uninvolved brain tissue was observed in 18 of 22 baseline scans (82%) and 15 of 17 initial response scans (88%). 11 C-methionine avidity within MRI-defined tumor was limited in extent, with 11 of 18 positive baseline 11 C-methionine PET scans (61%) showing less than 25% 11 C-methionine-avid tumor. The increase in total tumor volume with 11 C-methionine PET was relatively limited (17.2%; interquartile range, 6.53%-38.90%), as was the extent of 11 C-methionine uptake beyond the MRI-defined tumor (2.2%; interquartile range, 0.55%-10.88%). Although baseline 11 C-methionine PET intensity and uniformity metrics did not correlate with survival outcomes, initial 11 C-methionine avidity overlapped with recurrent tumor in 100% of cases. A clinical diagnosis of atypical DIPG was associated with borderline significantly prolonged progression-free survival (P = 0.07), yet 11 C-methionine PET indices at diagnosis did not differ significantly between atypical and typical DIPGs. Conclusion: Most newly diagnosed DIPGs are successfully visualized by 11 C-methionine PET. Baseline 11 C-methionine uptake delineates regions at increased risk for recurrence, yet intensity and uniformity metrics did not correlate with treatment outcomes in children with DIPG in this study.

Then, paired features were obtained by using the following criteria: 1) with the same charge state; 2) The mass difference between two features meet the requirement of equation Mass H_Feature – Mass L_Feature = 3.01883 × N Mod + 4.022185 × N Met (Herein, Mass H_Feature is the mass of heavy-feature (mass of the feature with larger mass, which is potentially the feature of heavy-labeled methylated peptide) and the Mass L_Feature is the light-feature mass. N Mod ϵ [1,6] is the range of the methyl count. N Met ϵ [0, 2] is the range of methionine count); 3) the retention time difference (RT H_Feature - RT L_Feature) between two features should be within the range of 10 ± 60 seconds; 4) the intensity ratio is required to be within the four folds. All paired features are supposed to come from the peptide with identical sequence but with different methyl labeling form, and the spectra corresponding to the un-methylated form are deduced from the spectra with paired features. Detailly, the precursor m/z of the spectrum corresponding to the un-methylated form is calculated using the equation MZ Pre = MZ L_Pre –N Mod × M L_Mod / Z Pre or MZ Pre = MZ H_Pre -(N Mod × M H_Mod + 4.022185 × N Met) / Z Pre (MZ L_Pre is the precursor m / z of the light-spectrum, which is the spectrum of light-feature. MZ H_Pre is the precursor m / z of the heavy-spectrum. M L_Mod is the mass of light mono-methylation. M H_Mod is the mass of heavy mono-methylation. Z Pre is the charge state of the precursor). The fragment peaks of the deduced spectrum are generated from the potential light- and heavy-spectrum as follows: both spectra are deisotoped and filtered with 10 peaks per 100 Da filter, normalized with base peak intensity. A m / z value from light-spectrum or heavy-spectrum is matched if Delta mz = (3.01883 × N Peak_Mod + 4.022185 × N Peak_Met) / Z Peak (N Peak_Mod ϵ [0, N Mod] is the number of methyl considered in the fragment peak. N Peak_Met ϵ [0, N Met] is the number of methionine considered in the fragment peak. Z Peak ϵ [1,2] is the charge of the fragment peak). If a peak in one spectrum could match multiple peaks in another, only the peak pair with minimum intensity difference is retained. The m / z of fragment without methyl is calculated from the matched pair peaks following the equation MZ Peak = MZ Peak_L –N Peak_Mod × M L_Mod / Z Peak or MZ Peak = MZ Peak_H -(N Peak_Mod × M H_Mod + 4.022185 × N metf) / Z Peak (MZ Peak_L is the m / z of pair peak from light-spectrum. MZ Peak_H is the m/z of pair peak from heavy-spectrum). In the resulting deduced spectra, only peaks corresponding to paired peaks were retained and the minimum number of matched peaks was 6. And the intensity value were retained accordingly.

### Follitropin (follistim AQ) [^467deec1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

11 DESCRIPTION

Follitropin beta, a gonadotropin [human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH)], is a glycoprotein hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. It has a dimeric structure containing two glycoprotein subunits (alpha and beta). The alpha and beta subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids, respectively, and their primary and tertiary structures are indistinguishable from that of hFSH. The molecular weight is approximately 40 kDa.

Follistim AQ Cartridge (follitropin beta) injection is a sterile clear and colorless solution, containing either 300 International Units, 600 International Units, or 900 International Units of follitropin beta in disposable single-patient-use cartridges for subcutaneous use only with the Follistim Pen.

Each cartridge delivers 300 International Units in 0.36 mL and the inactive ingredients: benzyl alcohol (3.6 mg; preservative), methionine (0.18 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.072 mg), sodium citrate (4.64 mg), sucrose (18 mg), and Water for Injection USP. Hydrochloric acid NF and/or sodium hydroxide NF are used to adjust the pH to 7.

Each cartridge delivers 600 International Units in 0.72 mL and the inactive ingredients: benzyl alcohol (7.2 mg; preservative), methionine (0.36 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.144 mg), sodium citrate (9.3 mg), sucrose (36 mg), and Water for Injection USP. Hydrochloric acid NF and/or sodium hydroxide NF are used to adjust the pH to 7.

Each cartridge delivers 900 International Units in 1.08 mL and the inactive ingredients: benzyl alcohol (10.8 mg; preservative), methionine (0.54 mg), polysorbate 20 (0.216 mg), sodium citrate (13.9 mg), sucrose (54 mg), and Water for Injection USP. Hydrochloric acid NF and/or sodium hydroxide NF are used to adjust the pH to 7.

Under current storage conditions, Follistim AQ may contain up to 11% of oxidized follitropin beta.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^ce80c0c0]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis — pregnancy course and pruritus management: During pregnancy, up to 70% of women with PBC have stable or improved liver tests, but increased liver disease activity occurs in 60% to 70% postpartum. De novo onset or worsening of pruritus during pregnancy occurs in approximately 50% of women. Immunoglobulin M levels and M2 antibody titers may decline in pregnancy but return to baseline levels postpartum. For management of pruritus, cholestyramine, rifampin, or S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) may be added to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Cholestasis may lead to vitamin K deficiency and increased risk of bleeding, and cholestyramine may exacerbate vitamin K deficiency in persons with cholestasis, with rare case reports of associated hypoprothrombinemia and even hemorrhage. Onset varied from 2 weeks to 8 months and responded promptly to parenteral vitamin K supplementation.
