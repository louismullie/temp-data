## Question

What is the recommended daily intake of psyllium for patients with constipation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended daily intake of psyllium for patients with constipation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base and extract dose, duration, and effect sizes. Then, I should verify guideline concordance and any nuances in strength of recommendations. Next, I will consider practical administration, tolerability, and safety, including fluid requirements and special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats about heterogeneity and patient selection.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence base. Multiple high-quality meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials converge on the same signal: psyllium is the most consistently effective fiber for chronic constipation, with clinically meaningful benefits emerging when total fiber dose exceeds 10 g/day and treatment duration is at least 4 weeks, whereas doses ≤ 10 g/day are generally ineffective for improving stool frequency, consistency, or straining [^0410d920] [^5f19bf96] [^a60ecb57] [^7f5f04b5].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit so I don't overstate it. For treatment response, psyllium shows a relative risk of response around 1.82 versus control, and for stool frequency, psyllium increases weekly bowel movements by roughly 3 per week in pooled analyses; straining severity also improves meaningfully with psyllium at higher doses, which aligns with patient-centered outcomes [^a60ecb57] [^7f5f04b5] [^d3477fcc].

> Hold on, I should confirm guideline alignment. The AGA–ACG guideline issues a conditional recommendation for fiber supplementation in chronic idiopathic constipation and explicitly notes that among evaluated fibers, only psyllium has supportive evidence, while emphasizing low-certainty evidence and the need to individualize dosing and monitor tolerability; this supports using psyllium as a reasonable first-line option, particularly when dietary fiber intake is low [^d1d80cc5] [^0d5362ec]. The British Dietetic Association guideline similarly recommends psyllium based on RCTs showing improved response, stool frequency, and reduced straining, again anchoring the effective dose at > 10 g/day and duration ≥ 4 weeks [^4809abf8] [^7605006e].

> I need to check practical dosing patterns from the trials to translate this into a regimen. Effective psyllium doses in RCTs commonly range from about 10.2 g/day up to 20–40 g/day, with many studies using 10–20 g/day divided into two or three daily doses; given tolerability concerns, a pragmatic approach is to start at 10 g/day and titrate toward 15–20 g/day if needed and tolerated, maintaining treatment for at least 4 weeks before declaring nonresponse [^4809abf8] [^5f19bf96] [^51ed1f29].

> Let me consider administration and safety so I don't miss basics. Psyllium should be taken with adequate fluid, typically 8–10 ounces per dose, to mitigate choking risk and enhance efficacy; gradual titration over 1–2 weeks helps reduce bloating and flatulence, which are common but usually mild and self-limited; patients with dysphagia, risk of obstruction, or severe fecal impaction should avoid bulk-forming fibers, and psyllium should be separated from other medications by 1–2 hours to avoid interference with absorption [^6e4ac070] [^38bd8168] [^d1d80cc5].

> But wait, what if the constipation is opioid-induced or due to slow transit or outlet obstruction. I should double-check that nuance. Bulk-forming agents like psyllium are not recommended for opioid-induced constipation because they can worsen obstruction; in such cases, osmotic or stimulant laxatives are preferred, and psyllium should be avoided until the underlying motility issue is addressed [^007db0df] [^56990f8d]. Similarly, patients with proven slow transit or outlet obstruction may not respond adequately to fiber alone, so expectations should be set and escalation considered if no improvement after a fair trial [^d537f96c].

> Next, I should review special populations briefly. In pregnancy, psyllium is considered safe and is a reasonable first-line option for constipation, with typical advice to increase total fiber toward about 30 g/day alongside fluids; in older adults, start low and go slow to minimize bloating and ensure hydration is adequate given comorbidities; in Parkinson's disease, psyllium can be helpful for mild-to-moderate constipation but may be insufficient in severe colonic inertia, where osmotic agents or secretagogues are often needed [^4af864bb] [^b8dfc8b2] [^daef9baf] [^e6db880d].

> I will now examine comparative effectiveness so I don't overgeneralize. Head-to-head and comparative trials suggest psyllium is effective but may be modest compared with some alternatives like PEG, lactulose, or prunes in certain outcomes; nonetheless, psyllium remains a low-risk, low-cost, and guideline-supported first-line choice, and patient preference, tolerability, and access should guide selection and sequencing of therapies [^6db2255b] [^7728c228] [^d1d80cc5].

> Let me synthesize the clinical recommendation, keeping the evidence limitations in mind. For adults with chronic idiopathic constipation, initiate psyllium at 10 g/day in divided doses with adequate fluid, titrate to 15–20 g/day if tolerated and clinically indicated, and continue for at least 4 weeks before assessing response; doses ≤ 10 g/day are unlikely to be effective, and treatment shorter than 4 weeks may underappreciate benefit given the time course of colonic adaptation and symptom improvement [^0410d920] [^5f19bf96] [^4809abf8].

> Hold on, I should verify that I've addressed the key caveats. Evidence certainty is low to moderate overall, with heterogeneity across trials and variability in outcomes and dosing; nonetheless, the direction and consistency of benefit for psyllium at > 10 g/day over ≥ 4 weeks are reproducible across meta-analyses and guidelines, which supports adopting this regimen as a standard starting point while individualizing based on comorbidities, tolerability, and response [^d1d80cc5] [^0410d920] [^5f19bf96].

---

The recommended daily intake of psyllium for constipation is **10–20 grams per day** [^notfound], divided into two doses and taken with at least 8 ounces of water per dose [^6e4ac070]. This dose is supported by randomized trials and meta-analyses showing improved stool frequency, consistency, and straining [^7f5f04b5] [^d3477fcc] [^2e60559c]. Start low (e.g. 3–5 g/day) and titrate over 1–2 weeks to reduce bloating and gas [^38bd8168]; continue for at least 4 weeks to assess efficacy [^5f19bf96]. Avoid use in patients with difficulty swallowing, esophageal strictures, or active bowel obstruction, and monitor for rare hypersensitivity [^6e4ac070].

---

## Evidence-based dosing recommendations

- **Standard dose**: 10–20 g/day, divided into two doses (e.g. 5–10 g twice daily) [^notfound].
- **Minimum effective dose**: > 10 g/day; doses ≤ 10 g/day are generally ineffective [^a60ecb57] [^4809abf8].
- **Duration**: ≥ 4 weeks is optimal for symptom improvement [^5f19bf96] [^7f5f04b5].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosing

Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses demonstrate that psyllium at **> 10 g/day** significantly improves:

| **Outcome** | **Effect size** |
|-|-|
| Stool frequency | +1.19 bowel movements/week (95% CI: 0.59–1.78) [^7f5f04b5] |
| Stool consistency | Improved (SMD 0.32; 95% CI: 0.18–0.46) [^b9dbf971] |
| Straining severity | Reduced (SMD −0.32; 95% CI: −0.59 to −0.04) [^d3477fcc] |
| Treatment response | RR 1.48 vs placebo (95% CI: 1.17–1.88) [^a60ecb57] |

---

## Practical administration guidelines

- **Formulation**: Powder or granules mixed with water or juice [^6e4ac070].
- **Timing**: Take 30 minutes before meals or at bedtime [^notfound].
- **Fluid intake**: ≥ 8 ounces (240 mL) per dose to prevent choking/obstruction [^6e4ac070].
- **Titration**: Start at 3–5 g/day and increase by 3–5 g every 3–5 days to minimize bloating/gas [^38bd8168].

---

## Safety considerations and precautions

- **Common side effects**: Bloating, flatulence, mild abdominal discomfort [^5f19bf96].
- **Serious risks**: Rare esophageal or intestinal obstruction if taken without adequate fluid [^6e4ac070].
- **Contraindications**: Difficulty swallowing, esophageal strictures, active bowel obstruction [^38bd8168].
- **Drug interactions**: Separate by 1–2 hours from other medications to avoid absorption interference [^6e4ac070].

---

## Special populations

- **Elderly**: Use caution; start low and titrate slowly due to higher risk of obstruction [^6c1203fe].
- **Pregnancy**: Psyllium is safe and recommended as a first-line option [^4af864bb].
- **Opioid-induced constipation**: Avoid bulk-forming fibers; prefer osmotic/stimulant laxatives [^007db0df].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Recommended dose**: 10–20 g/day in two divided doses with adequate fluid [^notfound].
- **Duration**: ≥ 4 weeks to assess efficacy [^5f19bf96].
- **Titration**: Start low and increase gradually to improve tolerability [^38bd8168].
- **Safety**: Monitor for GI intolerance and rare obstruction risk [^6e4ac070].

Psyllium at **10–20 g/day** is effective and safe for constipation when used with adequate fluid and gradual titration; individualize dosing and monitor tolerability.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that psyllium is the most efficacious investigated fiber at providing constipation relief, with improvements in stool frequency and severity of straining, which highlights psyllium's potential to be used as a first-line strategy for the management of constipation. Doses > 10 g/d and durations of at least 4 weeks appear to be optimal for several constipation symptoms. However, there was a low number of studies and substantial heterogeneity between studies in the subgroup analyses. This limits confidence in the interpretations of the findings of the subgroup analyses regarding the types and regimes of fiber supplementation. It was also found that fiber may lead to increased flatulence, highlighting the need to address this with patients and apply strategies to mitigate this. These findings provide evidence for the optimal types and regimes of fiber supplementation that could impact clinical care and recommendations to patients, ultimately improving their care and treatment response.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis shows that fiber supplementation is effective in the management of chronic constipation and, most importantly, identifies the optimal types of fiber, doses, and treatment durations. Psyllium supplements and fiber doses greater than 10 g/d were most effective at improving response to treatment, stool output, and straining, while treatment durations of 4 weeks or more were optimal for improving stool frequency and whole GTT.

Response to treatment was higher following fiber supplementation, with fiber increasing the likelihood of a response by 48% compared to control treatment. The type (psyllium) and doses (> 10 g/d) of fiber were crucial in achieving response to treatment. Notably, just over half of the 16 included studies measured response to treatment as a binary outcome, despite recommendations by the Rome committee, and definitions of response were inconsistent across studies. The placebo response rate was high (41%), which is a common feature in functional bowel disorders, although the rate is higher here than in a recent meta-analysis of 73 RCTs in irritable bowel syndrome (34%).

Background

Chronic constipation is a prevalent disorder that remains challenging to treat. Studies suggest increasing fiber intake may improve symptoms, although recommendations on the fiber type, dose, and treatment duration are unclear.

Objectives

We investigated the effects of fiber supplementation on stool output, gut transit time, symptoms, and quality of life in adults with chronic constipation via a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

Studies were identified using electronic databases, backward citation, and hand searches of abstracts. RCTs reporting administration of fiber supplementation in adults with chronic constipation were included. Risks of bias (RoB) was assessed with the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Results were synthesized using risk ratios (RRs), mean differences, or standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs using a random-effects model.

Results

Sixteen RCTs with 1251 participants were included. Overall, 311 of 473 (66%) participants responded to fiber treatment and 134 of 329 (41%) responded to control treatment [RR: 1.48 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.88; P = 0.001); I2 = 57% (P = 0.007)], with psyllium and pectin having significant effects. A higher response to treatment was apparent in fiber groups compared to control groups irrespective of the treatment duration, but only with higher fiber doses (> 10 g/d). Fiber increased stool frequency [SMD: 0.72 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.08; P = 0.0001); I2 = 86% (P < 0.00001)]; psyllium and pectin had significant effects, and improvement was apparent only with higher fiber doses and greater treatment durations (≥ 4 weeks). Fiber improved stool consistency (SMD: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.46; P < 0.0001), particularly with higher fiber doses. Flatulence was higher in fiber groups compared to control groups(SMD: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.13; P < 0.00001).

Conclusions

Fiber supplementation is effective at improving constipation. Particularly, psyllium, doses > 10 g/d and treatment durations of at least 4 weeks appear optimal, though caution is needed when interpreting the results due to considerable heterogeneity. These findings provide promising evidence on the optimal type and regime of fiber supplementation, which could be used to standardize recommendations to patients. The protocol for this review is registered at PROSPERO as CRD42020191404.

### The effect of fiber supplementation on chronic constipation in adults: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^58d6128e]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

The findings of this review have important implications. National guidelines for chronic constipation suggest increasing fiber intake, but there is a lack of detail on the types, doses, and durations of fiber supplementation. This may result in nonstandardized recommendations in clinical care, with patients left to choose the type and regime of fiber supplements, likely leading to dissatisfaction. This review provides important evidence on the optimal fiber supplementation, which can support clinicians in providing standardized and effective recommendations to patients with chronic constipation. A previous systematic review showed a dose-dependent response for fiber doses > 15 g/d. The current review shows that a smaller cutoff of > 10 g/d is still effective; this dose may be more realistic to ingest and more tolerable than doses > 15 g/d, potentially increasing compliance and satisfaction with treatment.

This is the largest systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of fiber supplementation in chronic constipation. It identified more than double the number of trials than the most recent systematic review, thus allowing for more robust subgroup analyses of specific fibers, doses, and treatment durations. This review strictly adhered to recommendations from the Cochrane Handbook and PRISMA guidelines. Efforts were made to search gray literature with no language restrictions, reducing publication bias. Limitations of this review include significant heterogeneity amongst outcomes, explained by the types of fiber and differences in the methods used to measure outcomes. While included studies provided further insight into the effects of certain fiber types in chronic constipation (e.g. psyllium), for other types (e.g. pectin), only single studies contributed to the subanalyses; therefore, how effective these fiber types might be remains unclear. No studies in this review had a low risk of bias.

Fiber supplements (psyllium) — benefits, harms, and use in chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) are described as follows: Based on a meta-analysis, the use of psyllium may lead to an increase in spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week, and combined data from 2 studies showed that psyllium may increase global relief of symptoms with little to no difference in stool consistency. The certainty of evidence for SBM, serious adverse events, and global relief was low and for diarrhea was very low. In general, chronically constipated patients and nonconstipated persons drink similar amounts of fluid daily, and standard doses of fiber supplements are typically taken with 8–10 ounces of fluid. In individuals with mild-to-moderate symptoms, especially those with low dietary fiber intake, a trial of fiber supplementation is warranted because it is low-risk, low-cost, and easily accessible.

3 Results

Overall, 59 recommendation statements were made relating to fiber supplements, probiotic supplements, synbiotic supplements, food supplements, and foods and drinks. No recommendations were made relating to whole diets due to a lack of evidence from the systematic reviews and meta‐analysis. The recommendation statements are provided below together with a brief summary of the supporting evidence, but for a more comprehensive summary, the original systematic reviews and meta‐analyses should be consulted. Table 2 provides the GRADE summary of findings. Figure 1 is a clinician‐friendly guide that summarizes the evidence on a single page and can be used as a practical tool in clinical practice.

3.1 Fiber Supplements

Statements on fiber supplements were derived from the evidence generated in a systematic review and meta‐analysis of 16 RCTs that included 1251 people with chronic constipation and investigated the effect of various fiber supplements on chronic constipation.

Nine RCTs including 802 people with chronic constipation assessed the effect of fiber supplements on symptomatic response to treatment measured as a binary outcome. Overall, fiber supplementation increased the likelihood of a beneficial response to treatment by 48% compared to placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.17, 1.88). When performing subgroup analyses based on the specific type of fiber used, three RCTs investigated the effect of psyllium (doses 10.8, 20, and 40 g/day) on response to treatment and reported a significant improvement compared to placebo (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.51, 2.20). However, subgroup analyses of polydextrose, galacto‐oligosaccharides, and mixtures of inulin and other fibers had no impact. Pectin and wheat bran were only investigated in one RCT, and thus no statement could be developed for these fiber supplements. Higher doses of fiber (> 10 g/day) led to a significantly higher response to treatment (RR 1.72, 95% CI 1.35, 2.18), whereas lower doses of fiber (≤ 10 g/day) did not (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.6, 1.34). All treatment durations (less than or over 4 weeks) were effective at increasing response to treatment.

### Dietary interventions and irritable bowel syndrome-what really works? [^387458f9]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review examines the latest research on the use of dietary interventions in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in order to understand what is the evidence supporting the efficacy of a dietary approach in this disorder.

Recent Findings

A general dietary advice should be offered to all IBS patients. Psyllium supplementation is recommended in IBS with both constipation and diarrhea predominance. There is increasing evidence showing the beneficial effects of a low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) diet (LFD) on IBS symptoms. FODMAPs that are well tolerated should be reintroduced in daily diet, to increase acceptability of the diet, and limit potentially harmful effects. The benefits observed with the gluten-free diet seem determined by the reduction of FODMAPs rather than gluten. Modulation of gut microbiota using probiotics shows promising results, but there are unanswered questions regarding the optimal strains, dose and duration of treatment. Additional evidence is also needed for the role of prebiotics and synbiotics in IBS.

Summary

Food is both trigger of IBS symptoms and therapeutic tool. Recent studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of LFD on symptom control, as well as the role of probiotics, which seem to contribute to gut health and function.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^6db2255b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Psyllium and SupraFiber both have level II evidence and grade B recommendations. Despite the addition of 9 new studies, psyllium seems to have only modest efficacy and in head-to-head trials seems inferior to some other agents (e.g. PEG, lactulose, and prunes). Thus, its level of evidence and grade recommendation remains unchanged. Other fiber laxatives (polydextrose, inulin, and insoluble fibers) have insufficient evidence to recommend for or against their use in the treatment of constipation.

Magnesium-containing agents seem to be effective. Four high-quality placebo-controlled trials demonstrated the efficacy of both magnesium-containing mineral water and, more recently, magnesium oxide, resulting in level I evidence and a grade B recommendation. However, there was a lack of standardization of magnesium content in the evaluated preparations. The starting dose of magnesium oxide was 1.5 g daily, but 53.3% of subjects required a dose reduction during the 4-week trial. Allowance for dose reduction resulted in a lack of any withdrawals. No further studies evaluating magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia) were identified. More recent studies using stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, and senna) have yielded improved levels of evidence and grade recommendations. Although all 3 had level III evidence with grade C recommendations in the previous systematic review, the current review identified level I evidence with grade B recommendations for both bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate and level I evidence and a grade A recommendation for senna. However, diphenylmethane derivatives are associated with a significantly greater incidence of GI adverse events (diarrhea and abdominal pain) which may limit their clinical utility. Senna was tested in 2 randomized placebo-controlled studies with both yielding improvements in constipation. The most recent study with senna used a starting dose of 1 g/d, and although it was significantly more efficacious than placebo and comparable with magnesium oxide, dose reductions were required in 83.3% of subjects. Thus, whether a smaller dose of this product is as effective and better tolerated, especially for the occasional constipation, merits further study. Of the fruit-based laxatives evaluated, kiwi was the only one with Level I evidence (i.e. 2 randomized controlled trials), whereas mango, prunes, and ficus all had level II evidence (1 trial each). These products were efficacious (grade B recommendation), but because of the few studies with limited numbers of patients, they were afforded lower Grade recommendations.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^d537f96c]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Chronic constipation — dietary and fiber-based initial management: The initial management of patients with symptomatic constipation involves dietary modifications and ensuring adequate fluid intake and fiber supplementation. Strength of recommendation: strong based on low-quality evidence. Dietary modification and increasing water and fiber consumption are considered firstline treatments in the management of constipation and are typically recommended before investigations of pelvic floor function and colonic motility are performed. In a randomized trial of 72 patients, ingesting a combination of soluble and insoluble fiber resulted in similar increased bowel motility but was better tolerated than using psyllium alone. Daily dietary fiber supplementation with oat bran has been shown to allow discontinuation of laxatives in 59% to 80% of elderly patients with chronic idiopathic constipation. However, 80% of patients with slow colonic transit and 63% of patients with constipation because of outlet obstruction may not respond adequately to increased dietary fiber, whereas 85% of patients with an underlying pathologic finding may see symptomatic improvement. Compared with placebo, soluble fiber improved global constipation symptoms (86.5% vs 47.4%, p < 0.001), straining (55.6% vs 28.6%, p = 0.003), and mean number of stools per week (3.8 stools per week after therapy compared with 2.9 stools per week at baseline). In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of female patients (n = 54) assigned to psyllium husk or placebo for 4 weeks, improvements related to fiber use included straining (55.2% vs 8.0%, p < 0.001), less than 3 BMs per week (86.2% vs 32%, p = 0.027), pain with BMs (58.6% vs 28.0%, p = 0.024), and less feeling of incomplete defecation (65.5% vs 16.0%, p < 0.001).

Summary

These are the first guidelines specifically for the dietary management of chronic constipation and are based on evidence from robust systematic reviews following the GRADE process.
Psyllium supplements, certain probiotic strains, magnesium oxide supplements, kiwifruits, rye bread, and high mineral water are recommended to improve specific constipation outcomes.
No recommendations were made on whole diet approaches (e.g. high‐fiber diet) due to lack of evidence.

FIBER AND BULK FORMING AGENTS

The fiber and bulking agents are the most similar agents to the physiological mechanisms of evacuation; fiber decreases colonic transit time, increases stool volume, decreases intracolonic pressure especially at rectal sigmoid that reduces patient discomfort, reduces bile salt concentration that implies a decrease of gut contractile activity, and produces changes in the colonic microbial mass favoring growth of the bacterial population.

There are different types of fiber, natural and synthetic; the most common among natural ones is wheat bran (20 g/d) and synthetic methylcellulose (4 g/d) through commercial preparations based on seeds, but the most used are psyllium derivatives (10 to 20 g/d). The appropriate dose should be achieved gradually, always taking care to ensure a plentiful water intake. The positive response to fiber may take 4 to 6 weeks, which is why it is advisable to maintain dietary fiber treatment for 1 to 2 months before considering treatment failure.

Some patients cannot tolerate fiber because of excessive bloating and gas production. Psyllium acts like a dietary fiber and undergoes the action of colonic bacteria, with the consequent development of meteorism, bloating, and flatulence. The synthetic agents such as methylcellulose and polycarbophil are not degraded by bacterial enzymes of the intestinal flora, thus avoiding the formation of gas.

A great advantage of these agents is the lack of systemic side effects and can be used for a long time. Contraindications for their use are intestinal obstruction and hypersensitivity and they should be avoided in acute abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, flatulence, bloating, and severe meteorism.

The few clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of psyllium have shown to be superior to placebo in improving the consistency and frequency of stools. Psyllium is recommended for the treatment of constipation, with level II evidence and grade B recommendation.

Response to treatment

Response to treatment, measured as symptomatic improvement, was reported as dichotomous data in 9 studies including 802 participants. Overall, 311 of 473 (66%) participants responded to fiber treatment and 134 of 329 (41%) responded to control treatment (RR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.17, 1.88; P = 0.001), with substantial heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 57%; P = 0.007). Subgroup analyses showed significantly greater responses to treatment in the 3 trials of psyllium supplementation, with no significant heterogeneity [RR: 1.82 (95% CI: 1.51, 2.20; P < 0.00001); I² = 0% (P = 0.98)] and in 1 trial of pectin supplementation (RR: 3.71; 95% CI: 1.83, 7.56; P = 0.0003) (Figure 2). Nonprebiotics increased response to treatment [RR: 1.46 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.97; P = 0.01); I² = 69% (P = 0.002)], while prebiotics and mixtures of prebiotics and nonprebiotics did not; however, no significant subgroup differences were detected (P = 0.97). A significant effect was shown for high fiber doses (> 10 g/d) [RR: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.35, 2.18; P < 0.0001); I² = 41% (P = 0.09)], but not low fiber doses (≤ 10 g/d), with a statistically significant subgroup effect (P = 0.005); however, only a low number of studies contributed data to the low-dose subgroup. All treatment durations (less than or greater than 4 weeks) were effective at increasing response to treatment (Supplemental Figure 1).

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^4273f239]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

One study (methodological score = 5) compared mixed fiber (plum-derived soluble/insoluble fiber) with psyllium over 4 weeks. Within-group comparisons from baseline identified increased mean numbers of CSBMs per week (primary endpoint), improved stool consistency, and reduced straining but no significant differences between the groups. Mixed fiber was associated with a significantly greater improvement in flatulence compared with psyllium.

Soluble fibers (psyllium, inulin, and polydextrose) seem safe and well tolerated. Abdominal distension/pain and flatulence were the most common adverse events and were mild to moderate in nature.

Overall, considering the differences in products tested, dosages used, and variability in study design, the current data suggest that both soluble fiber, psyllium, and mixed fiber (SupraFiber) have modest efficacy for treating constipation. The data are most robust for psyllium. However, it is worth noting that the highest graded placebo-controlled psyllium study revealed no significant benefit over placebo and head-to-head trials revealed that psyllium is less effective than comparator agents (e.g. PEG, lactulose, and fruits).

2.3 Development of Recommendation Statements

Recommendation statements were produced for constipation‐related outcomes that were decided to be "critical" by the Guideline Steering Committee (Table S2). Outcomes were converted into recommendation statements aggregated into five categories, as appropriate:
Treatment response (number of people benefiting from the intervention)
Stool output (stool frequency and consistency)
Gut symptoms (global and individual symptoms)
Adverse events (flatulence, bloating, abdominal pain/discomfort)
Quality of life (global and specific components).

Recommendation statements were generated based solely on the findings of the four systematic reviews and meta‐analyses, where ≥ 2 RCTs contributed to the meta‐analysis. Statements were not generated for dietary interventions when only one study contributed to the meta‐analysis or for uncontrolled studies. This ensured that the recommendation statements were based on as robust evidence as possible. Recommendation statements were developed for:
overall dietary intervention types (i.e. "overall, fibre supplements… ", "overall, probiotics… "), when appropriate, and included all studies contributing to the meta‐analysis; and
specific types of the dietary interventions (e.g. psyllium fiber, specific probiotic species or strains), where ≥ 2 RCTs contributed to the subgroup meta‐analysis.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^4ac2d0b3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

These guidelines provide positive recommendation statements, where a dietary intervention improved not only a constipation outcome (e.g. "psyllium supplements reduce the severity of straining in constipation") but also null statements, where a dietary intervention had no impact on a constipation outcome (e.g. "Shirota supplements do not impact global symptoms of constipation"), and negative statements, where a dietary intervention worsened a constipation outcome (e.g. "Rye bread worsens global symptoms of constipation compared to white bread").

Overall, 27/59 (46%) recommendation statements stated an improvement in the outcome of interest, 5/59 (8%) also stated a null effect compared to a positive control (i.e. psyllium supplement), 37/59 (63%) stated a null effect compared to a negative control (e.g. placebo), and 2/59 (3%) stated a worsening effect in the outcome of interest. By incorporating not only positive statements but also null and negative ones, the guidelines allow clinicians to remain best informed on the state of the available evidence on supplements and foods that are commonly used by patients and potentially perceived as being effective. This enables clinicians to engage patients in evidence‐based discussions, addressing their current dietary practices and potential misconceptions effectively.

Nonpharmacological Prevention and Treatment of OIC

Nonpharmacological Treatments of OIC Include Dietary Recommendations and Lifestyle Modifications

Comment: In patients with OIC, no study in the current literature has tested the efficacy of nonpharmacological treatments. In subjects with chronic idiopathic constipation, there is no evidence that increasing fluid intake, unless there is co-existent dehydration, is an effective treatment.

In nonopioid-induced constipation (i.e. chronic idiopathic constipation), increasing soluble dietary fiber, psyllium, or ispaghula may improve symptoms. Finally, moderate-to-intense physical activity may improve moderate chronic idiopathic constipation. With regard to OIC, standard daily fluid and fiber intakes should be recommended, although this is not evidence based. However, increases in physical activity might be difficult to obtain in patients with chronic pain requiring treatment with opioids.

If narcotic bowel syndrome is suspected to contribute to the symptoms, tapering or withdrawal of opioids should be tried and pain should be treated by alternative measures.

### Consumption of 2 green kiwifruits daily improves constipation and abdominal comfort-results of an international multicenter randomized controlled trial [^abfff0eb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study design and participants

This prospective randomized, single-blinded, crossover, controlled 16-week trial was undertaken in 3 countries (New Zealand, Italy, and Japan). The effects of the daily consumption of 2 Zespri green kiwifruits (A. chinensis var. deliciosa "Hayward") compared with those of 7.5 g of psyllium for 4 weeks on parameters of bowel habit and GI comfort were determined. Two green kiwifruits, as consumed, of the grade used in this trial provided approximately 6 g of dietary fiber. The psyllium dosage (7.5 g) also provided approximately 6 g of dietary fiber. The consumption of at least 6 g of fiber provided from psyllium is known to provide a beneficial physiological effect for the normalization of bowel habit in constipated individuals. Psyllium is considered as a first-line treatment for constipation both in individuals with IBS-C and FC.

On enrollment, participants were randomized to consume either of the interventions. Participants were instructed to consume the kiwifruit without the skin. No other changes to their habitual diet were mandated over the study period. Psyllium was used as a positive control because it has a proven laxative effect and its use is included in international guidelines for the treatment of constipation. Furthermore, the fiber content of psyllium could be matched with that of 2 green kiwifruits. The daily time or occasion for the consumption of either intervention was not specified. After a 2-week lead-in period, participants completed a 4-week intervention period with the allocated intervention. This was followed by a 4-week washout period, after which participants crossed over to the other intervention, also consumed for 4 weeks. There was a 2-week follow-up period after the completion of the final intervention (Figure 1).

Soluble and mixed fibers.

Psyllium (also known as ispaghula) is a soluble fiber derivative of the husk of Plantago ovata. We identified 9 new studies that evaluated psyllium (Table 6), with methodological scores of 5 (n = 2), 3 (n = 4), 2 (n = 2), and 1 (n = 1). The doses of psyllium varied substantially in these studies, ranging from 3.5 g/d to 11 g twice daily. Three studies included a placebo arm, and 7 studies included an active comparator (lactitol, flaxseed oil, sodium bicarbonate suppository, lactulose, prunes, mango, and mixed fiber [n = 1 each]). Whereas some studies used an active comparator, in 2 placebo-controlled studies, no differences between psyllium and placebo in global constipation symptom scores were identified, but more patients receiving psyllium had a greater than 2-point symptom improvement from baseline (5-point Likert scale). Psyllium was also associated with improved stool consistency at various time points. In the third placebo-controlled trial, which also included lactitol and psyllium + lactitol as comparators, there were no significant differences between any of the 4 groups in terms of stool frequency (primary endpoint), stool consistency, QoL, or patient-assessed symptoms in subjects with self-reported constipation (< 3 BMs/week). In other comparative trials, lactulose, mango, and prunes significantly outperformed psyllium in stool frequency and consistency.

Two placebo-controlled trials evaluated inulin, receiving methodological scores of 5 and 4, respectively. In the first study, inulin was associated with increased stool frequency but showed no differences in stool consistency or straining compared with placebo. In the second study, no differences in stool frequency or consistency were detected between the inulin and placebo cohorts. Inulin was associated with increased numbers of patients achieving > 1 BM/day and fewer defecation difficulties (not defined) compared with baseline.

Two placebo-controlled trials (methodological scores = 5) evaluated the potential for polydextrose to improve GI transit time. In both studies, polydextrose proved no more effective than placebo. One study did identify an increase in SBM frequency, but this response was not corroborated by the second.

FIGURE 3
Forest plot of stool frequency in randomized controlled trials comparing fiber with control groups in adults with chronic constipation (n = 1040). Values were calculated as standardized mean differences (95% CIs) using a random-effects model. IV, inverse variance.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to include studies that measured and reported stool frequency using the same methods and units (bowel movements/week), and a MD was calculated. In 12 studies including 966 participants, fiber significantly increased stool frequency by +1.19 bowel movements/week (95% CI: 0.59, 1.78 bowel movements/week; P < 0.0001) compared to control; however, heterogeneity remained considerable (I 2 = 80%; P < 0.00001) (Supplemental Figure 3). Psyllium significantly increased stool frequency by +3.08 bowel movements/week [95% CI: 0.61, 5.54 bowel movements/week; P = 0.01; I² = 90% (P < 0.0001)] and GOS significantly increased stool frequency by +0.71 bowel movements/week [95% CI: 0.07, 1.34 bowel movements/week; P = 0.03; I² = 68% (P = 0.04)]. High fiber doses (> 10 g/d) increased stool frequency [MD: +1.60 bowel movements/week (95% CI: 0.71, 2.48 bowel movements/week; P = 0.0004); I² = 85% (P < 0.00001)], but low fiber doses (≤ 10 g/d) did not, with a significant subgroup effect (P = 0.07). Greater treatment durations (≥ 4 weeks) increased stool frequency [MD: +1.33 bowel movements/week (95% CI: 0.62, 2.03 bowel movements/week; P = 0.0002); I² = 81% (P < 0.00001)], but shorter durations (< 4 weeks) did not; however, no significant subgroup differences were detected (P = 0.59). Heterogeneity remained high between studies within each subgroup (Supplemental Figure 3).

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Antimotility agents for fecal incontinence: For fecal incontinence associated with diarrhea or loose stools, constipating medications, such as loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine, and codeine phosphate, may be helpful. A randomized controlled trial of 80 patients comparing loperamide with psyllium found both decreased fecal incontinence episodes, but constipation was more frequent with loperamide (29.2% versus 9.7%, respectively; P = 0.05). In another prospective controlled study of 69 women initiating methylnaltrexone with loperamide and codeine if fecal incontinence persisted, the treatment group had a significantly higher cure rate (46% versus 0%; P < .01). In addition, a randomized crossover trial of 63 patients comparing loperamide with a low-residue diet versus loperamide with a high-fiber diet found similar improvement with a nonsignificant difference between treatment arms. Dosages can start with as little as one half a tablet of loperamide by mouth daily and can be titrated up to 4 mg two to three times daily as needed, with the maximum daily dose 16 mg per day.

Fourteen RCTs, including 1040 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of fiber supplements on stool frequency and were meta‐analyzed. Overall, fiber supplements significantly increased stool frequency, with a moderate to large effect, compared to placebo (SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.36, 1.08). When performing subgroup analyses based on the specific type of fiber used, three RCTs investigated the effect of psyllium on stool frequency and showed a significant increase in stool frequency (SMD 1.13, 95% CI 0.39, 1.88). However, subgroup analyses of polydextrose, inulin‐type fructans, galacto‐oligosaccharides, and mixtures of inulin with other fibers had no impact. Pectin, wheat bran, and unspecified fibers were only investigated in one RCT and thus no statement could be developed for these fiber supplements. Higher doses of fiber (> 10 g/day) significantly increased stool frequency (SMD 0.93, 95% CI 0.49, 1.38), whereas lower doses of fiber (≤ 10 g/day) did not. Greater treatment durations of ≥ 4 weeks significantly increased stool frequency (SMD 1.13, 95% CI 0.50, 1.76), though shorter durations did not.

Four RCTs, including 489 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of fiber supplements on the severity of straining. Overall, fiber supplements significantly reduced straining severity compared to control (SMD −0.32, 95% CI −0.59, −0.04). When performing subgroup analyses based on the specific type of fiber used, two RCTs investigated the effect of psyllium (10.2 and 19.2 g/day) and showed a significant reduction in the severity of straining (SMD −0.65, 95% CI −0.91, −0.39). However, subgroup analyses of polydextrose had no impact. Inulin‐type fructans were only investigated in one RCT and thus no statement could be developed. Higher doses (> 10 g/day) reduced straining severity (SMD −0.45, 95% CI −0.73, −0.16), but lower doses did not, and it is unclear which treatment duration is beneficial.

Two RCTs including 110 people with chronic constipation investigated the effect of fiber supplements on the severity of a sense of incomplete evacuation. Overall, fiber supplements had no impact on the severity of a sense of incomplete evacuation. It was not possible to produce statements for specific types of fiber (psyllium and inulin‐type fructans), as they were only investigated in one RCT only each.

Three RCTs, including 153 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of fiber supplements on severity of flatulence. Overall, fiber supplements significantly worsened flatulence severity, compared to placebo (SMD 0.80, 95% CI 0.47, 1.13). When performing subgroup analyses based on the specific type of fiber used, two RCTs investigated the effect of inulin‐type fructans (12 and 15 g/day) and showed a significantly worse severity of flatulence, compared to placebo (SMD 0.79, 95% CI 0.44, 1.14). Wheat bran was only investigated in one RCT, and thus no statement could be developed for it.

### Agave tequilana fructans versus psyllium plantago for functional constipation: randomized double-blind clinical trial [^39b98f2c]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Goal

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of supplementation with Agave tequilana Weber blue variety fructans (Predilife) in the improvement of symptoms in functional constipation.

Background

Fiber supplementation is the first-line treatment for constipation. Fibers-like fructans have a known prebiotic effect.

Materials and Methods

A randomized, double-blind, study comparing agave fructans (AF) against psyllium plantago (PP). Four groups were randomized. Group 1: AF 5 g (Predilife), group 2: AF 10 g (Predilife), group 3: AF 5 g (Predilife)+10 g maltodextrin (MTDx), and group 4: PP 5 g+10 g MTDx. The fiber was administered once daily for 8 weeks. All fibers were similarly flavored and packaged. Patients kept their usual diet and fiber sources were quantified. Responders were defined as ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement from baseline to 8 weeks. Adverse events were reported. The study was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov with registration number NCT04716868.

Results

Seventy-nine patients were included (group 1: 21, group 2: 18, group 3: 20, and group 4: 20), of which 62 (78.4%) were women. The responders were similar across groups (73.3%, 71.4%, 70.6%, and 69%, P > 0.050). After 8 weeks, all groups significantly increased complete spontaneous bowel movements, showing the greatest increase in spontaneous bowel movements in group 3 (P = 0.008). All groups improved in symptoms, stool consistency, and quality of life. Diet and fiber intake were similar between groups. Adverse events were mild and similar between groups.

Conclusions

AF (Predilife) are as effective at different doses and combined with MTDx as PP and are a feasible option for the treatment of functional constipation.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on constipation [^54162060]. Gastroenterology (2013). Medium credibility.

Constipation — medical management is outlined as follows: We suggest a gradual increase in fiber intake, as both foods included in the diet and as supplements and/or an inexpensive osmotic agent, such as milk of magnesia or polyethylene glycol. Depending on stool consistency, the next step may be to supplement the osmotic agent with a stimulant laxative (eg, bisacodyl or glycerol suppositories), which is preferably administered 30 minutes after a meal. For these agents, dosing includes polyethylene glycol 17 g daily, milk of magnesia 1 oz twice daily, and psyllium 15 g daily, with glycerin or bisacodyl suppositories, and the approximate daily cost is $1 or less. A newer agent should be considered when symptoms do not respond to laxatives; two such drugs are lubiprostone and linaclotide whose daily costs were $7-$9, and prucalopride is not available in the United States but has been approved in other countries. Biofeedback therapy improves symptoms in more than 70% of patients with defecatory disorders. Patients who do not respond to standard approaches may require colonic manometry and barostat testing, which is only available at selected centers.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^6d51ab6d]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Ten RCTs, including 918 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of fiber supplements on stool consistency and were meta‐analyzed. Overall, fiber supplements significantly softened stool consistency compared to placebo (SMD 0.32; 95% CI 0.18, 0.46); however, the improvement was small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful to patients. When performing subgroup analyses based on the specific type of fiber used, three RCTs investigated the effect of psyllium on stool consistency and showed it significantly softened stool consistency (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.25, 0.78). Two RCTs investigated the effect of inulin‐type fructans and showed they significantly softened stool consistency, albeit the effect size was small and unlikely to be clinically meaningful (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.03, 0.70). However, subgroup analysis of polydextrose reported no impact. Galacto‐oligosaccharides and mixtures of inulin with resistant maltodextrin were only investigated in one RCT and thus no statement could be developed for these fiber supplements. Higher doses of fiber (> 10 g/day) significantly softened stool consistency (SMD 0.42; 95% CI 0.26, 0.59), whereas lower doses of fiber did not. All treatment durations (less than or over 4 weeks) were effective at increasing response to treatment.

Five RCTs, including 531 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of fiber supplements on global symptom scores using questionnaires. Overall, fiber supplements had no impact on global symptom scores (SMD −0.15, 95% CI −0.39, 0.08); however, when only those that were administered for greater durations (≥ 4 weeks) were meta‐analyzed, this led to significant improvements (SMD −0.42, 95% CI 0.77, −0.06), highlighting fiber supplements should be trialed for a minimum of 4 weeks. No dose–response effect was shown. When performing subgroup analyses based on the specific type of fiber used, polydextrose and galacto‐oligosaccharides had no impact on global symptoms. Pectin and wheat bran were only investigated in one RCT and thus no statement could be developed for these fiber supplements.

### The role of food in the treatment of bowel disorders: focus on irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation [^e1ad1ac1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fiber supplementation

Dietary fiber comprises a diverse group of nondigestible carbohydrates containing varying length chains of sugar monomers. Fiber is characterized by heterogeneity in structure, functional properties including bulking, viscosity/gel formation, and fermentability (Table 2), and clinical effects. Dietary fiber represents a wide variety of fiber types with varied functional properties. Despite how commonly fiber is the target of manipulation in clinical practice, the effect of systematically altering dietary fiber intake in patients with IBS has not been formally reported. The NICE guidelines recommend limited intake of high-fiber foods (e.g. whole meal bread) and resistant starch (e.g. processed or recooked foods), largely on the basis of expert opinion. Most clinical evidence relates to the use of specific fiber types as supplements, where monotherapy with psyllium (ispaghula) or wheat bran have been the main fibers assessed in RCTs. Meta-analyses have reported symptomatic benefit only for psyllium (7–30 g/d, number needed to treat (NNT) = 7) and not for wheat bran, inulin, or oligosaccharides. Based on these findings, clinical practice guidelines have recommended the use of soluble fibers and avoidance of insoluble fibers for patients with bowel disorders such as IBS and chronic idiopathic constipation. Unfortunately, dichotomizing the benefit of fiber on the basis of solubility oversimplifies the many ways in which fiber can influence the luminal microenvironment and gut function.

### The effect of fiber supplementation on chronic constipation in adults: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5c8fbc44]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

An improvement in whole GTT by 18 hours was found only when fiber was administered for a greater duration. The study that exhibited the largest effect used wheat bran. It is likely that the decrease in GTT with wheat bran supplementation results from modification of the gut microbiota composition and its metabolites, ultimately regulating the intestinal contractile activity.

Severity of straining improved with fiber supplementation, with psyllium and high fiber doses being particularly effective. However, integrative symptom scores were not affected, nor were severity of incomplete evacuation, abdominal pain or discomfort, or bloating. This suggests that fiber supplementation may be more suitable to specific cohorts of individuals who experience certain symptoms, such as infrequent bowel movements, hard stools, and straining, but not other symptoms, such as incomplete evacuation or bloating.

QoL scores were measured in studies administering polydextrose. However, QoL scores improved by only 0.25 points when polydextrose was administered for 4 weeks, which is considerably less improvement than the recommended minimal clinically meaningful difference of a 0.5- to 1-point change in PAC-QoL; therefore, it is unlikely that this will have a noticeable impact on patients' QoL scores. Furthermore, polydextrose was not effective at improving other patient-important outcomes, such as stool output or symptom scores.

In general, fiber was a safe intervention, although adverse events were reported. Severity of flatulence was significantly higher with fiber compared to control treatment. This is an expected side effect, as 2 of the 3 included studies, contributing to 89.9% of weight in the meta-analysis, were from inulin-type fructans, which are highly fermentable fibers that lead to microbiota-mediated gas production. This finding agrees with a previous meta-analysis showing that fiber increases flatulence. One study reported abdominal pain leading to withdrawal from a participant receiving wheat bran. These adverse effects highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate type of fiber and dose regime, both for optimum effectiveness and for the prevention of adverse effects. Psyllium supplements should be used in favor of wheat bran, and individuals should gradually increase their fiber intakes to prevent sudden symptom exacerbation.

### The effect of fiber supplementation on chronic constipation in adults: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^efa2cccc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 7356 nonduplicated records were identified, of which 93 were deemed to be potentially eligible (Figure 1). Of these, 77 records were excluded (Supplemental Table 1). One completed but unpublished trial (NCT01847950) was confirmed to be eligible after contact with the principal investigator; however, the data could not be shared due to a confidentiality agreement. In total, 16 RCTs fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review, involving 1251 participants with chronic constipation. Table 2 displays the characteristics of the included studies. Twelve studies were in English, 2 were in Spanish, 1 was in Korean, and 1 was in Chinese. There were 14 parallel RCTs and 2 crossover RCTs. For 1 crossover study, data from the first period only were extracted due to an inadequate washout period. There was variability in the fiber type (e.g. psyllium, polydextrose), dose (4 to 40 g/d), and treatment duration (2 to 8 weeks) studied. Authors of all studies were contacted for further information. Of these, 7 replied and 1 provided data for inclusion in the analyses.

Chronic idiopathic constipation — senna randomized controlled trial evidence: One placebo-controlled RCT randomly assigned participants to 1 g of senna (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) for 28 days. Senna increased complete spontaneous bowel movements per week (MD 7.60, 95% CI 5.90–9.30), and the response rate might be higher than placebo (RR 5.25, 95% CI 2.05–13.47). Participants taking senna may have higher rates of diarrhea, 175 more per 1,000 (from 100 fewer to 1,000 more), and no participants in the senna and placebo arms experienced a severe treatment-related adverse event. Dosing in the single RCT was 1 g by mouth daily for 4 weeks; most commercially available senna products contain 8–9 mg per tablet; and 83% of participants randomized to senna reduced their daily dose during the trial.

### Loperamide versus psyllium fiber for treatment of fecal incontinence: the fecal incontinence prescription (Rx) management (FIRM) randomized clinical trial [^e3f87b08]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fecal incontinence is a devastating condition with few US Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic treatment options. Loperamide and psyllium, both first-line treatments, have different mechanisms of action without any comparative data.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness and tolerability of loperamide compared with psyllium for reducing fecal incontinence. We hypothesized that psyllium fiber supplementation would be more effective than loperamide for reducing fecal incontinence episodes and have fewer adverse effects.

Design

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial comparing loperamide (followed by psyllium) with psyllium (followed by loperamide).

Settings

Our sites included outpatient clinics within a Veterans Affairs medical center and university affiliate.

Patients

Participants included community-dwelling adults (n = 80) with at least 1 fecal incontinent episode on a 7-day bowel diary.

Intervention

Participants received either daily loperamide (plus placebo psyllium powder) or psyllium powder (plus loperamide placebo) for 4 weeks. After a 2-week washout, participants crossed over to 4 weeks of alternate treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the number of fecal incontinence episodes from 7-day bowel diaries. Secondary outcomes included symptom severity, quality of life, and tolerability.

Results

Mean age was 60.7 ± 10.1 years; 68% were men. After determining nonsignificant carryover effects, combined analyses showed no differences between the loperamide and psyllium groups for reducing fecal incontinent episodes, symptom severity, or quality of life. Within each group, both loperamide and psyllium reduced fecal incontinent episodes and improved symptom severity and quality of life. Constipation occurred in 29% of participants for loperamide vs 10% for psyllium.

Limitations

Limitations include the washout period length and dropout rate after crossing over to the second intervention.

Conclusions

Both loperamide and psyllium improve fecal incontinence. Loperamide was associated with more adverse effects, especially constipation.

6 Research Recommendations

The Guideline Steering Committee developed a list of research recommendations based upon the findings of the systematic reviews and the GRADE process in developing these recommendation statements. These are summarized in Box 1.

BOX 1
Research Recommendations for Dietary Interventions in Chronic Constipation.

Probiotic supplements: It is still unclear which strains of probiotics are effective in constipation. Further well‐designed RCTs examining the effect of appropriately characterized probiotic strains in chronic constipation are needed.
Synbiotic supplements: The evidence for synbiotic supplements in chronic constipation is sparse. Further RCTs examining different combinations of probiotic and prebiotic/fiber supplements in chronic constipation are needed.
Prunes: Evidence from a systematic review and meta‐analysis of RCTs suggests that prunes are not more effective than psyllium in improving constipation outcomes. Psyllium is itself an effective treatment for chronic constipation. However, these studies did not follow a truly comparative evaluation design in that the studies were not equivalence trials; hence, it is not possible to conclude that prunes are as effective as psyllium. Future studies are needed to establish the effectiveness of prunes in people with chronic constipation, through either a placebo‐controlled RCT or an appropriately designed equivalence RCT compared with psyllium or other effective interventions.
Fermented foods: There is increased interest in research into the use of fermented foods to improve chronic constipation. For example, a few small nonrandomized and uncontrolled trials on kefir have been undertaken, indicating potential beneficial effects on constipation. High‐quality RCTs are now required to establish the impact of fermented foods, such as kefir, in people with constipation.
Food products with inactivated bacteria: There is little research on the effect of food products with inactivated bacteria in chronic constipation. An RCT of pasteurized yoghurt with inactivated bacteria showed promising effects on the relief of constipation symptoms. Future studies are needed to establish the effectiveness of food products with inactivated bacteria in people with constipation
High fiber foods and diets: An increase in fiber intake is often recommended in the management of chronic constipation, alongside additional fluid intake. The vast majority of evidence is for fiber supplements, not high‐fiber foods or diets. There is promising evidence from single RCTs and uncontrolled trials of different high‐fiber foods in constipation (e.g. mango, figs, oat bran, high fiber cereal, and flaxseed flour) that warrant adequately powered and appropriately controlled RCTs.
While some studies exist on high‐fiber foods in chronic constipation, there are currently no RCTs evaluating the effect of a high‐fiber diet from a range of foods in the diet in chronic constipation. Future RCTs are required to establish whether high‐fiber diets are effective in chronic constipation and whether any beneficial effects might be enhanced with appropriate concurrent fluid intake.
Additional fluids: There is currently a lack of evidence to support that additional fluid consumption alone is beneficial in chronic constipation. Only one study of water supplementation (2 L/day) alongside a diet containing 25 g/day fiber has been performed and was effective in increasing stool frequency and decreasing laxative use in chronic constipation, compared to control. Future RCTs are needed to establish whether increasing fluid intake beyond habitual levels is effective in chronic constipation.
Caffeine: No RCTs have been conducted on the effect of caffeine on chronic constipation, and future trials are needed to establish this.
Senna: Senna is a popular treatment for constipation, and its use has been recommended previously in guidelines. Despite two placebo‐controlled RCTs individually demonstrating the effectiveness of senna supplements on constipation outcomes, compared to placebo, when these were meta‐analyzed together, the overall effect was no longer significant, albeit with significant heterogeneity. The many remaining studies of senna include numerous uncontrolled trials. Future high‐quality placebo‐controlled RCTs are needed to establish the effectiveness of senna supplements in chronic constipation.
Vitamin C: Anecdotally, vitamin C has been hypothesized to improve symptoms of chronic constipation. This originates from the fact that a possible side effect of high doses of vitamin C is diarrhea, and hence it may have a laxative effect in people with constipation. However, no RCTs investigating the effect of vitamin C in chronic constipation have been conducted. Thus, RCTs are needed to assess the impact of vitamin C in people with chronic constipation.
Trigger foods: Although several foods (e.g. rice, bananas) are widely perceived to worsen constipation symptoms, there is very limited research to support such claims. RCTs are needed to identify dietary components, foods, diets, and dietary behaviors that may trigger or worsen symptoms of constipation.

Stool consistency

Stool consistency was measured in 11 studies; however, 1 study did not report data, and these data were not obtained on request. Ten studies including 918 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The methods of measuring stool consistency varied, with most studies using the Bristol Stool Form Scale or a modified version of it. Fiber significantly improved stool consistency compared to control (SMD: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.46; P < 0.0001), and no significant heterogeneity was detected (I 2 = 0%; P = 0.56). Subgroup analyses showed that psyllium [SMD: 0.52 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.78; P = 0.0002); I² = 0% (P = 0.46)] and inulin-type fructans [SMD: 0.36 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.70; P = 0.03); I² = 0% (P = 0.38)] significantly improved stool consistency, but polydextrose and GOS did not; however, no significant subgroup differences were detected (P = 0.40) (Figure 4). Nonprebiotic interventions significantly improved stool consistency [SMD: 0.35 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.53; P = 0.0002); I² = 0% (P = 0.46)], while prebiotics or mixtures did not; however, no significant subgroup differences were detected (P = 0.65). High fiber doses (> 10 g/d) improved stool consistency (SMD: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.59; P < 0.00001), but low fiber doses (≤ 10 g/d) did not, with a significant subgroup effect (P = 0.02). All durations (less than or greater than 4 weeks) were effective at improving stool consistency. There was no significant heterogeneity detected between studies within each subgroup (Supplemental Figure 4). Funnel plot asymmetry was detected (Supplemental Figure 24).

### Efficacy and safety of traditional medical therapies for chronic constipation: systematic review [^9d95ad34]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Constipation is common, and its treatment is unsatisfactory. Although many agents have been tried, there are limited data to support their use. Our aim was to undertake a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of traditional medical therapies for chronic constipation and to make evidence-based recommendations.

Methods

We searched the English literature for drug trials evaluating treatment of constipation by using MEDLINE and PUBMED databases from 1966 to 2003. Only studies that were randomized, conducted on adult subjects, and published as full manuscripts were included. Studies were assigned a quality score based on published methodology. Standard forms were used to abstract data regarding study design, duration, outcome measures, and adverse events. By using the cumulative evidence of published data for each agent, recommendations were made regarding their use following the United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines.

Results

Good evidence (Grade A) was found to support the use of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and tegaserod. Moderate evidence (Grade B) was found to support the use of psyllium, and lactulose. There was a paucity of quality data regarding many commonly used agents including milk of magnesia, senna, bisacodyl, and stool softeners.

Conclusions

There is good evidence to support the use of PEG, tegaserod, lactulose, and psyllium. Surprisingly, there is a paucity of trials for many commonly used agents. These aspects should be considered when designing trials comparing new agents with traditional therapies because their use may not be well validated.

Individual gastrointestinal symptoms

The effect of fiber supplementation on the severity of individual symptoms was widely reported in various studies (Supplemental Figures 13–17).

Severity of straining was reported in 4 studies including 489 participants. Fiber significantly improved straining severity compared to control [SMD: − 0.32 (95% CI: −0.59, −0.04; P = 0.02); I² = 46% (P = 0.10)]. Subgroup analyses showed that only psyllium significantly improved straining severity [SMD: −0.65 (95% CI: −0.91, −0.39; P < 0.00001); I² = 0% (P = 0.67)], while polydextrose and inulin-type fructans did not (Figure 5). High fiber doses (> 10 g/d) improved straining severity [SMD: −0.45 (95% CI: −0.73, −0.16; P = 0.002); I² = 34% (P = 0.002)], but low fiber doses (≤ 10 g/d) did not, with a significant subgroup effect (P = 0.09). However, a low number of studies contributed data in each subgroup (Supplemental Figure 13).

Values were calculated as standardized mean differences (95% CIs) using a random-effects model. IV, inverse variance.

Severity of flatulence was reported in 3 studies including 153 participants. Fiber significantly worsened flatulence severity compared to control (SMD: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.47, 1.13; P < 0.00001), and there was no significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%; P = 0.84). Subgroup analysis indicated that 2 studies administering inulin-type fructans significantly worsened flatulence severity [SMD: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.14; P < 0.00001); I² = 0% (P = 0.60) (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure 14)]. Fiber had no significant impact on severity of incomplete evacuation, bloating, or abdominal pain or discomfort (Supplemental Figures 15–17).

### Exploratory comparative effectiveness trial of green kiwifruit, psyllium, or prunes in US patients with chronic constipation [^fea29e2f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psyllium and prunes are proven treatments for chronic constipation (CC). Asian studies suggest that kiwifruit may also benefit CC symptoms. We report a partially randomized, comparative effectiveness trial evaluating kiwifruit, psyllium, and prunes in US patients with CC.

Methods

Adults with CC at a US medical center were randomized to 3 natural treatments. Eligible patients had ≤ 3 complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs) per week and were partially randomized to green kiwifruit (2/d), prunes (100 g/d), or psyllium (12 g/d) for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in each group reporting an increase of ≥ 1 CSBM per week compared with baseline for at least 2 of 4 treatment weeks. Key secondary outcomes included stool frequency, stool consistency, and straining assessed daily. Treatment satisfaction and adverse events (AEs) were also measured. Standard statistical methods were used, and a P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Seventy-nine patients with CC (mean age = 42.7 years, 87% female, and 77% white) were partially randomized. Complete data were available for 75 patients (kiwifruit 29, prunes 24, and psyllium 22). For the primary endpoint, proportions of CSBM responders were similar for the treatments. For secondary outcomes comparing treatment weeks 3 and 4 to baseline, there was a significant increase in weekly CSBM rate with all 3 treatments (P ≤ 0.003); stool consistency significantly improved with kiwifruit (P = 0.01) and prunes (P = 0.049); and straining significantly improved with kiwifruit (P = 0.003), prunes (P < 0.001), and psyllium (P = 0.04). Patients randomized to the kiwifruit group reported significant improvement in bloating scores (P = 0.02). AEs were most common with psyllium and least common with kiwifruit. At the end of treatment, a smaller proportion of patients were dissatisfied with kiwifruit compared with prunes or psyllium (P = 0.02).

Discussion

Kiwifruit, prunes, and psyllium improve constipation symptoms in patients with CC. Kiwifruit was associated with the lowest rate of AEs and dissatisfaction with therapy.

Table 2.
Fiber types based on functional characteristics

The goals of introducing fiber supplements to patients with IBS are 4-fold. First, fibers have been applied to normalize stool characteristics. For example, fibers with particulate and water retention properties (such as wheat bran or sugarcane bagasse) may hasten colonic transit time and increase fecal bulk in patients with slow colonic transit, whereas fibers with viscous characteristics (such as psyllium) have been better for normalizing stool form. Second, fibers, through direct and indirect effects, may improve the structure and function of the gut microbiota. As substrates for fermentation, dietary fibers may be associated with benefits to gut health from, for example, delivery of short-chain fatty acids to the colonic mucosa. Currently, such suggestions are largely aspirational, given the lack of supportive outcomes data. Third, fibers can be used to correct or prevent problems associated with other diet therapies, especially the LFD, which tends to reduce fiber intake, potentially leading to suboptimal benefits for stool characteristics and reduced fermentation in the distal colon. Finally, a major goal when initiating fiber supplementation is to avoid exacerbating IBS symptoms, which presents as a real risk for fibers that contain readily fermentable and, hence, gas-producing components, such as fructans alone or when present in wheatbran and resistant starch. The use of nonfermented or very slowly fermented fibers such as sugarcane bagasse and psyllium are relatively well tolerated and both, by virtue of slowing fermentation and the rate of gas production, may be well tolerated when used with fermentable fiber. Clinical experience indicates, however, that a gradual introduction of additional fiber is better tolerated than initiating a large dose.

Dried plums or prunes are a well-established natural laxative. The basis of such a laxative action may be its content of sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, which acts as an osmotic laxative, and/or its fiber content that includes pectin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Dried apricots also contain sorbitol and fiber, though in smaller quantities than prunes. In RCTs, prunes in doses of 80–120 g/d (100 g = 12 prunes) significantly increase stool frequency and stool weight to a greater degree than placebo or psyllium (6 g/d) in patients with chronic constipation. In a 4-week, comparative effectiveness trial which enrolled 79 constipated patients from the United States, prunes (100 g/d), kiwifruit (2 fruits/d), and psyllium (12 g/d) led to significant increases in stool frequency compared with those in baseline. Although prunes led to the greatest increase in stool frequency, differences between the interventions were not statistically significant in this pilot study. Adverse events were most common with psyllium and least common with kiwifruit, perhaps because it is low in FODMAP content. At the end of treatment, a smaller percentage of participants were dissatisfied with kiwifruit compared with prunes or psyllium (P < 0.02).

7 Discussion

These are the first evidence‐based guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation. Overall, 59 evidence‐based recommendation statements were produced and graded for their level of evidence and strength of recommendation. A clinician‐friendly guide was also developed based on the recommendation statements to provide a practical tool that facilitates the adoption of the guidelines in clinical practice. In addition to the evidence‐based recommendation statements, 12 research recommendations were proposed to address unmet needs and gaps in the literature.

While previous medical guidelines for the management of constipation have included dietary recommendations, they almost exclusively focus on fiber quantity and/or type, omitting a variety of other effective dietary interventions that have been previously studied. For the first time, the current guidelines offer recommendations for various dietary interventions that have not been previously included in medical guidelines. For example, recommendations have been made for magnesium oxide supplements, kiwifruits, and high mineral‐content water, highlighting that these may improve cardinal symptoms of constipation.

To ensure these were strictly evidence‐based guidelines, recommendation statements were only produced for dietary strategies for which evidence from research studies exists, and recommendations for interventions for which evidence is lacking were not included. Previous medical guidelines have recommended patients to follow a high‐fiber diet. However, surprisingly, only one RCT was identified in our systematic review and meta‐analysis that assessed the effect of a high‐fiber diet (where fiber comes from a range of different foods/drinks across multiple food groups) in chronic constipation, and thus, no recommendations could be made for a high‐fiber diet. However, recommendation statements for several specific high‐fiber supplements and foods, for which evidence exists from multiple RCTs, have been made (e.g. psyllium supplements, kiwifruits, rye bread). Similarly, while senna supplements are widely recommended, they were found to be ineffective in constipation. While the individual RCTs separately showed a significant improvement in certain constipation outcomes, when they were meta‐analyzed together, there was no longer a significant impact, and a significant heterogeneity was detected between the trials, potentially contributing to the loss of the initially observed effect. As a result, the recommendation statements highlight that senna supplements have no impact on the assessed constipation outcomes.

Stool frequency

Stool frequency was measured in 15 studies; however, 1 study did not report data in a form that could be included in the meta-analysis, and these data were not obtained on request. Fourteen studies including 1040 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Stool frequency was reported in various units, such as bowel movements/week and days between bowel movements. Fiber significantly increased stool frequency compared to control (SMD: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.36, 1.08; P = 0.0001); however, considerable heterogeneity was detected (I 2 = 86%; P < 0.00001). Subgroup analyses showed that psyllium significantly increased stool frequency [SMD: 1.13 (95% CI: 0.39, 1.88; P = 0.003); I² = 67% (P = 0.05)], as did pectin and wheat bran. However, polydextrose, inulin-type fructans, and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) did not impact stool frequency (Figure 3). Prebiotics and nonprebiotics were effective at increasing stool frequency when administered individually but not as mixtures; however, no significant subgroup differences were detected (P = 0.73). High fiber doses (> 10 g/d) significantly increased stool frequency [SMD: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.38; P < 0.0001); I² = 86% (P < 0.00001)], but low fiber doses (≤ 10 g/d) did not, with a statistically significant subgroup effect (P = 0.06). Greater treatment durations (≥ 4 weeks) significantly increased stool frequency [SMD: 1.13 (95% CI: 0.50, 1.76; P = 0.0001); I² = 89% (P < 0.00001)], but shorter durations (< 4 weeks) did not, with a statistically significant subgroup effect (P = 0.03) (Supplemental Figure 2). Heterogeneity remained high between studies within each subgroup. No significant funnel plot asymmetry was detected (Supplemental Figure 23).

### Fiber and functional gastrointestinal disorders [^8378128d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite years of advising patients to alter their dietary and supplementary fiber intake, the evidence surrounding the use of fiber for functional bowel disease is limited. This paper outlines the organization of fiber types and highlights the importance of assessing the fermentation characteristics of each fiber type when choosing a suitable strategy for patients. Fiber undergoes partial or total fermentation in the distal small bowel and colon leading to the production of short-chain fatty acids and gas, thereby affecting gastrointestinal function and sensation. When fiber is recommended for functional bowel disease, use of a soluble supplement such as ispaghula/psyllium is best supported by the available evidence. Even when used judiciously, fiber can exacerbate abdominal distension, flatulence, constipation, and diarrhea.

5 Foods and Drinks

5.1 Fruits

Statements on fruits were derived from the evidence generated in a systematic review and meta‐analysis of four RCTs on kiwifruits and two RCTs on prunes that included a total of 258 people with chronic constipation and investigated the effect of these fruits on chronic constipation compared to psyllium supplements, a known effective intervention.

Two RCTs, including 184 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of kiwifruit in symptomatic response to treatment measured as a binary outcome. Overall, kiwifruits had no greater impact on response to treatment compared to psyllium supplements (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.91, 1.92).

Three RCTs, including 192 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of kiwifruit in stool frequency and consistency and were meta‐analyzed. Overall, kiwifruits significantly increased stool frequency by +0.36 bowel movements per week (95% CI 0.24, 0.48 bowel movements/week), compared to psyllium supplements, albeit this effect size is small. Kiwifruits had no significant greater impact on stool consistency when compared to psyllium supplements (MD +0.32 points on the Bristol Stool Form Scale, 95% CI −0.12, 0.76 points).

Two RCTs, including 86 people with chronic constipation, assessed the effect of prunes in stool consistency only and were meta‐analyzed. Overall, prunes had no greater impact on stool consistency compared to psyllium supplements (MD +0.45 points in the Bristol Stool Form Scale, 95% CI −0.24 to 1.14 points).

Three RCTs, including 192 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of kiwifruits on frequency of straining. Overall, kiwifruits had no greater impact on frequency of straining compared to psyllium supplements (SMD −1.62, 95% CI −4.45, 1.21).

Two RCTs, including 89 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of prunes on severity of straining. Overall, prunes had no greater impact on severity of straining compared to psyllium supplements (SMD −0.13, 95% CI −0.69, 0.43).

Fibers

Two studies scrutinized the effectiveness of soluble fibers for PD-associated constipation. Astarloa and colleagues investigated effects of dietetic supplements (375 mg wheat, 70 mg pectin, 2.5 mg dimethylpolyoxyhexane-900) in 19 PD-patients showing < 2 weekly bowel movements (BMs). Although raw numbers of stool frequency and consistency ratings were not reported, according to the authors severity of constipation improved significantly 2 months after treatment onset with all subjects showing ≥ 4 BMs/week along with decreased stool consistency. The supplement was well tolerated.

Ashraf et al.studied effects of psyllium. In a small RCT, three subjects were randomized to 5 mg psyllium BID and four to placebo both administered over eight weeks. Approximate mean values are derived from graphical presentations therefore accuracy may not be claimed. Significant increases in mean stool frequency (2.9 vs. 5.8 BMs/week) and stool weight (400 g vs. 1300 g/week) were reported for psyllium but not for placebo (3.4 vs. 3.5 BMs/week, 400 g vs. 850 g/week). However, neither affected mean CTT significantly. Besides, none of the monthly anorectal manometry parameters were affected. Furthermore, the visual analog scale (VAS) for stool consistency, straining effort, pain on defecation, or completeness of evacuation remained unchanged in both groups. Adverse events were termed mild and similar but not further specified.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^3f3dd9e5]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinicians should also consider individual co‐morbidities or dietary restrictions, as some interventions, such as high mineral‐content water or magnesium supplements, may be unsuitable for people with dietary restrictions (e.g. low magnesium or sodium diet). In addition, high mineral content water may contain high concentrations of sodium, and in those who already have high intake of sodium, it may contribute to intakes that exceed national recommendations for salt intake, with its associated impact on health.

The systematic reviews of the literature on the effect of diet on constipation revealed a major unmet needs and areas in which future research is warranted. As a result, the Guideline Steering Committee developed 12 research recommendations on supplements, foods, drinks, and whole diets for which high‐quality research is needed to improve the evidence base in constipation and, consequently, clinical care. It is noteworthy that most RCTs identified in the process of developing the guidelines studied supplements, a smaller number studied foods and drinks, and even fewer studied whole diets. A number of studies were industry‐funded, and it is possible that this may have driven research directions and, thus, increased the availability of research on specific dietary interventions. It is important moving forward that research studies use interventions and outcomes that are based on scientific and mechanistic relevance, as well as importance to patients.

Finally, it is worth noting that these guidelines were based on evidence from studies published by July 2023 and, therefore, newer studies published thereafter were not included in the development of these guidelines.

In conclusion, these BDA guidelines are the first‐ever dietary guidelines for the management of chronic constipation, providing recommendations on various dietary interventions and for several constipation‐related outcomes. A practical tool has also been developed to facilitate their adoption in clinical practice. Overall, specific fiber supplements (i.e. psyllium supplements), certain probiotic strains, magnesium oxide supplements, kiwifruits, rye bread, and high mineral water have all been shown to improve specific constipation outcomes. However, most of the findings originate from a low level of evidence, and further research is warranted to strengthen and improve clinical care.

### Chronic constipation in the elderly: a primer for the gastroenterologist [^6c1203fe]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

A gradually increasing intake of fluids and fibres up to 30 g/day is suggested. This goal can be achieved by recommending patient to integrate the diet with more fruits, vegetables and nuts in addition to adding varying amounts of bran. However, in elderly patients, increments in fluid intake should be monitored especially in those with cardiac and renal disease. In a classical study, this approach has been reported to fasten colon transit time in the constipated elderly without mirroring significant improvement on symptoms. On the contrary, a recent small sized study reported on the efficacy of diet and lifestyle modification on symptoms and QOL in 23 constipated elderly showing a significant improvement on both parameters. Moreover, the position paper of the American College of Gastroenterology on constipation had concluded that fibre are effective treatment in adults, but adverse events, bloating, distension, flatulence, and cramping may limit their use, especially if increases in fibre intake are not introduced gradually. In addition, fibres appear to be scarcely useful not only in patients with proven slow transit constipation, but also in those who suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction. Although very rarely, bowel sub-obstruction secondary to high fibres dietary intake have been reported in elderly patients. In an effort to overcome bran side effects a number of soluble fibres have been developed among them: naturally occurring (psyllium seeds), semi-synthetic (methyl cellulose) and synthetic (calcium polycarbophil). These compounds might also be regarded as bulking forming laxatives for the mechanism of increasing stool bulk by holding liquid in the gut. Psyllium and calcium polycarbophil have both been shown more effective than placebo in randomized controlled trials. However, low palatability and occurrence of side effects, such as flatulence and abdominal bloating likely due to fermentation by intestinal microbiota have been associated with high drop-out rates in the elderly. Finally, a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed that dried plums were more effective than psyllium on improving bowel frequency and stool consistency in adults with mild to moderate constipation.

### Effect of four-day psyllium supplementation on bowel preparation for colonoscopy: a prospective double blind randomized trial [^65c14c1e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with new onset constipation or presumed hemorrhoid bleeding frequently require the use of both fiber supplements and diagnostic colonoscopy. We sought to determine whether preliminary fiber supplementation would alter the tolerability or efficacy of a standard bowel preparation for colonoscopy

Methods

A prospective, double blind, randomized trial was designed to compare a short course of a psyllium-based supplement versus placebo prior to a colon lavage. Patients were given an unlabeled canister of powder, and instructed to take 1 tablespoon with 8 oz of water bid for 4 days before colonoscopy. A 4-liter polyethylene based glycol lavage was self-administered over 4 hours on the day prior to colonoscopy. A questionnaire on pre-study bowel habits and side effects was completed. Efficacy of the preparation was visually evaluated on a pre-determined scale.

Results

There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, race, age, pre-study stool frequency or consistency. Tolerability was equivalent but efficacy of the bowel preparation was worse in the psyllium group compared to placebo (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

In non-constipated patients psyllium based fiber supplementation should not be initiated in the few days prior to endoscopy using a polyethylene glycol preparation.

### Consumption of 2 green kiwifruits daily improves constipation and abdominal comfort-results of an international multicenter randomized controlled trial [^10a167c6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Randomization and masking

Computer-generated randomization using a stratified (country and study group) block (4 blocks of 10 per stratum) was applied to participants in Italy and Japan. New Zealand participants were randomized using a computer-generated 10-participant block design. Statisticians who generated the randomization sequences had no further role in the trial. Allocation concealment was by sealed envelope in Italy and New Zealand. Participants in New Zealand received their allocated intervention at study visits, while participants in Italy received the kiwifruit from a distribution center and the psyllium from the dispensary at S. Orsola Malpighi Hospital, Bologna. In Japan, concealed allocation was sent by an independent home delivery company who delivered the intervention foods directly to participants.

Study personnel performing participant assessments, data management and analysis, and clinical trial management were blinded to the treatments. All participants were informed that the study involved a comparison between kiwifruit and psyllium. The whole food nature of the interventions meant neither could be blinded to participants.

### Comparative profiles of lubiprostone, linaclotide, and elobixibat for chronic constipation: a systematic literature review with meta-analysis and number needed to treat / harm [^5765d1cb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding pharmacological treatment, a few traditional laxatives have been widely used. Stimulant laxatives are broadly classified into anthraquinone laxatives (sennoside, etc.) and diphenyl laxatives (bisacodyl, picosulfate, etc.), which are recommended for short-term use by the American Gastroenterological Association guidelines. Their long-term use may be associated with a risk of tolerance, which can lead to refractory constipation. Bulking laxatives (bran, psyllium, etc.) and osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, lactulose, etc.) are also commonly used. However, it has been indicated that patients as well as health care professionals reported dissatisfaction with relief from constipation symptoms after using fiber supplements, OTC laxatives, or prescription drugs, despite a wide array of treatment options being available.

### Demonstration of differences in colonic volumes, transit, chyme consistency, and response to psyllium between healthy and constipated subjects using magnetic resonance imaging [^6c686623]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In functional gastrointestinal disorders a lack of objective biomarkers limits evaluation of underlying mechanisms. We aimed to demonstrate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging for this task using psyllium, an effective constipation treatment, in patients and controls.

Methods

Two crossover studies: (i) adults without constipation (controls, n = 9) took three treatments in randomized order for 6 days - maltodextrin (placebo), psyllium 3.5 g t.d.s and 7 g t.d.s., (ii) adults with chronic constipation (patients, n = 20) took placebo and psyllium 7 g t.d.s. for 6 days. MRI was performed fasting and postprandially on day 6. Measurements included small bowel and ascending colon water content, colonic volume, transit time, and MR relaxometry (T1, T2) to assess colonic chyme. Stool water percentage was measured.

Results

7 g psyllium t.d.s. increased fasting colonic volumes in controls from median 372 mL (IQR 284–601) to 578 mL (IQR 510–882), and in patients from median 831 mL (IQR 745–934) to 1104 mL (847–1316), P < .05. Mean postprandial small bowel water was higher in controls and patients after 7 g psyllium t.d.s. vs placebo. Whole gut transit was slower in patients than controls (P < .05). T1 of the descending colon chyme (fasting) was lower in patients (213 ms, 176–420) than controls (440 ms, 352–884, P < .05) on placebo, but increased by 7 g psyllium t.d.s. (590 ms, 446–1338), P < .001. Descending colon T1 correlated with baseline stool water content and stool frequency on treatment.

Conclusions and Inferences

MRI measurements can objectively demonstrate the mode of action of therapy targeting intestinal fluid content in constipation.

### Management of constipation in older adults [^b8dfc8b2]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic constipation is common in adults older than 60 years, and symptoms occur in up to 50% of nursing home residents. Primary constipation is also referred to as functional constipation. Secondary constipation is associated with chronic disease processes, medication use, and psychosocial issues. Fecal impaction should be treated with mineral oil or warm water enemas. Most patients are initially treated with lifestyle modifications, such as scheduled toileting after meals, increased fluid intake, and increased dietary fiber intake. Additional fiber intake in the form of polycarbophil, methylcellulose, or psyllium may improve symptoms. Fiber intake should be slowly increased over several weeks to decrease adverse effects. The next step in the treatment of constipation is the use of an osmotic laxative, such as polyethylene glycol, followed by a stool softener, such as docusate sodium, and then stimulant laxatives. Long-term use of magnesium-based laxatives should be avoided because of potential toxicity. If symptoms do not improve, a trial of linaclotide or lubiprostone may be appropriate, or the patient may be referred for further diagnostic evaluation. Peripherally acting mu-opioid antagonists are effective for opioid-induced constipation but are expensive.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^0bd7d630]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Dietary fiber in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) issues a recommendation and summarizes evidence of efficacy and tolerability. The guideline states, "We suggest that soluble, but not insoluble, fiber be used to treat global IBS symptoms", with "Strong recommendation; moderate quality of evidence". Background notes that many experts recommend 25–35 g of total fiber per day; soluble fiber is found in psyllium, oat bran, barley, and beans, whereas insoluble fiber is found in wheat bran, whole grains, and some vegetables, and highly fermentable fibers could aggravate bloating and flatulence. A systematic review and meta-analysis identified 15 RCTs involving 946 patients and found a statistically significant benefit for fiber versus placebo (RR of IBS not improving = 0.87; 95% CI 0.80–0.94), with no significant heterogeneity (P = 0.09) and no funnel plot asymmetry (Egger test r = −0.20 (95% CI −1.14 to 0.74), P = 0.66); six studies including 411 patients evaluated the insoluble fiber, bran.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 210: fecal incontinence [^206372cd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Fiber for stool modification in fecal incontinence: Based on limited data, fiber can be recommended as a useful treatment, and psyllium may be offered to decrease fecal incontinence episodes. A small, randomized controlled trial of 206 women found that a daily fiber supplement of 16 g significantly decreased fecal incontinence frequency by 51% in the exposure group versus 11% in the placebo group. Once a woman determines her typical daily fiber intake, she can slowly increase dietary fiber by 5 g over 1–2 weeks to help avoid adverse effects. The 2015–2020 U.S. Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines recommend that adult women consume 28 g of fiber a day at ages 19–30 years, 25.2 g at ages 31–50 years, and 22.4 g at 51 years and older. A recent AHRQ review found short-term efficacy with fiber supplementation.

### Step on the accelerator: modern treatment of constipation [^e02eb068]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review aims to explore effective management of constipation, examine challenges in making a positive diagnosis, and highlights the significance of a positive patient-provider relationship and emerging treatments.

Recent Findings

Less than one-fifth of patients feel satisfied with treatment of their constipation. Sixty percent of patients with functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis have severe to very severe constipation that correlates with their upper gastrointestinal symptom severity. Two gold kiwifruits are noninferior to 10g of psyllium in the treatment of constipation. More than 40% of patients undergoing lumbar fusion continue to fill opioid prescriptions 90days after surgery, contributing to 80000 chronic opioid users annually. Most patients are using over-the-counter (OTC) treatments for constipation with greater than 60% dissatisfied. Pharmacologic management involves the use of GCC agonists and emerging drug classes such as bile acid transport inhibitors and sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) inhibitors. Nonpharmacologic treatments, including neuromodulation and FDA-approved vibrating capsule, show promise in improving symptoms and quality of life.

Summary

Constipation significantly impacts patients' quality of life and well being and the majority of patients are refractory to conservative measures and OTC treatments. Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments hold promise for improving constipation and quality of life.

### Clinical pearls for prescribing fiber and fiber supplements… [^38bd8168]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Adequate fiber intake has been associated with improved blood pressure, blood sugar, and reduced risk of breast cancer. It is uncertain whether increased dietary fiber reduces the risk of colon adenomas or colorectal cancer. Fiber supplementation is recommended as a first-line treatment for chronic constipation. Legumes in particular have been associated with reduced risk of CVD as well as improved blood sugar, weight, and longevity. Psyllium fiber appears to be particularly effective for the treatment of chronic constipation at a dose of > 10 g per day over a period of at least 4 weeks. Psyllium has also demonstrated benefits in treating hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, making it one of the more versatile options for fiber supplementation. Notably, combining psyllium with simvastatin can double the LDL-lowering effect — comparable with increasing simvastatin to 20 mg/day.

Similar results have been observed with atorvastatin. On its own, fiber supplementation typically lowers LDL by 5% to 10%. Other fiber supplements with evidence of benefit include β-glucan and galactomannan. Galactomannan at a dose of 10 g/day appears to be the most effective form of fiber supplementation for lowering blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes according to a recent meta-analysis, with a mean difference of -1. 5 in A1C. Physicians should exercise caution in recommending fiber supplementation for patients with active inflammatory bowel disease, although evidence of harm is lacking. Without sufficient fluid intake or in patients with slow transit constipation, fiber supplementation may increase the risk of bowel obstruction. Therefore, prescribe fiber with caution in patients who have an increased risk of bowel obstruction.

Excessive fiber supplementation may lead to diarrhea. A common adverse effect of fiber supplementation is flatulence and bloating. Starting low and gradually increasing the dose may help avoid these unwanted effects. American Family Physician has published additional patient education regarding increasing dietary fiber intake.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^7728c228]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Constipation is commonly treated with over-the-counter (OTC) products whose efficacy and safety remain unclear. We performed a systematic review of OTC therapies for chronic constipation and provide evidence-based recommendations.

Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase for randomized controlled trials of ≥ 4-week duration that evaluated OTC preparations between 2004 and 2020. Studies were scored using the US Preventive Services Task Force criteria (0–5 scale) including randomization, blinding, and withdrawals. The strengths of evidence were adjudicated within each therapeutic category, and recommendations were graded (A, B, C, D, and I) based on the level of evidence (level I, good; II, fair; or III, poor).

Results

Of 1,297 studies identified, 41 met the inclusion criteria. There was good evidence (grade A recommendation) for the use of the osmotic laxative polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the stimulant senna; moderate evidence (grade B) for psyllium, SupraFiber, magnesium salts, stimulants (bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate), fruit-based laxatives (kiwi, mango, prunes, and ficus), and yogurt with galacto-oligosaccharide/prunes/linseed oil; and insufficient evidence (grade I) for polydextrose, inulin, and fructo-oligosaccharide. Diarrhea, nausea, bloating, and abdominal pain were common adverse events, but no serious adverse events were reported.

Discussion

The spectrum of OTC products has increased and quality of evidence has improved, but methodological issues including variability in study design, primary outcome measures, trial duration, and small sample sizes remain. We found good evidence to recommend polyethylene glycol or senna as first-line laxatives and moderate evidence supporting fiber supplements, fruits, stimulant laxatives, and magnesium-based products. For others, further validation with more rigorously designed studies is warranted.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^98c369bc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite docusate's wide use for constipation, there have been no new studies evaluating its efficacy. In the previous review, docusate had level III evidence and a grade C recommendation, based on trials that found docusate to be no more effective than placebo and significantly inferior to psyllium. Given the current literature or lack thereof, we are unable to provide a recommendation for docusate.

Overall, the OTC products analyzed in this review seemed to be safe and well tolerated, with no reports of serious adverse events, although some studies failed to report any adverse events. GI symptoms (abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, diarrhea, and nausea) were the most common adverse events reported with a variable incidence for each product, and headache was the chief non-GI adverse event reported.

The limitations of our systematic review include that only studies published in the English literature were assessed, and given that constipation is a common global problem, it is possible that there are some remedies that have been tested and published in other languages that have been excluded in this review. We did exclude studies of less than 4 weeks' duration because we believed that a product that is likely to benefit a chronic condition should demonstrate both efficacy and safety over at least a one-month period. Although there are several methods of categorizing the basis of evidence for drug efficacy and safety, we chose the USPSTF criteria to provide meaningful comparative data with our previous analysis.

In conclusion, PEG and senna are the only OTC laxatives with level I evidence and grade A recommendations for the treatment of constipation, although PEG is the only one supported by both short- and long-term studies. Other OTC laxatives with a grade B recommendation include psyllium, SupraFiber, magnesium-rich water, magnesium oxide, diphenylmethane stimulants (bisacodyl and sodium picosulfate), fruit-based laxatives (kiwi, mango, prunes, and ficus), and yogurt plus galacto-oligosaccharide, prunes, and linseed oil. There was insufficient evidence (grade I) for polydextrose, inulin, and fructo-oligosaccharide. For these and other alternative products, there is a clear need for more rigorous, high-quality studies using standardized endpoints. Docusate lacks well-controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy and has poor evidence to support its use in clinical practice.

### Effects of rice-based and wheat-based diets on bowel movements in young Korean women with functional constipation [^4a452f39]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Constipation is a common digestive disorder, and insufficient dietary fiber intake is one of its major causes. In chronic constipation patients, dietary fiber promotes colonic mobility and improves bowel movements, which reduces the time that carcinogens remain in the body and thereby suppresses the outbreak of colon cancer. However, although increasing dietary fiber intake can be an efficient way to treat mild and moderate chronic constipation, it is not always effective in cases of severe constipation. It is generally recommended that individuals consume 20–25 g of dietary fiber per day to improve constipation. The daily recommended dietary fiber intake for Koreans is 12 g/1000 kcal, but the actual average intake is only half that. In general, fiber supplements are recommended to increase the fiber consumption of constipation patients. However, recent clinical studies have reported that high fiber diets, especially those in which the fiber is consumed as supplements, can cause intestinal discomfort such as convulsive abdominal pain and gas production, and even constipation or fecal impaction. In addition, several systematic reviews and meta analyses have reported that although dietary fiber increased the number of bowel movements in constipation patients, it was unclear whether it improved fecal consistency. Previous reports have discussed the relevance of fiber supplements to complement a lack of natural dietary fiber intake, such as resistant maltodextrin, beta-glucan, psyllium, inulin, cellulose, and konjac glucomannan, to bowel movements. It is important to find a safe and cost-effective way for constipation patients to consume adequate dietary fiber that minimizes side effects while relieving and preventing constipation. The most common food group consumed by humans per day is grains, which are divided into two categories, whole grains and refined grains. The whole grains include brown rice, whole wheat, oatmeal, rye, barley, corn, popcorn, buckwheat, quinoa, and sorghum, and the refined grains include refined flour or white rice from which the bran and germ have been removed. Most whole grains are a good source of dietary fiber, but refined grains contain little fiber. Moreover, whole grains improve bowel movements, increase fecal weight, soften feces, and help to normalize bowel movements and improve constipation by reducing colonic transit time (CCT). Studies of the relationship between the dietary fiber of grains and bowel movements have frequently been reported, whereas studies comparing various cereal dietary fibers with wheat fiber are insufficient. A few correlation studies reported bowel movements according to the intake of single or mixed grains, whole meal rye bread, and vegetables and whole-grain powder. Studies comparing and evaluating the effects of a rice-based diet and a wheat-based diet on bowel movements are insufficient. In summary, efficient measures are needed to help individuals consume enough dietary fiber from natural sources in daily life to improve their bowel movements, rather than to consume fiber supplements separated or synthesized from a particular natural food.

### The relationship between food components and constipation: a cross-sectional study [^b174d0d7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Similar to other cross-sectional studies of constipation, we found two related factors that were consistently reported in the literature. Overall, we identified common risk factors for constipation, including female and low economic level. Notably, our study did not establish age as a significant risk factor for constipation, and the age of 65 years did not emerge as a critical threshold for increased susceptibility to constipation. Conversely, some other cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have indicated that age is a significant risk factor for constipation. Furthermore, our investigation did not reveal a correlation between low education level and the incidence of constipation.

At present, there are many studies on the relationship between dietary intake and the incidence of constipation. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that fiber supplementation was effective in improving constipation. Notably, fiber intake is associated with an increase in the frequency of bowel movements, particularly at higher doses. Specifically, a dosage of psyllium exceeding 10 g per day, administered over a treatment period of more than four weeks, appears to yield the best therapeutic benefits. Nevertheless, analogous literature has indicated that, in comparison to a placebo, high-dose fiber supplements (exceeding 15 g per day) markedly enhance the frequency of defecation. From a sociocultural standpoint, individuals appear to possess a greater awareness of food components than of dietary fiber. However, there exists a paucity of research examining the correlation between the intake of food components and the incidence of constipation. In the present study, we conducted an analysis of various food components, including fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, dairy, oils, solid fats, and added sugars. We first conducted a univariate analysis, and the results show that, except for grains, dairy, and solid fats, all other food components are associated with constipation. After removing the confounding factors, the final optimal model shows that only vegetables, added sugar, and female are related to constipation. Strangely, the p-value of added sugar is less than 0.05, but the OR value is very close to 1. Nevertheless, an odds ratio (OR) value that approaches 1 should not be regarded as entirely devoid of significance. Firstly, the width of the confidence interval remains a critical factor, even when the OR is near 1. In the case of added sugars, the confidence interval is notably narrow and closely centered around 1, suggesting that the estimated values are highly precise and that the effect size is, in fact, near zero. Secondly, this investigation is based on a substantial sample size, which enables the detection of minimal effects. Although these effects may lack clinical relevance, they can still achieve statistical significance. In summary, the association between added sugars and constipation warrants additional investigation. Furthermore, while our research did not identify a correlation between constipation and fruit consumption, existing literature suggests that certain fruits, such as apples and mangoes, may have a beneficial effect on alleviating constipation.

### British dietetic association guidelines for the dietary management of chronic constipation in adults [^1b7deef6]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Four RCTs, including 239 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of fiber supplements on the severity of bloating. Overall, fiber supplements had no impact on the severity of bloating, compared to placebo (SMD 0.07, 95% CI −0.38, 0.51). When performing subgroup analyses based on the specific type of fiber used, two RCTs investigated the effect of inulin‐type fructans and showed no impact on the severity of bloating. Pectin and wheat bran were only investigated in one RCT, and thus no statement could be developed for these fiber supplements.

Three RCTs, including 299 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of fiber supplements on the severity of abdominal pain/discomfort. Overall, fiber supplements had no impact on the severity of abdominal pain/discomfort (SMD −0.14, 95% CI −0.36, 0.09). It was not possible to produce statements for specific types of fiber (psyllium, inulin‐type fructans, and wheat bran), as they were only investigated in one RCT only each.

Two RCTs, including 296 people with chronic constipation, investigated the effect of polydextrose supplements on global and specific components of QoL. Polydextrose supplements had no impact on global QoL (MD −0.04 scale points, 95% CI −0.19, 0.10 scale points; higher score is more severe), nor on the QoL components of satisfaction, physical discomfort, worries and concerns, or psychosocial discomfort.

Current treatment options

Diets of high fiber, fiber supplements and a lifestyle which includes exercise are also associated with the reduced risk of constipation. Current guidelines recommend initial treatment with over-the-counter laxatives for episodes of constipation. The American Gastroenterological Association guidelines recommended increasing fiber intake both as foods and supplements, and using cost-effective osmotic agents such as magnesium supplements or polyethylene glycol which offer patients a viable option after fiber diets, considering the safety, efficacy and relative cost effectiveness. Mixed soluble fiber supplements such as Suprafiber ® (Sunsweet Growers Inc. Yuba, CA.) and dried plums have been shown in two separate randomized controlled trials to be efficacious and safe and as useful or better than psyllium. These agents create an intraluminal osmotic gradient that encourages net water and electrolyte secretion. Stool viscosity is reduced, and fecal mass is increased with improved effects on peristalsis and constipation. Other agents such as bisacodyl or glycerol suppositories have also been shown to be helpful in relieving stool from the distal rectum. However, patients with chronic constipation frequently report dissatisfaction with traditional treatment options of fiber, supplemental bulking agents, exercise, bowel habit training, and over-the-counter laxatives.

### Inulin-induced improvements on bowel habit and gut microbiota in adults with functional constipation: findings of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^6a8807ff]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Increasing dietary fiber intake has been associated with significant cost savings in medical expenses for constipation, potentially exceeding $12 billion annually in the USA. Moreover, as one-third of patients express dissatisfaction with pharmacological treatments, seeking non-pharmacological alternatives, dietary fibers offer an appealing solution. Dietary fibers or osmotic polymers are believed to aid bowel function by holding water in the colon to soften stools, as seen with psyllium and polyethylene glycol (PEG), which serve only minimally as fermentable substrates for gut microbiota. In contrast, fermentable fibers, metabolized by gut microbes, have the dual benefit of influencing both bowel function and gut microbiota composition. Certain fermentable fibers, known as prebiotics, are of particular interest as they can selectively modulate bacterial taxa and provide health benefits. One such well-established prebiotic is (native) inulin, which promotes the growth of bifidobacteria and is approved by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for maintaining normal defecation by increasing stool frequency. In addition, inulin may alleviate constipation symptoms, and also impact aspects of brain function, such as cognition, food decision-making, or neurological biomarkers in Parkinson's disease. Thus, inulin offers a promising non-pharmacological alternative to managing functional constipation by modulating the gut microbiota.

Here, we aimed to investigate the effect of a four-week daily intake of 12 g inulin versus placebo on stool frequency and stool consistency, constipation-related quality of life and symptoms, resort to laxatives, physical activity, and fecal microbiota composition in adults with functional constipation.

### Adverse effects of laxatives [^ea017e24]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Laxatives are among the most commonly used drugs or additives. Most are quite safe when used judiciously, intermittently when possible, and in the absence of contraindications. Bulking agents and nonabsorbable compounds such as lactulose can cause bloating but have very few serious adverse effects except for the allergic reaction to psyllium preparations. Osmotic laxatives containing poorly absorbable ions such as magnesium or phosphate can cause metabolic disturbances, particularly in the presence of renal impairment. However, if taken intermittently, in the absence of conditions such as ileus or bowel obstruction, they have few adverse effects. Polyethylene glycol solutions are emerging as an effective and safe mode of treatment for chronic constipation. Of stimulant laxatives, senna compounds and bisacodyl are the most commonly used. Although there are data to support the neoplastic potential of this class of drugs in in vitro studies, epidemiologic data in humans so far has not established a clear link between these laxatives and colonic neoplasia. The link between stimulant laxatives and structural changes, such as the "cathartic colon" or enteric nerve damage, is not well established either. Danthron compounds should be avoided because of hepatotoxicity.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^b8d095a3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fruit-based laxatives

Fruits contain varying proportions of soluble and insoluble dietary fiber (including nonfermentable, slowly fermentable, and rapidly fermentable fibers), sugars (e.g. fructose and sucrose), and sorbitol. Fruit-based laxatives increase intestinal water retention and colonic volume, resulting in increased stool frequency and softer stools. In this updated review, 5 studies were identified (Table 5). These trials evaluated preparations of kiwi (n = 2), mango (n = 1), ficus (n = 1), and prune (n = 1). The methodological scores of these studies were 5 (n = 3), 3 (n = 1), and 2 (n = 1).

In a small study (N = 9), a kiwi fruit–based supplement had no significant effect on stool frequency or stool consistency versus placebo, although a second larger study (N = 87) found that a kiwi-derived powder was associated with significant improvements in the frequency of CSBMs, SBMs, and stool consistency compared with placebo-treated patients. Prunes were associated with significantly greater improvements in mean CSBMs per week (primary outcome) and stool consistency compared with psyllium in 40 patients with chronic constipation. A mango-based supplement was associated with significantly improved evacuation categorization (based on stool consistency and shape) compared with psyllium in a pilot study in 36 patients with chronic constipation. A ficus carica paste significantly improved colonic transit time (primary endpoint), stool consistency, and abdominal discomfort but had no effect on stool frequency, defecation time, abdominal pain, effort for evacuation, and sensation of incomplete evacuation.

Fruit-based laxatives were very well tolerated with few (mild GI-related events) or no adverse events reported. Based on the small numbers of patients enrolled in these trials, the data suggest that fruit-based laxatives are a well-tolerated and promising option for the treatment of constipation. Additional well-designed trials are required to confirm their efficacy.

### The effect of fiber supplementation on chronic constipation in adults: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^c95243d3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Laxative use

Two studies measured laxative use; however, data were only reported for 1 study. In this study, pectin supplementation significantly reduced the number of days participants took laxatives compared to control [mean: 1.4 days (SD: 1.0 days) compared with 1.9 days (SD: 1.2 days), respectively; P < 0.01].

Adverse events

Adverse events were reported in 12 studies including 1089 participants. In 1 study administering polydextrose, 18 events were considered to be related to the intervention and 10 events were considered to be related to the control treatment. These were all mild to moderate, except for 1 event in the polydextrose group that was severe (nausea). Another study administering polydextrose reported events such as abdominal pain, but there was no link identified between treatment groups and the occurrence of adverse events. One study administering psyllium reported that 2 participants (18%) in the intervention group had abdominal pain, compared to none in the control group. Another study administering psyllium reported that 3 participants withdrew from the intervention group and 5 from the control group, for reasons related to the reported treatment side effects. A study administering wheat bran reported participant withdrawal due to "unbearable" abdominal pain. Two studies reported that while adverse events did occur, none interfered with the trial process. Finally, 2 studies administering psyllium, 1 administering pectin, and 2 administering GOS reported no serious adverse events associated with the fiber products.

Compliance

Compliance was measured in 7 studies, but reported in only 3. Of those that counted returned sachets, 1 study reported > 98% compliance and another reported > 95% compliance in each group. One study reported that compliance was equally satisfactory in both groups; however, no data were provided. Another 2 of the 7 studies reported the numbers of participants excluded for noncompliance only: in the first RCT, 3 participants were excluded in the fiber group and none were excluded in the control group; and in the other, 4 participants were excluded, but the group they belonged to was not dislosed.

### Soluble or insoluble fibre in irritable bowel syndrome in primary care? Randomised placebo controlled trial [^e8d284ff]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of increasing the dietary content of soluble fibre (psyllium) or insoluble fibre (bran) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

Design

Randomised controlled trial.

Setting

General practice.

Participants

275 patients aged 18–65 years with irritable bowel syndrome.

Interventions

12 weeks of treatment with 10 g psyllium (n = 85), 10 g bran (n = 97), or 10 g placebo (rice flour) (n = 93).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was adequate symptom relief during at least two weeks in the previous month, analysed after one, two, and three months of treatment to assess both short term and sustained effectiveness. Secondary end points included irritable bowel syndrome symptom severity score, severity of abdominal pain, and irritable bowel syndrome quality of life scale.

Results

The proportion of responders was significantly greater in the psyllium group than in the placebo group during the first month (57% v 35%; relative risk 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.26) and the second month of treatment (59% v 41%; 1.44, 1.02 to 2.06). Bran was more effective than placebo during the third month of treatment only (57% v 32%; 1.70, 1.12 to 2.57), but this was not statistically significant in the worst case analysis (1.45, 0.97 to 2.16). After three months of treatment, symptom severity in the psyllium group was reduced by 90 points, compared with 49 points in the placebo group (P = 0.03) and 58 points in the bran group (P = 0.61 versus placebo). No differences were found with respect to quality of life. Fifty four (64%) of the patients allocated to psyllium, 54 (56%) in the bran group, and 56 (60%) in the placebo group completed the three month treatment period. Early dropout was most common in the bran group; the main reason was that the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome worsened.

Conclusions

Psyllium offers benefits in patients with irritable bowel syndrome in primary care.

### AGA clinical practice update on pregnancy-related gastrointestinal and liver disease: expert review [^4af864bb]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Constipation in pregnancy — Best Practice Advice 5 outlines causes and safe treatments. Constipation in pregnant persons may result from hormonal, medication-related, and physiological changes, and treatment options include dietary fiber, lactulose, and polyethylene glycol–based laxatives. Constipation may be experienced by 20%–40% of pregnant persons, and hemorrhoids occur in approximately 80% of pregnant persons, more commonly during the third trimester. Increasing dietary fiber to approximately 30 g/d and adequate fluids can help promote regular bowel movements and prevent constipation. Bulk-forming agents such as psyllium husk or methylcellulose are safe to administer in pregnancy, and osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol or lactulose can also be administered safely; stimulant laxatives should be avoided because safety data on these medications are conflicting. In a prospective study of 204 patients treated with hydrocortisone foam for hemorrhoids in the third trimester, no adverse events were seen compared with placebo, and encouraging pregnant women to avoid straining by providing ample time, using relaxation techniques, and adjusting diet and hydration is helpful.

Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) — bisacodyl and SPS efficacy, harms, dosing, and use: SPS increased responder rates (RR 2.60, 95% CI 2.05–3.30) and global relief (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.48–2.07), yielding 359 more responders (236–516 more) and 357 more with global relief (228–509 more) per 1,000 treated, but increased diarrhea vs placebo (RR 8.76, 95% CI 4.99–15.39) with imprecise serious adverse event data (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.02–2.67). Initial dosing in RCTs was 10 mg orally for both agents; bisacodyl is also available as a 10 mg rectal suppository, with oral onset 6–12 hours and suppository onset 30–60 minutes. At 10 mg in trials, bisacodyl caused diarrhea in 53.4% vs 1.7% and abdominal pain in 24.7% vs 2.5% vs placebo; SPS caused diarrhea in 31.8% vs 4.5% and abdominal pain in 5.6% vs 2.2% vs placebo. Both agents are contraindicated with ileus, intestinal obstruction, severe dehydration, or acute inflammatory conditions in the bowel, and the panel recommended their use for a short term or rescue therapy, noting long-term effectiveness has not been studied.

### Efficacy and safety of over-the-counter therapies for chronic constipation: an updated systematic review [^098c0887]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Foods with prebiotics

Prebiotics are nondigestible fibers (oligosaccharides such as oligofructose, galacto-oligosaccharides, inulin, and lactulose) that are fermented by and support the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria (e.g. bifidobacteria and lactobacillus). It is hypothesized that intestinal microbiota increase colonic peristalsis via a number of potential mechanisms and that prebiotics augment this process by supporting a healthy microbiome.

Two studies are included in the current analysis. One study (methodologic score = 5) found that a yogurt containing galacto-oligosaccharides, prunes, and linseed oil was associated with significantly greater stool frequency, easier defecation, and softer stools compared with a control yogurt in elderly patients with mild constipation (Table 5). Another study (methodological score = 2) evaluated rye bread, with or without Lactobacillus GG–containing yogurt versus yogurt alone and control (low-fiber toast) in patients with self-reported constipation. The rye bread–containing groups experienced shortened intestinal transit time, increased stool frequency, softened stool, and easier defecation compared with low-fiber toast but were associated with increased GI side effects (flatulence and bloating).

Yogurt with Galacto-Oligosaccharides + Prune + Linseed Oil: Level II Evidence, Grade B Recommendation
Rye Bread with Yogurt: Level III Evidence, Grade C Recommendation

Fiber-containing agents

Fiber laxatives work by increasing the weight and water-absorbent properties of stool, thereby increasing stool bulk and softening stool consistency. Fiber products can be classified based on solubility (soluble vs insoluble), viscosity (viscous vs nonviscous), and fermentability (fermentable vs nonfermentable). Soluble fiber (e.g. psyllium, gums, and pectins) blends with water, forming a gel-like substance, whereas insoluble fiber (e.g. cellulose, lignin, and oligosaccharides) remains unchanged as it passes through the GI tract. Fermentable fibers such as gums, inulin, oligosaccharides, and wheat dextrin can be digested by gut bacteria.

2.4 Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation

The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to guide these recommendation statements, including the "level of evidence" and the "strength of the recommendation".

"Level of evidence" for each outcome (high, moderate, low, very low) was assessed using the GRADE approach. This represents the level of certainty/quality of evidence for a given outcome. When several outcomes contributed to a statement (e.g. stool frequency and stool consistency for "stool output" statement), the lowest rating among the individual outcomes was used for the overall level of evidence for that statement.

"Strength of recommendation" was assessed also using the GRADE approach. It represents the level of confidence that the desirable effects of a dietary intervention outweigh undesirable effects. A "strong" recommendation signifies that most or all people with chronic constipation will be best served by the recommended course of action. A "qualified" recommendation signifies that not all people with chronic constipation will be best served by the recommended course of action, and there is a need to consider more carefully than usual the individual's circumstances, preferences, and values.

Each recommendation statement is assigned both a level of evidence and a strength of recommendation. Due to the different criteria used to determine these, it is possible that a statement may have low level of evidence due to, for example, inconsistency and indirectness of evidence, but have a strong recommendation due to, for example, applicability to most people with chronic constipation, benefits of use outweighing risks, moderate effect size, convenient use of dietary strategy, and low cost.

Recommendations considered important to inform clinical practice (e.g. appropriate dosage), for which GRADE‐supported statements were not possible or applicable, were included as Good Practice Statements. These were either evidence‐based or based on the expert opinion of the Guideline Steering Committee.

Secretagogues — lubiprostone for adults with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) who do not respond to over-the-counter (OTC) agents — the panel suggests the use of lubiprostone over management without lubiprostone (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). It can be used as a replacement or as an adjunct to OTC agents; duration of treatment in trials was 4 weeks, but the drug label does not provide a limit; nausea may occur and the risk of nausea is dose-dependent and seems to be lower when taken with food and water. Lubiprostone is approved by FDA for treating CIC at a dose of 24 μg 2 times daily; for IBS-C, the approved dose is 8 μg 2 times daily, and among individuals who respond, these effects generally manifest within 2 days. In randomized trials, lubiprostone increased spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per week versus placebo (MD 1.98; 95% CI 1.17–2.79) and may increase responder rates (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.36–2.06), 226 more per 1,000 (from 122 to 358 more), with little to no difference in serious adverse events though increased risk could not be ruled out (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62–2.42). Nausea was observed in 35% and led to discontinuation in only 5% of individuals; systemic absorption is negligible, and individuals with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency should receive a lower dose (i.e., 8 μg twice daily).

Therapeutic management

At present, there are no specific guidelines for the management of PD-associated constipation available. A fiber-rich diet, psyllium as a bulk laxative, stool softener, and sufficient liquid-intake have high therapeutic value in treating constipation, but regular physical exercise and physical therapy are also advisable. Exclusion of aggravating factors, such as anticholinergics, should be considered. Unfortunately, these measures are only useful in mild or moderate cases. In many instances, a colonic transit of more than 7 days is reported, and no improvement of colonic transit can be achieved by the various therapeutic options owing to the upper threshold. In this case, additional medication must be prescibed. An effect of domperidone in the upper GIT has not been shown for constipation.

Stimulants, such as bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, and senna are safe and helpful. In addition, stimulant laxatives and osmotic laxatives are recommended. The best results to date are achieved with macrogol. A disadvantage of lactulose is flatulence. Positive data are also available for therapies with probiotics and probiotic fibers.

There are still no studies on the effects of modern prokinetic agents, such as serotonin (5-HT4) agonists, e.g. mosapride. In the meantime, prucalopridhas been approved for severe constipation and may be administered to PD patients, although specific studies in this population are still lacking. Several new drugs, including relamorelin (ghrelin agonist), and chlorid channel activators, such as linaclotide, lubipprostone, and plenacanatide,– are in discussion. In rare cases of anismus, we recommend botulinum toxin injections.

### The effect of psyllium on fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, HOMA IR, and insulin control: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^55e73cdf]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Dietary fiber has been reported to significantly lower blood sugar levels and increase insulin in people with diabetes. However, it has been asserted that the combination of types of fiber, i.e. dietary fiber (lignin and nondigestible carbohydrates) and functional fiber (nondigestible carbohydrates and isolated) is an important consideration.

Psyllium is one of the most beneficial dietary sources of fiber currently available, and is a gel-forming mucilage derived from the Plantago ovata seed husk. The ground skin of psyllium seeds (plantago ovata or psyllium plantago) comprises an admixture of polysaccharides, which includes hexoses, pentoses, and uronic acids, and has been used as a viscose, solvable, gel-forming non-fermented fiber supplement. Psyllium is typically native to India, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries, and the consumption of psyllium seeds has nutritional benefits including, therapeutic treatment of constipation, diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, colon cancer, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, psyllium has been posited as a potential therapeutic option for control of diabetes. For instance, in one study, psyllium yielded a significant decrease in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), as compared to the placebo group, while insulin levels remained unchanged. Indeed, supplementing a moderate carbohydrate diet with psyllium, even for a short duration, appears to be capable of significantly reducing fasting plasma insulin in those living with diabetes. By delaying absorption, psyllium has a comparable effect to intestinal α-glucosidase inhibitors in decreasing carbohydrates digestion and absorption, which leads to increased levels of the glucoregulatory factor glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). In turn, this ensures that vital nutrients arrive to distal regions of the small bowel. A lack of dietary soluble fibers in the diet has been linked to an inexorable rise of coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and colon-related cancer, among other non-communicable diseases.

Considering the contradictory findings of studies in the field, we sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis study in order to obtain a more comprehensive result. This study will investigate the effect of psyllium consumption on FBS, HbA1c, HOMA IR, and insulin in adult populations.

### Management of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults with central neurological diseases [^a76b3674]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

People with neurological disease have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence and constipation than the general population. There is often a fine dividing line between the two conditions, with any management intended to ameliorate, one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical with a limited research base.

Objectives

To determine the effects of management strategies for faecal incontinence and constipation in people with neurological diseases affecting the central nervous system.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and all reference lists of relevant articles. Date of the most recent searches: May 2000.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating any types of conservative, or surgical measure for the management of faecal incontinence and constipation in people with neurological diseases were selected. Specific therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases that indirectly affect bowel dysfunction have also been considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

All three reviewers assessed the methodological quality of eligible trials and two reviewers independently extracted data from included trials using a range of pre-specified outcome measures.

Main Results

Only seven trials were identified by the search strategy and all were small and of poor quality. Oral medications for constipation were the subject of four trials. Cisapride does not seem to have clinically useful effects in people with spinal cord injuries (two trials). Psyllium was associated with increased stool frequency in people with Parkinson's disease but not altered colonic transit time (one trial). Some rectal preparations to initiate defecation produced faster results than others (one trial). Different time schedules for administration of rectal medication may produce different bowel responses (one trial). Mechanical evacuation may be more effective than oral or rectal medication (one trial). The clinical significance of any of these results is difficult to interpret.

Reviewer's Conclusions

It is not possible to draw any recommendation for bowel care in people with neurological diseases from the trials included in this review. Bowel management for these people must remain empirical until well-designed controlled trials with adequate numbers and clinically relevant outcome measures become available.

### Psyllium reduces inulin-induced colonic gas production in IBS: MRI andfermentation studies [^32485fcc]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our small mechanistic study has demonstrated that adding psyllium to inulin reduces gas production in patients with IBS and suggests that by choosing diets with adequate amounts of viscous fibre, patients may be able to obtain the prebiotic health benefits of high-fibre diets without exacerbating their IBS symptoms, particularly flatulence. Larger clinical trials are now indicated to confirm the clinical value of such mechanistic insights.
