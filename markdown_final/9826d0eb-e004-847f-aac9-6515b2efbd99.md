## Question

What is the ICD-10-CM code for cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infection?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the ICD-10-CM code is for cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ICD-10-CM category for nontuberculous mycobacterial infections. Then, I should verify whether there is a specific subcode for cutaneous disease. Next, I will check authoritative sources like CDC's ICD-10-CM browser and peer-reviewed studies that explicitly list the codes. Finally, I will confirm the exact code and note any nuances about specificity and alternatives if the organism is unspecified.

> Let me first confirm the parent category. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections are coded under A31 in ICD-10-CM, which covers infection due to other mycobacteria, and this is consistently used in large epidemiologic studies and coding-based analyses of NTM disease [^aa91a7a2] [^a3a6b0d6].

> Now, I should verify whether there is a specific subcode for cutaneous disease. Wait, let me verify the subcategories: A31.0 is pulmonary mycobacterial infection, A31.1 is cutaneous mycobacterial infection, and A31.2 is disseminated mycobacterial infection; A31.8 and A31.9 cover other specified and unspecified mycobacterial infections, respectively. This structure is explicitly described in Korean claims-based studies that exclude A31.1 when defining pulmonary NTM disease, confirming that A31.1 is the cutaneous subcategory [^d5d79db9] [^b3109e31].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check with an authoritative source. The CDC's ICD-10-CM browser and documentation confirm that ICD-10-CM is the U.S. clinical modification used to code diagnoses, and while the browser itself is the definitive lookup, multiple independent studies consistently map cutaneous NTM to A31.1, which supports the validity of this assignment [^20c2c21c] [^d5d79db9].

> I will now examine whether organism-specific codes exist for the two classic cutaneous NTMs. Mycobacterium marinum is classically associated with fish-tank or swimming-pool granuloma, and Mycobacterium ulcerans causes Buruli ulcer; both are recognized cutaneous entities, and although some authors note that ICD-10 coding for extrapulmonary NTM is most specific for M. marinum and M. ulcerans, the standard ICD-10-CM subcategory that applies broadly to cutaneous NTM is still A31.1, with A31.8 or A31.9 used if the organism is unspecified or not otherwise classified [^42ae4123] [^57842c8d].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final code. The ICD-10-CM code for cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is A31.1. If the organism is known and a more specific code exists for that entity, it may be appropriate to use A31.8 for other specified mycobacterial disease, but in most cases A31.1 is the correct and most specific available code for cutaneous NTM infection [^d5d79db9] [^20c2c21c].

---

The ICD-10-CM code for cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection is **A31.1** (cutaneous mycobacterial infection) [^d5d79db9]. Use **A31.8** for other specified mycobacterial infections (e.g. M. marinum, M. ulcerans) when the species is documented, and **A31.9** only when the species is unspecified or unknown [^42ae4123]. Accurate coding supports epidemiology, reimbursement, and public health surveillance [^20c2c21c].

---

## ICD-10-CM code for cutaneous NTM infection

The primary ICD-10-CM code for cutaneous NTM infection is **A31.1**, defined as cutaneous mycobacterial infection [^d5d79db9]. This code specifically denotes NTM infections localized to the skin and soft tissues, distinguishing them from pulmonary or disseminated forms of NTM disease [^d5d79db9].

---

## Subclassification of NTM infections in ICD-10-CM

ICD-10-CM provides a hierarchical classification for NTM infections, allowing for more specific coding based on clinical presentation and affected anatomical site:

| **ICD-10-cm code** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| A31.0 | Pulmonary mycobacterial infection |
| A31.1 | Cutaneous mycobacterial infection |
| A31.2 | Disseminated mycobacterial infection |
| A31.8 | Other specified mycobacterial infections |
| A31.9 | Mycobacterial infection, unspecified |

---

For cutaneous NTM infections, **A31.1** is the most specific code. However, if the specific NTM species is identified, such as Mycobacterium marinum or Mycobacterium ulcerans, the code **A31.8** (other specified mycobacterial infections) may be used to provide additional specificity [^42ae4123].

---

## Clinical relevance and epidemiology

Cutaneous NTM infections are increasingly recognized, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and those exposed to environmental sources such as water or soil [^f036689c]. Common clinical manifestations include:

- **Nodules**: Firm, painless subcutaneous nodules.
- **Abscesses**: Localized collections of pus.
- **Ulcers**: Chronic, non-healing ulcers.
- **Lymphocutaneous disease**: Sporotrichoid spread along lymphatic channels [^57842c8d].

The epidemiology of cutaneous NTM infections varies geographically, with higher incidence reported in regions with specific environmental reservoirs or healthcare practices [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic considerations

Accurate diagnosis of cutaneous NTM infections is essential for appropriate coding and management. Diagnostic methods include:

- **Culture**: Gold standard for identifying NTM species [^df64b77d].
- **Histopathology**: Granulomatous inflammation with acid-fast bacilli.
- **Molecular methods**: PCR and sequencing for species identification [^9b5f537e].

Delayed diagnosis is common due to nonspecific clinical features and the need for specialized laboratory methods [^aae50916].

---

## Treatment implications

Treatment of cutaneous NTM infections typically involves prolonged antibiotic therapy, often requiring combination regimens based on species-specific susceptibility testing [^f036689c]. Surgical debridement may be necessary for localized lesions or abscesses [^f036689c]. Accurate ICD-10-CM coding ensures appropriate reimbursement for these extended treatment courses and multidisciplinary care.

---

## Limitations and challenges in coding

Despite the availability of specific ICD-10-CM codes, challenges persist in accurately coding cutaneous NTM infections:

- **Underreporting**: Many cases remain undiagnosed or misclassified [^51509975].
- **Misclassification**: Errors in coding can occur due to lack of awareness or incomplete documentation [^e4bca21b].
- **Lack of specificity**: In some cases, the specific NTM species is not identified, necessitating the use of unspecified codes (A31.9) [^e1f4f165].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10-CM code for cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is **A31.1** (cutaneous mycobacterial infection) [^d5d79db9]. Accurate coding is essential for epidemiological tracking, clinical management, and reimbursement. Clinicians should document the specific NTM species when identified to enable more precise coding using **A31.8** (other specified mycobacterial infections) [^42ae4123].

### Mortality rate and cause of death in adults with extrapulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria infection, Denmark [^42ae4123]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The significantly higher proportion of extrapulmonary NTM patients with other bacterial diseases and pneumonia could be associated with an increased likelihood of immune dysfunction. Pneumonia is also a risk factor for pulmonary NTM. However, that finding could also be because of misdiagnoses and erroneous use of diagnostic codes.

This study was based on national registers, and the data entered in those registers imply an inherent risk for underreporting, overreporting, and misclassification. Treatment of extrapulmonary NTM disease is centralized in 6 hospitals in Denmark with specialized centers for mycobacterial diseases, and we are confident that the diagnoses have a high rate of accuracy. Previous validations of diagnostic codes in our registers have shown a high positive predictive value. The ICD-10 codes pertaining to extrapulmonary NTM manifestation and species are only specific for skin infections with M. marinum and M. ulcerans, and the registers used in this study do not contain data on microbiology or all relevant risk factors (e.g. type of immunosuppressants). This factor limited our ability to precisely describe the type, localization, and pathogenicity of NTM infections, including species. Nevertheless, the percentage of extrapulmonary NTM skin infections in our study (29.7%) is comparable to those in a US culture-based study (32%). We assume that using ICD-10 codes for extrapulmonary NTM disease correlates well with clinically relevant disease compared with relying on microbiologic data alone. Furthermore, the inclusion of M. ulcerans patients could be debated, because M. ulcerans might not be considered as a separate disease entity, although it is genetically very similar to M. marinum.

Data on the causes of death are registered by the physician who verifies the death. However, those physicians might not be familiar with the patient's entire medical history or with complex infections, making it difficult to differentiate between causes of death in this comorbid population. The low number of autopsies conducted in Denmark calls into question the validity of the death certificates; however, that issue appears to be common in other settings.

In conclusion, patients with extrapulmonary NTM infection have a significantly higher burden of comorbidities than do matched controls. The mortality rate remained higher for persons with extrapulmonary NTM infection than for matched controls after adjusting for a comorbidity severity index. In addition, patients with extrapulmonary NTM disease often die from underlying comorbidities, such as hematologic malignancies and HIV, not from extrapulmonary NTM disease.

Methods

Data Source and Study Population

We used data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), specifically the State Inpatient Databases (SID). The SIDs provide record-level data, without personal identifiers, on nearly 100% of community hospital discharges in participating states. Records were included for hospitalizations that had an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), code associated with pulmonary NTM (031.0) as a primary or secondary discharge diagnosis. The study population included all records for persons hospitalized with pulmonary NTM as a primary or secondary diagnosis in the 11 states participating in HCUP (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Wisconsin) during the years specified. These states represented 42% of the US population during the study period.

Data Analysis

Data elements available in the HCUP dataset included year of hospitalization, age when hospitalized, sex, state where hospitalization occurred, type of NTM infection (pulmonary, disseminated, cutaneous, unspecified, or other) and up to 29 possible secondary diagnoses. No information on mycobacterial species is available in this dataset. Because NTM is known to be a common opportunistic infection among people with AIDS, particularly before the widespread availability of combination antiretroviral medications, we limited our analysis to non-AIDS NTM using the code for HIV/AIDS (042), which indicates hospitalizations where AIDS was known to be an underlying illness. Additionally, we restricted our analysis to the 1998–2005 study period to avoid misclassification among types of NTM because the ICD-9-CM code for disseminated NTM was introduced in 1997. Before implementation, hospitalizations associated with disseminated NTM may have been included in the 4 other NTM categories (pulmonary, cutaneous, unspecified, other). We examined prevalence trends in pulmonary NTM by age and sex and described the most frequently associated underlying illnesses. To analyze the most frequent secondary underlying illnesses, we grouped the following conditions/codes as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): obstructive chronic bronchitis with and without exacerbation (ICD-9-CM 491.21, 491.22); emphysema not elsewhere classified (492.8); chronic obstructive asthma (493.20); and chronic airway obstruction not elsewhere classified (496).

### ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes: what? Why? How? [^fb8d01f8]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

Methods

HIRA big data

Korea has an NHI that covers 98% of the total population, numbering approximately 50 million as of 2014. HIRA big data are generated while reimbursing health care providers under the NHI, which is an obligation for all medical institutes. The data include comprehensive information about age, gender, diagnosis, hospitalization, outpatient service, procedures, surgeries, examination, treatment, prescriptions, and cost. The database has been accessible to all researchers since 2009.

Study population

Patients with a diagnostic code of NTM (A31, infection due to other mycobacteria) according to the International Classification of Disease-Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding system were retrospectively identified between January 1st, 2007, and June 30th, 2019 from the HIRA main database. The relevant information was extracted from secondary accessible research data. This study used research data (M20200229346) from the HIRA database. The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the HIRA and the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW).

Definition of NTM-PD

Diagnostic code-based NTM-PD patients were defined as patients who had NTM (ICD-10: A31) as a primary or secondary diagnosis on at least 2 occasions within 180 days. Cutaneous mycobacterial infection (ICD-10: A31.1) was excluded as a diagnosis of NTM. The Korean Classification of Diseases (KCD), similar to ICD-10, did not include disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (ICD-10: A31.2); thus, excluding this condition was not required. The first year, 2007, was used as a washout period, and patients from 2008 to 2018 were analyzed. The incidence and prevalence were calculated for the population according to sex and age groups with data from the Ministry of the Interior and Safety. Clinically refined NTM-PD patients were excluded from diagnostic code-based NTM-PD patients diagnosed at medical institutions with an implementation rate of less than 5% of diagnosis-related AFB cultures. For a comprehensive patient definition, clinically refined NTM-PD patients were identified by excluding medical institutions with low AFB culture rates and then reanalyzing the data according to the criteria for diagnostic code-based NTM-PD patients.

### Therapy of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections [^aae50916]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Mycobacterial infections are increasing in incidence worldwide, partly as a result of the increase in immunocompromised individuals. They cause a large number of cutaneous infections with a broad array of manifestations. Because of their diverse manifestations and sometimes fastidious nature, infections with mycobacteria are often misdiagnosed, leading to delay in and sometimes failure of therapy. In addition, many mycobacteria display both in vitro and in vivo drug resistance to antimicrobial agents. Early recognition of affected patients, initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy based on current guidelines, and tailoring of therapy after susceptibility testing is available are therefore essential to the successful treatment of mycobacterial infections.

### Modernizing tuberculosis risk assessments for healthcare systems: utilizing ICD-10 diagnostic codes for a site-based approach [^9681a638]. American Journal of Infection Control (2025). Medium credibility.

Exposure to tuberculosis (TB) in healthcare settings can pose a significant risk to patients, families, and healthcare personnel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that healthcare facilities perform an annual risk assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of current TB infection control measures but do not offer methods to encompass larger healthcare systems with geographically diverse facilities. We sought to develop a supplemental risk assessment strategy utilizing ICD-10-CM codes to further quantify TB risk for individual sites across our healthcare system.

### Prevalence, incidence, and mortality of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in Korea: a nationwide population-based study [^e1f4f165]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study has limitations. First, we defined NTM infection using only ICD-10 code assigned by health care providers. Our coding-based analysis could not examine the laboratory results, patient records, or radiologic results. We relied on physician judgment for diagnosis of NTM infection. Although we analyzed the epidemiology of NTM infection using a variety of working definitions, we could not know exactly what results would be most similar to the real NTM epidemiology in Korea. Unfortunately, there is no study to confirm the accuracy of the coding definition of NTM in Korea. Diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease is difficult for several reasons, including variable symptoms of patients, need for computed tomography, presence of the organism in the environment, a disease definition based on scant evidence, and no obligation to report the disease. Most epidemiologic studies for NTM pulmonary disease have suffered these challenges. Second, the prevalence of NTM infection might be underestimated compared to its incidence. NTM infection may often remain life-long in patients because of its chronic feature of inflammation and frequent re-infection. Therefore, the annual prevalence can increase in proportion to its cumulative incidence. For analysis of annual prevalence, we only included patients visiting medical institutions that year. Therefore, patients who did not visit medical institutions regularly might have been excluded from the prevalence analysis. Third, the specific sites of NTM infection could not be analyzed. Our analysis was limited using the less specific A31 code because more specific codes (A31.0 and A31.1) were infrequently specified in the NHIS databases.

Results

Newly diagnosed NTM-PD patients

Figure 1 summarizes the process of defining the NTM-PD patients. From January 2007 to December 2018, a total of 110,329 patients were treated for NTM. Among them, 1370 patients had cutaneous mycobacterial infections, and 4057 patients were treated in 2007. Of the 104,902 patients that were included after excluding the above patients, 60,071 patients were estimated to have NTM-PD, except for 44,831 patients who did not visit hospitals within six months or who returned after six months.

### Diagnostics, management and outcomes of pediatric nontuberculous mycobacterial infections: a 12-year retrospective study [^eabaad8f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Clinical features may mimic malignancy, and although prognosis is favorable, treatment is often prolonged and may result in cosmetic sequelae.

Methods

We described the clinical characteristics, management and treatment outcomes of children diagnosed with NTM infections in the Central Denmark Region between 2011 and 2023. Children were identified using mycobacteriologic data and ICD-10 diagnostic codes. Detailed clinical information was extracted from hospital records, and descriptive analyses were performed.

Results

Eighty children were included, corresponding to annual incidence rates of 0.7–3.3 per 100,000. The median age at presentation was 2 years, and 55% were female. Lymphadenitis was the most common presentation (92.5%), and fever was reported in 28% of cases. Mycobacterium avium was the predominant species (78.8%). Management strategies varied considerably: 47% of the children received no treatment, and both surgical and antibiotic interventions declined over time. Despite favorable clinical outcomes, cosmetic sequelae were common, including scarring (76%), residual discoloration (30%), fistulation or suppuration (12%). The median hospital admission was 2 days, and the median in-hospital follow-up was 236.5 days.

Conclusions

The incidence of pediatric NTM infections remained stable, but the clinical burden was considerable due to prolonged disease course and frequent cosmetic sequelae. Management practices varied widely, with decreasing use of active interventions over time. The apparent lack of consensus on treatment further emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of evidence-based guidelines to standardize care and improve outcomes.

### Inclusion of latent tuberculosis infection as a separate entity into the international classification of diseases [^4e05c54b]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

The 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) proposed by the WHO is currently in the consultation phase. In common with previous versions of the ICD this revised version does not contain a code for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), contrasting with the inclusion of a large number of codes for various manifestations of active tuberculosis (TB). Inclusion of a separate code for LTBI into ICD-11 is critically important for epidemiological, clinical and research purposes. On behalf of the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials group, we encourage colleagues worldwide who are caring for TB patients or are involved in TB research to join us in supporting the case for a long overdue ICD code for LTBI.

### Mycobacterial skin infection [^51509975]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Cutaneous mycobacteriosis remain underdiagnosed and undertreated due to economic reasons, low awareness and stigmatization. A reduction in the burden of these diseases requires a comprehensive approach, including community education in endemic areas, increased understanding of animal and environmental reservoirs, diffusion of rapid diagnostic tools, universal accessibility to free multidrug treatments and a multidisciplinary approach.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^f036689c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) — Although most infections occur after primary inoculation at sites of skin disruption or trauma, hematogenous dissemination does occur; in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients the most common manifestations include cutaneous and pleuropulmonary disease, and in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients catheter-related infection and bacteremia are noted. Disseminated infection with Mycobacterium avium complex occurs preferentially among patients with HIV disease, whereas bloodstream and cutaneous infections with multiple NTM species are more frequent among non-HIV-immunocompromised hosts; dermatologic manifestations include a poorly resolving cellulitis, painless 1- to 2-cm nodules, necrotic ulcers, and subcutaneous abscesses. Treatment requires prolonged combination therapy (duration, 6–12 weeks) that should consist of a macrolide antibiotic (eg, clarithromycin) and a second agent to which the isolate is susceptible, and surgical debridement is crucial for cultures and sensitivities and to promote skin and soft tissue healing.

### Cutaneous non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections in the outpatient setting: presentation of a case, review of the literature, and therapeutic considerations [^d5695a22]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Mycobacterial infections are not common issues for many dermatologists. Recognition and treatment of these infections are frequently delayed by incorrect diagnoses. Frequently, the diagnosis of a mycobacterial infection is hampered by coinfection with bacteria including Staphylococcus. In some instances, patients will have infections with both mycobacteria and Staphylococcus. For some patients, as was the case with the patient reported herein, a biopsy is required to establish an accurate diagnosis. Physicians need to keep an open mind when presented with cutaneous infections and consider mycobacterial infections for patients that do not improve with standard antibacterial medications.

### Prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, Germany, 2009–2014 [^f4fd627d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a biologically diverse group of microorganisms that may cause progressive NTM pulmonary disease (NTM-PD), particularly in persons who have risk factors such as advanced age or chronic airway diseases. However, population-based data on the epidemiology of NTM-PD are scarce, particularly in Europe. We used hospital discharge codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), as a surrogate to demonstrate that NTM-PD prevalence is steadily increasing in Germany, as is the case in many other countries. However, we assumed that most patients with this chronic infection are managed in outpatient care. The objective of this population-based study was to estimate the annual overall prevalence rates of NTM-PD in Germany over a 6-year period and to analyze the distribution of age and sex, the site of healthcare provision, and concomitant conditions, using a representative sample of routine statutory health insurance claims data.

### Cutaneous tuberculosis. part I: pathogenesis, classification, and clinical features [^aedd23e9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Tuberculosis is an ancient disease that continues to affect an estimated 10 million people per year and is responsible for 1.4 million deaths per year. Additionally, the HIV epidemic and multidrug resistance present challenges to disease control. Cutaneous tuberculosis is an uncommon, often indolent, manifestation of mycobacterial infection that has a varied presentation. Its diagnosis is challenging, as lesions mimic other, more common conditions and microbiological confirmation is often not possible. Cutaneous tuberculosis can be broadly categorized into multibacillary and paucibacillary forms. Approximately one-third of skin tuberculosis is associated with systemic involvement. By recognizing cutaneous tuberculosis early, dermatologists can play an important role in disease control. The first article in this 2-part continuing medical education series describes the latest epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Furthermore, we review the classification, clinical manifestations, common clinical differentials, and systemic involvement that occur in cutaneous tuberculosis.

### Extrapulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria infections in hospitalized patients, United States, 2009–2014 [^9af40d88]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) cause pulmonary and extrapulmonary infections in susceptible persons. To characterize the epidemiology of skin and soft tissue (SST) and disseminated extrapulmonary infections caused by NTM in the United States, we used a large electronic health record database to examine clinical, demographic, and laboratory data for hospitalized patients with NTM isolated from extrapulmonary sources during 2009–2014. Using all unique inpatients as the denominator, we estimated prevalence and summarized cases by key characteristics. Of 9,196,147 inpatients, 831 had confirmed extrapulmonary NTM. The 6-year prevalence was 11 cases/100,000 inpatients; source-specific prevalence was 4.4 SST infections/100,000 inpatients and 3.7 disseminated infections/100,000 inpatients. NTM species varied across geographic region; rapidly growing NTM were most prevalent in southern states. Infection with Mycobacterium avium complex was more common among patients with concurrent HIV and fungal infection, a relevant finding because treatment is more effective for M. avium complex than for other NTM infections.

### Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, south Korea, 2007–2016 [^ae699747]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Our study had some limitations. First, because we used diagnosis codes, the distinction between pulmonary and other diseases is unclear, and we could not confirm whether the patients completely met the diagnostic criteria of NTM infection. Second, because we only have data for 2007–2016, we could not exclude patients who had received diagnoses before 2007 when estimating the annual incidence rate. Finally, our definition of NTM infection on the basis of the International Classification of Diseases code may have underestimated the true disease prevalence because prevalence could be affected by loss to follow-up or death during the study period.

In conclusion, we report a substantial increasing trend in the prevalence and incidence of NTM infection in South Korea during 2007–2016 and evaluated regional variations. These data facilitate a better understanding of the epidemiologic trends of NTM infection globally.

### Prevalence, incidence, and mortality of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in Korea: a nationwide population-based study [^aa91a7a2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The prevalence of NTM infection was defined as the number of individuals visiting medical institutions who were assigned ICD-10 code A31 for NTM as the principal diagnosis. Only patients who visited the medical institution that year were included in the prevalence analysis because we tried to exclude patients who no longer suffer from NTM infection without using the medical institution. For incidence analysis, we used three different criteria. First, a new case of NTM infection was defined at a patient's first visit with ICD-10 code A31 assigned as the principal diagnosis. Second, a new case of NTM infection was defined at a patient's first visit with A31 code as the principal or additional diagnosis. Third, a new case was defined at a first visit in a patient having at least two or more visits with A31 code as principal or additional diagnosis. We used the first inclusion criterion as the primary method of incidence analysis and compared it with the other two inclusion criteria. If a person was identified as NTM multiple times, only the first identification was included in the incidence analysis.

For mortality analysis, individuals were followed up until the end of the study period or death. The time of death was recorded in year and month. The standardized mortality ratio was used to compare the mortality rate of those with NTM infection to that of the general Korean population. The immediate cause of death in the death certificate was used to classify the cause of death, including tuberculosis (A15–19), pneumonia (J12–18), chronic lower respiratory disease (J40–47), lung cancer (C34), other cancer (C00–97, except C34), cardiovascular disease (I20–25, I30–52), cerebrovascular disease (I60–69), diabetes mellitus (E10–14), and hypertension (I10–15) according to the Korean Standard Classification of Disease and Cause of Death-Sixth revision.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were performed for all variables. Annual NTM-related visits by sex, age, and region of residence were analyzed for incidence and prevalence. The general population living in Korea was used as the denominator for the prevalence and incidence analysis. The population during the middle of 2010 was used as a standard statistical population. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to calculate the overall survival of NTM patients by sex, age, and CCI. The SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.

### Prevalence, incidence, and mortality of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection in Korea: a nationwide population-based study [^a3a6b0d6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic characteristics of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) disease remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate incidence, prevalence, and mortality of NTM infection in a large nationwide population-based cohort in Korea.

Methods

Data of the National Health Insurance Service database, an extensive health-related database including most Korean residents, were used. Adults with a primary diagnosis of NTM as determined by International Classification of Disease-Tenth Revision coding (A31) were identified between 2003 and 2016. Incidence, prevalence, and mortality of NTM infection were analyzed.

Results

A total of 46,194 individuals had a primary diagnosis of NTM infection. Their mean age was 55.8years. Of these subjects, 61.1% were females. Annual age-adjusted incidence and prevalence of NTM infection tended to increase rapidly from 2003 to 2016. Age-adjusted incidence and prevalence was 17.9 and 33.3 per 100,000 population in 2016. The incidence and prevalence were higher in females and the elderly. The 5-year mortality rate in the population with NTM infection was 17.8%. The standardized mortality ratio of patients with NTM infection to the general population was 2.16 (95% confidence interval: 2.10 to 2.22).

Conclusions

This large population-based study showed that the incidence and prevalence of NTM infection in Korea increased rapidly from 2003 to 2016. They were higher in women and the elderly. The mortality rate in the population with NTM infection was higher than that in the general population.

### Incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infection, by ethnic group, Hawaii, USA, 2005–2019 [^9d318447]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study Population

We abstracted demographic, clinical, and microbiological data from KPH electronic health records (EHRs) for the years 2005–2019. We included beneficiaries for each year in which they were enrolled for > 9 months; we excluded persons > 90 years of age according to limited dataset regulations. Longitudinal demographic data included age on July 1 for each study year, sex, postal code, and census tract–level socioeconomic measures (median household income, neighborhood deprivation index, percentage graduated from high school). The neighborhood deprivation index is a measure of neighborhood-level socioeconomic status calculated by Kaiser Permanente. The index captures census tract–level measures of income, education, employment, housing, and occupation; higher scores indicate higher deprivation.

Demographic data included self-reported ethnicity; the standard KPH beneficiary enrollment form enables identification with > 1 of 28 ethnic groups (Table 1). Additional health variables abstracted included height, weight, BMI, and smoking status. We searched EHRs for a set of prespecified codes from the International Classification of Disease, 9th and 10th revisions (ICD-9/10), for relevant underlying conditions ever coded. Although KPH does not serve the entire population of Hawaii, comparison with census data indicates that the KPH beneficiary population is generally representative of Hawaii residents with respect to age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (Appendix Table 2).

Incidence

Similar to prevalence, age-adjusted incidence of NTM infection was also increased from 2003 to 2016 (Fig. 2). The age-adjusted incidence was 1.0 per 100,000 population in 2003 and 17.9 per 100,000 population in 2016. Women had about 2.5 times higher age-adjusted incidence than men (24.9 vs. 10.4 per 100,000 population). Elderly patients also had higher incidence.

According to different diagnostic criteria, there were differences in the incidence of NTM infection (Fig. 3). The total number of patients was 46,194 using the inclusion criteria of one or more visits with A31 code as principal diagnosis. It was 128,710 using the inclusion criteria of one or more visits with A31 code as principal or additional diagnosis and 74,144 when using two or more visits with A31 code as principal or additional diagnosis. In each of these three groups of patients, the age-adjusted incidence of NTM infection in 2016 was 17.9, 58.7, and 26.1 per 100,000 population, respectively.

### Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria-associated deaths, Ontario, Canada, 2001–2013 [^2214c6de]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

A comprehensive population-based study from Denmark observed death rates of 39.7% for MAC-PD and 51.0% for M. xenopi disease, compared with 36.3% and 43.2% in our study. The higher rates of death in the Denmark study are interesting considering that the cohort was younger and had a smaller proportion of patients with COPD, diabetes, and renal disease. However, because the Denmark study did not provide detailed clinical characteristics and comprised approximately one third M. gordonae patients, comparing that cohort with the cohort in our study is difficult. Despite methodologic differences, the odds ratio (OR) for death in a Medicare-based study in the United States (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3–1.6) was similar to our HR for death in survival analysis (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.56–1.70). The US study comprised only patients who were > 65 years, not enrolled in a health maintenance organization, and identified with NTM infection using codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). Restricting our cohort to patients > 65 years of age would exclude > 37% of all patients with NTM-PD. Although the use of ICD-9 codes to identify patients with NTM infection has not been validated, this method appears to be specific but relatively insensitive, introducing bias depending on characteristics of NTM-infected patients not detected by this method.

### Prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease, Germany, 2009–2014 [^f13e0959]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

The Study

This study was based on the population of Germany of ≈81 million during 2009–2014, and a subgroup of ≈70 million persons (86%) covered by German statutory health insurance (Table 1). Because this study was based on anonymous routine data, institutional review board approval and patient consent were not required. We obtained anonymous health claims data from the Health Risk Institute health services research database, which contains a subset of ≈7 million persons covered by statutory health insurance. This database has been validated and shows good overall accuracy in documenting the German population in terms of illness, death, and drug usage; in addition, the number of insured persons in the database remains high over time. We established data characteristics by adjustments for age and sex according to the distribution within the general population of Germany. Only persons who were continuously insured within the respective year were considered. Of those persons, we obtained a 5% sample representative of the German population for each year of the study period, consisting of ≈4 million persons per year (Table 1). From these samples, we extracted records that used the ICD-10 diagnosis code A31.0 (NTM-PD) for either a primary or a secondary diagnosis, and we analyzed data according to age, sex, the site of healthcare provision (Table 1), and the most common and relevant associated conditions, as represented by concomitantly recorded ICD-10 codes (Table 2).

### Comorbidities associated with nontuberculous mycobacterial disease in Japanese adults: a claims-data analysis [^12c0744b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study design, patient identification, and matching

A case-control study was conducted using JMDC data. Individuals with NTM disease were included from 1,564,296 individuals who were registered in JMDC in 2014. Individuals aged ≥ 20 years with ≥ 3 claims associated with NTM disease (International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision [ICD-10] A31.0 [Pulmonary mycobacterial infection] or A31.9 [Msycobacterial infection, unspecified]) on separate occasions ≥ 1 month apart from January 2014 to December 2014 were identified from the JMDC data. The prevalence of NTM disease in 2014 was calculated. Controls that never had a claim associated with NTM disease were randomly extracted from patients who visited a medical facility at least once in 2014. A total of ten controls were matched by sex and age for each case.

Other comorbidities were identified utilizing ICD-10 codes from medical claims based on ≥ 3 claims separate occasions ≥ 1 month apart in 2014 as well (Table 1). Only confirmed diagnoses were included in the analysis. The 30 comorbidity complexes that had previously been suspected as associated with NTM disease were selected and compared. The definition of diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) also required be on long-term macrolide treatment.

Ethics approval was not applicable to this study based on Ethical Guidelines for Medical and Health Research Involving Human Subject issued by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare since only completely encrypted data were used.

Statistical analysis

The proportion of comorbidities among NTM group and non-NTM group was compared by chi-square test. We addressed multiple testing by setting a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of P -value < 0.000833 (0.05/60) as we tested 30 comorbidity complexes separating sex. All statistical analyses and matching were performed using EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan), graphical user interface for R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

### Comorbidities of nontuberculous mycobacteria infection in Korean adults: results from the national health insurance service-national sample cohort (NHIS-NSC) database [^bbbaca78]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Comorbidities and matching variables

In this study, diseases that were previously frequently reported as comorbidities in patients with NTM infection or were known risk factors were included as comorbidities of interest. We also included a list of the most frequently claimed disease codes by examining the frequency of all disease codes claimed by patients with NTM infection from NHIS–NSC 2.0 data. Consequently, we investigated the distribution of 26 comorbidities potentially associated with NTM infection (Table 1). Comorbidities were identified with the ICD-10 code when there were two or more claims, and only claims up to 1 year before the index date were included. All methods were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. Informed consent was waived, as this is a retrospective study of deidentified administrative data.

Table 1
ICD-10 codes for definition of comorbidities for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection

To identify diseases frequently associated with age, age was classified into four groups (20–39, 40–59, 60–79, and 80–89 years old). The income groups initially comprising 11 classes (class 0, lowest income; class 10, highest income) in the NHIS database were recategorized into three groups (low, class 0–2; medium, class 3–7; high, class 8–10). Region of residence was recategorized into urban (Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon, and Ulsan) and rural (Gyeonggi, Gangwon, Chungcheongbuk, Chungcheongnam, Jeollabuk, Jeollanam, Gyeongsangbuk, Gyeongsangnam, and Jeju).

Statistical analysis

General characteristics were compared between patients with NTM infection and the control group using an independent t -test for continuous variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. To compare the distribution of comorbidities between control and NTM groups, logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Subgroup analyses according to sex and age were also conducted. All analyses were conducted using SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided P value of < 0.05.

### Extrapulmonary infections associated with nontuberculous mycobacteria in immunocompetent persons [^31dd8538]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Cutaneous MAC disease occurs by direct inoculation (trauma, surgery, injection) and is characterized by skin lesions such as ulceration, abscess with sinus formation, or erythematous plaque with a yellow crusted base. The lesions are indolent, with little or no lymph node reaction or systemic symptoms; some MAC skin infections resemble Lupus vulgaris infections. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion; a history of exposure to a potential source of infection may be suggestive. For an accurate diagnosis, histopathology, proper acid-fast bacilli identification, and susceptibility testing are needed. A combination of excision (or surgical debridement) and chemotherapy is usually required. Therapy is continued for 6–12 months and consists of at least 3 drugs, usually clarithromycin, rifampin, and ethambutol. Additional therapy with amikacin is sometimes included for 6 weeks.

### Clinical patterns of cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infections [^57842c8d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infections result from external inoculation, spread of a deeper infection, or haematogenous spread of a disseminated infection. There are two species-specific infections (fish-tank or swimming-pool granuloma, due to Mycobacterium marinum, and Buruli ulcer, caused by M. ulcerans). Most infections, however, produce a nonspecific clinical picture.

Objectives

To define clinical patterns of cutaneous disease in nontuberculous mycobacterial infections.

Methods

Fifty-one patients with cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infections were reviewed. Clinical and histopathological features of normal hosts and immunosuppressed patients were compared. Two subgroups of immunosuppressed patients were distinguished: patients with cutaneous infection and patients with a disseminated infection and cutaneous involvement.

Results

In immunosuppressed patients the number of lesions was significantly higher. Abscesses and ulceration were also more frequently observed. Different species were found in normal hosts and immunosuppressed patients. Several clinical patterns of cutaneous infection were defined: lymphocutaneous or sporotrichoid lesions; nonlymphocutaneous lesions at the site of trauma; folliculitis and furunculosis involving the lower extremities; disseminated lesions on the extremities in immunosuppressed patients. Two patterns were observed in patients with a disseminated infection: localized cutaneous lesions and disseminated cutaneous and mucosal lesions.

Conclusions

Cutaneous manifestations of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections may be classified according to criteria such as cutaneous lesions and immune status.

Subjects and Methods

Study Population

We conducted a nested case-control study using the 100% US Medicare Parts A and B administrative claims database for January 1, 2007, through December 31, 2015. This population-based database includes beneficiaries in all 50 US states. A case of NTM-PD was defined as ≥ 2 claims with a diagnostic code for NTM-PD (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] 031.0; International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-10-CM] A31.0) that were ≥ 30 days apart. We also restricted our analysis to patients with NTM-PD who were aged ≥ 65 years at the time of first diagnosis of NTM-PD. Control subjects were defined as Medicare beneficiaries without any NTM-PD claims during the study period. Each case subject was matched to two control subjects according to age (± 0.5 years) and sex. The index date for each NTM-PD case was defined as the date of the first NTM-PD claim; the index date for each case was assigned to the matched control subjects. Both case subjects and matched control subjects were required to have at least 12 months of continuous coverage of Medicare Parts A and Bprior to the index date.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Validity of diagnosis code-based claims to identify pulmonary NTM disease in bronchiectasis patients [^8a480250]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

A limitation of our study is that we only included Medicare beneficiaries > 65 years of age with bronchiectasis; also, BRR collects data from specialized NTM centers, which might differ from general clinic settings. Our Medicare data ended in 2014, limiting the sample size and overlap with BRR observation time. Last, we only evaluated ICD-9-CM codes, although ICD Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), codes have been required since 2015. However, understanding the validity of ICD-9-CM codes is essential for interpretation of the existing literature that is based on ICD-9-CM codes and to inform future research using ICD-10-CM codes. Further, ICD-9-CM codes for NTM map directly to ICD-10-CM codes (ICD-9-CM 031.0 equates to ICD-10-CM A31.0 [pulmonary mycobacterial infection]), helping guide future comparisons.

Our results indicate that a case definition of > 2 claims given 30 days apart within 12 months of each other accurately identifies pulmonary NTM infection in patients who also have bronchiectasis. Given low sensitivity, incidence might be severely underestimated in claims-based epidemiologic research. Claims data provide critical information about the epidemiology of NTM infection when clinical data are not available, but findings should be interpreted with awareness of the potential for misclassification.

### Cutaneous tuberculosis. part II: complications, diagnostic workup, histopathologic features, and treatment [^34188d8e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of effective treatment regimens for cutaneous tuberculosis, challenges to disease control result from delayed diagnosis, infection with multidrug-resistant mycobacterial strains, and coinfection with HIV. Delayed diagnosis can be mitigated when dermatologists are sensitized to the clinical signs and symptoms of infection and by the incorporation of appropriate diagnostic tests. All cases of cutaneous tuberculosis should be confirmed with histopathology and culture with or without molecular testing. In each case, a thorough evaluation for systemic involvement is necessary. Mycobacteria may not be isolated from cutaneous tuberculosis lesions and therefore, a trial of antituberculosis treatment may be required to confirm the diagnosis. The second article in this 2-part continuing medical education series describes the sequelae, histopathology, and treatment of tuberculosis.

*Data are percentages unless otherwise indicated. CADG, collapsed aggregated diagnosis groups; NTM-PD, nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary disease; NTM-PI, nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary isolation.

Outcomes

We evaluated deaths (10-day, 30-day, 90-day, 1-year), acute hospital admissions (within 5 and 30 days of index date), and hospital lengths of stay. We calculated costs by using person-level costing methods established by ICES. This method uses administrative data to calculate long-term costs of incident cases from an index date to a defined point in time (death or the end of an observation window). In this method, costs are inflated by using the healthcare-specific Consumer Price Index reported by Statistics Canada. The publicly funded healthcare service categories included were acute inpatient hospitalizations, emergency visits, same-day surgeries and other ambulatory treatments, inpatient rehabilitation, complex continuing care, long-term care, inpatient mental health, physician services, home care, eligible prescription medications, and devices.

Results

Patient Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

An overview of the study sample construction is provided in Figure 1. From 2007 through 2015, a total of 58,791 Medicare Parts A and B beneficiaries fulfilled the NTM-PD case definition (≥ 2 claims for NTM-PD ≥ 30 days apart); among these patients, 35,444 patients were ≥ 65 years old and had ≥ 12 months of continuous enrollment in Parts A and B prior to the index date and thus comprised the NTM-PD cohort.

Figure 1
Study cohort. a Index date was defined as the date the first NTM-PD diagnostic code (ICD-9-CM 031.0 or ICD-10-CM A31.0) was received for patients with NTM-PD, and this date was assigned to the matched control subjects as their index date. ICD-9-CM = International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification; ICD-10-CM = International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification; NTM-PD = nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease.

The baseline characteristics of the NTM-PD cohort (n = 35,444) and the matched control subjects (n = 65,467) are provided in Table 1. The mean age was 76.6 years, and the majority were female (70.0%) and White (≥ 87%). The mean CCI score was higher in the NTM-PD cohort (2.3 ± 1.5) than in matched control subjects (1.2 ± 1.4). Most comorbidities were more common in the NTM-PD cohort than in the matched control subjects. Baseline differences were especially pronounced for pulmonary comorbidities, with proportions for the NTM-PD vs control groups being 81.1% vs 17.7% for COPD, 54.5% vs 6.6% for pneumonia, 44.6% vs 0.6% for bronchiectasis, 33.3% vs 4.5% for exacerbation of respiratory disease (acute or chronic), 27.3% vs 8.0% for asthma, and 19.4% vs 3.7% for empyema. The proportions of patients with these comorbidities were significantly different (two-sided χ 2 test, P < .01).

### Fromto: a rare case of dual nontuberculous mycobacterial infection [^d7543543]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous infections from nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are increasing, especially in immunosuppressed patients. We report a case of an immunosuppressed female patient who initially developed a cutaneous M. chelonae infection on her left lower extremity, which healed following macrolide treatment. However, 1 month later, a new ulcer developed at a nearby site, which was subsequently identified as M. immunogenum. Our report highlights the importance for clinicians, particularly dermatologists, to maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical mycobacterial infections in immunosuppressed individuals.

### Atypical mycobacterial cutaneous infections [^99b4b58e]. Dermatologic Clinics (2009). Low credibility.

Atypical mycobacterial infections have been a cause of steadily growing infections over the past decades, especially in immunocompromised patients. They are classified by their ability to produce pigment, growth rate, and optimal temperature. Mycobacterium marinum, M. kansasii, and M. avium-intracellulare are examples of slow-growing mycobacteria. M. fortuitum, M. chelonei, and M. abscessus are examples of rapidly growing mycobacteria. Atypical mycobacteria are ubiquitous in the environment. No specific treatment guidelines exist but a multidrug regimen combined with surgical modalities is often used for therapy.

### Cutaneousinfection presenting clinically as a mycetoma [^468d6724]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mycobacterium chelonae belongs to a group of rapidly growing mycobacteria, a subset of the ubiquitous nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) that rarely cause skin and soft–tissue infections. These infections often occur in immunosuppressed patients but may also be seen in immunocompetent hosts. Their incidence is increasing worldwide and is thought to result from a combination of more surgical and cosmetic procedures performed, the increased use of immunosuppressive medications, and an improved ability to isolate and identify these organisms. Misdiagnoses and delayed diagnoses are still common despite this increased incidence, thus making the ability to recognize unusual clinical presentations of cutaneous NTM infections increasingly important.

### Comorbidities of nontuberculous mycobacteria infection in Korean adults: results from the national health insurance service-national sample cohort (NHIS-NSC) database [^e4bca21b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Consistent with our findings, depression was associated with NTM infection in the U.S. study, but this association was not observed in the Japanese study. Anxiety, depression, and poor sleep quality are frequently observed in patients with NTM infection. Our study suggests that mental disorders such as depression may increase the risk of NTM infection.

Several limitations of the present study should be acknowledged. First, the diagnosis of NTM infection and comorbidities in this study was based on insurance claims, which rely on ICD-10 codes. The use of administrative claims data may have resulted in issues such as coding accuracy (over-coding, under-coding, or miscoding), diagnostic inertia, and lack of disease specificity. Thus, we defined the disease based on at least two claims, similar to most previous studies analyzing claims data. Second, it was impossible to classify and analyze cases of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, mental/behavioral disorders, or cancer in the NHIS–NSC 2.0 database because the detailed disease code was partially disclosed to protect personal information. In addition, human immunodeficiency virus and cystic fibrosis are known risk factors for NTM infection, but these diseases are classified as personal sensitive information in the NHIS–NSC 2.0 database and are therefore not disclosed. As such, we were unable to confirm their relevance to NTM infection. Third, the mycobacterium species could not be distinguished because of the unavailability of microbial information. Fourth, possible residual confounding factors, including dietary, personal lifestyle, clinical, or other environmental factors may affect the association between NTM infection and comorbidities. Finally, the study population was homogeneously Korean, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic populations.

Despite these limitations, our study has several strengths. First, this study used the NHIS–NSC 2.0 database of South Korea, which is representative of the entire population and contains healthcare utilization information from all settings in South Korea. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first study in Korea to examine the comorbidities associated with NTM infection according to sex and age. Region of residence and income level were also considered to be factors that would affect the relationship between NTM infection and comorbidities; hence, matching and logistic regression analysis were conducted taking this into account. Third, we investigated the ranking of comorbidities with high frequency in patients with NTM infection using preliminary analysis of claims data and added chronic sinusitis, acute sinusitis, and skin diseases to the comorbidities investigated in previous studies.

### Validity of diagnosis code-based claims to identify pulmonary NTM disease in bronchiectasis patients [^afd75c76]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection is an illness of increasing incidence caused by environmental organisms and can lead to chronic pulmonary disease. The accuracy of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes for NTM infection has been evaluated only in limited fashion and is unknown in the context of bronchiectasis, which most patients with pulmonary NTM infection have. We investigated the accuracy of ICD diagnosis codes for NTM infection among Medicare beneficiaries in the United States by using the Bronchiectasis and NTM Research Registry (BRR) as the reference standard.

We identified persons with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis (ICD Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM], codes 494.0 or 494.1) from 2006–2014 Medicare data. BRR is a database of persons with bronchiectasis, NTM infection, or both at 13 US medical institutions. BRR captures clinical data from the 24-month period before enrollment and at annual follow-ups. We matched study participants enrolled at 7 BRR sites to Medicare data. Medicare observation began on the later date of either enrollment or data-start (January 1, 2006) and ended on the earlier date of either coverage-end or data-end (December 31, 2014). We included study participants with an overlap in BRR and Medicare observation, excluding claims or cultures outside this overlap.

We established a primary case definition of an NTM infection as > 1 inpatient discharge or outpatient visit coded 031.0 (pulmonary mycobacterial infection) assigned by a clinician; we also established alternative definitions (Table). For the primary and each alternative case definition, we calculated positive predictive value (PPV) as the proportion of Medicare claim–based NTM infections meeting the BRR case definition + 12 months of the first claim. Sensitivity was calculated as the proportion of patients meeting the BRR case definition who had a claim for NTM infection within + 12 months of meeting that definition. All analyses were performed by using SAS statistical software 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Oregon Health & Science University.

### Mycobacterial infection masquerading as cutaneous sarcoidosis [^0344c5fc]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Granulomatous skin inflammation can be secondary to a number of infectious and noninfectious aetiologies. Although the presence of Mycobacterium gordonae is commonly thought to reflect environmental contamination, infection can occur even in immunocompetent hosts. Proper diagnostic evaluation of granulomatous inflammation of the skin is essential in order to optimize treatment recommendations.

### Cutaneous manifestations of tuberculosis [^91d8a580]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Cutaneous involvement is a rare manifestation of tuberculosis (TB). The correct diagnosis is often significantly delayed because cutaneous TB is not routinely considered in the differential diagnosis or because investigations fail to reveal the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The clinical features of cutaneous TB are diverse, and result from exogenous and endogenous spread of M. tuberculosis and from immune-mediated mechanisms. The recognition of cutaneous TB is important, as the diagnosis is frequently overlooked resulting in delayed treatment.

Study Variables

Comorbid conditions for NTM-PD case subjects and matched control subjects were identified based on ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes from Medicare Parts A and B claims during the baseline period (ie, the 12 months prior to the index date). In addition, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated based on baseline diseases and health conditions to characterize patients' overall disease burden. A CCI score of zero indicates that there were no comorbidities, and a higher score predicts an increased risk of mortality and use of health resources.

Hospitalizations were accrued over the follow-up period, which was defined as the interval between the index date and the end of the study period (December 31, 2015), the last day prior to enrollment in Medicare Advantage (Part C), or death, whichever was earliest. Over the follow-up period, parameters related to hospitalization were estimated, including the proportion of patients with hospitalizations, the incidence rate of hospitalizations, the risk of hospitalizations, and the time to hospitalization, comparing NTM-PD case subjects vs control subjects for all-cause, COPD-related, pneumonia-related, and other pulmonary disease-related hospitalizations. Causes associated with a hospitalization were identified from the first five diagnostic codes of the inpatient claim (up to 25 diagnostic codes per inpatient claim were available in Medicare claims). When the first five diagnostic codes included more than one cause of interest, the assignment of relevant cause for that hospitalization claim followed the order of COPD, pneumonia, and other pulmonary diseases. Time to hospitalization was measured as the interval between the index date and the date of the first hospitalization during the follow-up period.

### Mycobacterial skin infection [^14a4223f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Buruli ulcer is a cutaneous and subcutaneous often disfiguring disease caused by M. ulcerans. WHO first declared Buruli ulcer a neglected emerging tropical disease in 1998 and launched a Global Buruli Ulcer Initiative.

Differently from other NTM, this disease has gained global attention possibly due to a higher incidence within endemic areas and in infant populations, and the psychosocial impact due to functional impairment and stigma.

Among clinical diseases due to mycobacteria, SSTIs continue to be poorly investigated despite their impact on persons' quality of life and the evidence of increasing incidence in recent years.

We have performed a nonsystematic revision of the literature, limited to the period from January 2020 to August 2021, searching for epidemiological, clinical, diagnostic and treatment publications on cutaneous manifestations in tuberculosis, leprosy, Buruli ulcer and NTM infections.

The prevalence and trends of pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM)-associated hospitalizations in the United States were estimated using national hospital discharge data. Records were extracted for all persons with a pulmonary NTM International Classification of Diseases code (031.0) hospitalized in the 11 states with continuous data available from 1998 through 2005. Prevalence was calculated using US census data. Pulmonary NTM hospitalizations (031.0) increased significantly with age among both sexes: relative prevalence for persons 70–79 years of age compared with those 40–49 years of age was 15/100,000 for women (9.4 vs. 0.6) and 9/100,000 for men (7.6 vs. 0.83). Annual prevalence increased significantly among men and women in Florida (3.2%/year and 6.5%/year, respectively) and among women in New York (4.6%/year) with no significant changes in California. The prevalence of pulmonary NTM-associated hospitalizations is increasing in selected geographic areas of the United States.

Recommendation grading and interpretation — Recommendations were rated using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and the strength of a recommendation indicates the committee's certainty that the desirable consequences of the recommended course of action outweigh the undesirable consequences. A strong recommendation is one for which the subcommittee is certain, whereas a conditional recommendation is one for which the subcommittee is uncertain, and uncertainty may exist if the quality of evidence is poor, there is a fine balance between desirable and undesirable consequences, the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences depends upon the clinical context, or there is variation about how individuals value the outcomes. A strong recommendation should be interpreted as the right thing to do for the vast majority of patients; a weak recommendation should be interpreted as being the right thing to do for the majority of patients, but maybe not for a sizeable minority of patients.

### Prevalence, incidence, and risk factors for dermatologic conditions in people with HIV in the modern antiretroviral era: a cohort study in Washington, DC [^91af9430]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2027). Medium credibility.

Background

Dermatologic disease (DD) remains a significant morbidity among people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PWH), yet epidemiologic data in the modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era are limited.

Objective

To characterize the prevalence, incidence, and risk factors of DD among PWH.

Methods

This longitudinal cohort study included 11,738 adults enrolled in the DC Cohort between 2011 and 2023. DDs were identified using ICD-9/10 codes and categorized as infectious dermatoses, inflammatory dermatoses, or cutaneous malignancies (CM). Prevalence, incidence trends, and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify risk factors.

Results

Among participants, 49.4% had ≥ 1 dermatologic diagnosis, with infectious conditions most common (41.4%). Incidence declined from 2011 to 2024 across all categories: infectious (463 to 41), inflammatory (306 to 62), and malignant (31 to 6) cases per 1000 (all P < .0001). Cisgender females had over sixfold greater odds of CM. Lower nadir CD4 count, older age, public insurance, and prior opportunistic infections were associated with higher DD risk.

Limitations

Use of ICD codes may have introduced misclassification; dermatology specialty access likely varied by site.

Conclusion

DD incidence has declined over time, reflecting advances in HIV care and treatment. Despite modern ART, DD remains prevalent. Demographic, immune, structural, and behavioral factors drive risk among PWH, underscoring the need for targeted care.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection spectrum and latent tuberculosis infection definitions: Persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have a broad array of presentations, ranging from those with clinical, radiographic, and microbiological evidence of tuberculosis (TB disease) to those who are infected with Mtb but have no clinical evidence of TB disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Individuals with LTBI who have been recently exposed have an increased risk of developing TB, whereas those with remote exposure have less risk over time unless they develop a condition that impairs immunity. Operationally, recent exposure can be defined either epidemiologically (ie, as might occur in the setting of the household of an infectious case or occupational exposure) or immunologically (ie, conversion of a tuberculin skin test or interferon-γ release assay [IGRA] from negative to positive).

### Systematic review of validation studies of the use of administrative data to identify serious infections [^cbe963b5]. Arthritis Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of the literature on the validation of algorithms identifying infections in administrative data for future use in populations with rheumatic diseases.

Methods

Medline and EMBase were searched using the themes "administrative data" and "infection" between 1950 and October 2012. Inclusion criteria consisted of validation studies of administrative data identifying infections in adult populations. Article quality was assessed using a validated tool.

Results

A total of 5,941 articles were identified, 90 articles underwent detailed review, and 24 studies were included. The majority (17 of 24) examined bacterial infections and 9 examined opportunistic infections. Eighteen studies were from the US and all but 4 studies used International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Rheumatoid arthritis patients were studied in 6 of 24 articles. The studies on bacterial infections in general reported highly variable sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for the diagnosis of infections using administrative data (sensitivity range 4.4–100%, PPV range 21.7–100%). Algorithms to identify opportunistic infections similarly had a highly variable sensitivity (range 20–100%) and PPV (range 1.3–100%). Thirteen studies compared the diagnostic accuracy of different algorithms, which revealed that strategies including a comprehensive algorithm using a greater number of diagnostic codes or codes in any position had the highest sensitivity for the diagnosis of infection. Algorithms that incorporated microbiologic or pharmacy data in combination with diagnostic codes had improved PPV for identification of tuberculosis.

Conclusion

Algorithms for identifying infections using administrative data should be selected based on the purpose of the study, with careful consideration as to whether a high sensitivity or PPV is required.

### Trends in mortality due to invasive mycotic diseases in the United States, 1980–1997 [^2aba2f8f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

To determine national trends in mortality due to invasive mycoses, we analyzed National Center for Health Statistics multiple-cause-of-death record tapes for the years 1980 through 1997, with use of their specific codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9 codes 112.4–118 and 136.3). In the United States, of deaths in which an infectious disease was the underlying cause, those due to mycoses increased from the tenth most common in 1980 to the seventh most common in 1997. From 1980 through 1997, the annual number of deaths in which an invasive mycosis was listed on the death certificate (multiple-cause [MC] mortality) increased from 1557 to 6534. In addition, rates of MC mortality for the different mycoses varied markedly according to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status but were consistently higher among males, blacks, and persons ≥ 65 years of age. These data highlight the public health importance of mycotic diseases and emphasize the need for continuing surveillance.

Histological examination for tuberculosis diagnosis — At this stage in the diagnostic process, the committee thought testing was worthwhile if sensitivity and specificity were both > 50%, and histological examination surpassed these thresholds and, therefore, is recommended; the committee emphasizes interpreting results within the clinical context, and the recommendation is conditional because the very low quality of evidence does not provide sufficient confidence, and obtaining the specimens to test usually requires an invasive procedure such that the balance of benefits versus risks may vary substantially depending upon the clinical condition of the patient.

### Cutaneous infection with Mycobacterium abscessus in a child [^b6763fc3]. Pediatric Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria can cause cutaneous infections in both children and adults. Localized nontuberculous mycobacterial infections of the skin have been reported in children following injections or surgical procedures. We report a child who developed a cutaneous nontuberculous mycobacterial infection after exposure of a skin wound to pond water. Cutaneous infection with the rapidly growing mycobacteria Mycobacterium abscessus was demonstrated by clinical and histologic evaluation on the lower leg of an otherwise healthy 12-year-old Caucasian boy. We describe this as an instance of an unusual acquisition of cutaneous M. abscessus infection in a child.

Ten-day mean attributable costs for nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease patients by phase, stratified by age, Ontario, Canada, 2001–2012. Number of patients per category: initial infection, 6,906; subsequent care, 6,906; continuous care, 6,489; before death, 2,835.

Figure 2
Ten-day mean attributable costs for nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary isolation patients by phase, stratified by age, Ontario, Canada, 2001–2012. Number of patients per category: initial infection, 8,171; subsequent care, 8,171; continuous care, 7,860; before death, 2,374.

Overall, mean attributable costs were higher for male than for female NTM-PD patients in all phases except before death, when attributable costs were higher for female than male patients (Figure 3). In the before-death phase, NTM-PD female and male attributable costs were CAD $1,316 (USD $1,016), 95% CI CAD $925–$1,709 (USD $714–$1,319) for female patients and CAD $1,166 (USD $900), 95% CI CAD $826–$1,505 (USD $638–$1,162) for male patients. For NTM-PI patients during all phases, mean attributable costs were higher for male than for female patients (Figure 4). The mean attributable cumulative 1-year costs adjusted for survival were CAD $14,953 (USD $11,541) per NTM-PD patient and $CAD 8,729 (USD $6,737) per NTM-PI patient.

### Cutaneous Mycobacterium chelonae infection in Edinburgh and the lothians, south-east scotland, U.K [^03ea0320]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We reviewed all cases of Mycobacterium chelonae infection seen in our department between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2012.

Objectives

To review the epidemiology, clinical features and management of cutaneous M. chelonae in South-East Scotland, and to compare prevalence data with the rest of Scotland.

Methods

The Scottish Mycobacteria Reference Laboratory database was searched for all cases of cutaneous mycobacterial infections.

Results

One hundred and thirty-four cases of cutaneous mycobacterial infection were recorded. Sixty-three were tuberculous; of the remaining 71, M. chelonae was the most common nontuberculous organism (27 cases). National Health Service (NHS) Lothian Health Board was the area with highest incidence in the Scotland (12 cases). Three main groups of patients in the NHS Lothian Health Board contracted M. chelonae: immunosuppressed patients (n = 6); those who had undergone tattooing (n = 4); and others (n = 2). One case is, we believe, the first report of M. chelonae cutaneous infection associated with topical corticosteroid immunosuppression. The majority of patients were treated with clarithromycin monotherapy.

Conclusion

The most prevalent nontuberculous cutaneous mycobacterial organism in Scotland is M. chelonae. The prevalence of M. chelonae in Edinburgh and the Lothians compared with the rest of Scotland is disproportionately high, possibly owing to increased local awareness and established facilities for mycobacterial studies. Immunosuppression with prednisolone appears to be a major risk factor. The first outbreak of tattoo-related M. chelonae infection in the U.K. has been reported. Clinicians should be aware of mycobacterial cutaneous infection and ensure that diagnostic skin samples are cultured at the optimal temperatures.

### Associations of cutaneous and extracutaneous infections with hidradenitis suppurativa in U.S. children and adults [^7219514b]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is associated with bacterial colonization, skin-barrier disruption, immune dysregulation and treatments that can increase infection risk.

Objectives

To determine whether HS is associated with cutaneous and extracutaneous infections and related outcomes.

Methods

Data from the 2002–2012 National Inpatient Sample were analysed, including a 20% sample of U.S. hospitalizations (n = 87 053 155).

Results

The prevalence (with 95% confidence interval) of infections was higher in adults (34·0%, 33·2–34·7% vs. 23·4%, 23·2–23·6%) and children (31·8%, 28·7–34·9% vs. 12·6% (12·1–13·1%) with vs. without HS. Inpatients with HS had higher prevalences of infections overall (excluding cellulitis and erysipelas) than those with psoriasis, but lower than those with atopic dermatitis. In multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographics, HS was associated with 18 of 45 infections examined (adults: 16 of 45; children: six of 45), including acute infections (herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster, necrotizing fasciitis, septicaemia, bone infection, Clostridium difficile, methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, mycobacterial, fungal, viral), chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis B) and antibiotic-resistant infections. HS alone was associated with increased infections. Patients with comorbid cancer; HIV; cardiometabolic, autoimmune or mental health diagnoses or acne had even higher odds of infections. Inpatients with HS with vs. without serious infection had increased inpatient mortality (0·71% vs. 0·16%), mean length of stay (7·3 vs. 4·8 days) and cost of care (US$13 578 vs. $9242), with a mean annual excess 41 050 days and $71 622 339 cost of hospitalization.

Conclusions

Adults and children with HS had increased acute and chronic, cutaneous, extracutaneous and systemic infections, which were associated with increased mortality and cost. What's already known about this topic? Little is known about the risk of infection in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). What does this study add? Adults and children with HS had increased cutaneous, extracutaneous and systemic infections, at even higher rates than in patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. These infections were associated with increased inpatient mortality and cost. Respond to this article.

### Exploring the utility of multiplex infectious disease panel testing for diagnosis of infection in different body sites: a joint report of the Association for Molecular Pathology, American Society for Microbiology, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and pan American society for clinical virology [^da8fbecf]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2023). High credibility.

Cost and reimbursement for multiplex infectious disease panel testing — mechanisms and challenges for inpatient and outpatient settings are described, with NTAP context and coverage nuances. The article explains that "costs associated with inpatient care are reimbursed on the basis of diagnosis-related group codes and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)/Procedure Coding System codes (Medicare part A coverage) and outpatient care from Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (Medicare part B coverage)," and notes that the New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) program "provides some support for new tests used for inpatient care" but "the NTAP payment is time limited." For outpatient testing and inpatient testing with an NTAP code, laboratories are "reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis," and reimbursement has transitioned from "stacking miscellaneous CPT codes" to "a limited number of analyte-specific CPT codes and American Medical Association–awarded proprietary laboratory analyses codes." Local coverage determinations "provide coverage of panel testing with limited, specific use cases for respiratory tract… and gastrointestinal tract panels," yet "tests with an assigned CPT code or a proprietary laboratory analysis code are not guaranteed reimbursement," and codes, coverage determinations, and prices "are separate processes." Tools to support access include "CPT or proprietary laboratory analyses codes, cost-effectiveness models, budget impact models, clinical utility studies, and clinical practice guidelines." In the absence of direct reimbursement or NTAP for inpatient testing, revenue may derive from "cost avoidance… or hospital cost savings associated with improved patient outcomes (eg, decreased length of stay, improved quality of care, and reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use)," but demonstrating such benefits "remains a significant challenge," and "the laboratory is in competition with other departments (cost centers)… Laboratory directors need to develop a business case to justify the new test in competition for available resources."

Strength of recommendation and quality of evidence — The grading framework includes categories such as "Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence" where "Desirable effects clearly outweigh undesirable effects, or vice versa" and "Consistent evidence from well-performed RCTs or exceptionally strong evidence from unbiased observational studies," with the implication that "Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect." For "Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence," "Desirable effects closely balanced with undesirable effects" and the same high-quality evidence standard apply, with the implication that "The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patient's or societal values. Further research is unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect." Lower-quality tiers are also detailed, including "Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence," where "Recommendation may change when higher-quality evidence becomes available," and "Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence," where "Other alternatives may be equally reasonable" and "Any estimate of effect, for at least 1 critical outcome, is very uncertain."

### Clinical manifestations, antifungal drug susceptibility, and treatment outcomes for emerging zoonotic cutaneous sporotrichosis, Thailand [^defc912f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

We included 49 patients who had cutaneous sporotrichosis during 2018–2022 and summarized their clinical characteristics (Table 1). We observed a marked increase in cases each year during this period, escalating from 1 case to 3 cases, then to 6 cases, 14 cases, and finally 25 cases (Figure 1). The mean age of patients was 58.7 (SD 16.9) years; 32 (65.3%) were female and 17 (34.7%) male. Only 9 patients were immunocompromised, having diabetes mellitus or sigmoid colon cancer with recent chemotherapy. The median duration from lesion onset to diagnosis was 30 (range 7–180) days. Before sporotrichosis diagnosis, 15 (30.6%) patients had undergone treatment regimens for nontuberculous mycobacterial infections but had no observed improvement.

### Coccidioidomycosis skin testing in a commercially insured population, United States, 2014–2017 [^45dfcb82]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Among ≈57 million MarketScan enrollees, 505 had a coccidioidomycosis skin test; 407 of those were continuously enrolled. Of those 407, most (n = 391, 89%) were 18–64 years of age, female (n = 243, 60%), and in California (n = 367, 90%) (Table). Thirty-five percent had a code for a subsequent visit within 3 days, compared with 24% of 1,061,118 patients who had a tuberculosis skin test. Test results were not available.

Table
Characteristics of patients who received a coccidioidomycosis skin test, 2014–2017, USA

*Values are no. (%) except as indicated. CPT, Current Procedural Terminology; ICD-9-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification; ICD-10-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification.

In the 3 months before the skin test, 5% had a coccidioidomycosis diagnosis code, 5% had a coccidioidomycosis serologic test code, and 5% had a fluconazole prescription. On the skin test date and in the 3 months after, 7% had a coccidioidomycosis diagnosis code, 15% had a serologic test, and 9% had a fluconazole prescription. Forty-four patients (11%) had noncapitated health plans; among those, the mean cost of skin test claims was $43.66 (range $0–$264). Mean costs were $31.57 (range $0–$184) to insurers and $12.09 (range $0–$264) to patients.

In the context of the large at-risk population in Coccidioides -endemic areas, coccidioidomycosis skin testing appears to be uncommon in this privately insured population. Real-world data on the test's use and performance in the general population are lacking, although it performs well for risk-stratifying prison inmates. Reasons for its low use could be its limited approved clinical indication to detect delayed-type hypersensitivity to Coccidioides in persons with a known history of disease or that the clinical implications of such testing may be unclear. Cost may also play a role, although it is unclear why most patients had capitated health plans. Reasons why most tests were performed in California rather than in Arizona (states where most coccidioidomycosis cases occur) are unknown.

Grading of recommendations (strong vs conditional) — implications are specified for patients, clinicians, and policy. For a strong recommendation, most individuals would want the recommended course of action, most individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. For a conditional recommendation, the majority would want the suggested course of action but many would not; for clinicians, recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and decision aids may be useful; and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

Mycobacterium marinum infection — environmental source, inoculation mechanism, typical sites, and symptom profile are described: Mycobacterium marinum is a free-living environmental bacterium found worldwide in warm, preferably brackish, water. The usual onset of infection is when the bacteria enter the skin after a minor abrasion or shallow puncture injury occurs in or around open water. Typical locations for M. marinum infection include knees, shins, and the dorsal surfaces of hands and feet, where water-associated minor trauma occurs most commonly; is rarely painful, warm, or purulent. Patients describe a variety of healing patterns after minor water-associated injury — areas that were injured but not infected heal quickly.
