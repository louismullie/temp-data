## Question

What's the moa behind alcohol ablation for HOCM

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an explanation of the mechanism of action of alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, with explicit reasoning steps and self-verification language preserved and enhanced. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the underlying pathophysiology of obstructive HCM that ASA aims to modify. Then, I should verify the procedural steps and how imaging guides targeting. Next, I will examine the immediate vascular and myocardial effects of ethanol, followed by the mechanical consequences in the left ventricular outflow tract. After that, I should review structural remodeling and secondary hemodynamic effects. I will then assess functional and clinical outcomes, consider technical refinements that modify the mechanism's safety and efficacy, and finally synthesize a concise mechanism statement that aligns with guidelines and evidence [^116HQTSF] [^111UKqcN].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic target: obstructive HCM is driven by basal septal hypertrophy with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve creating a dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and often secondary mitral regurgitation, producing symptoms and remodeling that ASA seeks to alleviate [^116HQTSF] [^117DFUd3].

> Wait, let me verify the procedural approach before attributing mechanism to ethanol effects alone. ASA entails selective cannulation of a septal perforator branch feeding the hypertrophied basal septum, typically using a balloon catheter to occlude the vessel and myocardial contrast echocardiography to confirm that the opacified territory corresponds to the LV side of the basal septum where obstruction occurs, which is critical for targeting the correct substrate [^116vEYqM] [^11123TXw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "ethanol-induced apoptosis"; I initially thought of apoptosis, but I should correct that. Ethanol at 96–99% is directly cytotoxic and induces immediate coagulative necrosis of vascular endothelium and myocytes with vascular necrosis and intraluminal debris, which distinguishes this injury from platelet-fibrin thrombotic infarction and is a key mechanistic driver of ablation success [^116Xk91H].

> I need to check the immediate mechanical consequences next. Infarction of the targeted basal septum acutely impairs contractility and septal excursion during systole, which directly reduces the propulsive force contributing to SAM–septal contact and thereby lowers the LVOT gradient; early akinesia and hypokinesis are expected in the infarcted segment [^111UKqcN] [^113nkeHB].

> Let me consider the time course of remodeling, because this shapes the durability of benefit. Over weeks to months, the infarcted septal tissue thins and scars, leading to a permanent reduction in basal septal thickness and further widening of the LVOT; cardiac MRI shows early and progressive septal mass reduction that correlates with the degree of infarction and gradient decline, confirming the structural component of the mechanism [^114XgZXt] [^117AYRPK].

> I should confirm secondary hemodynamic effects beyond the gradient itself. Relief of LVOTO reduces afterload and systolic pressure overload, which improves diastolic function indices and lowers left atrial pressure and volume, with concomitant reduction in mitral regurgitation severity when SAM is the mechanism; exercise studies demonstrate sustained reductions in filling pressures and gradients at follow-up [^115quFMN] [^117TyMDp].

> Next, I should review the functional and clinical correlates to ensure the mechanism translates into patient-centered outcomes. Multiple contemporary series show marked reductions in resting and provocable LVOT gradients, improvements in NYHA class, exercise capacity, and quality of life, with long-term survival comparable to age- and sex-matched populations when performed at experienced centers, aligning the mechanical mechanism with clinical benefit [^114R2PHX] [^111EZgXk].

> But wait, what about refinements that modulate mechanism-related risks and efficacy? Let me reconsider how imaging and dosing strategy matter. Myocardial contrast echocardiography improves targeting accuracy and has enabled lower ethanol volumes (often 1–2 mL), which reduce infarct size and conduction system injury without sacrificing gradient reduction, thereby minimizing complete heart block and pacemaker needs while preserving efficacy [^113f3R5b] [^116vEYqM].

> Hold on, I should verify how to synthesize this into a precise mechanism statement. The mechanism of action of alcohol septal ablation is the induction of a controlled, highly targeted basal septal infarction via superselective intracoronary ethanol delivery, producing immediate loss of septal contractility and subsequent thinning and scarring of the basal septum; these changes widen the LVOT, abolish or reduce SAM-related obstruction and mitral regurgitation, lower afterload, and improve diastolic function, culminating in durable symptom relief and hemodynamic normalization when performed at experienced centers [^111UKqcN] [^114XgZXt] [^115quFMN].

---

Alcohol ablation for HOCM works by **selective ethanol infusion** into a septal perforator artery [^111UKqcN] to induce a controlled infarction of the basal septum, causing thinning and akinesis that reduce LVOT obstruction and SAM [^111UKqcN]. This lowers resting/provocable gradients [^114R2PHX], improves symptoms [^111EZgXk], and promotes favorable remodeling, but carries risks of conduction block [^115cFgQZ] and arrhythmias, especially with larger infarcts or multiple branches [^112CaPgc] [^112TdYgZ].

---

## Procedural steps and key technical considerations

- **Patient selection**: Severe symptoms (NYHA III/IV) [^114askq5] despite optimal medical therapy, with resting/provocable LVOT gradient ≥ 50 mmHg [^1132jsWM].
- **Coronary angiography**: Identify the septal perforator supplying the basal septum [^111CZx8J].
- **Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE)**: Confirm target perfusion and avoid non-target injury [^116vEYqM].
- **Balloon occlusion and ethanol injection**: Deliver 1–3 mL absolute alcohol to induce controlled infarction [^112MzEDL].
- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Assess acute gradient reduction and complications [^113nkeHB].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Immediate effects

Immediate effects include **ethanol-induced myocyte necrosis** — coagulative necrosis of myocytes and vessels [^116Xk91H] — and **loss of contractility**, with akinesis of the basal septum reducing SAM and LVOT obstruction [^1153mgqm].

---

### Delayed effects

Delayed effects include **septal thinning and remodeling**, with replacement fibrosis causing permanent thinning and akinesis [^111UKqcN] [^116Xk91H], and **reduction of LVOT gradient**, typically to < 30 mmHg at rest [^114R2PHX] [^1161bbAm].

---

## Hemodynamic consequences

Hemodynamic consequences include **reduced LVOT gradient** [^115quFMN] — both resting and provocable — and **improved diastolic function**, with lower LV filling pressures and better relaxation [^117AYRPK].

---

## Clinical outcomes

Clinical outcomes include **symptom improvement** — reduced dyspnea, angina, and syncope — and **long-term survival** that is comparable to surgical myectomy and the general population [^111pCQun] [^111EZgXk].

---

## Potential complications and limitations

- **Conduction block**: Permanent pacemaker in 7–20% [^111pCQun] [^114R2PHX].
- **Arrhythmias**: Ventricular arrhythmias from scar, including SCD (rare) [^113hQcHi] [^116oHoWP].
- **Incomplete obstruction relief**: May require repeat ASA or myectomy [^114R2PHX] [^1147K6as].
- **Limited applicability**: Unsuitable anatomy in ~10–15% [^111jt7nY].

## Comparison with surgical myectomy

| **Parameter** | **Alcohol ablation** | **Surgical myectomy** |
|-|-|-|
| Invasiveness | Minimally invasive | Open-heart surgery |
| Recovery | Short | Longer |
| Pacemaker risk | 7–20% | 1–5% |
| Gradient reduction | Moderate-high | High |
| Repeat intervention | 10–15% | 1–2% |
| Long-term outcomes | Comparable survival | Comparable survival |

Alcohol ablation achieves **symptom relief and favorable remodeling** via a targeted septal infarction, with outcomes comparable to surgery when performed in experienced centers [^114f4h5i] [^114R2PHX].

Introduction

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex and heterogeneous disease with different anatomical variants, physiologic manifestations, and genetic underpinnings. Even asymptomatic patients with HCM are at potential risk for sudden cardiac death and require risk stratification and consideration of an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator for primary or secondary prophylaxis. However, the progression to symptomatic heart failure depends most often on upper septal hypertrophy with systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral valve leaflet causing left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, elevated gradients, mitral regurgitation, and often atrial fibrillation. Symptoms in patients with LVOT obstruction usually manifest as exertional dyspnea or chest pain, and β‐blockers or calcium channel blockers are the mainstay of medical therapy to reduce LV contractile forces and associated LVOT gradients. When symptoms are refractory to medical management, surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is considered, and both have been shown to be effective in carefully selected patients. 1 Nonrandomized studies have determined that patients after surgical myectomy or ASA have an expected long‐term survival that is comparable to that of the general population, and superior to similar patients who do not undergo surgery. 2, 3 Historically though, these procedures have been reserved for patients with severe symptoms and LVOT gradients ≥ 50 mm Hg, with the primary objective of symptom improvement, as reflected in major society guidelines. 4, 5

In conclusion, we agree with the authors that carefully selected patients with HCM who have significant obstructive pathology and symptoms that are refractory to medical therapy appear to benefit from alcohol septal ablation, and that such therapy is both safe and effective in reducing gradients and progression of symptoms. Importantly, this benefit seems to extend to the cohort of patients with seemingly more mild (NYHA Class II) symptoms, and as a result, we advocate for comprehensive evaluation of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy using both subjective and objective measurements to determine the extent of symptoms and impact on quality of life, before making decisions about septal reduction therapies. Further study is needed to determine which of these tools are most effective in determining who might benefit from septal reduction therapies.

### Pathological effects of alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^116Xk91H]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The pathological effects and the mechanisms of action of intracoronary administration of ethanol for alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for the management of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) are unknown.

Methods

We examined surgical specimens and, in one case, autopsy specimens from four patients who underwent surgical septal myectomy 2 days to 14 months after unsuccessful ASA.

Results

Pathological examination early after ASA showed coagulative necrosis of both the myocardium and the septal perforator arteries. Affected arteries were distended and occluded by necrotic intraluminal debris, without platelet-fibrin thrombi. Late after unsuccessful ASA, excised septal tissue was heterogeneous, containing a region of dense scar, and adjacent tissue containing viable myocytes and interspersed scar.

Conclusions

Intracoronary administration of ethanol in patients with HOCM causes acute myocardial infarction with vascular necrosis. The coagulative necrosis of the arteries, their distension by necrotic debris and the absence of platelet-fibrin thrombi distinguish ethanol-induced infarction from that caused by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The direct vascular toxicity of ethanol may be an important aspect of the mechanism of successful ASA.

### Alcohol septal ablation for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a word of balance [^115ZevZp]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of drug-refractory symptoms of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has long been debated and is primarily centered on the choice between surgical myectomy and alcohol septal ablation. Decision making in these patients requires consideration of procedural risk, expertise and efficacy, and the long-term impact on patients' survival. Although there have been numerous reports on these procedures that may help guide decision making, these data continue to be self-reported and voluntary. Greater insight into the real-world experience for these therapies and how they should be applied in practice would be gained from mandatory reporting, akin to other multidisciplinary, transcatheter-based therapies.

### New treatment strategies for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: alcohol ablation of the septum: the new gold standard? [^113JdZDV]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal pattern of inheritance characterized by inappropriate myocardial hypertrophy. Annual mortality has been reported to be 1% to 2% and sudden death represents the most common cause. Treatment strategies are 1) medical therapy in patients with mild to moderate symptoms, 2) reduction of septal hypertrophy by surgical myectomy or alcohol ablation, and 3) implantation of an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator in the presence of non-sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. A debate has been started on whether surgical myectomy or alcohol ablation of the septum is the appropriate treatment for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Surgical (transaortic) myectomy has been the gold standard in the past 20 to 30 years for treatment of symptomatic patients with significant hemodynamic outflow tract obstruction. However, modern interventional technologies allow reduction of the myocardial septum by injection of alcohol into the first or second septal branch under guidance of two-dimensional (2D)-contrast echocardiography. This percutaneous technique not only has a lower morbidity than surgical myectomy but can be guided precisely by 2D echocardiography. One potential complication is transient (< 30%) or permanent (< 10%) atrioventricular block III; however, this complication is relatively rare. A randomized trial comparing the two treatment modalities is lacking, and the chance is small that such a trial will be performed because alcohol ablation can be done with high success and low complication rates, leaving only complex interventions (with valvular reconstructions and so on) for surgical myectomy.

### Treatment strategies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: alcohol septal ablation and procedural step-by-step technique [^111UKqcN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is a well-established procedure for septal reduction therapy in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, significant at rest or provocable outflow tract gradients, and medically refractory symptoms. This percutaneous approach to relief of obstruction and eventual cardiac remodeling involves the infusion of a small quantity of ethanol into an appropriately targeted septal artery that is feeding the basal septum to create an iatrogenic and controlled focal infarction. Early akinesia is followed by subsequent thinning and remodeling, which widens the outflow tract, reducing or eliminating the obstruction. Historically, the use of ASA was reserved primarily for high-risk surgical candidates; however, more contemporary data suggest similar outcomes in the short-term and long-term safety of the procedure and overall effectiveness in relieving obstructive symptoms when it is performed in broader populations at experienced centers. Therefore, the current guidelines published in 2020 support ASA as a class 1 indication, similar to its open-heart surgical counterpart, surgical myectomy, when no concomitant significant coronary or valve surgical indication exists. This article summarizes contemporary management of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who were selected for ASA and details procedural methods and outcomes.

Study Limitations

Several limitations to this study should be noted. First, it was a relatively small, single‐center observational study, and the generalizability of the findings should be approached with caution. Although ASA significantly affected the primary end point, the smallsample size lacked sufficient power to detect changes in NT‐proBNP and peak VO₂. The nonsignificant results may reflect a type II error, suggesting that a larger study could potentially demonstrate a significant effect of ASA treatment. Second, the lack of a sham‐controlled arm limits our ability to accurately assess the true impact of treatment on symptoms and QoL, as placebo effects are commonly observed in placebo‐treated groups. Third, ASA theoretically solves a mechanistic problem with outflow obstruction, and hence remodeling is seen after 7 months. Whether the treatment influences the natural progression of the myocardial disease over time remain unknown, leaving conclusions about its effects on death and prognosis speculative, yet previous studies have documented favorable long‐term outcomes associated with this treatment. Finally, the robust but complex examination setup, which allows for simultaneous assessment of right‐heart catheterization, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and echocardiographic measures, may affect patients' ability to reach a level of peak exercise comparable with out‐of‐hospital physical activity.

### Controversies in cardiovascular medicine. hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: alcohol septal ablation [^115cFgQZ]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) was introduced in 1994 as an alternative to septal myectomy for patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and symptoms refractory to medical therapy. This procedure alleviates symptoms by producing a targeted, limited infarction of the upper interventricular septum, resulting in an increase in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter, a decrease in LVOT gradient, and regression of the component of LV hypertrophy that is due to pressure overload. Clinical success, with improvement in symptoms and reduction in gradient, is achieved in the great majority of patients with either resting or provocable LVOT obstruction. The principal morbidity of the procedure is complete heart block, resulting in some patients in the requirement for a permanent pacemaker. The introduction of myocardial contrast echocardiography as a component of the ASA procedure has contributed to the induction of smaller myocardial infarctions with lower dosages of alcohol and, in turn, fewer complications. Non-randomized comparisons of septal ablation and septal myectomy have shown similar mortality rates and post-procedure New York Heart Association class for the two procedures.

### Effects of alcohol septal ablation on exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and quality of life in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^115quFMN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of alcohol septal ablation (ASA) on exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is poorly described according to contemporary standards. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of ASA on filling pressures at rest and during exercise, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Methods

This prospective study enrolled 24 patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy referred for ASA. Right‐heart catheterization and echocardiography were performed at rest and during exercise, before and ≈7 months after ASA. The primary outcome was the difference in pulmonary artery wedge pressure at 75 W. Secondary outcomes assessed left ventricular outflow tract gradients, New York Heart Association functional class, and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score.

Results

ASA significantly reduced pulmonary artery wedge pressure at 75 W (33 ± 9 mm Hg versus 24 ± 10 mm Hg; P < 0.001), decreased left ventricular outflow tract gradients at rest (49 [interquartile range (IQR), 24–90] mm Hg versus 17 [IQR, 14–27] mm Hg; P < 0.01), at peak exercise (45 [IQR, 29–90] mm Hg versus 32 [IQR, 21–61] mm Hg; P = 0.02), and after exercise (96 [IQR, 34–161] mm Hg versus 28 [IQR, 21–62] mm Hg; P < 0.01). The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score was significantly increased (65.4 ± 16 versus 76.7 ± 16; P < 0.01). ASA improved New York Heart Association functional class, with 54% in class III before treatment, compared with 13% after treatment (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

ASA significantly reduced exercise‐induced filling pressures and LVOT obstruction, leading to improved symptoms and quality of life in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Regarding surgical interventions for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, more specifically with respect to septal reduction therapy (alcohol septal ablation), ACC/AHA/AMSSM/HRS/PACES/SCMR 2024 guidelines recommend to perform alcohol septal ablation at experienced HCM centers in eligible adult patients with obstructive HCM remaining severely symptomatic despite guideline-directed medical therapy and if surgery is contraindicated or the risk is considered unacceptable because of serious comorbidities or advanced age.

### Mavacamten: a first-in-class myosin inhibitor for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^113xDUH5]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

First-line treatment of obstructive HCM (oHCM) includes oral beta-blockersand/or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Both drug classes slow heart rate, and their modest negative inotropic actions may provide some reduction of intra-cardiac obstruction. Disopyramide, an antiarrhythmic, may be added because of its additional negative inotropic action, but its anticholinergic side effects are frequent limitations. While these three drug classes have been the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for decades, their use is largely supported by observational studies. None address the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease.

Septal reduction therapy (SRT), either septal myectomyor alcohol septal ablation, is recommended for patients with symptomatic oHCM, who are refractory to medical treatment. Septal reduction therapy substantially improves symptoms and quality of life, but may not be appropriate for patients with serious comorbidities or frailty and others who may prefer not to undergo an invasive procedure. To be effective and safe, these procedures require substantial operator experience, which is limited to a few centres of excellence and is not accessible to the majority of patients worldwide. Therefore, medical management of oHCM remains a major unmet need.

### Surgical approaches to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^1157bmTv]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction secondary to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy remains a challenging entity facing clinicians. Despite the success of invasive therapies, some clinicians remain hesitant because of early results with unacceptable morbidity and mortality rates. However, current literature strongly suggests improved short- and long-term outcomes with extended septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation compared with patients not undergoing such interventions. This review evaluates hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy treatment with a focus on short- and long-term outcomes, perioperative complications, and major tenets of surgical intervention. The data reveal mortality rates approaching zero, and perioperative complications occur infrequently. Alcohol septal ablation and extended septal myectomy both consistently decrease left ventricular outlet tract pressure gradients and result in improved functional capacity with lower New York Heart Association class and should be recommended as treatment for patients with symptoms refractory to standard medical treatment.

Conclusions

Carefully selected, mildly symptomatic HOCM patients with severe LVOTO treated with ASA in dedicated centers have long‐term prognosis comparable to that of the age‐ and sex‐matched general population. These patients are at minimal risk for developing severe heart failure and most of them achieve long‐term functional class NYHA I and LVOT gradient ≤ 30 mm Hg.

### Inferior infarction following alcohol septal ablation: a consequence of "collateral damage"? [^11369Yox]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2007). Low credibility.

Alcohol septal ablation is fast becoming the most common method to reduce left ventricular outflow tract gradient in patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) is routinely used as an adjunct to avoid the spread of alcohol to non-target areas of myocardium. We report two cases where despite the careful use of MCE, remote inferior wall myocardial infarctions occurred. The likely mechanism and possible preventive measures are discussed.

Clinical Perspective

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) is a complex disease characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and mitral valve abnormalities, causing LV outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) and, hence, myocardial dysfunction. The majority of patients with oHCM are disabled by symptoms of heart failure, with dyspnea and fatigue limiting their functional capacity. The first line of treatment to relieve symptoms is medical with nonvasodilating β‐adrenergic receptor blocking agents. Nevertheless, a significant number of patients continue to experience severe symptoms, requiring more advanced treatment options such as septal reduction therapy (SRT) or novel medical treatment with myosin inhibitors. Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) was introduced in the mid‐1990s as a minimally invasive SRT for patients with oHCM in whom symptoms were not relieved by medical treatment. The catheter‐based injection of alcohol into a septal perforator artery aims to induce a localized infarction of the proximal hypertrophied septum, reducing septal wall thickness and consequently abolishing outflow obstruction. The technique has proven effective in reducing LVOTO and symptoms in most patients with oHCM. Early studies demonstrated that, with extensive ablation, a complete elimination of LVOTO was associated with favorable hemodynamic changes and an improvement in exercise capacity. However, the extensive ablation also came with a greater risk of pacemaker implantation and increased mortality rate. Over the past 2 decades, the technique has been further refined, and today a more restricted ASA strategy is practiced, and the injection of large volumes of alcohol into multiple septal branches is generally not recommended. In light of new emerging treatment options with myosin inhibitors for patients with oHCM, we performed a comprehensive study to assess the clinical and hemodynamic effects of contemporary ASA at an experienced tertiary referral center. We analyzed the impact of ASA treatment on outflow obstruction, exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and quality of life (QoL).

### Alcohol septal ablation for the treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. A multicenter north American registry [^114qYQZs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of the study is to identify the predictors of clinical outcome (mortality and survival without repeat septal reduction procedures) of alcohol septal ablation for the treatment of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

Background

Alcohol septal ablation is used for treatment of medically refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy patients with severe outflow tract obstruction. The existing literature is limited to single-center results, and predictors of clinical outcome after ablation have not been determined. Registry results can add important data.

Methods

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy patients (N = 874) who underwent alcohol septal ablation were enrolled. The majority (64%) had severe obstruction at rest, and the remaining had provocable obstruction. Before ablation, patients had severe dyspnea (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class III or IV: 78%) and/or severe angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class III or IV: 43%).

Results

Significant improvement (p < 0.01) occurred after ablation (~5% in NYHA functional classes III and IV, and 8 patients in Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class III). There were 81 deaths, and survival estimates at 1, 5, and 9 years were 97%, 86%, and 74%, respectively. Left anterior descending artery dissections occurred in 8 patients and arrhythmias in 133 patients. A lower ejection fraction at baseline, a smaller number of septal arteries injected with ethanol, a larger number of ablation procedures per patient, a higher septal thickness post-ablation, and the use beta-blockers post-ablation predicted mortality.

Conclusions

Variables that predict mortality after ablation, include baseline ejection fraction and NYHA functional class, the number of septal arteries injected with ethanol, post-ablation septal thickness, beta-blocker use, and the number of ablation procedures.

### Effects of alcohol septal ablation on exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and quality of life in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^111pLjwH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In patients with oHCM, ASA effectively reduced LV filling pressures both at rest and during exercise. This effect was attributed to the alleviation of LVOTO and mitral valve regurgitation, which subsequently led to a decrease in left atrial size. These favorable structural and hemodynamic changes were associated with improvements in symptoms and QoL.

### Management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^116HQTSF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a relatively common, globally distributed, and often inherited primary cardiac disease, has now transformed into a contemporary highly treatable condition with effective options that alter natural history along specific personalized adverse pathways at all ages. HCM patients with disease-related complications benefit from: matured risk stratification in which major markers reliably select patients for prophylactic defibrillators and prevention of arrhythmic sudden death; low risk to high benefit surgical myectomy (with percutaneous alcohol ablation a selective alternative) that reverses progressive heart failure caused by outflow obstruction; anticoagulation prophylaxis that prevents atrial fibrillation-related embolic stroke and ablation techniques that decrease the frequency of paroxysmal episodes; and occasionally, heart transplant for end-stage nonobstructive patients. Those innovations have substantially improved outcomes by significantly reducing morbidity and HCM-related mortality to 0.5%/y. Palliative pharmacological strategies with currently available negative inotropic drugs can control symptoms over the short-term in some patients, but generally do not alter long-term clinical course. Notably, a substantial proportion of HCM patients (largely those identified without outflow obstruction) experience a stable/benign course without major interventions. The expert panel has critically appraised all available data and presented management insights and recommendations with concise principles for clinical decision-making.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a comparison with medical therapy [^1118CBnW]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is an inherited myocardial disease caused by genetic mutations that has the important pathophysiological characteristics of marked myocardial hypertrophy (> 15 mm) and dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Clinical manifestations include exertional dyspnea, chest pain, syncope and even sudden cardiac death (SCD), which seriously affect the life quality of patients. Several previous studies indicated that alcohol septal ablation (ASA) was one of the effective therapies for the relief of LVOT obstruction. Current guidelines recommended ASA for highly symptomatic patients (NYHA class ≥ III) with HOCM. However, several data have demonstrated that markedly increased LVOT gradient has an adverse influence on the prognosis of HOCM patients irrespective of severity of clinical symptoms. In mildly symptomatic (NYHA class II) or asymptomatic patients with HOCM, this observed survival was slightly lower than expected survival of an age‐ and sex‐matched U.S. general population, and remarkably increased LVOT gradient was associated with a high risk of developing heart failure and death. Medical therapy is recommended as first‐line treatment to improve symptoms in mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM, while invasive therapy is also considered in some centers. Nevertheless, there was no definite evidence of the outcome of ASA in mildly symptomatic patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was mainly to evaluate the efficacy of ASA compared with medical therapy in mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM, so as to provide an evidence for clinical practice.

### Alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: lower alcohol dose reduces size of infarction and has comparable hemodynamic and clinical outcome [^113f3R5b]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with highly symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) are considered to be good candidates for percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA). However, there is ongoing discussion regarding the optimal dose of alcohol injected into target septal artery and the impact of infarct sizes on the clinical and hemodynamic outcome. Thirty-four patients with symptomatic HOCM receiving maximum medical therapy were consecutively enrolled. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of the two arms according to dose of injected alcohol during echocardiography-guided PTSMA procedure. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic evaluation were performed 6 months after the procedure in all the patients. Both groups of patients matched in all clinical and echocardiographic data. The dose of alcohol injected was 1.6 ± 0.4 and 3.4 ± 0.9 (P < 0.001) with subsequent peak of CK-MB 1.9 and 3.2 microkat/L (P < 0.05) in group A and B, respectively. There was a correlation between amount of injected alcohol and the peak of CK-MB (r = 0.58; P < 0.01), whereas no significant relationship (r = 0.16; P = NS) was documented between the peak of CK-MB and left ventricular outflow gradient at follow-up. At 6-month follow-up, both groups of patients were not significantly different with regard to symptoms or electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. In conclusion, this study suggests that the low dose (1–2 ml) of alcohol injected into target septal branch reduces size of necrosis. Moreover, the low dose is probably as safe and efficacious as usually used doses (2–4 ml).

This prospective, randomized study evaluates the association between ethanol dose and postprocedural hemodynamic changes in 42 patients treated by alcohol septal ablation for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These results suggest that the early course of hemodynamic changes is not related to the use of a small (1 to 2 ml) or standard (> 2 ml) dose of ethanol.

### Sudden cardiac death complicating alcohol septal ablation: a case report and review of literature [^116oHoWP]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Over the years, alcohol septal ablation has become an effective and well-accepted modality in the treatment of patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy refractory to standard medical therapy. Malignant tachyarrythmias infrequently complicates the procedure and are usually self-terminating. We describe a case of alcohol septal ablation complicated by sudden cardiac death occurring immediately following the procedure requiring prolonged resuscitative efforts with eventual complete recovery. We also discuss the pathophysiologic significance of this event in the setting of this cardiomyopathy and its relevance as a complication of the procedure.

### Radiofrequency septal reduction in symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^116FBF7d]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol septal ablation remains the only approved nonsurgical therapeutic alternative for patients with drug-resistant hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Radiofrequency (RF) ablation offers another option for treating HOCM.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether irrigated RF ablation can reduce symptomatic outflow tract obstruction in adults with HOCM.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic HOCM and an outflow gradient of > 50 mm Hg despite medication were offered RF ablation. In 11 patients, the hypertrophied interventricular septum was localized on a 3-dimensional mapping system and ablated via a transmitral or retrograde aortic approach.

Results

Ten of 11(91%) patients had a significant and persistent reduction in resting and provocable left ventricular outflow tract gradients. Mean resting gradients at 12 months postprocedure were reduced by 85% (66.7 mm Hg at baseline to 10.0 mm Hg at 12 months); mean provocable gradients were reduced by 85% from baseline (136.2 mm Hg at baseline to 20.0 mm Hg at 12 months). Functional New York Heart Association heart classification improved from class 3.0 ± 0.0 in all patients to class mean of 1.8 ± 0.8.

Conclusion

RF septal ablation for the treatment of HOCM is a safe therapeutic option that allows for significant reduction in left ventricular outflow tract gradients, improvement in symptoms, and increase in efficacy rates comparable to reported rates for alcohol septal ablation.

### Future role of new negative inotropic agents in the era of established surgical myectomy for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1122BjQy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

This commentary reviews management strategies for obstructive HCM and heart failure that have been effective over the last 2 decades in reducing HCM morbidity and mortality, including septal reduction with surgical myectomy or alcohol ablation (Figure – Panel C). In addition, we are approaching an era for reinvigorated pharmacotherapy in HCM with novel myosin‐inhibitors/negative inotrope drugs. A measured perspective is justified until more extensive data and experience can be scrutinized over longer periods of time to avoid unrealistic expectations and resolve remaining fundamental questions about the role, efficacy, and safety of these new drugs for obstructive HCM.

While additions to the HCM treatment armamentarium are enthusiastically welcomed (if affordable), there is the concern that initial over‐exuberance for myosin‐inhibitors could potentially lead to unintended consequences in which there is under‐utilization of septal reduction therapies for symptomatic outflow obstruction.

### A prospective follow-up of alcohol septal ablation for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy – the baylor experience (1996–2002) [^112RV6SQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

There is a paucity of data on the long-term outcome of alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

Hypothesis

The study was undertaken to evaluate the longer-term outcome of ASA therapy for symptomatic HOCM.

Methods

In all, 137 patients were enrolled consecutively (1996–1999) and 130 (95%) (74 men, 56 women, aged 51 ± 17 years) underwent ASA and had serial prospective follow-up for up to 5 years (mean follow-up 3.6 ± 1.4 years). Evaluation included angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society [CCS] score), dyspnea (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class), duration of exercise on treadmill, and echocardiographic indices.

Results

Ethanol (3.5 ± 1.5 cc), injected into 1.5 ± 0.6 arteries, induced a mean peak plasma creatine kinase (CK) of 1676 ± 944 units. Complications of procedures included death 1.5% (2/130), heart block requiring permanent pacemaker 13% (17/130), and coronary dissection 4.4% (6/130). Baseline versus last follow-up visit: NYHA class decreased from 3.0 ± 0.4 to 1.2 ± 0.6 (p < 0.01); CCS angina score from 2.0 ± 0.8 to 0.08 ± 0.4 (p < 0.01); and duration of exercise increased from 322 ± 207 to 443 ± 200 s (p < 0.01). Resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient at baseline versus last follow-up visit showed a decrease from 74 ± 30 to 4 ± 13 (p < 0.01), and the dobutamine-provoked gradient of 88 ± 29 decreased to 21 ± 21 (p < 0.01) mmHg. All-cause mortality over the duration of follow-up was 7.7% (10) giving an annual rate of 2.1%, and cardiac mortality was 2.3% (3) reflecting an annual rate of 0.6%.

Conclusions

Alcohol septal ablation decreased symptoms and improved exercise performance, indicating that it is an effective procedure for symptomatic HOCM.

### Long-term outcome of alcohol septal ablation in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a word of caution [^115hcPms]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of alcohol septal ablation (ASA)-induced scar is not known. This study sought to examine the long-term outcome of ASA among patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Methods and Results

Ninety-one consecutive patients (aged 54 ± 15 years) with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy underwent ASA. Primary study end point was a composite of cardiac death and aborted sudden cardiac death including appropriate cardioverter-defibrillator discharges for fast ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation. Secondary end points were noncardiac death and other nonfatal complications. Outcomes of ASA patients were compared with 40 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent septal myectomy. During 5.4 ± 2.5 years, primary and/or secondary end points were seen in 35 (38%) ASA patients of whom 19 (21%) patients met the primary end point. The 1-, 5-, and 8-year survival-free from the primary end point was 96%, 86%, and 67%, respectively in ASA patients versus 100%, 96%, and 96%, respectively in myectomy patients during 6.6 ± 2.7 years (log-rank, P = 0.01). ASA patients had a approximately 5-fold increase in the estimated annual primary end point rate (4.4% versus 0.9%) compared with myectomy patients. In a multivariable model including a propensity score, ASA was an independent predictor of the primary end point (unadjusted hazard ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 22.1; P = 0.02 and propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio, 6.1; 95% CI, 1.4 to 27.1; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

This study shows that ASA has potentially unwanted long-term effects. This poses special precaution, given the fact that ASA is practiced worldwide at increasing rate. We recommend myectomy as the preferred intervention in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a comparison with medical therapy [^1122knJR]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

This study was a retrospective, nonrandomized and single‐center study with a small sample, and the results were limited. First, analysis may be influenced by selection and referral bias because a part of patients from referral cannot represent the general HOCM population. Second, the efficacy and safety of ASA was cautiously extended, since patients were treated in our center experienced in HCM management in China. Third, comorbidities (e.g. coronary artery disease) were known to affect patient survival and may be more remarkable in larger sample or longer follow‐up time. This study did not evaluate the impact of relevant aspects. Fourthly, the management of AF patients, for example, indications for medical therapy including anticoagulation have changed significantly during the inclusion period. In our study, AF patients took a relatively small proportion and adhered to taking warfarin as the anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, the anticoagulant therapy considered as a confounding factor has little effect on the prognosis. Finally, overall survival of patients enrolled in our current study was not compared with expected survival of an age‐ and sex‐matched Chinese general population.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study based on the euro-alcohol septal ablation registry [^113x1V1j]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The long‐term efficacy and safety of alcohol septal ablation in patients with highly symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy has been demonstrated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long‐term outcomes of mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy treated with.

Methods and Results

We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients enrolled in the Euro‐registry (1427 patients) and identified 161 patients (53 ± 13 years; 27% women) who were mildly symptomatic (New York Heart Association class) pre‐. The median (interquartile range) follow‐up was 4.8 (1.7–8.5) years. The clinical outcome was assessed and compared with the age‐ and sex‐matched general population. The 30‐day mortality afterwas 0.6% and the annual all‐cause mortality rate was 1.7%, which was similar to the age‐ and sex‐matched general population (P = 0.62). A total of 141 (88%) patients had resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient at the last clinical checkup ≤ 30 mm Hg. Obstruction was reduced from 63 ± 32 to 15 ± 19 mm Hg (P < 0.01), and the meanclass decreased from 2.0 ± 0 to 1.3 ± 0.1 (P < 0.01); 69%, 29%, and 2% of patients were inclass I, andat the last clinical checkup, respectively.

Conclusions

Mildly symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy patients treated withhad sustained symptomatic and hemodynamic relief with a low risk of developing severe heart failure. Their survival is comparable to the general population.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a comparison with medical therapy [^115zwW2M]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

This registry suggests that mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM treated with ASA have comparable survival to that of medically treated patients. Furthermore, ASA has advantages on the improvement of NYHA class and the reduction of LVOT gradient, with a lower occurrence of new‐onset AF. Therefore, ASA could be considered as an alternative therapy for mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM intolerant to medication.

Obstructive HCM invasive therapy — invasive septal reduction therapies (surgical septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation) performed by experienced HCM teams at dedicated centers can provide safe and effective symptomatic relief for drug-refractory or severe outflow tract obstruction, and given improved outcomes at comprehensive HCM centers, these decisions are an optimal opportunity for referral.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study based on the euro-alcohol septal ablation registry [^114askq5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The prognosis in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) who self‐report mild or no symptoms is significantly worse than that of the age‐ and sex‐matched general US population. 1 Furthermore, even in the absence of cardiac symptoms, severity of the left ventricular (LV) outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) is independently associated with a higher risk of adverse clinical outcome. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Based on current guidelines, alcohol septal ablation (ASA) may only be performed in highly symptomatic HOCM patients in NYHA class III or IV and in those with recurrent exertional syncope associated with a LVOTO ≥ 50 mm Hg. 6, 7 In these patients, ASA has been shown to be very effective in reducing LVOTO and associated symptoms. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 However, data on the outcomes of ASA in mildly symptomatic patients are scarce. We examined the long‐term outcomes of ASA in patients, who self‐report dyspnea of functional class New York Heart Association (NYHA) II and were included in the Euro‐ASA registry.

### Survival after alcohol septal ablation in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^114R2PHX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol-induced infarction for treatment of symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) was discussed as a risk factor for increased cardiac mortality during follow-up.

Objectives

This study sought to report on long-term survival after echo-guided alcohol septal ablation (percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation [PTSMA]) in symptomatic patients with HOCM.

Methods

Between May 2000 and June 2017, PTSMA with alcohol injection was performed in 952 patients (age 55.7 ± 14.9 years; 59.2% men; 73.3% New York Heart Association functional class III or IV; 50.3% syncope; 10.3% sudden cardiac death in family). Clinical follow-up after 6.0 ± 5.0 years was achieved in all patients.

Results

We injected 2.1 ± 0.4 cc of alcohol. Maximal creatine kinase rise was 872 ± 489 U/l. Two (0.21%) patients died 3 and 33 days after ablation. Permanent pacemaker was implanted in 100 (10.50%) patients. Echo gradients were acutely reduced from 63.9 ± 38.2 mm Hg to 33.6 ± 29.8 mm Hg at rest and from 104.6 ± 44.0 mm Hg to 56.5 ± 41.0 mm Hg at Valsalva (p < 0.0001, each). During follow-up, 164 (17.2%) patients underwent reablation due to the planned staged procedure, 18 (1.9%) patients underwent surgical myectomy, and 49 (5.10%) patients underwent cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Seventy patients died: causes of death were identified as noncardiovascular in 50, stroke related in 6, and cardiac in 14 patients. Estimated 5-year survival was 95.8%, estimated 5-year survival free of cardiovascular events was 98.6%, and an estimated 5-year survival free of cardiac events was 98.9%. Corresponding values at 10 years were 88.3%, 96.5%, and 97.0%, and at 15 years were 79.7%, 92.3%, and 96.5%.

Conclusions

In this study, PTSMA could be proofed as a safe procedure with ongoing symptomatic improvement and excellent long-term survival. Therefore, PTSMA is a reasonable alternative to surgical myectomy in HOCM.

### Short time effects of two radiofrequency ablation methods on hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^112EJx5C]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined as having left ventricular hypertrophy without any additional potential cardiac, systemic, syndromic, or metabolic disease that could be considered causal. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is a subtype of HCM that has an obstruction in the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), which is present in around 70% of HCM patients.

The main objective in the treatment of HOCM is to decrease the amount of hypertrophy in the basal septum and to alleviate the systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve (MV) leaflet. Patients with drug‐refractory HOCM and have a resting or provoked LVOT gradient of 50 mmHg or higher, as well as being in functional class III or IV according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA), are primarily treated with septal reduction therapy (SRT). The traditional methods for SRT include surgical myectomy (SM) or alcohol septal ablation (ASA). SM effectively reduces LVOT obstruction and carries a low risk of mortality. However, it may not be accessible in all medical centers. ASA is an alternative option for patients who are not suitable candidates for SM, but the success of ASA heavily relies on the patient's specific coronary anatomy needed for the ablation procedure, and around 15% of patients do not have a suitable septal vessel. Additionally, nearly 17% of patients require a permanent pacemaker implantation following ASA.

The radiofrequency ablation method can also be used to implement SAT in HOCM patients, which includes two methods: endocardial radiofrequency septal ablation (ERSA) and percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (PIMSRA). ERSA built a three‐dimensional model of LVOT and SAM region under the guidance of Carto, the ablation creates a localized myocardial scar at the SAM‐septum contact point, which can disrupts the feedback mechanism and soon reduces the LVOT gradient. Liu et al.change the HOCM radiofrequency ablation road to ablate the inner layer of interventricular septum (IVS) myocardium through the apical approach, this modification aims to avoid damage to the conduction system and reduce the dependency on the coronary septal branches. The objective of this study is to compare the short‐term effectiveness of the two different radiofrequency ablation method on HOCM patients.

### Efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jt7nY]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) could lead to symptoms of dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope due to left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Population‐based studies estimated that the prevalence of HOCM was 0.02% to 0.23% in adults. 1 The morbidity and mortality were higher in a population with LVOT obstruction than in that without. 2, 3, 4

An increased LVOT gradient, which is defined as a peak gradient ≥ 30 mmHg, was present in 20% to 30% and 70% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients at rest and with exercise provocation, respectively. The key causes of an increased LVOT gradient were septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. 1, 5 For decades, myectomy has been the golden standard therapy for symptomatic drug‐resistant HOCM because of its excellent outcome. 6 Moreover, alcohol septal ablation (ASA) has been an appealing alternative approach in the treatment of HOCM because it effectively reduced symptoms with less trauma and shorter hospital stay than myectomy. Nevertheless, the use of ASA is limited by coronary anatomy, which means that 5% to15% of patients are unsuitable to undergo ASA. 7, 8

Radiofrequency catheter ablation has been a well‐accepted treatment of cardiac arrhythmia for many decades. This technique has been also used to relieve LVOT obstruction without restriction of the coronary anatomy. 9 However, the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency septal ablation have not been clear, as only small studies on this topic were conducted. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the short‐term efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation for HOCM.

### Is there a role for alcohol septal ablation in young patients with medically refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy? [^114bPE29]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical myectomy is recommended for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) after optimal pharmacological therapy. Percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) is reserved for high-risk adults. Symptomatic patients below 25 years underwent either surgery or PTSMA after heart-team discussion and informed consent. Echocardiography assessed gradients in surgical group. PTSMA group underwent invasive transseptal hemodynamic assessment, selective coronary angiography and super-selective cannulation of septal perforators using microcatheters. Contrast echocardiography through the microcatheter identified the myocardial target for PTSMA. Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic monitoring guided alcohol injection. Both groups were continued on beta-blockers. Symptoms, echocardiographic gradients and Brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) measurements were assessed on follow-up. Twelve patients aged 5–23 years (11–98 kg) formed the study group. Indications for PTSMA in 8 patients included abnormal mitral valve anatomy warranting replacement (n = 3), Jehovah's witness (n = 2), severe neurodevelopmental and growth retardation (n = 1) and refusal of surgery (n = 2). PTSMA targeted first perforator (n = 5), second perforator (n = 2) and anomalous septal artery from left main trunk (n = 1). Outflow gradient reduced from 92.5 ± 19.7 to 33.1 ± 13.5 mmHg. At a median follow-up of 38 months (range 3–120 weeks), the peak instantaneous echocardiographic gradient was 32 ± 16.5 mmHg. Gradient reduced in four surgical patients from 86.5 ± 16.3 mmHg to 42 ± 14.7 mm Hg. All patients were in NYHA class I/II on follow-up. The mean NTproBNP in PTSMA group reduced from 6084 ± 3628 pg/ml to 3081 ± 2019 pg/ml; it was 1396 and 1795 pg/ml in surgery. PTSMA may be considered in medically refractory high-risk young patients. It relieves symptoms and reduces gradient. Though surgery is preferred in young patients, PTSMA may have a role in selected patients.

### Novel techniques for alcohol septal ablation in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with complex anatomy: a case series [^111CZx8J]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is an established treatment option for drug‐refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). The clinical application of this technique has been challenged by the more predictable and durable results of surgical myectomy or of the transcatheter septal scoring along midline endocardium (SESAME) technique as well as by the introduction of anti‐myosin inhibitors that offer a pharmacological alternative to all mechanical interventions. However, ASA has also found new applications in the prevention or treatment of left ventricular outflow obstruction after transcatheter mitral valve implantation. Preprocedural coronary angiography (CAG) is crucial for identifying target septal branches and assessing their anatomy, including origin, diameter, and course. Intraprocedural echocardiography is essential to confirm that the targeted septal branches adequately perfuse the intended myocardium. This imaging technique helps to evaluate the extent of myocardial ablation, detects any inadvertent effects on non‐target areas, and determines if additional septal branches require ablation to achieve optimal results. Key elements of this procedure include: (1) effective ablation of the myocardium contributing to left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction; (2) prevention of ethanol leakage into non‐target vessels, especially the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, to avoid unintended acute myocardial infarction; and (3) sparing of non‐target myocardial regions. Mastery of these technical aspects is crucial for procedural success and avoidance of complications. However, conventional ASA techniques may be challenging or unfeasible in cases with extremely small septal branches or acute bifurcation angles, making it difficult or impossible to deliver over‐the‐wire (OTW) balloons or microcatheters. To address these anatomical challenges, we developed novel techniques to expand the indications for ASA to previously unsuitable cases. This report describes innovative approaches aimed at improving the safety and efficacy of ASA in complex anatomical scenarios.

### Effects of alcohol septal ablation on exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and quality of life in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114xzofQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study assessing the comprehensive effects of contemporary ASA in patients with oHCM demonstrated that the procedure was associated with a significant reduction in LV filling pressures both at rest and during exercise, along with an improvement in symptoms and QoL. The procedure led to favorable functional and structural changes, with significant reductions in LVOTO gradients, severity of mitral valve regurgitation, and a reduced left atrial volume.

LV Dysfunction and Outflow Obstruction

The relationship between the pathophysiology and development of symptoms in patients with oHCM is multifactorial and complex. Together with inherent abnormalities of the myocardium, the presence of an LVOTO leads to elevated LV systolic pressure, which triggers a complex chain of abnormalities, including prolonged ventricular relaxation, increased LV diastolic pressure and myocardial ischemia. The increase in ventricular diastolic pressure is subsequently transmitted backward to the left atrium, causing dilation of the chamber. Regurgitant mitral flow may further exacerbate the hemodynamicburden on the left atrium. The resulting pressure overload in the left atrium and pulmonary circulation often manifests clinically as exertional dyspnea. Data from the present study, demonstrating a reduction in LV filling pressures, are consistent with previous research evaluating the acute hemodynamic effects of ASA. A prior study assessing the acute effects of ASA on resting filling pressures found that the relief of systolic contraction load influenced myocardial relaxation, thereby impacting diastolic properties and subsequently reducing left atrial filling pressures. These findings were further supported by another study investigating acute hemodynamic changes with ASA, which showed a significant decrease in end‐diastolic pressure and a notable improvement in diastolic stiffness following the procedure. Data from the present study extend this knowledge by examining the median‐term effects, which indicate sustained benefits in reducing LV filling pressures over time.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study based on the euro-alcohol septal ablation registry [^1137Dzjx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

There remains a significant knowledge gap in the therapeutic strategy for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with severe LVOTO. Not surprisingly, the current therapeutic approach with septal reduction therapy (ASA or myectomy) is based on evidence obtained exclusively from highly symptomatic patients; a multicenter North American registry (n = 874; 55 ± 16 years; rest gradient, 70 ± 38 mm Hg; 78% in NYHA class III/IV) demonstrated a 5‐year survival rate of 86%, 21 and previously reported European experience (n = 1275; 58 ± 14 years; rest gradient, 67 ± 36 mm Hg; NYHA class 2.9 ± 0.5) showed a 5‐year survival rate of 89%. 4 A 5‐year survival rate reported in this study is 94%. This difference was expectable, given that NYHA class pre‐ASA was recently identified as an independent predictor of all‐cause mortality (HR, 1.5). 4

However, scarce data and experience from clinical practice suggest that severe LVOTO may be harmful irrespective of the severity of symptoms. 1, 2, 3, 5 This notion was supported by a study (n = 544; 59 ± 16 years) from the Mayo Clinic reporting on the long‐term outcome of patients with HOCM who were free of severe symptoms at baseline. 1 Patients with LVOT gradient > 64 mm Hg at baseline had a 10‐year survival of only 53%, and severe LVOTO was an independent predictor of adverse clinical outcome. Furthermore, death or severe symptoms occurred in 68% of these patients within 10 years after the first evaluation. 1 This finding is important, especially in the light of recent studies showing a ≤ 1% ASA‐related mortality, with an enduring effect on LVOTO and associated symptoms following the procedure. 4, 13, 22 Thus, on one hand, LVOTO is considered a risk factor of long‐term outcome in HOCM patients irrespective of their symptoms, and on the other hand, ASA performed in dedicated centers seems to be safe and effective in diminishing LVOTO. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22 The results of the present study should be weighed against this background, and although our study has limitations as discussed below, the results clearly challenge the established clinical standard of treating only highly symptomatic HOCM patients with ASA.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study based on the euro-alcohol septal ablation registry [^114DmWNQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Alcohol septal ablation for the HOCM was introduced more than 2 decades ago, 8 and its early use was restricted to highly symptomatic patients. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that these patients benefitted symptomatically. 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 Some studies also suggested a positive prognostic influence of septal reduction therapy (ASA or surgical myectomy), especially if post‐treatment LVOTO was markedly reduced. 5, 9, 20 The careful therapeutic strategy, focused on the highly symptomatic and highest risk patients, was mirrored by both American and European guidelines on hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). 6, 7 However, recent data have suggested a significant impact of LVOTO on long‐term outcome in patients with HOCM, independent of symptoms. 1, 2, 3, 5, 9 This led us to analyze post‐ASA outcomes of patients treated for mild symptoms and severe LVOTO. The essential findings of this study are as follows: (1) Carefully selected patients with mild symptoms (NYHA class II) and severe LVOTO treated with ASA had a long‐term prognosis similar to that of the sex‐ and age‐matched general population; (2) these patients were at minimal risk (2%) for developing severe heart failure (NYHA class ˃II) symptoms during long‐term (median 4.8 years) follow‐up; (3) 70% of patients achieved NYHA functional class I; (4) resting LVOTO assessed by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography was reduced by 77% at the last clinical checkup, and 88% of patients had LVOT gradient ≤ 30 mm Hg at the last clinical check‐up; and (5) the absence of NYHA class improvement was independently associated with higher long‐term mortality.

### Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: present and future, with translation into contemporary cardiovascular medicine [^111e4hdL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited heart disease with diverse phenotypic and genetic expression, clinical presentation, and natural history. HCM has been recognized for 55 years, but recently substantial advances in diagnosis and treatment options have evolved, as well as increased recognition of the disease in clinical practice. Nevertheless, most genetically and clinically affected individuals probably remain undiagnosed, largely free from disease-related complications, although HCM may progress along 1 or more of its major disease pathways (i.e., arrhythmic sudden death risk; progressive heart failure [HF] due to dynamic left ventricular [LV] outflow obstruction or due to systolic dysfunction in the absence of obstruction; or atrial fibrillation with risk of stroke). Effective treatments are available for each adverse HCM complication, including implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for sudden death prevention, heart transplantation for end-stage failure, surgical myectomy (or selectively, alcohol septal ablation) to alleviate HF symptoms by abolishing outflow obstruction, and catheter-based procedures to control atrial fibrillation. These and other strategies have now resulted in a low disease-related mortality rate of < 1%/year. Therefore, HCM has emerged from an era of misunderstanding, stigma, and pessimism, experiencing vast changes in its clinical profile, and acquiring an effective and diverse management armamentarium. These advances have changed its natural history, with prevention of sudden death and reversal of HF, thereby restoring quality of life with extended (if not normal) longevity for most patients, and transforming HCM into a contemporary treatable cardiovascular disease.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study based on the euro-alcohol septal ablation registry [^115CKcin]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The fact that current treatment guidelines on HCM generally recommend watchful waiting until development of severe symptoms before invasive treatment parallels established practice in patients with severe aortic stenosis. 6, 7 However, a growing body of evidence suggests that long‐term outcome in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis managed conservatively is dismal, and that earlier invasive treatment could lead to improved outcomes. 23, 24, 25 Along this line, it appears possible that mildly symptomatic HOCM patients with severe LVOTO could benefit from early invasive treatment aimed at LVOTO reduction. However, decision making for early septal reduction therapy in mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM is complex, and these patients may represent a diverse group. Furthermore, septal reduction therapy (myectomy or ASA) should only be performed in dedicated centers that can achieve a procedure‐related mortality rate less than 1%. 26

Notably, the European Society of cardiology HCM risk calculator used to estimate the risk for SCD considers some mildly symptomatic patients with LVOTO to be eligible for ICD implantation. 27 Although patients after septal reduction therapy should not be subject to SCD risk evaluation with this calculator, one can speculate that diminishing LVOTO by invasive treatment could lower the risk of SCD in some of these patients. 16 This may not only improve survival, but might also reduce the need for ICD implantation. Such a clinical scenario is not uncommon, but an adequate therapeutic strategy has not yet been determined in these patients. 6, 7 Randomized trials would be ultimately required to determine whether the primary therapeutic goal in such patients should be invasive reduction of LVOTO and/or ICD implantation, but, in the meantime, more retrospective data, such as those presented in the current study, are needed on outcomes in mildly symptomatic HOCM patients, especially those with severe LVOTO.

### Alcohol septal ablation vs myectomy for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pCQun]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Surgical myectomy (SM) and Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) are effective therapies for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy. A plethora of data has recently emerged on the long-term outcomes of these procedures. We hence sought to perform an updated meta-analysis comparing both procedures.

Methods

Studies reporting long-term (> 3-years) outcomes of SM and/or ASA were included. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included cardiovascular mortality, sudden cardiac death (SCD), reintervention, and complications including death, pacemaker implantation, and stroke.

Results

Twenty-two ASA cohorts (n = 4213; follow-up = 6.6-years) and 23 SM cohorts (n = 4240; follow-up = 6.8-years) were included. Septal myectomy was associated with higher periprocedural mortality and stroke (2% vs 1.2%, P = 0.009 and 1.5% vs 0.8% P = 0.013, respectively), but ASA was associated with more need of pacemaker (10% vs 5%, P < 0.001). During long-term follow-up, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and sudden cardiac death rates were 1.5%, 0.4%, and 0.3% per person-year in the ASA group and 1.1%, 0.5%, and 0.3% per person-year in the SM group (P = 0.21, P = 0.53, P = 0.43), respectively. Repeat septal reduction intervention(s) were more common after ASA (11% vs 1.5%, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Compared with SM, ASA is associated with lower periprocedural mortality and stroke but higher rates of pacemaker implantations and reintervention. However, there was no difference between ASA and SM with regards to long-term all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or SCD.

### Sustained improvement in left ventricular diastolic function after alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^117AYRPK]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

Impaired diastolic function is responsible for many of the clinical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) whose symptoms are refractory to medical therapy, alcohol septal ablation (ASA) reduces left ventricular (LV) outflow tract gradient, with short-term improvement in LV diastolic function. Little is known about the longer term impact of ASA on diastolic function.

Methods and Results

We evaluated LV diastolic function at baseline and 1- and 2-year follow-up after successful ASA. In 30 patients (58 ± 15 years, 22 men) who underwent successful ASA, New York Heart Association class was lower at 1-year follow-up compared with baseline (3.0 ± 0.5 to 1.5 ± 0.7; P < 0.0001). LV outflow tract gradient (76 ± 37 to 19 ± 12; P < 0.0001), interventricular septal thickness (19 ± 2 to 14 ± 2; P < 0.0001), and left atrial volume (26 ± 5 to 20 ± 4; P < 0.0001) were decreased. Significant improvement in E-wave deceleration time, isovolumic relaxation time, early diastolic mitral lateral annular velocity (E'), mitral inflow propagation velocity (V(p)), ratio of transmitral early LV filling velocity (E) to early diastolic Doppler tissue imaging of the mitral annulus (E/E'), and E/V(p) were observed at 1 year following successful ASA. These changes persisted in the subset cohort (n = 21) for whom 2-year data were available.

Conclusion

Successful ASA for HOCM leads to significant and sustained improvement in echocardiographic measures of diastolic function, which may contribute to improved functional status after successful ASA.

### Early onset and progression of left ventricular remodeling after alcohol septal ablation in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^114XgZXt]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) reduces left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) pressure gradient in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), which leads to left ventricular remodeling. We sought to describe the early to midterm changes and modulating factors of the remodeling process using cardiac MRI (CMR).

Methods and Results

CMR was performed at baseline and 1 and 6 months after ASA in 29 patients with HOCM (age 52 ± 16 years). Contrast-enhanced CMR showed no infarct-related hyperenhancement outside the target septal area. Septal mass decreased from 75 ± 23 g at baseline to 68 ± 22 and 58 ± 19 g (P < 0.001) at 1- and 6-month follow-up, respectively. Remote, nonseptal mass decreased from 141 ± 41 to 132 ± 40 and 111 ± 27 g (P < 0.001), respectively. Analysis of temporal trends revealed that septal mass reduction was positively associated with contrast-enhanced infarct size and transmural or left-sided septal infarct location at both 1 and 6 months. Remote mass reduction was associated with infarct location at 6 months but not with contrast-enhanced infarct size. By linear regression analysis, percentage remote mass reduction correlated significantly with LVOT gradient reduction at 6-month follow-up (P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Left ventricular remodeling after ASA occurs early and progresses on midterm follow-up, modulated by CMR infarct size and location. Remote mass reduction is associated with infarct location and correlates with reduction of the LVOT pressure gradient. Thus, myocardial hypertrophy in HOCM is, at least in part, afterload dependent and reversible and is not exclusively caused by the genetic disorder.

### Comparison of alcohol septal ablation with mavacamten in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114ECwLs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is associated with significant morbidity attributed to left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Although alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is an established interventional treatment, mavacamten, a novel cardiac myosin inhibitor, has emerged as a noninvasive pharmacologic alternative. Understanding the comparative efficacy of these 2 treatments is important for optimizing patient care. This single-center retrospective study assessed the hemodynamic and functional changes in adult patients with obstructive HCM treated with ASA (n = 58) or mavacamten (n = 36) from July 2012 to May 2024. Outcomes, including changes in LVOT gradient, left ventricular ejection fraction, mitral regurgitation (MR) severity, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, were collected at baseline, 16 weeks, and after 32 weeks of treatment. ASA and mavacamten were associated with over 70% reductions in Valsalva-induced LVOT gradient and MR after 32 weeks. The maximal effect of ASA on LVOT gradient was observed at 16 weeks, whereas mavacamten's peak effect was noted after 32 weeks. MR severity improved similarly in both cohorts (p < 0.01). Patients who underwent ASA had a poorer baseline NYHA functional class than their counterparts; however, each treatment significantly improved LVOT gradients (p < 0.001) and average NYHA class after 32 weeks (p < 0.001). The average left ventricular ejection fraction was comparable at baseline and after 32 weeks between the 2 groups. Patients treated with ASA were older than those treated with mavacamten (68.5 vs 60.8 years, p < 0.001). In patients with obstructive HCM, ASA and mavacamten yield significant and comparable improvements in hemodynamics and functional status after 32 weeks.

### Hemodynamic predictors of outcome following alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^112FY6ro]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to parameters that are directly impacted by ASA (reduction in gradient and increase in PP), our results suggest that patients with lower mean LA pressure at baseline have more favorable outcomes than patients with higher mean LA pressure at baseline (Figure 4). The findings from this study suggest that careful selection of patients with HCM for ASA therapy may confer a survival advantage. This may suggest that earlier detection (using invasive and noninvasive techniques) and intervention, before severe LA pressure develops, may carry a better prognosis for patients with HCM. Currently, ASA is reserved for patients with refractory symptoms to medical therapy; however, it is possible that during the prolonged time course after which some patients become refractory to medical therapy, advanced changes in LA pressure, structure, and morphology have already occurred, which may limit the benefits of ASA therapy. Thus, it is crucial to understand the factors that lead to the increase in LA pressures and whether early intervention, before LA pressures increase, carries a better prognosis for patients with HCM undergoing ASA.

### Release of matrix metalloproteinases following alcohol septal ablation in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^117WRPwo]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study examined plasma levels of certain matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) species before and after alcohol-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

Background

Matrix metalloproteinases contribute to tissue remodeling, and endogenous control of MMP activity is achieved by the concordant release and binding of TIMPs. Animal models of MI have demonstrated a role for MMP activation in myocardial remodeling. However, the temporal relationship of MMP and TIMP release following a controlled myocardial injury in humans remains unknown.

Methods

Plasma levels for the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, and for the collagenases MMP-8 and MMP-13, as well as TIMP-1 profiles were examined (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) at baseline and serially up to 60 h following alcohol injection into the septal perforator artery in order to induce an MI in 51 patients with HOCM (age 55 ± 2 years).

Results

Plasma creatine kinase (MB isoform), indicating myocardial injury, increased 2,150% 18 h post-MI (p < 0.05). Plasma MMP-9 increased by over 400% and MMP-8 by over 100% from baseline values by 12 h post-MI (p < 0.05 vs. baseline). A similar temporal profile was not observed for MMP-2 and MMP-13. In addition, a concomitant increase in plasma TIMP-1 levels did not occur post-MI. As a result, MMP/TIMP stoichiometry (MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio) increased significantly post-MI, suggestive of reduced TIMP-1 mediated MMP-9 inhibition, which would potentially enhance extracellular myocardial remodeling.

Conclusions

These unique results demonstrated that induction of a controlled myocardial injury in humans, specifically through alcohol-induced MI, caused species- and time-dependent perturbations of MMP/TIMP stoichiometry that would facilitate myocardial remodeling in the early post-MI setting.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112CaPgc]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical efficacy of alcohol septal ablation for drug-refractory hypertrophic cardiomyopathy remains unclear. This study examines the outcome of alcohol septal ablation performed at a tertiary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy referral center.

Methods and Results

Among 601 patients with severely symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy referred for alcohol septal ablation or myectomy from 1998 to 2006, 138 patients (median age, 64 years; 39% men) chose to undergo ablation. Procedural complications included death in 1.4%, sustained ventricular arrhythmias in 3%, tamponade in 3%, and pacemaker implantation in 20%. This rate was higher than a combined complication rate of 5% in age- and gender-matched patients who had undergone septal myectomy at Mayo Clinic (P < 0.0001). Four-year survival free of all mortality was 88.0% (95% confidence interval, 79.4 to 97.5%), which was similar to that of the age- and gender-matched patients who had undergone myectomy (P = 0.18). Six patients had documented ventricular arrhythmias after ablation, 4 of whom had successful intervention. Four-year survival free of death and severe New York Heart Association class III/IV symptoms after septal ablation was 76.4%, and 71 patients (51%) became asymptomatic. Myectomy patients ≤ 65 years of age had significantly better survival free of death and severe symptoms (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Alcohol septal ablation is an efficacious procedure if performed in an experienced institution and may resolve symptoms in a subset of patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the procedural complication rate exceeds that of myectomy. Patients 65 years of age have better symptom resolution with myectomy. No impairment in short-term survival was noted in this nonrandomized study, but the long-term outcome remains unknown.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study based on the euro-alcohol septal ablation registry [^1132jsWM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

A total of 1427 consecutive patients (49% women, 58.1 ± 13.6 years) treated with ASA for HOCM in 11 European centers were enrolled in the Euro‐ASA registry.

We identified 161 patients (11%; 27% women) with baseline NYHA class II dyspnea and LVOTO ≥ 50 mm Hg at rest or after provocation, who were included in this study. None reported angina or syncope. Patients were treated with ASA between January 1996 and May 2016. Some of the patients have been included in previous reports. 4 Informed consent was given by each patient, and the study was performed in agreement with The Declaration of Helsinki.

Alcohol septal ablation was performed in mildly symptomatic patients who were diagnosed with HOCM that was refractory to medical therapy. Because ASA in mildly symptomatic patients is not generally recommended, the procedure was only performed in patients who had significantly reduced quality of life attributed to dyspnea and had a strong wish for symptomatic improvement. All patients were carefully informed about institutional experience with septal reduction therapy techniques and accepted the risk of the procedure.

Interventional Procedure and Follow‐up

Details of the ASA technique used in the Euro‐ASA registry were published previously. 4 Most patients had routine clinical examination 3 to 6 months post‐ASA and subsequently once every year. The follow‐up program included recording of events, symptoms, physical examination, ECG, and echocardiographic examination, including risk stratification for sudden cardiac death (SCD). In patients with an implanted pacemaker or defibrillator (ICD), the device's memory and function were assessed, and ICD therapy was recorded. All clinical adverse events were confirmed by reviewing the medical records and respective national registries of deaths. For patients who died outside the participating hospitals, interviews and/or mail communications with the next of kin and/or the treating family doctor were performed to determine the cause of death.

### Hemodynamic predictors of outcome following alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^1152xkTq]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is a minimally invasive treatment for drug-refractory obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Detailed assessment of pressure changes and predictors of mortality and procedure success are not well defined.

METHODS:

This is a single-center study evaluating pressure changes and predictors of mortality and procedure success in transseptal ASA. Survival analysis and predictors of mortality were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression, respectively.

RESULTS:

A total of 156 patients were included (mean age, 67.3 years; 46.8% women). Left atrial (LA) pressure and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient decreased, whereas aortic pulse pressure (PP) increased post-ASA. Patients with lower baseline mean LA pressure (< median, 19 mm Hg), LVOT gradient reduction > 82% (gradient change median), and PP increase > 19% (PP change median) had superior survival. On Cox univariable regression, baseline mean LA pressure > median (19 mm Hg; hazard ratio [HR], 2.09 [95% CI, 1.05–4.18]; P = 0.036), residual LVOT gradient (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01–1.03]; P = 0.003), and LVOT gradient percent reduction < median (82%; HR, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.46–5.83]; P = 0.002) were predictors of mortality. When adjusting for age and sex, baseline LA v wave > median (28 mm Hg; HR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.17–4.76]; P = 0.016), baseline mean LA pressure > median (19 mm Hg; HR, 2.70 [95% CI, 1.33–5.50]; P = 0.006), percentage reduction in gradient < median (82%; HR, 2.74 [CI, 1.37–5.50]; P = 0.005), and percentage increase in PP < median (19.3%; HR, 2.09 [CI, 1.05–4.16]; P = 0.035) predicted survival free of all-cause mortality.

CONCLUSIONS:

ASA is associated with an acute decrease in the LVOT gradient and LA pressures and increase in aortic PP. Mean LA pressure, percentage decrease in LVOT gradient, and increase in PP are strong predictors of survival free of all-cause mortality following ASA and are important variables for procedural guidance.

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) — echocardiography-guided alcohol septal ablation: Echocardiography is recommended in selecting the appropriate septal perforator during alcohol injection during septal ablation for HOCM, and both transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be used; they provide an assessment of immediate procedural results and allow monitoring for complications, and myocardial contrast echocardiography can prevent erroneous instillation of alcohol into unwanted territory distant from the target septal area.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy septal reduction therapy — patient selection and procedural considerations: Generally, SRT performed by experienced operators in comprehensive centers is contemplated when patients continue to have severe symptoms despite optimal medical therapy or intolerant adverse effects, and SRT with either surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation is rarely indicated for the asymptomatic patient. Survival of patients with LVOTO is reduced compared with those without obstruction, and relief of obstruction may mitigate this incremental risk, yet currently insufficient evidence is available to recommend SRT to improve patient survival as the only indication; highly symptomatic patients should participate in discussion of success rates, benefits, and risks, and if either procedure is unavailable at their primary cardiology practice, referral to more comprehensive HCM centers is encouraged because the literature demonstrates a volume-outcome relationship. In symptomatic obstructive HCM with associated cardiac disease requiring surgical treatment, surgical myectomy by experienced operators provides the opportunity to correct structural and anatomic issues with a single procedure, and for paroxysmal AF, intraoperative pulmonary vein isolation or maze can be added; transaortic septal myectomy adds little to the risk of other cardiac procedures, and relief of LVOTO will minimize the risk of hemodynamic instability early postoperatively. In adult patients for whom surgery is contraindicated or the risk is unacceptably high due to serious comorbidities or advanced age, alcohol septal ablation when feasible and performed in experienced HCM centers becomes the preferred invasive strategy for relief of LVOTO.

### Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy-alcohol septal ablation vs. myectomy: a meta-analysis [^115DydPz]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Our purpose is to conduct a meta-analysis of all published studies comparing alcohol septal ablation (ASA) and myectomy (MM) for drug refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Alcohol septal ablation is a less invasive alternative to MM for relief of symptoms in patients with drug refractory HOCM.

Methods and Results

An extensive search of PubMed identified five non-randomized studies comparing ASA and MM. Of 351 patients studied, 183 underwent ASA and 168 underwent MM. Patients undergoing ASA were older (mean age 54.4 ± 6.3 vs. 45.0 ± 4.4 years, P = 0.02). All patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV. Baseline left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient was comparable (81.4 ± 14.3 mmHg in ASA vs. 77.4 ± 15.5 mmHg in MM, P = 0.2). Although resting LVOT gradient after septal reduction therapy in both groups was < 20 mmHg at follow-up, patients undergoing MM had lower LVOT gradient (18.2 ± 6.7 vs. 10.8 ± 6.3 mmHg, P < 0.001). Patients in both groups had comparable improvement in NYHA class (1.5 ± 0.3 in ASA vs. 1.3 ± 0.2, P = 0.2) at follow-up. A higher percentage of patients undergoing ASA required permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation for complete heart block (18.4 ± 7.9 vs. 3.3 ± 3.9%, P = 0.04). There was no significant in-hospital mortality difference between the two groups.

Conclusion

Alcohol septal ablation and MM provide significant reduction in LVOT gradient and NYHA functional class on mid-term follow-up. A higher percentage of patients required PPM after ASA. Randomized trials are needed to confirm current findings.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a long-term follow-up study based on the euro-alcohol septal ablation registry [^1147K6as]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Fifteen (9.3%) patients underwent repeated septal reduction therapy attributed to insufficient symptomatic relief; 13 (8.1%) underwent repeated ASA, 3 (1.9%) underwent myectomy, and 1 (0.7%) underwent myectomy after re‐ASA. During the study period, 9 patients (5.6%) had an ICD implanted; 1 for secondary prevention and 8 for primary prevention according to current guidelines. Overall, of 18 (11.3%) patients with an ICD (median age at ASA, 50.0 ± 11.7 years; 28% women; median [IQR] follow‐up, 3.0 [1.7–8.9] years), 4 (22%) experienced an appropriate ICD discharge (4.5% per year).

A total of 15 (9.3%) deaths occurred during 895 patient‐years of follow‐up, which translates to a rate of 1.7 deaths per 100 patient‐years. Five of these patients died suddenly, which converts to a rate of 0.6 sudden deaths per 100 patient‐years. In these patients, ASA was performed at an average age of 61.6 ± 11.1 years and the mean survival was 5.2 ± 4.2 years post‐ASA. Causes of death are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Causes of Death After ASA

Survival free of all‐cause mortality at 1, 5, and 10 years was 97% (95% CI, 93–99), 94% (95% CI, 89–97), and 87% (95% CI, 78–93), respectively. This survival was comparable to the expected survival in an age‐ and sex‐matched general population (P = 0.62; Figure 1). According to multivariable analysis, the independent predictors of all‐cause mortality were age at ASA (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00–1.10; P = 0.04) and absence of improvement in NYHA class score at the last clinical check‐up (HR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.09–13.11; P = 0.04).

### Myocardial mechanics explains the time course of benefit for septal ethanol ablation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1153mgqm]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2008). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the time course of left ventricular (LV) outflow tract gradient reduction during septal ethanol ablation for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is related to changes in myocardial mechanics. A total of 21 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy undergoing septal ethanol ablation were analyzed. LV outflow tract gradient decreased with septal balloon occlusion, further decreased postethanol injection, and partially rebounded at discharge (5–6 days postprocedure). During balloon occlusion longitudinal and circumferential strain significantly decreased in all analyzed segments, significantly improved with alcohol injection only at sites distant to infarction, and normalized at all segments except infarcted ones at discharge. LV twist significantly improved with ethanol injection and remained high at discharge. Myocardial mechanics suggest that the decrease in LV outflow tract gradient during septal ethanol ablation coincides with global LV dysfunction despite only local ischemia during septal balloon occlusion. Global dysfunction is transient and the gradient rebounds when dysfunction is limited to the basal septum.

Effect of ASA on QoL and Symptoms

ASA was associated with a clinically significant improvement in symptoms and QoL, with an increase in the KCCQ‐CSS (11.3 [95% CI, 4.5–18.2]; P < 0.01; Table 2). The improvement was confirmed by changes in NYHA functional class. Before ASA treatment, 54% of patients were in NYHA functional class III compared with 13% after ASA (P < 0.001; Figure 3). Similar findings for the Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class were observed, with 67% reporting a degree of angina before ASA, which was reduced to 33% after ASA (P = 0.02). There was no significant correlation between the reduction in LV filling pressures and improvement in KCCQ‐CSS (r 2 = 0.2, P = 0.3).

### Novel techniques for alcohol septal ablation in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with complex anatomy: a case series [^1146uiYR]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is an established treatment for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). However, conventional techniques may be challenging in cases with complex septal branch anatomy, including hairpin curves, extremely small branches, and acute angle bifurcations. We present three innovative catheter techniques that expand the applicability of ASA in these challenging anatomical scenarios. The double balloon technique overcomes hairpin curves in the proximal septal branches, while the perfusion balloon and microcatheter technique enables ablation of extremely small branches. The balloon screen technique facilitates access to small branches at acute angles. These methods were successfully applied to three patients with medically refractory HOCM, resulting in a significant reduction in left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradients and an improvement in symptoms. These novel techniques provide potential solutions for anatomically challenging cases, expanding the indications for ASA and improving clinical outcomes for patients with HOCM.

### Long-term clinical follow-up of patients undergoing percutaneous alcohol septal reduction for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^114AmySg]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is an alternative treatment for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) patients refractory to pharmacological therapy. We sought to evaluate the immediate and long-term incidence of death and changes in life quality in a consecutive cohort submitted to ASA.

Methods and Results

Between October 1998 and December 2013, a total of 56 patients (mean age 53.2 ± 15.5) with symptomatic refractory HOCM were treated with ASA and followed during 15 years (mean 8 ± 4 years). There were 7 (12.5%) deaths, 2 (3.6%) being of cardiac cause. The Kaplan-Meier survival probability estimate was 96.4% at 1 year, 87.7 at 5 years and 81.0% at 12 years post-ASA. Significant improvement was observed in life quality assessed by DASI index and NYHA functional class as well as in the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT) gradient reduction (from 92.8 ± 3.3 mm Hg to 9.37 ± 6.7 mm Hg, P < 0.001) and septum thickness (from 23.9 ± 0.6 mm to 12.9 ± 1.0 mm, P < 0.001). Only one patient (1.7%) required permanent pacemaker immediately after ASA. During follow-up, one patient had a repeated ASA, three patients underwent myectomy and other four required ICD/pacemaker. In the multivariate model only post-ASA LVOT residual gradient and left ventricle mass were associated with worse prognosis.

Conclusions

In this long-term clinical follow-up without losses, ASA was effective in improving quality of life and NYHA functional class, with relatively low mortality and very low need for immediate permanent pacemaker implantation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Clinicopathological profiles of progressive heart failure in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112y7QBJ]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we have distinguished three diverse pathways of progressive heart failure in a large HCM referral cohort. Atrial fibrillation was the most common pathophysiological variable associated with progressive heart failure. Extensive transmural myocardial scarring influences progression to end-stage systolic dysfunction. However, no consistent relationship was evident between genetic substrate and heart failure profile, underscoring the broad heterogeneity of HCM from both molecular and clinical perspectives. Recognition of the diverse pathophysiology underlying progressive heart failure in HCM offers a measure of clarity to the selection of targeted management strategies, e.g. antiarrhythmic and other drug therapies (or radiofrequency ablation) for AF; surgical myectomy (or, selectively, alcohol ablation) for LV outflow obstruction, or timely heart transplantation for end-stage systolic or refractory diastolic dysfunction in the absence of LV outflow obstruction.

### Short time effects of two radiofrequency ablation methods on hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^1114XAiE]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The patient follow‐up revealed a significant improvement in symptoms of angina pectoris. However, there was no significant reduction in syncope, presyncope, or palpitation symptoms for the patients. Additionally, patients with heart function grade III–IV did not demonstrate any noteworthy improvement in heart function during the 30‐day follow‐up. We hypothesized that the improvement of syncope, palpitation, and heart function relied on the structural changes, which were confirmed in the long‐term follow‐up results of PIMSRA.

For ERSA, the most crucial part of the procedure is accurately locating the contact point between the SAM and the IVS. Some studies noted a reduction of under 2 mm in the SAM area of the IVS, however, this small reduction was enough to disrupt the SAM‐septal feedback mechanism and effectively lower the LVOT, similar to ASA. Unlike SM, early improvement in obstructive conditions in ERSA does not occur due to structural changes in hypertrophic myocardium. Early studies on the behavior of LVOT obstruction during temporary balloon occlusion of the septal branch without alcohol injection support the hypothesis that the decrease of gradient may depend more on inducing a SAM localized reduction in contractility, the transient ischemia in septal branch at the site of obstruction already leads to an acute, reversible LVOT gradient reduction. After the ERSA, scar formation reduces the contractility in the SAM‐IVS. The endocardial myocardium typically exhibits the LS, therefore, the LS in the SAM region was weakened after ablation. The energy of radiofrequency ablation decreases with the blood flow, so it is reasonable to question the ablation depth. However, the scar on the endocardial myocardium weakens the LS sufficiently to reduce the gradient of LVOT. This recognition emphasizes the importance of changing the LS of IVS in patients with HOCM to achieve hemodynamic improvement. Future interventional ablation should focus on this, but with caution, to protect the cardiac function of patients.

### Sex-related differences in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy undergoing alcohol septal ablation [^112ewKuw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is an established percutaneous septal reduction therapy (SRT) for patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM) with drug‐refractory symptoms. Previous studies have shown that women with HCM have worse outcomes compared with men both with and without SRT, while other studies showed no difference in outcome according to sex. Of note, the studies reporting on sex differences following SRT are largely composed of patients undergoing septal myectomy. To the best of our knowledge, the assessment of hemodynamic changes and long‐term outcomes in ASA‐treated patients with HCM based on sex has not been previously evaluated. Hence, this study aimed to assess the outcomes of patients treated with ASA and evaluate the differences in survival based on biological sex.

### Follow-up of alcohol septal ablation for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy the baylor and medical university of South Carolina experience 1996 to 2007 [^111cC5xg]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the long-term outcome of alcohol septal ablation (ASA).

Background

There are inadequate data on the long-term outcome of ASA for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).

Methods

Six hundred and twenty-nine patients were enrolled consecutively (1996 to 2007) and 98.4% (n = 619) underwent ASA with 92% follow-up in 2007. Evaluation included deaths, procedural complications, pacemaker requirement, repeat ASA, and myectomy/valve surgery. Follow-up parameters included angina (Canadian Cardiovascular Society score), dyspnea (New York Heart Association functional class), exercise time, and echocardiographic indices (septal thickness, ejection fraction, resting and provoked gradients).

Results

Ethanol (2.6 ± 1.0 ml) was injected into 1.3 ± 0.5 septal arteries, inducing a septal infarct. Complications included death 1% (n = 6), permanent pacemaker requirement 8.2% (n = 52), coronary dissection 1.3% (n = 8), and worsening mitral regurgitation 0.3% (n = 2). The mean follow-up was 4.6 ± 2.5 years (range: 3 months to 10.2 years). During follow-up, New York Heart Association functional class decreased from 2.8 ± 0.6 to 1.2 ± 0.5 (p < 0.001); Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina score decreased from 2.1 ± 0.9 to 1.0 ± 0 (p < 0.001); and exercise time increased from 4.8 ± 3.3 to 8.2 ± 1.0 (p < 0.001) min. The resting and provoked left ventricular outflow tract gradients decreased progressively (p < 0.001) and remained low during follow-up. The septal thickness decreased from 2.1 ± 0.5 cm to 1.0 ± 0.1 cm (p < 0.001) and the ejection fraction decreased from 68 ± 9% to 62 ± 3% (p < 0.001). The survival estimates at 1, 5, and 8 years were 97%, 92%, and 89%, respectively.

Conclusions

The initial benefits of ASA were maintained during follow-up.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a comparison with medical therapy [^114K7YY6]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia in HCM, with a prevalence of 20–30%. The occurrence of AF as a turning point in the course of HCM leads to the impairment of life quality and the increased mortality. AF‐related stroke is one of the main causes of adverse prognosis in HCM patients. In our study, the incidence of new‐onset AF following ASA was significantly lower than that of patients in the medical group(7.8% vs. 20.4%, p = .048). The reason may be related to the impact of the two therapeutic methods on left atrium diameter: patients after medical therapy had a significantly increased left atrium diameter at the last check‐up, while the left atrium diameter of patients who underwent ASA was not statistically significant. It was worth noting that patients treated with ASA had larger left atrium diameter compared with patients of the medical group at baseline (41.8 ± 5.1 vs. 39.4 ± 6.1 mm, p = .013). Conversely, left atrium diameter of patients in the medical group was larger than after ASA at the last clinical check‐up (43.1 ± 6.9 vs. 40.9 ± 5.0 mm, p = .033). Several previous studies also revealed that increased left atrium diameter was independently associated with the occurrence of AF. The possible reason why the left atrium diameter of patients undergoing ASA was not statistically significant is that ASA had a remarkable reduction of LVOT gradient compared to medical therapy (a mean reduction of 66.1% vs. 28.8%, p = .000). Nevertheless, whether ASA could reduce the incidence of new‐onset AF needs to be determined with a larger sample and longer follow‐up time.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Alcohol septal ablation — myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) demonstrates correct versus incorrect septal targeting; opacification of the LV side of the basal septum is "the desired location to induce infarction", whereas RV-side opacification "is not the location that affects dynamic obstruction". Advantages of MCE during alcohol septal ablation include shorter intervention and fluoroscopy times, fewer occluded vessels, smaller amount of ethanol used, smaller infarct size, lower likelihood of heart block, and higher likelihood of success.

### Time course of pressure gradient response after first alcohol septal ablation for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1161bbAm]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) causes remodeling of the upper septum and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) and reduction in the LVOT gradient. The time course of gradient reduction early after ASA has not been established. This study characterized the time course of gradient response early after ASA. Patients underwent clinical assessment and transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and immediately, 3 days, 3 months, and 1 year after ASA. Forty-seven patients underwent ASA. The baseline LVOT gradient was 98 ± 48 mm Hg. Three-month echocardiographic success, defined as ≥ 50% gradient reduction from baseline, was achieved in 41 procedures (87%); thus, there were 6 failures. On the basis of percentage reduction in LVOT gradient at 3 days, 2 distinct subgroups of the success group were identified. These were monophasic success (≥ 50% gradient reduction at 3 days and 3 months, n = 25) and triphasic success (< 50% gradient reduction at 3 days but ≥ 50% gradient reduction at 3 months, n = 16). LVOT gradient in the triphasic success group was similar to that in the failure group at 3 days (81 ± 28 vs 99 ± 31 mm Hg, p = NS) but similar to that of the monophasic success group at 3 months (24 ± 20 vs 12 ± 16 mm Hg, p = NS) and at 1 year (27 ± 24 vs 13 ± 20 mm Hg, p = NS). In conclusion, many patients who undergo ultimately successful ASA demonstrate triphasic LVOT gradient response patterns, with a large gradient 3 days after the procedure.

### Alcohol septal ablation in patients with severe septal hypertrophy [^113bpVGJ]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The current guidelines suggest alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is less effective in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) patients with severe left ventricular hypertrophy, despite acknowledging that systematic data are lacking. Therefore, we analysed patients in the Euro-ASA registry to test this statement.

Methods

We compared the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with basal interventricular septum (IVS) thickness < 30 mm Hg to those with ≥ 30 mm Hg treated using ASA in nine European centres.

Results

A total of 1519 patients (57 ± 14 years, 49% women) with symptomatic HOCM were treated, including 67 (4.4%) patients with IVS thickness ≥ 30mm. The occurrence of short-term major adverse events were similar in both groups. The mean follow-up was 5.4 ± 4.3 years and 5.1 ± 4.1 years, and the all-cause mortality rate was 2.57 and 2.94 deaths per 100 person-years of follow-up in the IVS < 30mm group and the IVS ≥ 30mm group (p = 0.047), respectively. There were no differences in dyspnoea (New York Heart Association class III/IV 12% vs 16%), residual left ventricular outflow tract gradient (16 ± 20 vs 16 ± 16mm Hg) and repeated septal reduction procedures (12% vs 18%) in the IVS < 30mm group and IVS ≥ 30mm group, respectively (p = NS for all).

Conclusions

The short-term results and the long-term relief of dyspnoea, residual left ventricular outflow obstruction and occurrence of repeated septal reduction procedures in patients with basal IVS ≥ 30 mm is similar to those with IVS < 30mm. However, long-term all-cause and cardiac mortality rates are worse in the ≥ 30 mm group.

Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Ventricular Tachycardia After Alcohol Septal Ablation. A 76-year-old female developed 2 different ventricular tachycardias (VTs) 5 years after alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. VT#1 was a small macroreentry at the anterior border of the low-voltage zone, suggesting the ASA-scar and eliminated by endocardial ablation at a site recording fractionated potentials covering the mid-diastolic and presystolic periods. VT#2 was a focal VT and eliminated by epicardial cryoablation at the basal posterior left ventricle, suggesting the posterior border of the ASA-scar. Using the electroanatomical mapping, we demonstrated that the mechanism of the VTs was reentry at the edge of the ASA-scar.

### Predictors of outcome after alcohol septal ablation therapy in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^114QKMZ1]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) therapy results in clinical and hemodynamic improvement in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. However, a subset remains symptomatic afterward, requiring additional procedures. We sought to examine the determinants of an unsatisfactory outcome, defined as unchanged symptoms with < 50% reduction of baseline left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient.

Methods and Results

Of 173 consecutive hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy patients who underwent ASA, 39 had an unsatisfactory outcome after the first procedure. Patients with an unsatisfactory outcome had a higher baseline LVOT gradient, fewer septal arteries injected with ethanol, lower peak creatine kinase (CK), smaller septal area opacified by contrast echocardiography, and higher residual gradient in the catheterization laboratory after ASA (all P < 0.05). Symptoms, septal thickness, mitral regurgitation severity, and ventricular function were not determinants of outcome. On multiple logistic regression, LVOT gradient reduction after ASA in the catheterization laboratory to ≥ 25 mm Hg (OR, 5.5; P = 0.01) and peak CK < 1300 U/L (OR, 2.5; P = 0.04) were the independent predictors of an unsatisfactory outcome.

Conclusions

The residual LVOT gradient in the catheterization laboratory and peak CK leak after ASA are the independent predictors of ASA outcome.

### Hemodynamic predictors of outcome following alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^1128E2DP]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is a minimally invasive treatment for drug-refractory obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Detailed assessment of pressure changes and predictors of mortality and procedure success are not well defined.

Methods

This is a single-center study evaluating pressure changes and predictors of mortality and procedure success in transseptal ASA. Survival analysis and predictors of mortality were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression, respectively.

Results

A total of 156 patients were included (mean age, 67.3 years; 46.8% women). Left atrial (LA) pressure and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient decreased, whereas aortic pulse pressure (PP) increased post-ASA. Patients with lower baseline mean LA pressure (< median, 19 mmHg), LVOT gradient reduction > 82% (gradient change median), and PP increase > 19% (PP change median) had superior survival. On Cox univariable regression, baseline mean LA pressure > median (19 mmHg; hazard ratio [HR], 2.09 [95% CI, 1.05–4.18]; P = 0.036), residual LVOT gradient (HR, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01–1.03]; P = 0.003), and LVOT gradient percent reduction < median (82%; HR, 2.92 [95% CI, 1.46–5.83]; P = 0.002) were predictors of mortality. When adjusting for age and sex, baseline LA v wave > median (28 mmHg; HR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.17–4.76]; P = 0.016), baseline mean LA pressure > median (19 mmHg; HR, 2.70 [95% CI, 1.33–5.50]; P = 0.006), percentage reduction in gradient < median (82%; HR, 2.74 [CI, 1.37–5.50]; P = 0.005), and percentage increase in PP < median (19.3%; HR, 2.09 [CI, 1.05–4.16]; P = 0.035) predicted survival free of all-cause mortality.

Conclusions

ASA is associated with an acute decrease in the LVOT gradient and LA pressures and increase in aortic PP. Mean LA pressure, percentage decrease in LVOT gradient, and increase in PP are strong predictors of survival free of all-cause mortality following ASA and are important variables for procedural guidance.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a comparison with medical therapy [^1132jXpQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

This study firstly reported the efficacy of ASA used for mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM in China. Moreover, the efficacy comparison between ASA and medical groups was also revealed. The principal findings of this study are as follows: (1) Survival free of all‐cause mortality and survival free of HCM‐related death after ASA is similar to that of patients treated with medical therapy. (2) Compared to medical therapy, ASA has advantages on the improvement of NYHA class and the mean reduction of LVOT gradient, with a lower occurrence of new‐onset AF. (3) All‐cause mortality is independently associated with resting LVOT gradient at the last clinical check‐up.

Currently, ASA is predominantly recommended for highly symptomatic patients with HOCM, achieving long‐term benefits in several previous studies. Scarce evidence supported the clinical application of ASA procedure in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients. Recently, the result was reported based on Euro‐ASA registry that long‐term survival after ASA in mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM was similar to the expected survival of an age‐ and sex‐matched general population (p = 0.62) and patients treated with ASA had LVOT gradient reduction and symptomatic relief with a low risk of developing heart failure. However, the perspective that positive implementation of invasive therapy in mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM has not been clear and further related research is needed. The results of the current study (mean age at ASA 48 years) demonstrate that survival free of all‐cause mortality is 98.3% at 5 years and 95.1% at 10 years after ASA, compared with the Euro‐ASA registry study(mean age at ASA 53 years) with survival rate of 94% and 87% at 5 and 10 years after ASA in mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM, respectively, and their patients are older than those included in the present study. Although overall survival of patients enrolled in our study was not compared with the age‐ and sex‐matched Chinese general population, overall survival at 5 and 10 years after ASA was higher than the survival reported by Sorajja et al.in 544 asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM, who did not undergo septal reduction therapy (98.3% and 95.1% vs. 85.8% and 69.3% at 5 and 10 years, respectively). Furthermore, survival rate at 5 and 10 years after ASA in the present study was also higher than the survival reported by Veselka et al.in highly symptomatic patients treated with ASA(89.0% and 77.0% at 5 and 10 years after ASA, respectively). These findings described above may suggest the significance of timely ASA treatment for maximally improving long‐term survival in mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM intolerant to medical therapy. Different from other relevant studies, this study evaluated the efficacy difference between ASA and medical therapy in mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM. The results suggest that survival free of all‐cause mortality and survival free of HCM‐related death after ASA is comparable to that of patients in the medical group, while ASA is in a favorable position on the improvement of NYHA class and lower occurrence of new‐onset AF.

### Hemodynamic predictors of outcome following alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^1162qzdm]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Prior studies have demonstrated that increases in LVOT gradient post-ASA predicted higher all-cause mortalityand conversely that significant reductions in the LVOT gradient immediately post-ASA and during long-term follow-up predicted improved clinical outcomes. – Our study is in agreement with those findings but also found that all-cause mortality post-ASA was more reliably predicted by the percentage change in LVOT gradient compared with the residual LVOT gradient alone, likely because baseline LVOT gradient is factored into the percentage change LVOT gradient. Baseline LVOT gradient severity may reflect underlying HCM severity and thus contribute to the degree of benefit provided by septal reduction therapy. In contrast, patient baseline hemodynamics are unaccounted for by only using the residual post-ASA LVOT gradient.

LA pressure measurement has an increasing role in guiding mitral valve interventions, as prior studies have demonstrated an association between reduction in LA pressures and improved outcomes in survival and symptoms. In patients with HCM, increases in LA pressure and volume occur secondary to diastolic dysfunction, which may be mediated, in part, by the dynamic LVOTO and mitral regurgitation. Despite the alcohol-induced localized myocardial infarction, which might be expected to increase LA pressure by associated impairment in LV function, mean LA pressure uniformly decreased by a small degree in this study, likely due to reduction in LVOT gradient and degree of mitral regurgitation. In our study, percentage change in LA pressures did not predict all-cause mortality; however, baseline LA v wave and mean pressures were significant predictors of mortality in the multivariable Cox regression model. Yang et alfound that LA enlargement was associated with worse outcomes in HCM patients and associated with a higher incidence of mitral regurgitation, nonapical hypertrophy, and a higher degree of hypertrophy based on the Wigle score. In transcatheter mitral interventions, LA pressures may be more directly affected by the regurgitant flow and often decrease to a greater degree, which may explain why the reduction in LA pressure is associated with better outcomes in these populations; however, this is not well studied in patients with HCM. Sorajja et alshowed that patients with higher reduction in gradient post-ASA have better myocardial relaxation and improvement in LA pressure. However, 50% (n = 20) of the included patients had an increase in LA pressure post-ASA. The abnormalities in left-sided filling pressures in HCM occur due to multitude of interconnected factors, including diastolic dysfunction and myocardial stiffness, mitral regurgitation, increased afterload, dyssynchrony, and fibrosis. Post-ASA, while the gradient and afterload decrease, myocardial stiffness likely increases due to the localized infarction. These factors could suggest why intraprocedural changes in LA pressures were relatively small and did not predict mortality as opposed to baseline mean LA pressure or the changes in gradient or PP.

Background

A 42-year-old woman with a 20-year history of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was referred for alcohol septal ablation following a worsening of symptoms, which had persisted despite medical treatment.

Investigations

Physical examination, electrocardiography, rest-exercise Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography, coronary angiography, intracoronary myocardial contrast echocardiography, and intraoperative transesophageal and epicardial echocardiography.

Diagnosis

Symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Management

The patient was deemed unsuitable for alcohol septal ablation and underwent surgical myectomy guided by intraoperative echocardiography.

### Meta-analyses of septal reduction therapies for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: comparative rates of overall mortality and sudden cardiac death after treatment [^112TdYgZ]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Septal reduction for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be performed by surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation (ASA). Unlike surgical myectomy, ASA creates an intramyocardial scar that may potentiate the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD).

Methods and Results

Systematic reviews for ASA and surgical myectomy were performed. Study selection and data extraction were completed independently by 2 investigators. Comparative data analyses were completed using a random effects model and regression analysis. Kappa statistics for agreement on initial study inclusion were high for both ASA (0.78; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.88) and surgical myectomy studies (0.95; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.0). Nineteen ASA studies (2207 patients) and 8 surgical myectomy studies (1887 patients) were included. Median follow-up was shorter for ASA than for myectomy studies (51 versus 1266 patient-years; P < 0.001). For ASA and surgical myectomy, unadjusted rates (events/patient-years) of all-cause mortality (0.021 versus 0.018, respectively; P = 0.37) and SCD (0.004 versus 0.003, respectively; P = 0.36) were similar. Patients treated with ASA were older (weighted mean, 55 versus 44 years; P < 0.001) and had less septal hypertrophy (weighted mean, 21 versus 23 mm; P < 0.001) compared with those treated with myectomy. After adjustment for available baseline characteristics, odds ratios for treatment effect on all-cause mortality and SCD were 0.28 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.46) and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.97), respectively, favoring ASA.

Conclusions

Rates of all-cause mortality and SCD after both ASA and surgical myectomy were similarly low. Adjusted for baseline characteristics, the odds ratios for treatment effect on all-cause mortality and SCD were lower in ASA cohorts compared with surgical myectomy cohorts.

### Syndrome of reversible cardiogenic shock and left ventricular ballooning in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^112FDRUH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

One patient had "bail‐out" alcohol septal ablation performed because multisystem failure precluded myectomy. Because alcohol ablation causes a septal infarct, there is the potential for exacerbating hemodynamic instability. Also, surgery provides immediate and reliable relief of obstruction, compared with ablation, which may require weeks for effect. For these reasons, we recommend surgery over alcohol ablation. The institution of cardiopulmonary bypass itself can reverse the ischemic process. Indeed, in 2 patients, after the bypass run and abolishing outflow obstruction, we observed improvement in LV function almost immediately. Although there is understandable reticence to operate on patients with acute myocardial ischemia, cardiogenic shock, and systemic acidosis, when pharmacotherapy fails to reverse shock, surgical intervention is necessary. Indeed, this clinical scenario is one of the few in HCM requiring emergent surgical intervention. When LV outflow gradients cause obstruction and ballooning, the patients with HCM may be confused with the larger group of patients with non‐HCM Takotsubo syndrome. In this clinical scenario, decisions must be made in hours, often in the emergency department, and misdiagnosis of the true pathophysiology can result in fatal missteps, underscoring the need for a prepared team. Familiarity with the many anatomic variants found in HCM, particularly of the mitral valve, can speed recognition. Figure S1 summarizes our recommended approach for these critically ill patients.

We acknowledge the possibility of publication bias; patients who do not do well may not be the subject of case reports, and patients who have succumbed from this syndrome may not have come to our attention. We also acknowledge that natural history of LV ballooning syndrome often results in spontaneous and complete resolution. We believe this would not have been the case for our patients who required mechanical support and septal reduction who were in extremis before their interventions.

### Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: comparison of outcomes after myectomy or alcohol ablation adjusted by propensity score [^1118vtw6]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

In November 1998, our center began offering alcohol ablation as an alternative to surgical myectomy for patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Patients with concomitant lesions were referred for surgical intervention, and the others were offered either treatment option. We sought to review the early outcomes for both protocols.

Methods

One hundred fifty patients had intervention for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy to June 30, 2003. Sixty patients elected to have alcohol ablation, and 5 crossed over to surgical intervention. A total of 95 patients had a myectomy. Patients having an isolated myectomy (n = 48) are compared with those who had an ablation. Hospital records were reviewed, and follow-up contact (mean, 2.2 years) with the patient or referring cardiologist and recent echocardiographic reports were obtained. Differences in clinical and hemodynamic outcomes between achieved treatment groups were compared after adjustment for differing baseline patient characteristics, including use of a propensity score, to adjust for the non-randomization.

Results

The patients undergoing alcohol ablation (n = 60) were older (58 vs 48 years) and had fewer associated lesions (1 vs 39 patients), lower pressure gradients (67 vs 73 mm Hg), and similar symptomatic status and degrees of mitral regurgitation compared with those in the myectomy group. Alcohol ablation was abandoned in 6 patients, 5 of whom underwent myectomy. Among the completed alcohol ablations, there were 5 late deaths, and 1 other patient was referred for myectomy. One late death occurred after myectomy. At latest follow-up, 3-year survival is 97%, and 92% of the patients are in New York Heart Association class II or I. Adjusted comparisons showed significantly lower postintervention left ventricular outflow gradients at rest in the myectomy group (5 vs 15 mm Hg), with provocation (14 vs 42 mm Hg), mitral systolic anterior motion (67% vs 29%), and New York Heart Association class. No significant difference was present in postintervention septal thickness or freedom from postintervention pacing, although in time-related analysis, the 3-year freedom from pacing is 88% versus 59% (P = 0.02), favoring myectomy.

Conclusion

Either alcohol ablation or myectomy offers substantial clinical improvement for patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Hemodynamic resolution of the obstruction and its sequelae is more complete with myectomy. Residual lesions after alcohol ablation might affect longer-term outcomes.

1 Introduction

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) was first described by Gunnar Berghöfer in the 1980s and first implemented by German cardiologist Ulrich Sigwart. Today, ASA is a minimally invasive procedure that involves coronary injection of absolute alcohol, resulting in a controlled, irreversible myocardial infarction of the basal aspect of the interventricular septum with the goal of reducing the hypertrophic myocardium into an akinetic scar, thereby reducing left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. Several studies have validated this procedure's efficacy and safety. The key to successful ASA is identification of the coronary arteries that supply the basal septum; these are often the first septal branches which in 90% of cases originate from the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. However, variation in the size and origin of the first septal branch exists. In this case report, we describe a 75‐year‐old female with HOCM who underwent successful ASA via an aberrantly originating septal artery from the ramus intermedius.

### Outcomes of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy patients undergoing alcohol septal ablation with a standard 3 mL dose of ethanol: focus on long-term safety [^112MzEDL]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this research was to assess the long-term results of alcohol septal ablation in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), with all of them receiving a standard 3mL ethanol dose.

Background

Generally, ethanol (0.5–3 mL) is infused depending on a septal artery width or interventricular septum (IVS) thickness during alcohol septal ablation. We injected 3 mL of ethanol irrespective of IVS thickness or perforator width in all cases.

Methods

Between 2000 and 2017, 150 HOCM patients (78 males, 72 females) underwent alcohol septal ablation procedures. In all cases we intentionally used the constant dose of ethanol (3 mL). The median of age was 52 (interquartile range: 41–60) years.

Results

The median of follow-up was 71 (interquartile range: 36–110) months. Hospital mortality was 0.67% (one patient died of sepsis). Perioperative high-grade atrioventricular blocks required permanent pacemaker implantations-18 (12%). Long-term survival rates were as follows: 95.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.7–97.5%), 85.8% (95% CI: 83.7–87.0%), and 81.7% (95% CI: 79.7–83.7%) at 5-, 10-, and 15-year follow-up, respectively. One-sample log-rank test revealed no significant differences in 15-year survival rates between the alcohol septal ablation cohort and age- and sex-matched Russian population.

Conclusions

Alcohol septal ablation with the standard (3 mL) ethanol dose is safe and efficient. Survival rates after alcohol septal ablation are comparable with those in age- and sex-matched general Russian population.

### Novel techniques for alcohol septal ablation in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with complex anatomy: a case series [^116naJce]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Learning Objectives

1 This case series introduces three novel ASA techniques — the double balloon, perfusion balloon and microcatheter, and balloon screen techniques — to overcome anatomical challenges in HOCM.
2 These novel techniques expand the applicability of ASA to cases with complex septal branch anatomy, including hairpin curves, extremely small branches, and acute angle bifurcations, which pose difficulties for conventional ASA.
3 In three patients with drug‐refractory HOCM, the application of these novel techniques resulted in a significant reduction in LVOT PGs and an improvement in symptoms.
4 Cautious patient selection, detailed preprocedural planning with comprehensive angiographic and echocardiographic assessments, and performance in centers with significant ASA experience are crucial for the safe and effective implementation of these techniques.

### Echocardiography-guided interventions [^11142qua]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2009). Medium credibility.

Alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) — TEE is the conventional approach for intraprocedural echocardiographic monitoring of transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy for HOCM, some laboratories prefer TEE because it provides more precise imaging of the subaortic anatomy of the left ventricle than TTE, and ICE is a third imaging alternative for use during this procedure. Perhaps the most important modification has been the use of myocardial contrast echocardiography to delineate the vascular distribution of the individual septal perforator branches of the left anterior descending artery, and the use of contrast echocardiography is paramount to the success of this procedure. To determine correct target vessel selection, intraprocedural myocardial contrast echocardiography should be performed, and after verification of correct balloon position and the hemodynamic effect of balloon occlusion, 1 to 2 mL of diluted echocardiographic contrast agent followed by a 1-mL to 2-mL saline flush is injected. A radiographic contrast agent may be used to demonstrate the perfusion territory supplied by the chosen septal perforator as an alternative to the use of an ultrasound contrast agent.

### Two-year results of percutaneous endocardial septal radiofrequency ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy [^117MsgXR]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by unevenly increased left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (> 15 mm) in the absence of hypertension or significant valvular disease. Approximately 70% of HCM patients experience left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) at rest or upon exercise provocation, leading to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Conventionally, HOCM is defined by an instantaneous Doppler‐measured left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOTG) of ≥ 30 mmHg, and invasive treatment is considered at a threshold of 50 mmHg or higher. HOCM patients with elevated LVOTG are at increased risk of developing progressive heart failure (HF) symptoms and HF‐related mortality. Although current guidelines advocate for the use of medication therapy — including β‐blockers and non‐dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers as class I indications — these treatments often fail to manage symptoms in most patients adequately. For HOCM patients who present with symptoms despite receiving β‐blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, a myosin inhibitor, disopyramide, or septal reduction therapy [surgical myectomy (SM) or alcohol septal ablation (ASA)] is recommended to alleviate severe LVOTO. Nonetheless, SM involves significant risks, including an increased risk of atrioventricular block and extended patient recovery periods. Furthermore, the applicability of the ASA is limited by the septal coronary anatomy.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely used to treat cardiac arrhythmias for several decades. Percutaneous endocardial septal radiofrequency ablation (PESA) represents an innovative approach that uses high‐temperature energy to create necrotic areas in the ventricular septum for a reduction in systolic excursion of the myocardium and septum, and its clinical application for HOCM has increased in recent years. In this study, we present the outcomes following PESA for HOCM.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Radiofrequency septal ablation allows significant reduction in the LOVT gradient and symptomatic improvement of patients with HOCM. Although further study is required, this novel technique is safe and effective, which makes it a promising alternative approach in the treatment of patients who are unsuitable for undergoing myectomy or ASA.

### American Society of Echocardiography clinical recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: endorsed by the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, and Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^113nkeHB]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2011). Medium credibility.

Alcohol septal ablation — intraprocedural echocardiography and complementary imaging: A short-axis view can assess possible perfusion of papillary muscles or the right ventricle, and the deep transgastric TEE view is useful for measuring the intracavitary gradient though more challenging than TTE. Intracardiac imaging provides high-quality near-field imaging and 3D echocardiography can provide additional information, but the added benefit of 3D TEE during alcohol ablation has not yet been defined. Intraprocedural echocardiography is useful for evaluating results, with the basal septum infarcted by alcohol typically intensely echo dense, reduced thickening and excursion, reduction or elimination of mitral regurgitation when due to SAM, and elimination or reduction of dynamic obstruction.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Recommendations and key points — procedural imaging priorities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: for patients on oral allosteric modulators of cardiac β-myosin, monitoring of LVEF is essential to avoid the development of heart failure due to reduced EF. Intraoperative TEE plays a critical role in guiding the management of HCM patients undergoing surgical myectomy. Myocardial contrast echocardiography plays a critical role in intraprocedural guidance of alcohol septal ablation. TEE is critical for intraprocedural guidance of TEER to treat obstructive HCM patients who are not candidates for septal reduction therapy.

Left Ventricular Function and Outflow Obstruction

ASA was associated with a significant reduction of the proximal interventricular septum diameter, a decrease in LVOT gradients, and a reduced volume of the left atrium (Table 2). The LVOT gradients after ASA were reduced by 65% at rest (49 [IQR, 24–90] mm Hg versus 17 [IQR, 14–27] mm Hg; P < 0.01) and by 51% during the Valsalva maneuver (102 [IQR, 78–139] mm Hg versus 52 [IQR, 34–90] mm Hg; P < 0.001). In total, 79% of patients presented with a resting LVOT gradient < 30 mm Hg after ASA treatment. During peak exercise, the reduction in gradients was 29% (45 [IQR, 29–90] mm Hg versus 32 [IQR, 21–61] mm Hg; P = 0.02), and after a recovery of 5 minutes, it was reduced by 71% (96 [IQR, 34–161] mm Hg versus 28 [IQR, 21–62] mm Hg; P < 0.01; Figure 3). The degree of mitral valve regurgitation was also significantly reduced, with 50% having moderate to severe regurgitation before ASA, compared with 17% after ASA (P = 0.046). The systolic function assessed by LV ejection fraction remained unaffected by the procedure (P = 0.52). ASA was associated with a significant reduction in left atrial volume (−9 mL/m 2 [95% CI, −15 to −3 mL/m 2]; P < 0.01).

### Short-and long-term outcomes of alcohol septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in patients with mild left ventricular hypertrophy: a propensity score matching analysis [^112J8TD1]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Based on European guidelines, alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is indicated only in patients with interventricular septum (IVS) thickness > 16mm. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcomes in ASA patients with mild hypertrophy (IVS ≤ 16mm).

Methods and Results

We retrospectively evaluated 1505 consecutive ASA patients and used propensity score to match 172 pairs (344 patients) in groups IVS ≤ 16mm or IVS > 16mm. There was no occurrence of post-ASA ventriculoseptal defect in the whole cohort (n = 1505). Matched patients had 30-day mortality rate 0% in IVS ≤ 16mm group and 0.6% in IVS > 16mm group (P = 1). Patients in IVS ≤ 16mm group had more ASA-attributable early complications (16% vs. 9%; P = 0.049), which was driven by higher need for pacemaker implantation (13% vs. 8%; P = 0.22). The mean follow-up was 5.4 ± 4.3years and the annual all-cause mortality rate was 1.8 and 3.2 deaths per 100-patient-years in IVS ≤ 16 group and IVS > 16 group, respectively (log-rank test P = 0.04). There were no differences in symptom relief and left ventricular (LV) gradient reduction. Patients with IVS ≤ 16mm had less repeated septal reduction procedures (log-rank test P = 0.03).

Conclusion

Selected patients with HOCM and mild hypertrophy (IVS ≤ 16mm) had more early post-ASA complications driven by need for pacemaker implantation, but their long-term survival is better than in patients with IVS > 16mm. While relief of symptoms and LV obstruction reduction is similar in both groups, a need for repeat septal reduction is higher in patients with IVS > 16mm.

### Outcome of alcohol septal ablation in mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: a comparison with medical therapy [^111PvUs9]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

The aim of this study was primarily to determine efficacy after alcohol septal ablation (ASA) in mildly symptomatic patients (NYHA class II) with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), as compared to medical therapy.

Methods

This retrospective study included 163 mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM evaluated in Beijing Anzhen Hospital between March 2001 and August 2019, consisting of the medical group (n = 105) and the ASA group (n = 58). All‐cause mortality and HCM‐related death were mainly observed.

Results

Follow‐up was completed in 161 patients and the median follow‐up was 6.0 years. Compared to medically treated patients, patients post‐ASA had comparable survival free of all‐cause mortality (98.3% and 95.1% vs. 93.0% and 83.1% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.374). Survival free of HCM‐related death was also similar between ASA and medical groups (98.3% and 95.1% vs. 94.3% and 86.2% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.608). However, compared to medical therapy, ASA had advantages on the improvement of NYHA class (1.4 ± 0.6 vs. 2.1 ± 0.5, p = .000) and lower occurrence of new‐onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (7.8% vs. 20.4%, p = .048). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that resting LVOT gradient at the last clinical check‐up was an independent predictor of all‐cause mortality (HR = 1.021, 95%CI 1.002–1.040, p = .027).

Conclusion

This registry suggests that mildly symptomatic patients with HOCM treated with ASA have comparable survival to that of medically treated patients, with the improvement of NYHA class and lower occurrence of new‐onset AF. All‐cause mortality is independently associated with resting LVOT gradient at the last clinical check‐up.

### Novel techniques for alcohol septal ablation in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with complex anatomy: a case series [^112fm2Xs]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Conclusion

The double balloon, perfusion balloon with microcatheter, and balloon screen techniques represent significant advancements in ASA for HOCM. These methods expand the applicability of this minimally invasive procedure to patients with challenging septal branch anatomy, who were previously considered unsuitable candidates. While these results are encouraging, it is imperative that these techniques be applied cautiously. This includes careful patient selection, detailed preprocedural planning with comprehensive angiographic and echocardiographic assessments, and performance in centers with significant ASA experience. Intraprocedural imaging, particularly TTE, plays a critical role in ensuring adequate ablation and monitoring for complications. As we continue to refine and evaluate these methods, they have the potential to significantly impact HOCM management (Central Illustration 1).

### Guideline-based referral for septal reduction therapy in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with excellent clinical outcomes [^111EZgXk]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The outcome of medically refractory patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treated according to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association consensus guideline recommendations is not known. The objectives of this study were to define the short- and long-term outcomes of medically refractory obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients undergoing alcohol septal ablation (ASA) and surgical septal myectomy (SM) with patient management in accordance with these consensus guidelines, as well as to quantify procedural risk and burden of comorbid conditions at the time of treatment.

Methods and Results

Patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy referred for either ASA or SM from 2004 to 2015 were followed for the primary end point of short- and long-term mortality and compared with respective age- and sex-matched US populations. Of 477 consecutive severely symptomatic patients, 99 underwent ASA and 378 SM. Compared with SM, ASA patients were older (P < 0.001), had a higher burden of comorbid conditions (P < 0.01), and significantly higher predicted surgical mortality (P < 0.005). Procedure-related mortality was 0.3% and similarly low in both groups (0% in ASA and 0.8% in SM). Over 4.0 ± 2.9 years of follow-up, 95% of patients had substantial improvement in heart failure symptoms to New York Heart Association class I/II (96% in SM and 90% in ASA). Long-term mortality was similar between the 2 groups with no difference compared with age- and sex-matched US populations.

Conclusions

Guideline-based referral for ASA and SM leads to excellent outcomes with low procedural mortality, excellent long-term survival, and improvement in symptoms. These outcomes occur in ASA patients despite being an older cohort with significantly more comorbidities.

### Percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation in drug-refractory hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy… [^114w8tLb]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

High-frequency alternating current is applied, resulting in irreversible coagulation necrosis of the tissue and regional blood vessels. Basal and mid portions of anterior and posterior septum can be targeted to ensure efficacy. Contrast echocardiography is performed to assess the ablation region, and a comprehensive Doppler assessment is performed to assess hemodynamic improvement. Meaning PIMSRA may be an alternative to surgical intervention in patients who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy. Importance Patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and drug-refractory symptoms and outflow gradients have limited nonsurgical treatment options. The feasibility of percutaneous intramyocardial septal radiofrequency ablation has been reported previously; however, procedural and medium-term outcomes are unknown.

After discussion among the heart team, 40 patients underwent surgical or alcohol septal reduction therapy and 4 required treatment of significant coronary artery disease. Interventions PIMSRA performed in patients. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was 30-day major adverse clinical events: death, emergency surgery, severe effusion requiring intervention, procedure-related stroke, bleeding, and stroke. Secondary outcomes included 30-day technical success and 90-day improvement in outflow obstruction. Conclusions and Relevance This study found that PIMSRA in patients with drug-refractory HOCM may be an effective procedure for relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and symptoms with acceptable complication rates. These results are encouraging and support the design of a randomized clinical trial against well-established septal reduction therapies. hypertrophy with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is the pathophysiologic cause of LVOT obstruction.

4 Although medical treatment with β-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and disopyramide have a class I indication in current guidelines, 1 they are effective in reducing LVOT obstruction in less than 50% of patients resulting in a large patient population with drug-refractory sypmtoms. 5 Therefore, effective ventricular septal reduction with either surgical myectomy or alcohol septal ablation is the main invasive treatment for LVOT obstruction. Nonsurgical septal reduction using alcohol injection into the first major septal artery was developed in 1995 as an alternative to surgery in drug-refractory patients, 20 and ASA has become an acceptable alternative for patients who are not ideal candidates for surgical myectomy. 1, 9 Its main limitation is the reliance on.

### Alcohol septal ablation in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a pilot study… [^114o6Kx7]. ClinicalTrials (2002). Low credibility.

Alcohol Septal Ablation in Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: A Pilot StudyClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This study will test the feasibility of a modified procedure for treating obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Patients with OHC have a thickening of the heart muscle that obstructs blood flow out of the heart, causing breathlessness, chest pain, palpitations, tiredness, lightheadedness, and fainting. The current treatment for OHC is a procedure called alcohol septal ablation, which involves injecting a small amount of alcohol into a tiny artery that supplies the part of muscle causing blood flow obstruction. The success of PTSA is limited, however, by problems of heart anatomy and the ability to find the appropriate artery to inject. Modifying the procedure by injecting the alcohol through the wall of the lower right chamber of the heart may improve its safety and effectiveness.

The new technique requires positioning a catheter into the appropriate area of the heart. This study will test the ability to accurately guide the catheter to that area. Patients with OHC 18 years of age and older who are scheduled to have a cardiac catheterization may be eligible for this study. At the end of the catheterization procedure, participants will undergo intra-cardiac echocardiographic imaging. For this test, one of the catheters placed in the femoral artery for cardiac catheterization will be substituted for a larger one. Through this catheter, a special catheter will be introduced and advanced to the heart to provide images. This pilot feasibility study does not involve injection of alcohol.
