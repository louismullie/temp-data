## Question

Can tygacil and fosfomycin be used

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether tigecycline (Tygacil) and fosfomycin can be used, including when, how, and with what cautions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled indications of each agent. Then, I should verify safety signals, especially tigecycline's mortality warning and fosfomycin's sodium load. Next, I will review guideline positions for resistant Gram-negative infections, including CRE, CRAB, and ESBL-E. After that, I need to check dosing nuances and whether combination therapy is preferred. Finally, I will examine drug–drug interactions and special populations before synthesizing a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the agents and their core profiles. Tigecycline is a glycylcycline with broad activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, and many anaerobes, but it lacks reliable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and has low serum concentrations, which limits utility in bacteremia and urinary tract infections [^5c63f3e2] [^7f34872f]. Fosfomycin is a phosphonic acid antibiotic that inhibits an early step in peptidoglycan synthesis, achieves high urinary concentrations, and retains activity against many ESBL- and some carbapenem-resistant organisms, though susceptibility testing can be unreliable and resistance can emerge on therapy [^f6c8acd4] [^2e6ab8e2].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled indications before moving to off-label use. Tigecycline is FDA-approved for complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia; it is not approved for hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or bloodstream infections, and carries a boxed warning for increased all-cause mortality observed in pooled analyses [^0e10e5c4] [^7706d689] [^29d95cdb]. Fosfomycin tromethamol is FDA-approved for uncomplicated cystitis as a single 3 g oral dose; intravenous fosfomycin is not currently FDA-approved in the United States, though it has been studied and used internationally for complicated infections, including cUTI and bacteremia, with a recent randomized trial showing noninferiority to ceftriaxone or meropenem for MDR E. coli bacteremic UTI [^4fa57258] [^09b7dda7] [^213c65ec].

> Hold on, I should verify the safety signals that will shape risk–benefit decisions. Tigecycline has a consistent signal of higher all-cause mortality across meta-analyses and randomized trials, with an absolute risk difference around 0.6% and particular vulnerability in hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, where cure rates are lower and mortality higher compared with comparators; nausea and vomiting are common and can be dose-limiting, and pancreatitis, hepatic dysfunction, and coagulopathy have been reported [^29d95cdb] [^b7edf0e9] [^845d1db2] [^28e4a355]. Fosfomycin is generally well tolerated, but the IV formulation contains substantial sodium load and can precipitate heart failure in susceptible patients; resistance emergence during monotherapy is a recognized risk, especially in high-burden infections [^2e6ab8e2] [^d92877b3].

> Next, I should review guideline positions for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. IDSA recommends avoiding tigecycline for CRE bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections due to low serum and urine concentrations and the mortality signal; tigecycline may be considered as an alternative for intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissue, osteomyelitis, or respiratory infections when β-lactam options are not suitable, and if used, high-dose regimens are suggested to mitigate underexposure [^2546873c] [^ab3cb08a]. ESCMID similarly advises against tigecycline for BSI and HAP/VAP and allows consideration of high-dose tigecycline for pneumonia only when necessary, again emphasizing combination therapy in severe disease [^62b6fa24]. For fosfomycin, IDSA does not suggest fosfomycin for CRE pyelonephritis or cUTI because of limited renal parenchymal concentrations, reserving it for select scenarios when no better options exist and typically in combination to mitigate resistance [^fca0c1f6].

> I will now examine carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, where options are constrained. IDSA recommends combination therapy for CRAB and suggests high-dose minocycline or high-dose tigecycline as components, with a preference for minocycline due to more experience and available breakpoints; fosfomycin is not suggested for CRAB because of limited activity and lack of supportive data in this pathogen [^4cdc591c] [^e3cf4e44] [^0ec19d7c]. Let me reconsider the dosing nuance: when tigecycline is used for CRAB, high-dose regimens are favored to overcome pharmacokinetic limitations, though this does not negate the general caution against its use in bacteremia or pneumonia when alternatives exist [^30eb1b71].

> For ESBL-producing Enterobacterales, I should confirm where tigecycline and fosfomycin fit. IDSA guidance prioritizes TMP-SMX, fluoroquinolones, or carbapenems for ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI when susceptible, with aminoglycosides as alternatives; fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI because of limited tissue penetration, and tigecycline is not recommended for UTIs due to low urinary concentrations [^868445cc] [^fca0c1f6]. In lower-tract UTIs, oral fosfomycin remains a reasonable option for cystitis, including cases caused by ESBL E. coli, given high urinary concentrations and low resistance in some regions, though stewardship and susceptibility confirmation are essential [^3374a380] [^4fa57258].

> Let me think about dosing strategies that align with the evidence. For tigecycline, standard dosing is 100 mg IV loading then 50 mg IV every 12 hours; however, for severe MDR infections, many experts use high-dose regimens of 200 mg IV loading followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours, recognizing that this is off-label and supported by limited clinical data and pharmacodynamic rationale rather than definitive mortality benefit [^4fa57258] [^30eb1b71]. For fosfomycin, when used IV for systemic infections, typical dosing is 4 g every 6 hours, with attention to renal function and sodium load; in the randomized trial for MDR E. coli bacteremic UTI, IV fosfomycin was noninferior to ceftriaxone or meropenem, supporting its role as a carbapenem-sparing option in select cases [^09b7dda7] [^213c65ec].

> I should confirm the stance on combination therapy versus monotherapy. Across resistant Gram-negative infections, particularly CRE and CRAB, guidelines favor combination regimens to broaden activity, prevent resistance, and overcome suboptimal pharmacodynamics of single agents; tigecycline and fosfomycin are most often used as parts of combinations rather than as sole therapy in severe disease, with the caveat that evidence quality varies and decisions should be individualized to susceptibilities and clinical context [^2546873c] [^62b6fa24] [^38636994]. But wait, what if fosfomycin is used alone? Resistance emergence is a real risk with fosfomycin monotherapy in high-burden infections, so if used, it should be short-course and ideally paired with another active agent when feasible [^d92877b3] [^2e6ab8e2].

> Next, I should review special populations and drug–drug interactions. Tigecycline requires dose reduction in severe hepatic impairment and should be avoided in pregnancy due to tetracycline-class effects on fetal development; it is not recommended in children under 8 years, and breastfeeding should be interrupted during therapy and for several half-lives after the last dose [^bd018514] [^beeb4408] [^296466df]. Fosfomycin's sodium load mandates caution in heart failure and hypertension, and renal function should guide dosing and monitoring; no clinically meaningful CYP-mediated interactions are expected with tigecycline, though P-gp modulation is theoretically possible and has not translated into consistent clinical effects [^9dc0d823] [^2e6ab8e2].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. Yes, tigecycline and fosfomycin can be used, but their roles are narrow and context-specific: tigecycline is a last-resort agent for selected MDR intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissue, osteomyelitis, or respiratory infections when β-lactams are unsuitable, ideally at high dose and in combination, and should be avoided for bacteremia and UTIs; fosfomycin is useful for uncomplicated cystitis and, when available intravenously, can be considered for select complicated infections including MDR E. coli bacteremic UTI, preferably in combination and with attention to sodium load and resistance risk [^2546873c] [^ab3cb08a] [^09b7dda7] [^2e6ab8e2]. I should double-check that this aligns with the boxed warning and guideline hierarchy: it does, with the caveat that all decisions must be anchored to culture and susceptibility data and local antibiograms to minimize harm and resistance selection [^7706d689] [^2546873c].

---

Tigecycline (Tygacil) and fosfomycin can be used together when treating **multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections** (e.g. CRE, CRAB) when no better options exist, as there is **no direct pharmacokinetic interaction** between them [^9977ec83]. Tigecycline is reserved for severe infections due to its **boxed mortality warning** [^7706d689] and should be dosed high (200 mg load, then 100 mg every 12 hours) when used for CRE or CRAB [^2546873c] [^30eb1b71]. Fosfomycin is typically combined to reduce resistance risk, especially in high-burden infections [^d92877b3] [^2e6ab8e2]. Monitor for clinical response, adverse effects (notably GI upset with tigecycline and sodium load with IV fosfomycin), and resistance emergence [^845d1db2] [^2e6ab8e2].

---

## Pharmacological compatibility and interactions

- **Pharmacokinetic compatibility**: Tigecycline and fosfomycin have distinct mechanisms and pathways, with no known direct pharmacokinetic interaction [^9977ec83].

- **Clinical compatibility**: Both are used in combination for MDR Gram-negative infections, particularly CRE and CRAB, when first-line agents are unsuitable or unavailable [^2546873c] [^4cdc591c].

---

## Clinical indications for combination therapy

- **Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE)**: Tigecycline is an alternative for intra-abdominal, skin/soft tissue, osteomyelitis, or respiratory infections when β-lactams are not active or tolerated; fosfomycin is often added to reduce resistance emergence [^2546873c] [^ab3cb08a].

- **Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB)**: High-dose tigecycline (200 mg load, then 100 mg every 12 hours) is recommended in combination with at least one other agent; fosfomycin may be considered when active [^4cdc591c] [^e3cf4e44].

- **Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) infections**: Combination therapy is standard to broaden coverage and limit resistance [^7243d24d].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

Evidence is largely from observational studies and expert opinion; **randomized data are limited**. Observational data suggest combination regimens including tigecycline and fosfomycin improve outcomes in severe MDR infections, though heterogeneity and confounding limit certainty [^5fbcb280] [^ee2f3f61]. Expert guidelines endorse combination therapy for CRE and CRAB when options are limited, reflecting consensus despite low-quality evidence [^2546873c] [^4cdc591c].

---

## Dosage and administration

| **Drug** | **Standard dosing** | **High-dose regimen (if indicated)** |
|-|-|-|
| Tigecycline | 100 mg IV load, then 50 mg IV every 12 hours | 200 mg IV load, then 100 mg IV every 12 hours for severe MDR infections [^2546873c] [^30eb1b71] |
| Fosfomycin | 4 g IV every 6 hours (up to 24 g/day) | Dose adjust for renal function; monitor sodium load [^2e6ab8e2] |

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

- **Tigecycline**: Nausea/vomiting are common; monitor for hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and coagulopathy; boxed warning for increased mortality in certain indications [^845d1db2] [^b7edf0e9] [^7706d689].

- **Fosfomycin**: Generally well tolerated; monitor for GI upset, electrolyte disturbances, and sodium load, especially in heart failure [^2e6ab8e2].

- **Combination therapy**: Monitor for additive adverse effects and clinical response; watch for resistance emergence during therapy [^d92877b3].

---

## Limitations and precautions

- **Resistance risk**: Fosfomycin resistance can emerge rapidly; use combination therapy and limit monotherapy [^d92877b3] [^2e6ab8e2].

- **Clinical evidence**: High-quality RCTs are lacking; use reserved for cases where benefits outweigh risks [^2546873c] [^4cdc591c].

- **Patient selection**: Avoid tigecycline in pregnancy, severe hepatic impairment, or when safer effective alternatives exist [^beeb4408] [^bd018514].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Outcomes are **variable** and depend on infection type, severity, and susceptibilities. Combination therapy is associated with improved microbiological cure and clinical response in severe MDR infections, though mortality remains high in critically ill patients [^5fbcb280] [^ee2f3f61]. Tigecycline-containing regimens are particularly useful for intra-abdominal and skin/soft tissue infections, while fosfomycin adds value in urinary-source infections and when tigecycline MICs are elevated [^2546873c] [^09b7dda7].

---

Tigecycline and fosfomycin can be used together for **severe MDR Gram-negative infections** when first-line options are unsuitable, with no direct interaction and supportive but low-quality evidence. Use high-dose tigecycline, combine to mitigate resistance, and monitor closely for response and adverse effects.

1.5 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of TYGACIL and other antibacterial drugs, TYGACIL should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Appropriate specimens for bacteriological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify the causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to tigecycline. TYGACIL may be initiated as empiric monotherapy before results of these tests are known.

5.1 All-Cause Mortality

An increase in all-cause mortality has been observed in a meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials in TYGACIL-treated patients versus comparator-treated patients. In all 13 Phase 3 and 4 trials that included a comparator, death occurred in 4.0% (150/3788) of patients receiving TYGACIL and 3.0% (110/3646) of patients receiving comparator drugs. In a pooled analysis of these trials, based on a random effects model by trial weight, the adjusted risk difference of all-cause mortality was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2) between TYGACIL and comparator-treated patients. An analysis of mortality in all trials conducted for approved indications (cSSSI, cIAI, and CABP), including post-market trials showed an adjusted mortality rate of 2.5% (66/2640) for tigecycline and 1.8% (48/2628) for comparator, respectively. The adjusted risk difference for mortality stratified by trial weight was 0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2).

The cause of this mortality difference has not been established. Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. TYGACIL should be reserved for use in situations when alternative treatments are not suitable [see Boxed Warning, Indications and Usage (1.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects who received TYGACIL in Phase 3 clinical studies (n=2514), 664 were 65 and over, while 288 were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, but greater sensitivity to adverse events of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

No significant difference in tigecycline exposure was observed between healthy elderly subjects and younger subjects following a single 100 mg dose of tigecycline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Hepatic Impairment

No dosage adjustment is warranted in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A and Child Pugh B). In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C), the initial dose of tigecycline should be 100 mg followed by a reduced maintenance dose of 25 mg every 12 hours. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) should be treated with caution and monitored for treatment response [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.2)] .

### What role for tigecycline in infections? [^29fce6a6]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Tigecycline (pronounced tie-ge-sigh-cleen; Tygacil--Wyeth) is a broad-spectrum antibacterial and the first glycylcycline to be marketed in the UK. It is active against certain resistant bacteria, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). Tigecycline is licensed for intravenous treatment of adults with complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and complicated intra-abdominal infections. We review tigecycline and assess its place for these infections.

16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING

TYGACIL (tigecycline) for injection is supplied in a single-dose 10 mL glass vial, containing 50 mg tigecycline lyophilized powder for reconstitution.

Supplied:

Prior to reconstitution, TYGACIL should be stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F). [See USP Controlled Room Temperature.] The reconstituted solution of TYGACIL may be stored at room temperature (not to exceed 25°C/77°F) for up to 24 hours (up to 6 hours in the vial and the remaining time in the intravenous bag) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] .

Risk Summary

TYGACIL, like other tetracycline class antibacterial drugs, may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.8), Data, and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. There are no available data on the risk of major birth defects or miscarriage following the use of TYGACIL during pregnancy. Administration of intravenous tigecycline in pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was associated with reduction in fetal weights and an increased incidence of skeletal anomalies (delays in bone ossification) at exposures of 5 and 1 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose in rats and rabbits, respectively. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if TYGACIL is used during the second or third trimester.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Fosfomycin

Fosfomycin is another old broad-spectrum antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis and has in vitro activity against CRE. The oral formulation achieves high concentrations in the urine and is usually effective in the treatment of non-complicated UTIs. The IV formulation (fosfomycin disodium) is not available in the US and other countries, although it has been used successfully in Greece, mostly as an adjuvant drug in combination therapies. For example, a study of 11 critically ill patients with nosocomial infections caused by KPC K. pneumoniae were treated with IV fosfomycin (2 to 4 g every 6 hours) in combination with colistin (n = 6), gentamicin (n = 3), and piperacillin/tazobactam (n = 1). All patients were reported to have good treatment-related microbiological and clinical outcomes, while the all-cause hospital mortality was 18.2% (two patients). The emergence of resistance to fosfomycin during therapy for bacteremia with KPC K. pneumoniae has been reported and is especially concerning since fosfomycin was used as an adjunct in combination therapy in these cases. Recently, parenteral fosfomycin administered in combination with colistin or tigecycline was studied in a prospective observational multicenter trial in 11 ICUs in Europe. In total, 41 patients with bacteremia or ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae were treated with a median dose of 24 g of fosfomycin per day for a total of 14 days. Microbiological cure was reported in 56.5% of cases, with an all-cause 28-day mortality of 43.5% and emergence of resistance in three patients.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tigecycline is a tetracycline class antibacterial [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Cardiac Electrophysiology

No significant effect of a single intravenous dose of TYGACIL 50 mg or 200 mg on QTc interval was detected in a randomized, placebo- and active-controlled four-arm crossover thorough QTc study of 46 healthy subjects.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The mean pharmacokinetic parameters of tigecycline after single and multiple intravenous doses based on pooled data from clinical pharmacology studies are summarized in Table 3. Intravenous infusions of tigecycline were administered over approximately 30 to 60 minutes.

Distribution

The in vitro plasma protein binding of tigecycline ranges from approximately 71% to 89% at concentrations observed in clinical studies (0.1 to 1.0 mcg/mL). The steady-state volume of distribution of tigecycline averaged 500 to 700 L (7 to 9 L/kg), indicating tigecycline is extensively distributed beyond the plasma volume and into the tissues.

Following the administration of tigecycline 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours to 33 healthy volunteers, the tigecycline AUC0–12h(134 mcg∙h/mL) in alveolar cells was approximately 78-fold higher than the AUC0–12hin the serum, and the AUC0–12h(2.28 mcg∙h/mL) in epithelial lining fluid was approximately 32% higher than the AUC0–12hin serum. The AUC0–12h(1.61 mcg∙h/mL) of tigecycline in skin blister fluid was approximately 26% lower than the AUC0–12hin the serum of 10 healthy subjects.

In a single-dose study, tigecycline 100 mg was administered to subjects prior to undergoing elective surgery or medical procedure for tissue extraction. Concentrations at 4 hours after tigecycline administration were higher in gallbladder (38-fold, n=6), lung (3.7-fold, n=5), and colon (2.3-fold, n=6), and lower in synovial fluid (0.58-fold, n=5), and bone (0.35-fold, n=6) relative to serum. The concentration of tigecycline in these tissues after multiple doses has not been studied.

5.2 Mortality Imbalance and Lower Cure Rates in Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia

A trial of patients with hospital acquired, including ventilator-associated, pneumonia failed to demonstrate the efficacy of TYGACIL. In this trial, patients were randomized to receive TYGACIL (100 mg initially, then 50 mg every 12 hours) or a comparator. In addition, patients were allowed to receive specified adjunctive therapies. The sub-group of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who received TYGACIL had lower cure rates (47.9% versus 70.1% for the clinically evaluable population).

In this trial, greater mortality was seen in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who received TYGACIL (25/131 [19.1%] versus 15/122 [12.3%] in comparator-treated patients) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . Particularly high mortality was seen among TYGACIL-treated patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia at baseline (9/18 [50.0%] versus 1/13 [7.7%] in comparator-treated patients).

5.3 Anaphylactic Reactions

Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including TYGACIL, and may be life-threatening. TYGACIL is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs.

5.4 Hepatic Adverse Effects

Increases in total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time and transaminases have been seen in patients treated with tigecycline. Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have been reported in patients being treated with tigecycline. Some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during tigecycline therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. Hepatic dysfunction may occur after the drug has been discontinued.

5.5 Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis, including fatal cases, has occurred in association with tigecycline treatment. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be considered in patients taking tigecycline who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Cases have been reported in patients without known risk factors for pancreatitis. Patients usually improve after tigecycline discontinuation. Consideration should be given to the cessation of the treatment with tigecycline in cases suspected of having developed pancreatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)] .

### Tigecycline [^9a2f4e98]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of tigecycline IV (also known as Tygacil): 
- Antimicrobial resistance: use extreme caution in patients receiving tigecycline in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea is reported with use of tigecycline, and may present as mild diarrhea to more severe colitis.
- Gastrointestinal perforation: use caution in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal complications.
- Hypofibrinogenemia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tigecycline has been associated with altered blood coagulation parameters.
- Hypoglycemia: use extreme caution in patients with diabetes mellitus.
- Pancreatitis: use caution in patients taking tigecycline who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute pancreatitis.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^14279f43]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Current treatment options for infections with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae

The optimal treatment of infections with CRE is uncertain, as most data come from retrospective case series and anecdotal case reports; few prospective studies or randomized controlled trials are published on this topic. Since carbapenem-producing organisms are often resistant to other antimicrobial classes in addition to most beta-lactams, additional susceptibility testing to antimicrobials such as colistin, fosfomycin, tigecycline, aztreonam, and rifampin is needed. Consultations from experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms may also prove valuable in patient management. The following antimicrobial therapies have been used with various levels of success in the treatment of CRE infections.

### Options for treating carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^0f6822fd]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To address the therapeutic management of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae on the basis of literature of the last 12 months.

Recent Findings

Retrospective and prospective (nonrandomized noncontrolled) studies provide data regarding the management of infections due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The combination of a carbapenem with colistin or high-dose tigecycline or aminoglycoside or even triple carbapenem-containing combinations if the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of carbapenem (meropenem and imipenem) resistance is 8mg/l or less seems to have an advantage over monotherapy with either colistin or tigecycline or fosfomycin. For Enterobacteriaceae with MIC for carbapenems over 8mg/l, combination regimens involve colistin, tigecycline usually administered in a double dose than that suggested by its manufacturer, fosfomycin and aminoglycosides in various combinations.

Summary

Suggestions based on the limited literature cannot be made safely. Combination regimens involving carbapenems for Enterobacteriaceae with MICs 8mg/l or less for carbapenems (in dual combination with colistin or high-dose tigecycline or aminoglycoside or even triple combinations) seem to confer some therapeutic advantage over monotherapy. For Enterobacteriaceae with higher than the above-mentioned MICs, a combination of two or even three antibiotics among colistin, high-dose tigecycline, aminoglycoside and fosfomycin seems to confer decreased mortality.

14.1 Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections

TYGACIL was evaluated in adults for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multinational, multicenter studies (Studies 1 and 2). These studies compared TYGACIL (100 mg intravenous initial dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours) with vancomycin (1 g intravenous every 12 hours)/aztreonam (2 g intravenous every 12 hours) for 5 to 14 days. Patients with complicated deep soft tissue infections including wound infections and cellulitis (≥10 cm, requiring surgery/drainage or with complicated underlying disease), major abscesses, infected ulcers, and burns were enrolled in the studies. The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical response at the test of cure (TOC) visit in the co-primary populations of the clinically evaluable (CE) and clinical modified intent-to-treat (c-mITT) patients. See Table 4 . Clinical cure rates at TOC by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 5.

14.2 Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections

TYGACIL was evaluated in adults for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) in two randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multinational, multicenter studies (Studies 1 and 2). These studies compared TYGACIL (100 mg intravenous initial dose followed by 50 mg every 12 hours) with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg intravenous every 6 hours) for 5 to 14 days. Patients with complicated diagnoses including appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, gastric/duodenal perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, perforation of intestine, and peritonitis were enrolled in the studies. The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical response at the TOC visit for the co-primary populations of the microbiologically evaluable (ME) and the microbiologic modified intent-to-treat (m-mITT) patients. See Table 6 . Clinical cure rates at TOC by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 7.

Warfarin

Concomitant administration of TYGACIL (100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours) and warfarin (25 mg single-dose) to healthy subjects resulted in a decrease in clearance of R-warfarin and S-warfarin by 40% and 23%, an increase in Cmaxby 38% and 43% and an increase in AUC by 68% and 29%, respectively. Tigecycline did not significantly alter the effects of warfarin on INR. In addition, warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline. However, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored if tigecycline is administered with warfarin.

In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tigecycline does not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following 6 cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms: 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4. Therefore, TYGACIL is not expected to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. In addition, because tigecycline is not extensively metabolized, clearance of tigecycline is not expected to be affected by drugs that inhibit or induce the activity of these CYP450 isoforms.

In vitro studies using Caco-2 cells indicate that tigecycline does not inhibit digoxin flux, suggesting that tigecycline is not a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor. This in vitro information is consistent with the lack of effect of tigecycline on digoxin clearance noted in the in vivo drug interaction study described above.

Tigecycline is a substrate of P-gp based on an in vitro study using a cell line overexpressing P-gp. The potential contribution of P-gp-mediated transport to the in vivo disposition of tigecycline is not known. Coadministration of P-gp inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole or cyclosporine) or P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin) could affect the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline.

Mechanism of Action

Tigecycline inhibits protein translation in bacteria by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules into the A site of the ribosome. This prevents incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. In general, tigecycline is considered bacteriostatic; however, TYGACIL has demonstrated bactericidal activity against isolates of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila .

8.2	Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of tigecycline in human milk; however, tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs are present in breast milk. It is not known whether tigecycline has an effect on the breastfed infant or on milk production. Tigecycline has low oral bioavailability; therefore, infant exposure is expected to be low. Tigecycline is present in rat milk with little or no systemic exposure to tigecycline in nursing pups as a result of exposure via maternal milk. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for TYGACIL and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TYGACIL or from the underlying maternal condition (see Clinical Considerations) .

Clinical Considerations

Because of the theoretical risk of dental discoloration and inhibition of bone growth, avoid breastfeeding if taking TYGACIL for longer than three weeks. A lactating woman may also consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breastmilk during administration of TYGACIL and for 9 days (approximately 5 half-lives) after the last dose in order to minimize drug exposure to a breastfed infant.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established. Because of the increased mortality observed in TYGACIL-treated adult patients in clinical trials, pediatric trials of TYGACIL to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TYGACIL were not conducted.

In situations where there are no other alternative antibacterial drugs, dosing has been proposed for pediatric patients 8 to 17 years of age based on data from pediatric pharmacokinetic studies [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Because of effects on tooth development, use in patients under 8 years of age is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] .

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^21330137]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Tigecycline remains a viable treatment option for complicated IAI due to its favourable in vitro activity against anaerobic organisms, enterococci and ESBLs, and to the high concentration achieved in the biliary tract. However, in numerous trials, excess mortality was seen in patients treated with tigecycline when compared with other drugs; in 12 of 13 phase 3 and 4 comparative clinical trials, all-cause mortality was found higher in the tigecycline group versus the comparison group. Study-level and patient-level analyses identified that patients in the hospital-acquired pneumonia trial, particularly those with ventilator-associated pneumonia with baseline bacteraemia, were at a higher risk of clinical failure and mortality. A mortality analysis was used to investigate the association of baseline factors in intra-abdominal infections, including severity of illness at study entry and treatment assignment, with clinical failure and mortality. Mortality modelling identified multiple factors associated with death which did not include tigecycline. Because of its high concentration in the biliary tract, despite its low performance in bacteraemia patients, tigecycline could be considered as an alternative to beta-lactam agents in the setting of IAIs, when considering a combination antibiotic treatment when a secondary bloodstream infection is suspected.

Aminoglycosides are particularly effective against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and can act synergistically against certain Gram-positive organisms. They are active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria. Because of their serious toxic side effects including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, and considering the poor penetration rate in the ascitic fluid and the loss of bactericidal activity in the presence of acidic pH, most authors do not recommend aminoglycosides for the routine empiric treatment of IAIs.

Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with a wide therapeutic range and characteristic pharmacological properties. Fosfomycin penetrates excellently into various tissues and is frequently administered in combination with other antibiotics to combat severe bacterial infections in Europe. It exerts bactericidal activity under anaerobic conditions, such as is the case within encapsulated purulent lesions, and has negligible protein binding. These characteristics constituted the rationale for choosing fosfomycin in treating abscesses if source control is not feasible.

### Tigecycline for the treatment of severe Clostridium difficile infection [^7d9e1af8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence for the use of tigecycline in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

Data Sources

Searches were performed (2004 to June 2011), using the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, with the terms tigecycline, Tygacil, Clostridium difficile, C. difficile, Clostridium difficile infection, and CDI.

Study Selection

Six case reports that described the use of tigecycline for treatment of CDI were included for review. No clinical trials were identified.

Data Synthesis

In all case reports except 1, tigecycline (alone or in combination with other CDI therapies) was used for the treatment of CDI that was refractory to metronidazole and/or vancomycin. In 6 of the cases, treatment success was reported following initiation of tigecycline therapy; 1 patient died following a complicated hospitalization. The treatment duration with tigecycline was 2-4 weeks. In the cases with successful outcomes, symptoms began to improve within 1 week. None of these patients experienced recurrence during follow-up of various lengths. In vitro studies demonstrated a 90% minimum inhibitory concentration range for tigecycline of 0.016-0.25 mg/L for all C. difficile isolates. Tigecycline exhibited good fecal penetration because of primary biliary excretion of unchanged drug. Up to 59% of the dose is recovered in feces following administration over 4 days in healthy volunteers.

Conclusions

Case reports have suggested that tigecycline may be successful for treatment of severe or severe complicated CDI, when prior therapy has failed. Data demonstrating tigecycline use as initial therapy for CDI are limited; therefore, this option should be reserved for patients in whom other therapeutic options, including metronidazole and vancomycin, have failed. A randomized controlled trial is needed to assess the safety and efficacy of tigecycline in this patient population and better define the drug's role in the treatment of CDI.

### The management of multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^99c657c6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae are often related to the production of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and represent an increasing global threat. Recommendations for the therapeutic management of MDR-related infections, however, are mainly derived from retrospective and nonrandomized prospective studies. The aim of this review is to discuss the challenges in the treatment of patients with infections because of MDR Enterobacteriaceae and provide an expert opinion while awaiting for more definitive data.

Recent Findings

To avoid the selection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-sparing strategies should be considered. B-lactams/b-lactamase inhibitors, mainly piperacillin-tazobactam, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 16/4mg/ml or less represents the best alternative to carbapenems for the treatment of ESBL-producing strains. Overall, combination therapy may be preferred over monotherapy for CRE. The combination of a carbapenem-containing regimen with colistin or high-dose tigecycline or aminoglycoside can be administered at high-dose prolonged infusion with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of CRE with MIC for meropenem 8-16 mg/l or less. For MIC higher than 8-16 mg/l, the use of meropenem should be avoided and various combination therapies based on the in-vitro susceptibility of antimicrobials (e.g., colistin, high-dose tigecycline, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides) should be selected.

Summary

Carbapenem-sparing strategies should be used, when feasible, for ESBL infections. The majority of available nonrandomized studies highlight that combination for CRE seem to offer some therapeutic advantage over monotherapy. Strict infection control measures toward MDR Gram-negative pathogens remain necessary while awaiting for new treatment options.

### Tigecycline (Tygacil) [^845d1db2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In comparative clinical studies, infection-related serious adverse reactions were more frequently reported for subjects treated with TYGACIL (7%) versus comparators (6%). Serious adverse reactions of sepsis/septic shock were more frequently reported for subjects treated with TYGACIL (2%) versus comparators (1%). Due to baseline differences between treatment groups in this subset of patients, the relationship of this outcome to treatment cannot be established [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] .

The most common adverse reactions were nausea and vomiting which generally occurred during the first 1 – 2 days of therapy. The majority of cases of nausea and vomiting associated with TYGACIL and comparators were either mild or moderate in severity. In patients treated with TYGACIL, nausea incidence was 26% (17% mild, 8% moderate, 1% severe) and vomiting incidence was 18% (11% mild, 6% moderate, 1% severe).

In patients treated for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), nausea incidence was 35% for TYGACIL and 9% for vancomycin/aztreonam; vomiting incidence was 20% for TYGACIL and 4% for vancomycin/aztreonam. In patients treated for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), nausea incidence was 25% for TYGACIL and 21% for imipenem/cilastatin; vomiting incidence was 20% for TYGACIL and 15% for imipenem/cilastatin. In patients treated for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), nausea incidence was 24% for TYGACIL and 8% for levofloxacin; vomiting incidence was 16% for TYGACIL and 6% for levofloxacin.

### Other antimicrobials of interest in the era of extended-spectrum β-lactamases: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin and tigecycline [^3374a380]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

The progressive increase of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing enteric bacteria in recent years has called for a re-evaluation of current antibiotic therapy for these infections. The activity and potential use of two old antimicrobials, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin, and the new compound tigecycline for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with special emphasis on E. coli, are reviewed. Fosfomycin continues to be active against the most common uropathogens; in a recent survey from Spain, among the 428 ESBL-producing isolates, the resistance rate of E. coli to fosfomycin was 0.3%, whereas the resistance rate of K. pneumoniae was 7.2%. Other recent surveys, from other parts of the world, confirm the activity of fosfomycin against ESBL-producing E. coli. The rate of resistance to nitrofurantoin in recent surveys in the USA and Canada was 1.1% among 1142 isolates of E. coli from outpatient urinary isolates. However, among 115 clinical isolates of E. coli ESBL producers, only 71.3% were sensitive to nitrofurantoin. Also, E. coli resistance to nitrofurantoin has been reported to be high in a recent survey in Latin American hospitals and in Italy. Tigecycline is a glycylcycline that circumvents efflux and ribosomal protection, the two most frequent genetic mechanisms of tetracycline resistance. The recent activity of tigecycline against 285 nonclonally related isolates expressing well-characterised ESBLs from hospital settings and the community reveal susceptibility rates for tigecycline of 97.5%. Because responses to nitrofurantoin may be less satisfactory and may require longer courses of therapy, nitrofurantoin is considered to be an alternative, rather than a first-line, therapeutic agent for this clinical syndrome. Fosfomycin trometamol is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of cystitis and asymptomatic UTI during pregnancy, and has become, in many countries, the first choice for treatment of any type of cystitis. Finally, for treatment of systemic infections in the hospital setting, tigecycline could be an option that would reduce selection for ESBL-producing organisms.

### Treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections [^55142797]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance has become one of the greatest threats to public health, with rising resistance to carbapenems being a particular concern due to the lack of effective and safe alternative treatment options. Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria of clinical relevance include the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and more recently, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Colistin and tigecycline have been used as first-line agents for the treatment of infections caused by these pathogens; however, there are uncertainties regarding their efficacy even when used in combination with other agents. More recently, several new agents with activity against certain carbapenem-resistant pathogens have been approved for clinical use or are reaching late-stage clinical development. They include ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, plazomicin, eravacycline, and cefiderocol. In addition, fosfomycin has been redeveloped in a new intravenous formulation. Data regarding the clinical efficacy of these new agents specific to infections caused by carbapenem-resistant pathogens are slowly emerging and appear to generally favor newer agents over previous best available therapy. As more treatment options become widely available for carbapenem-resistant gram-negative infections, the role of antimicrobial stewardship will become crucial in ensuring appropriate and rationale use of these new agents.

### Targeted therapy against multi-resistant bacteria in leukemic and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: guidelines of the 4th European conference on infections in leukemia (ECIL-4, 2011) [^38636994]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

The detection of multi-resistant bacterial pathogens, particularly those to carbapenemases, in leukemic and stem cell transplant patients forces the use of old or non-conventional agents as the only remaining treatment options. These include colistin/polymyxin B, tigecycline, fosfomycin and various anti-gram-positive agents. Data on the use of these agents in leukemic patients are scanty, with only linezolid subjected to formal trials. The Expert Group of the 4(th) European Conference on Infections in Leukemia has developed guidelines for their use in these patient populations. Targeted therapy should be based on (i) in vitro susceptibility data, (ii) knowledge of the best treatment option against the particular species or phenotype of bacteria, (iii) pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, and (iv) careful assessment of the risk-benefit balance. For infections due to resistant Gram-negative bacteria, these agents should be preferably used in combination with other agents that remain active in vitro, because of suboptimal efficacy (e.g., tigecycline) and the risk of emergent resistance (e.g., fosfomycin). The paucity of new antibacterial drugs in the near future should lead us to limit the use of these drugs to situations where no alternative exists.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^b1cc2148]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Enterobacteriaceae

If Enterobacteriaceae are cultured, an anti–Gram-negative agent should be administered (ideally a narrower beta-lactam agent if possible) in line with the antibiogram. Once susceptibilities are available and the wound is dry, an oral fluoroquinolone may be appropriate as monotherapy. Fluoroquinolones are able to eliminate Gram-negative rods in young biofilms and have excellent bioavailability. Unfortunately, selection of resistance to fluoroquinolones is common when there is a high bioburden, so they should only be started after surgical debridement. Furthermore, the risk of superinfection with selected fluoroquinolone-resistant strains from the skin microbiome is highest during the early postoperative period, when the patient has drains and an oozing wound.

When there is fluoroquinolone resistance, oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in high dose (800/160 mg, 8 hourly) or continuation of beta-lactam agents is recommended. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim has poor biofilm activity by which it is regarded as a suppressive rather than curative therapy.

IV fosfomycin showed biofilm activity against Escherichia coli in vitro and in an experimental model of foreign-body infection, and may be considered as an additional antibiotic against Gram-negative FRI in selected cases, caused by susceptible bacteria.

For some carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, other agents such as tigecycline, intravenous fosfomycin, or colistin, in combination treatment, may need to be considered. Expert microbiology advice should be sought for any of these infections.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^df8e6b94]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS guidelines—empiric treatment options for resistant gram-negative pathogens in HA-IAI state that carbapenems are generally considered the empiric agents of choice for the most common ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with de-escalation to piperacillin–tazobactam, cefepime, an aminoglycoside, a cephamycin, a fluoroquinolone, or tigecycline considered once susceptibilities are known, although ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are frequently resistant to these other agents and clinical experience with ceftolozane–tazobactam or ceftazidime–avibactam is still limited. Patients with extensive hospital exposure may be infected with AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacter or other Enterobacteriaceae, for which broad-spectrum carbapenems are generally considered the treatment of choice; ceftazidime–avibactam shows good in vitro activity and cefotaxime–tazobactam has activity against 70% of these strains, but clinical experience is quite limited. For KPC-producing strains, combining a carbapenem with an aminoglycoside, a polymyxin, or tigecycline has been associated with the highest efficacy when the minimum inhibitory concentration to carbapenems is not too high, and ceftazidime–avibactam has activity against KPC-producing strains. Treatment of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is more problematic because these bacteria are resistant to nearly all β-lactam antibiotic agents, although aztreonam may be an exception, and combination therapy using agents such as a polymyxin, tigecycline, or fosfomycin is generally advocated. For these MDR, XDR, and PDR pathogens, combination regimens are generally used and may or may not include a broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic agent, an aminoglycoside, a polymyxin, tigecycline (not applicable for Pseudomonas), rifampin, or fosfomycin.

### Dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in German intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008 [^490e2a48]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

• The burden of resistance increased dramatically for 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which indicates a rise in ESBL-producing bacteria.

• This increase has been followed by a doubling of carbapenem use from 2001 through 2008.

• Greater carbapenem use harbours the risk of greater selection of carbapenem resistance and is associated with permeability mutations in strains already producing ESBLs or KPCs.

• Because treatment options for infections with multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria and KPC-producing organisms are limited, besides tigecycline, old antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, fosfomycin, and colistin with or without rifampicin will have to be re-employed.

• Adopting appropriate infection control strategies becomes paramount to prevent transmission to other patients.

### Tigecycline: a critical analysis [^65859ee6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Tigecycline (GAR-936) is the first glycylcycline antibiotic to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The drug overcomes the 2 major resistance mechansisms of tetracycline: drug-specific efflux pump acquisition and ribosomal protection. Tigecycline is active against many gram-positive and -negative organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-intermediate and -resistant enterococci, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. It is also active against many anaerobic bacteria, as well as atypical pathogens, including rapidly growing, nontuberculous mycobacteria. Tigecycline is concentrated in cells and is eliminated primarily via biliary excretion. Diminished renal function does not significantly alter its systemic clearance. Furthermore, tigecycline does not interfere with common cytochrome P450 enzymes, making pharmacokinetic drug interactions uncommon. It provides parenteral therapy for complicated skin/skin-structure and intra-abdominal infections. The only prominent adverse effects are associated with tolerability, most notably nausea and vomiting. Tigecycline will be most useful as empirical therapy for polymicrobial infections, especially in cases in which deep tissue penetration is needed or in which multidrug-resistant pathogens are suspected.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections—combination therapy rationale: The general approach is to administer combination therapy with at least 2 agents until an appropriate clinical response is observed, and it is generally suggested that at least 1 agent be sulbactam-based; when high-dose sulbactam is used, combination therapy is suggested even though only 1 of 7 clinical trials showed improved clinical outcomes, and the only trial demonstrating benefit included high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam as the combination arm; when sulbactam-durlobactam is unavailable, an alternative is high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam with a total daily dose of 9 grams of the sulbactam component as part of combination therapy; components to consider include polymyxin B, minocycline, and tigecycline, whereas fosfomycin and rifampin are not suggested; two large trials did not show benefit for high-dose extended-infusion carbapenem therapy with colistin, and meropenem or imipenemcilastatin are not suggested as routine components except when administered with sulbactam-durlobactam; nebulized antibiotics are not suggested as adjunctive therapy for CRAB pneumonia because of lack of benefit, distribution concerns, and potential respiratory complications such as bronchoconstriction.

### Laboratory diagnosis, clinical management and infection control of the infections caused by extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli: a Chinese consensus statement [^7243d24d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) are defined as bacterial isolates susceptible to two or fewer antimicrobial categories. XDR-GNB mainly occur in Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The prevalence of XDR-GNB is on the rise in China and in other countries, and it poses a major public health threat as a result of the lack of adequate therapeutic options. A group of Chinese clinical experts, microbiologists and pharmacologists came together to discuss and draft a consensus on the laboratory diagnosis, clinical management and infection control of XDR-GNB infections. Lists of antimicrobial categories proposed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing were created according to documents from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Multiple risk factors of XDR-GNB infections are analyzed, with long-term exposure to extended-spectrum antimicrobials being the most important one. Combination therapeutic regimens are summarized for treatment of XDR-GNB infections caused by different bacteria based on limited clinical studies and/or laboratory data. Most frequently used antimicrobials used for the combination therapies include aminoglycosides, carbapenems, colistin, fosfomycin and tigecycline. Strict infection control measures including hand hygiene, contact isolation, active screening, environmental surface disinfections, decolonization and restrictive antibiotic stewardship are recommended to curb the XDR-GNB spread.

We appreciate the comments by Honore et al. on our article. We agree that with the data at hand, we cannot extrapolate to other RRT settings and membrane types than the ones investigated in our study. In fact, these points were stated by us as limitation of the study.

It is correct that RRT clearance was estimated to approx. 11.2% of the body clearance of tigecycline. The mass balance analysis was presented including 10th–90th percentiles to indicate the variability in this vulnerable population. This in mind, we want to emphasize that even the 90th percentile evaluated (18.3% of the total elimination via CRRT) in patients suffering from acute kidney injury would not differ in a clinically relevant extent from the renal clearance (13% of the total elimination via renal elimination (SPC Tygacil 50 mg powder for solution for infusion, Pfizer Limited, Sandwich, UK) of non-renally impaired subjects).

### Antimicrobial resistance and vaccines in enterobacteriaceae including extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae [^620680bb]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapies against highly resistant organisms

Current antimicrobials against most ESBL-producing organisms include beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combinations such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam, and meropenem-vaborbactam. However, other antimicrobial agents can also be used for the treatment of such infections and include cephamycins (e.g. cefepime), temocillin, aminoglycosides, tigecycline, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,,. In the case of CRE, “second-line” drugs, such as polymyxins, tigecycline, aminoglycosides, and fosfomycin may be considered.

Between 2017 and 2023, only meropenem-aborbactam, imipenem-cilastatin/relebactam, plazomicin, eravacycline, and a siderophore cephalosporin (cefiderocol) received regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for treatment of CRE-associated infections (Table 2),. Currently, 32 new antimicrobials based upon traditional mechanisms of action are in phase 1–3 clinical trials targeting WHO priority pathogens (excluding Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Traditional mechanisms refer to the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis, bacterial nucleic acid/protein synthesis, metabolic pathways or membrane function. Of those 32 agents, 14 are expected to have some activity against CRE organisms. The majority of antibiotics in clinical trials, which are mainly BLBLI combinations, have limited or no activity against metallo-beta-lactamases such as the bla NDM (Table 2). This highlights that the antibiotic pipeline remains insufficient to address the challenge of AMR. Further, pharmaceutical industry innovation has largely moved away from the development of novel antimicrobials, due to a lack of profit incentives resulting from short dosing regimens and the rapid bacterial evolution of drug resistance. Although antibiotic stewardship programs do lead to more appropriate antibiotic use and are a necessary part of any AMR strategy, these interventions are also fragile as these are dependent on healthcare providers’ perception of antibiotic use, adequate infection control practices, and available infrastructure (e.g. microbiology results provided to clinical care teams in a timely fashion). Thus, a systems-level intervention such as the use of vaccines against Enterobacteriaceae may be the key long-term strategy against AMR.

### Genomics for molecular epidemiology and detecting transmission of carbapenemase-producingin victoria, Australia, 2012 to 2016 [^8b96db5d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Most CPE isolates in these data set tested susceptible to colistin and fosfomycin, while susceptibilities to amikacin and tigecycline were moderate. However, the colistin and fosfomycin MICs were obtained with AST methods no longer recommended for these antibiotics and, as such, may not be accurate. The laboratory has since moved to broth microdilution AST panels (including colistin and ceftazidime-avibactam) supplemented by agar dilution (fosfomycin) and E test (tigecycline), with susceptibility rates remaining at similar levels. In order to assist clinicians with empirical antibiotic choices, AST results have been compiled into antibiograms and made publicly available.

Analyzing genomic data to infer relationships between isolates is complex. Many variables affect the number of measured SNPs between patients, including species, sequence type, assembly quality, reference sequence selected (and relatedness to isolates being analyzed), number and diversity of isolates analyzed, time between samples, masking of recombination and/or phage elements, sequencing technology, tools employed, and SNP-calling parameters. As such, the potential SNP “threshold” proposed by this study (pairwise SNPs below a certain number suggesting possible transmission; in this case, ≤23 SNPs) may only apply to our data set and workflows, and hence it is always important to interpret genomic data in parallel with local epidemiological data. Notably, masking recombinant sites had little effect on the pairwise SNP distances for highly related pairs by epidemiology (presumably as they had been transmitted over a short period of time), except for(IMP-4; no ST scheme, hence all analyzed together) andST 478. Further work should be directed to the development of international standards for genomic transmission analysis, validation and correlation with epidemiology (e.g. standard data sets of known outbreaks and unrelated isolates), and automation of analysis to move this toward more routine incorporation into the public health laboratory workflow.

### Tigecycline [^a4cf7225]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.5 Usage

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Tigecycline for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Tigecycline for Injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Appropriate specimens for bacteriological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify the causative organisms and to determine their susceptibility to tigecycline. Tigecycline for Injection may be initiated as empiric monotherapy before results of these tests are known.

### Tigecycline: a new glycylcycline for treatment of serious infections [^50be9b85]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Tigecycline is a new semisynthetic glycylcycline for the treatment of serious infections. Of the glycylcyclines, tigecycline is the most studied and appears to hold promise as a new antimicrobial agent that can be administered as monotherapy to patients with many types of serious bacterial infections. For patients with serious infections, the initial choice for empirical therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics is crucial, and, if the choice is inappropriate, it may have adverse consequences for the patient. Tigecycline has been designed to overcome many existing mechanisms of resistance among bacteria and confers broad antibiotic coverage against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and many species of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Tigecycline has been efficacious and well tolerated in human clinical phase 2 studies, which warranted further evaluation of tigecycline in larger studies for treatment of many indications, including complicated skin and skin-structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections, and infections of the lower respiratory tract.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^9f394673]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Tigecycline

Tigecycline has been shown to have in vitro activity against multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Tigecycline has been used in the treatment of infections with CRE primarily as an adjuvant drug in combination therapy (Table 3) [-]. However, the clinical experience with tigecycline has been somewhat disappointing, especially for severe infections such as bloodstream infections or nosocomial pneumonias, for which the drug does not have US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. For example, Kontopidou and colleagues, in their study of 127 ICU patients with bacteremias or ventilator-associated pneumonias caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, found that patients treated with tigecycline, especially as monotherapy (at doses of 100 to 200 mg/day), had the highest failure rates compared with other drug combinations. Most patients treated with tigecycline in this cohort had an MIC of 2 μg/mL (which is the cutoff for susceptibility) and severe infections with high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, which may explain why tigecycline was ineffective. Post-approval meta-analyses have shown that tigecycline had lower cure rates and higher mortality compared with other treatment regimens in pooled randomized controlled trials of various infectious syndromes [-]. When evaluated in a randomized controlled trial of hospital-acquired pneumonia, tigecycline plus ceftazidime was inferior to vancomycin and imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The problem may be related to the low plasma serum concentrations achieved by the dose recommended by the manufacturer (100 mg loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg every 12 hours), which is likely ineffective against pathogens with an MIC of between 0.4 and 1 mg/L. Higher doses have been used in clinical practice. In fact, a recent phase 2 randomized controlled trial of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia studied higher doses of tigecycline (150 mg loading followed by 75 mg every 12 hours, and 200 mg loading followed by 100 mg maintenance dose every 12 hours) versus imipenem/cilastatin. Clinical cure rates were the highest in the arm with the highest dose regimen of tigecycline, whereas the safety profile was similar to that of the lower dose regimens. Nevertheless, in 2010, the FDA added a warning regarding the risk of increased mortality with tigecycline treatment, especially for non-approved indications such as hospital- or ventilator-associated pneumonias (found at). This safety concern was upgraded to a stronger Boxed Warning in 2013, after analysis of 10 clinical trials of tigecycline use for FDA-approved indications, including trials conducted after drug approval, still showed a higher (0.6%) risk of death for patients treated with tigecycline versus other antimicrobials (found at). As a result, many clinicians have chosen tigecycline-based regimens only when other therapies were not available. The low concentration of tigecycline in the urine further limits the use of this antimicrobial for the treatment of UTIs. Unless more compelling evidence of improved clinical outcomes in well-designed studies of high-dose tigecycline becomes available, tigecycline monotherapy is not routinely recommended for severe infections such as bacteremia or hospital-acquired pneumonia.

### Tigecycline: the answer to β-lactam and fluoroquinolone resistance? [^8923f7f5]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with serious bacterial infections such as intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and soft tissue infections are often treated empirically because a delay in appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy has been shown to significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, pathogens that have developed resistance to mainstay therapeutic options are increasing in prevalence making these infections a challenge for physicians. Treatment guidelines for surgical and intra-abdominal infections recommend selection of an agent or a combination of agents with activity to cover both Gram-positive, Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. Recommended agents include second-generation cephalosporins with anaerobic coverage, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor agents, fluoroquinolone/metronidazole combinations and carbapenems. However, the effectiveness of these agents has come into question as once susceptible organisms are now showing signs of resistance to such antimicrobial therapies. Alternative agents specifically designed to overcome mechanisms of microbial resistance have been sought. The result of that search has been the development of a new class of antimicrobials termed glycylcyclines. The first of these novel antibacterials is tigecycline, with a broad spectrum of activity that includes coverage against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and many species of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Tigecycline also has activity against most penicillin-susceptible and resistant Gram-positive organisms. Clinical trial experience with tigecycline has shown it to be at least as effective as current recommended regimens for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and soft tissue infections. This new agent thus holds promise as an alternative to the beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones for the initial empiric treatment of serious bacterial infections.

### Intravenous fosfomycin-back to the future. systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical literature [^d92877b3]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the clinical evidence and usage patterns of intravenous fosfomycin from its development to the present time.

Methods

PubMed, the Cochrane Library and local journals were searched for relevant studies reporting aggregated data of intravenous fosfomycin use in adults and children, with no restrictions regarding study design. Single case reports were excluded. Data were systematically abstracted for all included studies. Clinical and microbiological efficacy from randomized controlled and comparative observational studies were synthesized using meta-analysis to calculate pooled effect sizes.

Results

In all, 128 studies on intravenous fosfomycin in 5527 patients were evaluated. Fosfomycin was predominantly used for sepsis/bacteraemia, urinary tract, respiratory tract, bone and joint, and central nervous system infections. No difference in clinical (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.96-2.15) or microbiological (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.82-2.01) efficacy between fosfomycin and other antibiotics was observed in comparative trials. The pooled estimate for resistance development during fosfomycin monotherapy was 3.4% (95% CI 1.8%-5.1%). Fosfomycin showed a favourable safety profile, with generally mild adverse events not requiring discontinuation of treatment. Included studies explored intravenous fosfomycin as an anti-staphylococcal agent in monotherapy and combination therapy, whereas studies from 1990 focused on combination therapy (fosfoymcin + β-lactams or aminoglycosides) for challenging infections frequently caused by multidrug-resistant organisms.

Conclusion

Intravenous fosfomycin can play a vital role in the antibiotic armamentarium, given its long history of effective and safe use. However, well-designed randomized controlled trials are still desired.

### Extended-spectrum [ beta ]-lactamase producing Escherichia coli: changing epidemiology and clinical impact [^b70ae166]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the recent findings (July 2008-January 2010) on extended-spectrum [beta]-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, mainly focussed on the epidemiology and clinical impact of infections owing to this pathogen.

Recent Findings

CTX-M-producing E. coli, mainly the CTX-M-15 producers, has emerged and disseminated worldwide as an important cause of both nosocomial and community-onset infections. The clonal spread of the ST131 epidemic E. coli strain is linked not only to the CTX-M-15 pandemia but also to other ESBLs types. The most commonly reported risk factors for community-onset ESBL-producing E. coli infections are contact with healthcare centres, recent use of antimicrobial agents, and presence of comorbidities. But infections owing to ESBL-producing E. coli in patients without obvious risk factors can occur, probably related to the increase of healthy carriers colonized with this pathogen. The main significant predictor of mortality caused by ESBL-producing E. coli is inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy. Alternatives of treatment of severe ESBL-producing E. coli infections included carbapenems, amikacin, tigecycline, and [beta]-lactam/[beta]-lactamase inhibitor combinations; with some of them enough clinical evidence is lacking (tigecycline, [beta]-lactam/[beta]-lactamase inhibitor combinations). For urinary tract infections, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin could be useful.

Summary

The worldwide emergence of multiresistant ESBL-producing E. coli raises key therapeutic problems; interventions addressed to their quick detection and early appropriate antibiotic treatment and prevention are urgently needed.

### Tigecycline: a glycylcycline antimicrobial agent [^5ee61cb2]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Tigecycline, the first glycylcycline to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, is a structural analogue of minocycline that was designed to avoid tetracycline resistance mediated by ribosomal protection and drug efflux. It is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections and is available for intravenous administration only.

Objective

This article summarizes the in vitro and in vivo activities and pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of tigecycline, and reviews its clinical efficacy and tolerability profile.

Methods

Relevant information was identified through a search of MEDLINE (1966-April 2006), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966-April 2006), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2006) using the terms tigecycline, GAR-936, and glycylcycline. Also consulted were abstracts and posters from meetings of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1999-2006) and documents provided for formulary consideration by the US manufacturer of tigecycline.

Results

Like the tetracyclines, tigecycline binds to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and inhibits protein synthesis by preventing the incorporation of amino acid residues into elongating peptide chains. In vitro, tigecycline exhibits activity against a wide range of clinically significant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains (eg, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae), and anaerobes (eg, Bacteroides spp). In pharmacokinetic studies in human adults, tigecycline had a large Vd (7-9 L/kg), was moderately bound to plasma protein (71%-89%), had an elimination t(1/2) of 42.4 hours, and was eliminated primarily by biliary/fecal (59%) and renal (33%) excretion. Dose adjustment did not appear to be necessary based on age, sex, renal function, or mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A-B). In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), the maintenance dose should be reduced by 50%. In 4 Phase III clinical trials in patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections, tigecycline was reported to be noninferior to its comparators (vancomycin + aztreonam in 2 studies and imipenem/cilastatin in 2 studies), with clinical cure rates among clinically evaluable patients of >80% (P < 0.001 for noninferiority). The most frequently reported (> or =5 %) adverse events with tigecycline were nausea (28.5%), vomiting (19.4%), diarrhea (11.6%), local IV-site reaction (8.2%), infection (6.7%), fever (6.3%), abdominal pain (6.0%), and headache (5.6%). The recommended dosage of tigecycline is 100 mg IV given as a loading dose, followed by 50 mg IV g12h for 5 to 14 days.

Conclusions

In clinical trials, tigecycline was effective for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections. With the exception of gastrointestinal adverse events, tigecycline was generally well tolerated. With a broad spectrum of activity that includes multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, tigecycline may be useful in the treatment of conditions caused by these pathogens.

Ceftazidime avibactam versus colistin or other drugs

Six studies evaluated the use of ceftazidime avibactam (CZA) versus colistin or other drugs (online supplemental table SM6).ICERs ranged between $693 and $113 423 per QALY gained. Goudarzi et al and Simon et al calculated ICERs equal to $798 and $113 423 per QALY gained among patients infected with CRE, respectively, comparing CZA versus colistin therapy. Incremental QALYs were similar (≈0.5) in both studies, but costs differed. In Goudarzi et al, CZA therapy costs were 1.5-times greater for CZA compared with colistin according to Iran health system tariffs. Simon et al employed a healthcare system perspective in the USA, estimating four times greater daily therapy costs for CZA compared with colistin after accounting for LOS, which increased the ICER. In comparison to colistin+meropenem, Gutiérrez and Fandiñoand Varón-Vega et al reported ICERs of $1340 and $3797 per QALY gained for CZA, respectively. This difference is attributed to CZA showing increased incremental QALYs (+2.3 and +1.8, respectively), while incremental costs were similar ($3151 and $2886, respectively). The slight variation in additional concomitant treatments reported (amikacin+fosfomycin and tigecycline+fosfomycin) played a minor role.

Four studies presented an ICER below the WTP threshold (figure 3B), except Bolaños-Diaz et al and Simon et al.

### Efficacy and safety of tigecycline for the treatment of infectious diseases: a meta-analysis [^1f1857f7]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Background

Multidrug resistance among bacteria increases the need for new antimicrobial drugs with high potency and stability. Tigecycline is one candidate drug, and a previous meta-analysis of only published randomised controlled trials suggested that it might as effective as comparator treatments; we did a meta-analysis to include new and unpublished trials to assess its efficacy for the treatment of adult patients with serious bacterial infection.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register, and Embase up to March 30, 2011, to identify published studies, and we searched clinical trial registries to identify completed unpublished studies, the results of which were obtained through the manufacturer. Eligible studies were randomised trials assessing the clinical efficacy, safety, and eradication efficiency of tigecycline versus other antimicrobial agents for any bacterial infection. The primary outcome was treatment success in patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, had clinical evidence of disease, and had complete follow-up (the clinically assessable population). Meta-analysis was done with random-effects models because of heterogeneity across the trials.

Findings

14 randomised trials, comprising about 7400 patients, were included. Treatment success was lower with tigecycline than with control antibiotic agents, but the difference was not significant (odds ratio 0·87, 95% CI 0·74-1·02). Adverse events were more frequent in the tigecycline group than in the control groups (1·45, 1·11-1·88), with significantly more vomiting and nausea. All-cause mortality was higher in the tigecycline group than in the comparator groups, but the difference was not significant (1·28, 0·97-1·69). Eradication efficiency did not differ between tigecycline and control regimens, but the sample size for these comparisons was small.

Interpretation

Tigecycline is not better than standard antimicrobial agents for the treatment of serious infections. Our findings show that assessment with unpublished studies is needed to make appropriate decisions about new agents.

Funding

Figure 6 displays a clustered SUCRA ranking plot in the three dimensions of x-axis (all-cause mortality), y-axis (clinical cure), and bubble size (microbiological eradication). The plot includes 12 antimicrobial treatments, commonly included in the analyses of all three outcomes. The relative size of each bubble is in proportion to the 100% SUCRA value of FOS + IV COL. IV COL fell in the center of the plot with a relatively small bubble size. Five antimicrobial treatments (SUL, HD SUL, FOS + IV COL, IH COL + IV COL, and HD TIG) fell in farther in the right upper corner of the plot than IV COL. SUL was in the farthest-right upper position with a relatively large bubble size among the five treatments, suggesting that overall, SUL is associated with a more favorable therapeutic effect than other treatments for the three outcome variables. The bubble size of both HD SUL and HD TIG was relatively small among the top 5 treatments placed in the farthest-right upper corner, indicating that those treatments have relatively lower benefits in terms of microbiological eradication.

CRAB—tigecycline dosing and considerations — Tigecycline is only available as an IV formulation and neither CLSI nor FDA breakpoints are available for tigecycline against A. baumannii isolates. A meta-analysis of 15 trials suggests that tigecycline monotherapy is associated with higher mortality compared to alternative regimens used for the treatment of pneumonia, but subsequent investigations suggest that when high-dose tigecycline is prescribed (200 mg IV as a single dose followed 100 mg IV q12h), mortality differences between tigecycline and comparator agents are no longer evident. Similar to minocycline, efficacy of tigecycline may be limited when MICs are >1 μg/mL, and if tigecycline is prescribed for the treatment of CRAB infections, the panel suggests that high doses are used.

### Treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections [^f6c8acd4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Fosfomycin

Fosfomycin is a phosphoenolpyruvate analog that exhibits bactericidal activity by inhibiting one of the first steps in peptidoglycan synthesis. It is active against a wide range of gram-negative pathogens, in particular E. coli, and has been used successfully as an oral formulation for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections for several decades. Fosfomycin is active against the majority of CRE and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains but not those of A. baumannii or S. maltophilia based on current susceptibility breakpoint for urinary tract isolates. Dose fractionation studies in murine thigh infection model demonstrated that the pharmacodynamic driver of fosfomycin most likely linked to its efficacy was ƒAUC/MIC. Of note, the currently widely used susceptibility testing methods (eg, automated testing by Sensititre, VITEK-2, Phoenix, and manual tests performed by Etest) have limitations in providing the fosfomycin MIC values accurately for E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, and also when the pathogen produces KPC enzymes. When compared with the standard agar dilution method, such tests performed with high very major error (ie, false susceptible) rates.

A phase 2/3 study of intravenous fosfomycin (ZEUS; Randomized, Double-Blind, Comparative Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of ZTI-01 vs Piperacillin/Tazobactam in the Treatment of cUTI/AP Infection in Hospitalized Adults; NCT02753946) has been completed. In this intravenous-only study, 465 patients with cUTI or AP were enrolled and randomized to receive fosfomycin or piperacillin-tazobactam. The study met the –15% noninferiority criterion, with overall success rates at TOC of 64.7% and 54.5%, respectively, in the mMITT population.

One major uncertainty about intravenous fosfomycin is whether monotherapy is efficacious in the treatment of systemic infections other than cUTI/AP, as carbapenem-resistant strains tend to have reduced susceptibility to fosfomycin. In countries where intravenous fosfomycin is already available, it has mostly been used in combination with various other agents. A potential, novel therapeutic strategy to avoid the issues related to resistance development during fosfomycin monotherapy, namely, its combination with ceftazidime-avibactam, has been proposed by Papp-Wallace et al for infections with high bacterial burden.

Treatment options against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens

Several classes of antibiotics have been developed to target multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. For example, fosfomycin was earlier used as an effective treatment option in urinary tract infections (UTIs),. Similarly, tigecycline (targeting CRE and CRAB),, fluoroquinolones (broad spectrum antibiotic effective even against drug-resistant strains), aminoglycosides (to treat Gram-negative bacteria associated nosocomial pneumonia) and piperacillin/tazobactam (against multiple Gram-negative pathogens)are other effectively used antibiotics. The membrane-disrupting drug colistin is employed only as an antibiotic of last resort against serious, MDR- Gram-negative bacterial nosocomial infections. However, colistin is highly nephrotoxic and the emergence of colistin-resistant strains limits its clinical use. Tables 1, 2 list various antibiotics discovered or under development targeting Gram-negative bacterial pathogens.

Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) infections—Randomized trials of colistin-based combination therapy versus monotherapy: In a large trial, 312 patients with CRAB bacteremia, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections were randomized to colistin alone versus colistin plus meropenem (2 grams IV every 8 hours as a 3-hour infusion), with no difference in 28-day mortality (46% vs 42%). In a second large trial including 329 patients with drug-resistant A. baumannii bloodstream infections or pneumonia, patients received colistin alone or colistin plus meropenem (1 gram IV every 8 hours as a 30-minute infusion), and the 28-day mortality was 46% vs 42% in the monotherapy versus combination arms. In a randomized trial of critically ill patients given colistin alone versus colistin plus rifampicin, there was no difference in 30-day mortality with 43% mortality in both study arms; another rifampin trial in CRAB pneumonia (n=43) found in-hospital mortality 73% versus 62%, not statistically significant, and a third study in nine patients with colistin-resistant A. baumannii found no difference in 30-day mortality (20% vs 33%). A fosfomycin trial randomized 94 patients to colistin alone versus colistin with fosfomycin with 28-day mortality 57% versus 47%, although IV fosfomycin is not currently available in the United States. A sulbactam trial in 39 CRAB pneumonia patients randomized colistin monotherapy versus colistin plus high-dose sulbactam (total daily dose of 9 grams of the sulbactam component) reported clinical improvement by day five in 16% versus 70% and 28-day mortality 63% versus 50%; investigators were unblinded and patients could transition to other antibiotics after day five, limiting accurate comparison of failure or mortality.

### Crude mortality associated with the empirical use of polymyxins in septic patients in a setting of high prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria: retrospective analysis of a cohort [^c93641d8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Globally, approximately 49 million cases of sepsis and septic shock occur each year. These are medical emergencies, and early identification and proper management are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality. Several studies have shown improved survival with early antimicrobial therapy and increased mortality proportional to the delay in treatment, especially in septic shock. However, clinicians must balance the early administration of antimicrobials with the harm that results from the inadequate use of antibiotics, including unnecessary use in patients without infection.

Antimicrobial resistance may increase due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics as empirical therapy in patients with sepsis or septic shock. Resistance leads to difficult-to-treat infections, longer hospital stays, increased morbidity and mortality, and has an impact on the global economy.

Some antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA), and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), are of major concern due to the severity of infection and the spread of resistance, leading to few treatment options.

Treatment of CRE infections, particularly in Brazil, is often restricted to the use of drugs such as polymyxins, aminoglycosides, tigecycline, or fosfomycin. In low- to middle-income and low-income countries, the “new antibiotics,” such as ceftazidime-avibactam, are available in only 8% of them. In addition to the high cost of these drugs, limited access to laboratory techniques for identifying carbapenemases makes their use difficult. Since their reintroduction into clinical practice, polymyxins have been used as salvage therapy for multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections caused by P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and Enterobacterales.

At our hospital, due to the high prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing gram-negative bacteria, meropenem is suggested as empirical treatment of hospital-acquired sepsis, and polymyxins are recommended when there is an increased risk of infection with organisms resistant to carbapenems. A 2017 study at our hospital linked exposure to healthcare in the previous year, liver disease, and antibiotic use to the increased risk for CRE colonization.

Our aim in this study was to evaluate the impact of the initial use of polymyxin as therapy for carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria (CR-GNB) on mortality in patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis.

### Treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections [^5c63f3e2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Tigecycline and Minocycline

Tigecycline is a glycylcycline agent that was designed to resist key tetracycline resistance mechanisms (ribosome protection and active efflux) and as a result has broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, with notable exceptions of P. aeruginosa, Proteus species, and Providencia species. Among carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens, tigecycline is active against the majority of CRE, A. baumannii, and S. maltophilia strains. Despite its in vitro activity against these problematic pathogens, data regarding clinically efficacy have been mixed, with an excess mortality risk shown in comparative clinical trials. Double-dose tigecycline has been adopted by some clinicians for severe infections such as VAP, but clinical data are limited and many patients cannot tolerate the gastrointestinal side effects. As with colistin, tigecycline is mostly used in combination regimens when treating carbapenem-resistant gram-negative infections to overcome the above pitfalls. In addition, tigecycline is generally not recommended for bacteremia because of its bacteriostatic activity and low steady-state concentrations in serum at current dosing recommendation.

Minocycline, an old derivative of tetracycline, has been “rediscovered” as an agent with in vitro activity against most carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains. It is not as active against CRE as tigecycline and has no activity against P. aeruginosa. Clinical data regarding its efficacy against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii infections are currently limited to case series.

Acinetobacter species—agent selection rationale and avoidance of tigecycline: The evidence suggests that the carbapenems (including imipenem), ampicillin-sulbactam, and colistin are equally effective at treating Acinetobacter species that are determined by antimicrobial sensitivity testing to be sensitive to those agents, and the panel agreed that carbapenems and ampicillin-sulbactam are preferred due to fewer side effects, whereas colistin should be reserved for species sensitive only to colistin due to the risk of nephrotoxicity. The recommendation to use colistin to treat Acinetobacter species that are sensitive only to colistin was strong despite the low quality of evidence because, for such patients, there are no other therapeutic options, so colistin therapy may be lifesaving. In contrast, adjunctive rifampicin did not improve outcomes and was not recommended because its burdens, costs, and risks clearly exceed the benefits. The evidence synthesis indicated that the current label dose of tigecycline worsened clinical outcomes compared with several other therapies, and the panel’s strong recommendation against tigecycline despite low-quality evidence is intended to emphasize the importance of avoiding potentially harmful therapies when alternatives exist.

### Epidemiology, mechanisms, and clinical impact of bacterial heteroresistance [^19405131]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of heteroresistance to multidrug-resistant gram-negative species is mainly reported in polymyxins (including polymyxin B and colistin), beta-lactams (including carbapenems, ceftazidime/avibactam), tigecycline and fosfomycin. These studies addressed a wide range of countries and performed different screening methods. Several studies reported that carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) exhibited a heteroresistance prevalence of ~50 to 75% to polymyxins,–. Luo et al. emphasized that heteroresistance to polymyxin B was confirmed in the vast majority of patients (39/42,92%) before complete resistance was detected, indicating that heteroresistance may represent a transitional stage in the evolution of bacteria from sensitive to resistant. In recent years, there has been a paucity of studies investigating colistin heteroresistance in E. coli. Two recent research studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of heteroresistance to colistin in E. coli is relatively low, with less than 5% of the population exhibiting heteroresistance,. It was found that 93% (15/16) of A. baumannii were heteroresistance to polymyxin and could evolve to resistance under antibiotic pressure. Furthermore, two studies conducted in Brazil and the United States reported heteroresistance prevalence in A. baumannii of 100 and 89%, respectively,. However, recent studies suggest that this rate is now less than 50%. These data are in sharp contrast with E. coli data, in which polymyxins heteroresistance seems rare (<5%).

### The role of fosfomycin for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections [^e4e36cd7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the last decade, an increasing interest in using fosfomycin for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDR-GNB) infections have been registered, especially when none or only a few other active alternatives remained available.

Recent Findings

Fosfomycin may remain active against a considerable proportion of MDR-GNB. In observational studies, a possible curative effect of oral fosfomycin monotherapy has been described for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) and bacterial prostatitis caused by MDR-GNB, whereas intravenous fosfomycin has been mostly used in combination with other agents for various type of severe MDR-GNB infections. The ZEUS randomized controlled trial (RCT) has started to provide high-level evidence about the possible use of fosfomycin for complicated UTI caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing GNB, but no results of large RCT are currently available to firmly guide the use of fosfomycin for carbapenem-resistant GNB.

Summary

Fosfomycin is an important therapeutic option for MDR-GNB infections. Further pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and clinical research is needed to optimize its use.

### Tigecycline use in critically ill patients: a multicentre prospective observational study in the intensive care setting [^6ebff256]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The tigecycline dosage used in this study stands in the conventional range (100 mg daily) in 93–94 % of the cases. Interestingly, a relatively satisfactory success rate was reported in pulmonary infection patients. Similarly to other antibiotic drugs, concerns have been raised about the best dose for tigecycline, especially for treatment of pulmonary infections. Recent publications suggest a potential benefit of high dose tigecycline (200 mg daily) in severe/difficult-to-treat infections. Effectiveness and safety of this policy without adding new risk factors for potentially resistant bacteria remain to be confirmed.

The never-ending debate on bacteriostatic drugs use for treatment of serious infections was re-triggered with the launch of tigecycline. In many ICUs across the world, physicians dare to prescribe this bacteriostatic agent without having the feeling of putting their patients in jeopardy. This point is particularly relevant in patients receiving a monotherapy as a first-line treatment. We, like others, report good results in monotherapy in more than half of patients receiving tigecycline. In contrast to other countries, tigecycline seems to be used in France mainly in combination with agents directed particularly against Gram-negative microorganisms, and the preferred indications are those of the marketing authorisations. This finding was also reported in the European registries. For instance, in a severe ICU population in Germany, tigecycline was also used mostly in combination (76 %), but the therapy frequently targeted Gram-positive cocci (including enterococci) possibly because of the high frequency of vancomycin-resistant strains. In Latin American countries, the tigecycline use in off-label indications appears to be important.

### Alternative clinical indications for novel antibiotics licensed for skin and soft tissue infection? [^5330cc93]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A number of novel antibiotics in different classes have been registered and licensed in recent years for complicated skin and soft tissue infections or acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Many of these have activity against resistant gram-positive bacteria (linezolid, daptomycin, oritavancin, dalbavancin and tedizolid). In addition, two have gram-negative activity (ceftaroline and tigecycline). The licence for the clinical use of these agents is very narrow, but the clinical need is much broader. This is a personal opinion of the prospective clinical roles for these novel antibiotics.

Recent Findings

All were found to be noninferior to standard comparators in registration trials. There are few data on their use in other clinical conditions outside the narrow confines of the registration trials. 'Off-label' use is likely to be more common than the licensed use, and data need to be collected on clinical and microbiological efficacy and adverse effects in real life.

Summary

There is now a wide range of antibiotics for treating complicated skin and soft tissue infections or acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, and they all have a role in different clinical scenarios. Use in nonlicensed situations needs to be assessed.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE)—tetracycline derivatives: Tetracycline derivatives are not suggested for urinary and bloodstream infections, and have been associated with increased mortality for CRE bloodstream infections; tigecycline or eravacycline can be considered as alternative options for intra-abdominal, skin and soft tissue, osteomyelitis, and respiratory infections when optimal dosing is used. Nausea and emesis are reported in as many as 20%–40% of patients receiving tetracycline derivatives, and tigecycline MICs of ≥0.5 for CRE isolates are associated with poor outcomes. When high-dose tigecycline is prescribed (200 mg IV as a single loading dose followed by 100 mg IV every 12 hours), mortality differences versus comparators may no longer be evident; as such, if tigecycline is prescribed for CRE infections, the panel recommends that high-dosages be administered. Evidence for eravacycline in CRE is limited, with fewer than 5 patients included in relevant trials. The panel suggests using minocycline with caution for the treatment of CRE infections, and omadacycline is not suggested; available data also suggest a lower proportion of CRE isolates are susceptible to minocycline compared to tigecycline or eravacycline.

Introduction: Carbapenemases producing (cp) Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) infection rate ranges between 5-50% and is associated with a high mortality (19-51%). The use of ceftazidime-avibactam - a 3-generation cephalosporin plus a new inhibitor of class A (KPC), C (AmpC) and D (OXA48) ESBL, may resolve life-threatening conditions.

Methods: Case-report of 14 patients undergoing compassionate treatment.

Results: From April to November 2017, 14 patients (10 M and 4 F), median age 57 (IQR = 42.5-70.5) were given ceftazidime/avibactam for major KP-cp (meropenem MIC > 16) infections: (i.e. 9 bacteramia 3 secondary peritonitis and 2 UTI. 10/14 (71.5%) patients, developed a septic shock [median (IQR) SOFA score 10 (8-17)) and needed mechanical ventilation [median (IQR) 8 (4-17) days], norepinephrine infusion [median (IQR) 3 (2-5) days]; 4 patients underwent renal replacement therapy. The median treatment duration (IQR) was 14 (13-14) days. In 41.6% of cases, antibiotic-therapy therapy combination (phosphomycin and colistin) was chosen. All the patients experienced a clinical response by 72/96 hours from the ceftazidime/avibactam commencing. In 8/9 bacteraemic patients negativization of blood culture occurred by 96 hours as well as of the rectal swab in 5/14 patients. A (B) recurred and a second treatment was given. 11/14 (78.5%) patients survived, whereas death was caused by multi-organ failure. The susceptibility test of strains showed sensitivity to ceftazidime/avibactam, whereas 100% of resistance to carbapenems, quinolones and III/IV generation cephalosporin, tigecycline and piperacillin/tazobactam; 62.5% of susceptibility to fosfomycin and colistin; (v) less than 50% of suceptibility to aminoglicosides.

### Tigecycline: a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial [^aa21c4fc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature on tigecycline, a novel antibiotic.

Data Sources

References were identified through MEDLINE (1966-February 2007) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2007) databases, using the key words tigecycline, glycylcycline, complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), complicated intraabdominal infections (cIAI), and in vitro. Additional articles for this review were identified by reviewing the bibliographies of articles cited. The package insert was also used as a reference.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

In vitro, clinical, and pharmacokinetic studies evaluating tigecycline's safety and efficacy were selected.

Data Synthesis

A tigecycline 100 mg intravenous loading dose followed by an intravenous infusion of 50 mg every 12 hours was shown in clinical trials to be as effective as comparator antibiotics in treating cSSSI and cIAI. Tigecycline has a broad spectrum of activity that includes many resistant bacteria with few treatment options, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In cSSSI studies, tigecycline was found to be noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam with test-of-cure rates of 86.5% and 88.6%, respectively. Tigecycline was also found to be noninferior to imipenem/cilastatin in cIAI studies; clinical cure rates were 86.1% and 86.2%, respectively. In vitro activity has been demonstrated against other multidrug-resistant microorganisms of concern, such as Acinetobacter spp. Although it has a broad spectrum of activity, tigecycline has inadequate activity against Pseudomonas spp. Nausea and vomiting were the most frequently reported adverse effects.

Conclusions

Tigecycline is approved for the treatment of cSSSI and cIAI infections. To date, little resistance to tigecycline has been reported; however, with widespread use of the drug, resistance will likely occur. Since published studies have not dealt with seriously ill patients, it is recommended that, until further studies have been completed, other agents be used in the treatment of these patients unless no option other than tigecycline exists.

Rationale: Tetracycline derivatives function independent of the presence or type of carbapenemase, both carbapenemase-producing and non-carbapenemase-producing CRE may test susceptible to these agents, and the tetracycline-derivative agents achieve high tissue distribution following administration, resulting in limited urine and serum concentrations.

### Treatment strategy for a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella UTI [^48fb229c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the management strategy for a multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI).

Case Summary

A 69-year-old Caucasian woman with a past medical history of recurrent UTIs and a right-lung transplant presented with fever to 101.4°F, chills, malaise, and cloudy, foul-smelling urine for approximately 1 week. She was found to have a MDR Klebsiella UTI that was sensitive to tigecycline and cefepime. To further evaluate the degree of resistance Etest minimum inhibitory concentrations were requested for cefepime, amikacin, meropenem, and ertapenem. The patient received a 14-day course of amikacin, which resulted in resolution of her symptoms. One month later, the patient's UTI symptoms returned. The urine culture again grew MDR Klebsiella, sensitive only to tigecycline. Fosfomycin was initiated and resulted in limited resolution of her symptoms. Colistin was started, however, therapy was discontinued on day 5 secondary to the development of acute kidney injury. Despite the short course of therapy, the patient's symptoms resolved.

Discussion

The case presented lends itself well to numerous discussion items that are important to consider when determining optimal treatment for MDR Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs). Susceptibility testing is an important tool for optimizing antibiotic therapy, however, automated systems may overestimate the susceptibility profile for a MDR GNB. Treatment strategies evaluated to treat MDR GNB, include combination therapy with a carbepenem and synergy using polymyxin.

Conclusion

We have described the management strategy for a MDR Klebsiella UTI, the consequences of the initial management strategy, and potential strategies to manage these types of infections in future patients.

### Deaths attributable to carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae infections [^72e4aa35]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Many factors other than underlying concurrent condition or severity of illness at the initial medical visit could be responsible for the higher rate of death among patients with infections caused by CRE. A key relevant factor could be the higher frequency of inappropriate empirical treatments among the CRE patients. Only 2 of the included studies provided comparative data for patients who received appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment. Those studies showed that patients with infections caused by CRE were significantly more likely than those infected by CSE to receive inappropriate antibiotic treatment. In addition, another study showed that inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was independently associated with death in patients infected with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. Apart from empirical treatment, the antibiotics used for treatment might be less effective against carbapenem-resistant infections as well. There are few published clinical data available on the effectiveness of colistin, tigecycline, fosfomycin, and gentamicin (which are likely to be active in vitro against CRE) for the treatment of CSE infections. From a pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic perspective, these agents might be suboptimal for the treatment of serious CRE infections, particularly bloodstream infections.

Five studies showed that carbapenem resistance or KPC production were independent predictors of death after adjustment for concurrent condition or severity of illness. KPC ST258, a widely distributed clone of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, is considered a successful pathogen because of its ability to persist and spread, causing nosocomial outbreaks.

Data regarding the association between carbapenem resistance and virulence are scarce. In vivo and in vitro findings from1 study argued that carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates are less virulent and fit than carbapenem-susceptible isolates in an antibiotic-free environment.This reduction in virulence and fitness was due to the loss of the major porins OmpK35/36 (through which β-lactams penetrate into K. pneumoniae isolates) and the presence and expression of OmpK26 in the resistant isolates.

Surveillance data, patients, and definition

Local infection preventionists (IPs) performed prospective surveillance for CRE using standardized protocols in all hospitals. CRE was defined using CDC definitions based on phenotypic susceptibility.The IPs collected and entered data on patients with CRE isolates into a centralized database, including the following variables: infection versus colonization, year of birth, sex, ethnicity, date of hospital admission, previous admissions to the same hospital during the preceding year, specimen collection date and type, types of infections, and whether the admission was from home or another healthcare facility. IPs also routinely entered monthly patient days for each hospital.

All CRE-positive cultures from the surveillance database during the study period were reviewed for inclusion. If an individual patient had multiple hospitalizations during which CRE was detected, only the first isolate and admission were registered in the surveillance. “Hospital-acquired” was defined as identification that occurred on or after calendar day 3 of hospital admission.Based on this definition, only HA-CRE cases were included in the analysis. To determine infection versus colonization, IPs examined the medical record and spoke to the primary healthcare providers to evaluate for signs or symptoms consistent with infection. The definitions in the DICON protocols used to identify urinary tract infection, bloodstream infection, pneumonia, and ventilator-associated events were the same as those of NHSN.All IPs were trained on NHSN definitions, which allowed for standardized surveillance protocols to be followed.

Quarterly rates of AU for systemic anti-CRE regimens in each hospital, including ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relabactam, cefiderocol, tigecycline, colistin, polymyxin B, eravacycline, and plazomicin as well as oral fosfomycin for treating the urine were retrieved from the DASON database.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^168387e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient’s clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### The role of intravenous fosfomycin: finding our way out of dante's forest dark (...) [^2e6ab8e2]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Fosfomycin is the only commercially available member of the phosphonic acid class of antibiotics. 2 This unique antibiotic was discovered in the 1960s and inhibits a critical first step in bacterial cell wall synthesis. 2 As is the case with other agents whose availability preceded the contemporary rigorous regulatory environment, important gaps in knowledge regarding the safety and efficacy of fosfomycin remain. Interestingly, along with its antibacterial properties, fosfomycin alters leukocyte function, penetrates biofilms, and demonstrates intracellular bactericidal killing.
2. Interestingly, when limiting the analysis to patients who completed the planned treatment course and were evaluated at the test of cure visit, clinical failure occurred among
14. 3% and 19. 7% of patients in the fosfomycin and comparator groups, respectively.

This study follows on the heels of an earlier clinical trial4 in which IV fosfomycin was found to be noninferior to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections. A second finding suggested by this work is that IV fosfomycin should be used with caution, or avoided, for older patients and patients with predisposing risk factors associated with heart failure. The IV formulation of fosfomycin contains significant sodium content that can exacerbate cardiac failure among individuals unable to tolerate large increases in volume. Acquired E coli resistance to fosfomycin generally occurs because of loss of transport systems required for the drug’s uptake or the presence of fosA genes, which encode fosfomycin-modifying enzymes. 2 Fortunately, the mechanism of action and structure of fosfomycin are unique, reducing the likelihood of cross-resistance to β-lactam agents.

2 Although the small number of patients in the analysis precludes any firm conclusions about the ecological impact of fosfomycin on other bacterial flora, its role in preserving the efficacy of carbapenem agents warrants further investigation. We applaud Sojo-Dorado and colleagues3 for their thought-provoking clinical trial investigating the role of IV fosfomycin for the treatment of E coli bloodstream infections from urinary sources. Although several alternative agents exist for relatively susceptible E coli bloodstream infections, the potential for the use of IV fosfomycin as a carbapenem-sparing alternative for ESBL-producing E coli infections is intriguing. The “forest dark” of antimicrobial resistance is further illuminated.

Randomization and Masking

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive fosfomycin disodium (4 g every 6 hours intravenously, in 60 minutes) or a comparator: ceftriaxone (1 g every 24 hours intravenously in 2-4 minutes) or if ceftriaxone resistant, meropenem (1 g every 8 hours intravenously in 15-30 minutes). Dose adjustments for patients with kidney dysfunction are specified in the study protocol (Supplement 1). After 4 days of intravenous treatment, a switch was allowed to an in vitro active oral drug. This was oral fosfomycin trometamol 3 g every 48 hours for patients assigned to fosfomycin and cefuroxime axetil, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at standard dosing for patients in the comparator group, according to the susceptibility profile of the isolate. To reflect real clinical practice, patients with ceftriaxone-resistant isolates in the comparator group could also be switched to parenteral ertapenem for ambulatory treatment. The recommended total duration of treatment was 10 to 14 days. The patients were followed up for 60 days.

Assignment to the treatment group was done centrally using a previously prepared list integrated in the electronic case report form. Randomization was stratified for empirical therapy (ie, active or not) and ceftriaxone susceptibility. No blocks were used. Investigators were not blinded for drug allocation, with the exception of 2 investigators (J.S.-D. and J.R.-B.) who were blinded for checking end points.

### Safety of newer parenteral antibiotics [^17d73bc9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Several parenteral antimicrobials have been introduced into clinical practice over the course of the last decade. Some of these agents (e.g., linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline) are prototypes of new classes of compounds. In comparative clinical trials, these newer anti-infectives have been shown to be safe and to have low rates of discontinuation by patients. However, long-term use has revealed unique toxicities associated with the use of some of these drugs. The adverse events and potential drug interactions associated with the use of these antibiotics are variable and require familiarity with the safety profile of each drug. It is especially important that clinicians be able to recognize serious adverse events associated with the use of specific drugs, because most of the adverse events can be readily reversed by cessation of therapy.

Question 1.2—ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.
