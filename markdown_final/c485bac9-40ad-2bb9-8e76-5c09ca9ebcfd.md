## Question

Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation for Small-Cell Lung Cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), including its benefits, risks, dosing, and how modern imaging changes practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the disease context and why PCI was historically adopted. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence by stage, especially the classic meta-analyses and randomized trials. Next, I will examine how MRI-based staging and surveillance alter the risk–benefit balance, particularly in extensive-stage disease. After that, I need to check dosing, fractionation, and neurocognitive mitigation strategies. Finally, I will integrate current guideline positions and outline practical, patient-centered recommendations with shared decision-making considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. SCLC has a uniquely high propensity for brain metastases, historically approaching 50–60% at 2 years, which underpins the logic of PCI to eradicate microscopic intracranial disease and potentially improve survival; this risk profile is substantially higher than many other solid tumors, justifying prophylaxis in responders to systemic therapy [^34c01856] [^29acfe8e].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence for limited-stage SCLC. The Aupérin meta-analysis of randomized trials showed a 5.4% absolute improvement in 3-year overall survival with PCI (20.7% vs 15.3%) and a 54% reduction in brain metastases, establishing PCI as standard of care for LS-SCLC patients who respond to chemoradiation; this remains the backbone of current recommendations despite being derived from the pre-MRI era [^34a36aab] [^4da974b5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for extensive-stage disease. Initially, I thought the EORTC 08993 trial proved a survival benefit in ES-SCLC, but wait, let me verify the details. The NEJM EORTC trial showed a marked reduction in symptomatic brain metastases and improved 1-year survival (27.1% vs 13.3%), yet it did not mandate pretreatment brain MRI, raising concerns that some benefit may reflect treatment of occult disease rather than true prophylaxis; this uncertainty is amplified by the Japanese phase 3 trial in MRI-staged patients, which found no OS benefit for PCI and even a trend favoring observation, prompting modern guidelines to endorse MRI surveillance as an acceptable alternative in ES-SCLC [^bd855689] [^e5a9da71] [^ee97a271] [^e23cdcc0].

> I need to check how MRI changes the calculus in limited-stage disease as well. Contemporary retrospective cohorts using MRI restaging show that PCI still reduces brain metastases but fails to translate into a significant OS advantage, suggesting that in patients with confirmed MRI-negative brains after therapy, the survival benefit of PCI may be attenuated; this is hypothesis-generating and underscores the need for prospective trials like SWOG S1827/MAVERICK, but it does justify shared decision-making in select LS-SCLC patients, particularly older adults or those with baseline neurocognitive vulnerability [^6af03d82] [^51ba5e03] [^021d1081].

> Let me consider dosing and fractionation carefully. Standard PCI dosing is 25 Gy in 10 fractions of 2.5 Gy, supported by randomized data; higher doses (e.g., 36 Gy) did not reduce brain metastases and were associated with worse survival in RTOG 0212, so dose escalation should be avoided. For ES-SCLC, 20 Gy in 5 fractions is an accepted alternative supported by randomized data, though neurocognitive effects of this hypofractionation are less well characterized [^396af76f] [^e23cdcc0].

> I should confirm neurocognitive toxicity and mitigation strategies. Chronic neurocognitive decline occurs in a substantial proportion after PCI, with higher risk in older adults; hippocampal-avoidance PCI has shown improved delayed free recall at 3 months in a phase III trial, and NRG CC003 has completed accrual to further define cognitive outcomes, so HA-PCI is a reasonable strategy when PCI is chosen and expertise is available, ideally within clinical trials or experienced centers [^370c8664] [^99f2fdce].

> Next, I should review guideline synthesis to ensure alignment. NCCN continues to recommend PCI for LS-SCLC responders given historical OS benefit, while acknowledging the MRI-era uncertainty and supporting MRI surveillance when PCI is omitted; ASTRO emphasizes MRI restaging, recommends PCI for stage II–III LS-SCLC in fit patients, advises against routine PCI in stage I disease, and supports shared decision-making for ES-SCLC between PCI and MRI surveillance; ESMO similarly recommends PCI for LS-SCLC responders but cites insufficient evidence for routine PCI in ES-SCLC, endorsing shared decision-making [^a2a31f0f] [^021d1081] [^382e3278] [^a2f0d9a4].

> But wait, what if the patient is stage I or has poor performance status or baseline cognitive impairment. I should double-check those exceptions. For pathologic stage I (T1–2a, N0) SCLC, the risk of brain metastases is lower and OS benefit from PCI is unproven, so guidelines favor MRI surveillance rather than routine PCI; in patients older than about 70, with ECOG 2, or with baseline neurocognitive deficits, the risk of neurotoxicity may outweigh benefit, so PCI should generally be avoided and surveillance considered, with decisions individualized via shared decision-making [^a2d38a0d] [^218f63c6] [^021d1081].

> I will now examine practical implementation details. MRI brain with contrast is the preferred modality for restaging before PCI decisions and for surveillance if PCI is omitted; if MRI is contraindicated, contrast-enhanced CT is an alternative, albeit with lower sensitivity. PCI should be delivered after recovery from acute toxicities of initial therapy, and patients should be counseled on potential neurocognitive effects, with consideration of HA-PCI when available and appropriate [^29acfe8e] [^4e7c9590] [^99f2fdce].

> Let me reconsider the overarching message to ensure internal consistency. Historically, PCI improves survival in LS-SCLC and reduces brain metastases across stages, but in the MRI era, especially in ES-SCLC and possibly a subset of LS-SCLC with confirmed MRI-negative brains, the survival advantage is attenuated or absent, making MRI surveillance a legitimate alternative; therefore, decisions should be individualized by stage, response, age, performance status, baseline cognition, access to MRI surveillance, and patient preferences, with 25 Gy in 10 fractions remaining the standard dose when PCI is used [^34a36aab] [^e5a9da71] [^021d1081].

---

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is **standard of care** for limited-stage SCLC after response to chemoradiation [^382e3278], reducing brain metastases and improving survival [^34a36aab] [^4da974b5]. For extensive-stage SCLC, PCI reduces brain metastases [^bd855689] but **does not improve survival** in modern MRI-era trials [^e5a9da71], so MRI surveillance is a reasonable alternative [^e23cdcc0] [^a2f0d9a4]. PCI is not recommended for stage I SCLC [^6c18cd8d] or patients with poor performance status or cognitive impairment [^4e7c9590]. The standard regimen is 25 Gy in 10 fractions [^396af76f]; hippocampal avoidance may reduce neurocognitive toxicity [^370c8664] [^99f2fdce]. Shared decision-making is essential, balancing benefits and neurocognitive risks [^8feb7926] [^021d1081].

## Clinical evidence supporting PCI

### Limited-stage SCLC

In limited-stage SCLC, **historical evidence** shows PCI reduces brain metastases and improves survival [^34a36aab] [^4da974b5]. A meta-analysis of seven randomized trials showed a 5.4% absolute improvement in 3-year survival (20.7% vs 15.3%) and a 54% reduction in brain metastases [^34a36aab]. Contemporary data indicate that while PCI still reduces brain metastases, **MRI-era studies** show no significant overall survival benefit, prompting more selective use and shared decision-making [^6af03d82] [^021d1081].

---

### Extensive-stage SCLC

In extensive-stage SCLC, **historical evidence** from a randomized trial showed PCI reduced symptomatic brain metastases and improved 1-year survival (27.1% vs 13.3%) [^bd855689]. However, **modern evidence** from a Japanese phase 3 trial with MRI staging found no survival benefit (median OS 11.6 vs 13.7 months), though brain metastases were reduced, supporting MRI surveillance as an alternative [^e5a9da71] [^e23cdcc0].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Limited-stage sclc** | **Extensive-stage sclc** |
|-|-|-|
| NCCN | Strongly recommends PCI for patients responding to chemoradiation, except stage I or poor performance status [^a2a31f0f] [^4e7c9590] | Recommends PCI or MRI surveillance after shared decision-making; PCI reduces brain metastases but survival benefit is uncertain [^ee97a271] [^e23cdcc0] |
| ASTRO | Strongly recommends PCI for stage II–III, < 70 years, good performance status; consider hippocampal avoidance [^3596df7c] [^99f2fdce] | Recommends PCI or MRI surveillance; PCI reduces brain metastases but survival benefit is uncertain [^e23cdcc0] [^8feb7926] |
| ESMO | Recommends PCI for stage III with good response; consider for performance status 2 [^382e3278] | Insufficient evidence; use shared decision-making [^a2f0d9a4] |

---

## Patient selection criteria

PCI is **recommended** for patients with limited-stage SCLC who respond to chemoradiation, except stage I or those with poor performance status or cognitive impairment [^a2a31f0f] [^4e7c9590]. For extensive-stage SCLC, PCI or MRI surveillance should be considered after shared decision-making, especially in fit patients with good response [^e23cdcc0] [^751278be].

---

## Dose and fractionation

The **standard regimen** is 25 Gy in 10 fractions of 2.5 Gy [^396af76f]. Higher doses (e.g. 36 Gy) do not improve control and increase mortality [^396af76f]. Hypofractionation (20 Gy in 5 fractions) is acceptable in extensive-stage SCLC [^e23cdcc0].

---

## Potential benefits and risks

### Benefits

PCI provides a **significant reduction in brain metastases** — by about 50% in limited-stage and 60% in extensive-stage disease [^34a36aab] [^bd855689]. In limited-stage SCLC, it improves 3-year survival by 5.4% [^34a36aab] [^7cf6df48].

---

### Risks

PCI carries a **risk of neurocognitive decline**, including memory, attention, and executive dysfunction, with higher risk in older adults and at higher doses [^ed5d7f50] [^370c8664]. Acute toxicity includes fatigue, headache, and nausea, typically mild and self-limited [^396af76f].

---

## Alternative strategies

MRI surveillance is a **reasonable alternative** in extensive-stage SCLC, with scheduled brain MRI to detect asymptomatic metastases early [^e5a9da71] [^e23cdcc0]. Hippocampal avoidance PCI may reduce neurocognitive toxicity without compromising control [^370c8664] [^99f2fdce].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing trials such as SWOG S1827/MAVERICK are evaluating **PCI versus MRI surveillance** in both limited- and extensive-stage SCLC [^51ba5e03]. Efforts focus on identifying biomarkers or clinical features to personalize PCI use and minimize overtreatment [^notfound].

---

PCI remains a **key modality** for limited-stage SCLC, with clear benefits in reducing brain metastases and improving survival [^34a36aab]. In extensive-stage SCLC, modern MRI-era data challenge survival benefits, making MRI surveillance a valid alternative [^e5a9da71]. Shared decision-making is essential, integrating patient preferences, performance status, and access to MRI [^8feb7926].

### Practice guideline on prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung cancer [^36559d77]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop an evidence-based clinical practice guideline that would address the following questions: (a) What is the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with limited or extensive stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who have achieved complete remission in response to induction therapy (chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy)? (b) What dose and fractionation schedules of PCI are optimal? (c) Does the use of PCI in patients with SCLC in complete remission affect quality of life? Survival, disease-free survival, quality of life, and adverse effects were the outcomes of interest.

Methods and Materials

A systematic review of the published literature was undertaken to provide the data for an evidence-based practice guideline.

Results

Six randomized controlled trials and one fully published individual patient data meta-analysis were included in the systematic review of the evidence. For patients who have achieved complete response after induction therapy, there is evidence of a disease-free survival benefit (4 of 6 trials) and an overall survival benefit (meta-analysis). There is insufficient evidence to make a definitive recommendation with respect to dose. There is some indication that 30–36 Gy in 2–3 Gy per fraction, or a biologically equivalent dose, may produce a better outcome than a lower dose or less aggressive fractionation regimen. The schedule commonly used in Canada is 25 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks. Data from further research, including a trial currently ongoing that compares 25 Gy in 10 fractions with 36 Gy in 18 fractions, will be required to determine optimal dose of PCI. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations concerning the optimal timing of PCI in relation to the administration of chemotherapy. Lung DSG members generally felt that it should be given as soon as possible after completion of chemotherapy. There is evidence from trials with data for up to 2 years of follow-up that prophylactic cranial irradiation does not produce significant late neurotoxicity. There is evidence from one trial that prophylactic cranial irradiation does not have a detrimental effect on quality of life in the first 12 months following the completion of therapy. There is insufficient evidence to comment on the long-term effects of prophylactic cranial irradiation on quality of life.

Conclusion

For adult patients with limited or extensive SCLC who achieve a complete remission with induction therapy, PCI is recommended.

### Is prophylactic cranial irradiation indicated for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer with a complete response to first-line treatment? [^e9cb0925]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been considered standard of care for patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer who achieve complete response to definitive treatment after a meta-analysis revealed its favorable effects on survival. In a European trial, PCI was also shown to confer a survival advantage for patients with extensive-stage (ES) SCLC who experienced any positive response after initial chemotherapy, leading to PCI also being considered a standard treatment for these patients as well. However, a recent Japanese trial investigating PCI for patients with ES-SCLC was stopped early when an interim analysis failed to confirm a survival benefit. This finding has motivated the thoracic oncology community to rethink the role of PCI in ES-SCLC.

### Re-examining prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a84c9395]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are at high risk for brain metastases. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended in this population to reduce the incidence of brain metastases and prolong survival. We aimed to assesses the efficacy of PCI in this population in the era of routine brain imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the use among patients who were radiographically confirmed not to have brain metastases after completion of first-line therapy.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, cohort studies and controlled trials reporting on the use of PCI for patients SCLC were identified in EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and grey literature sources. The literature search was conducted on November 12, 2023. Summary data were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses pooled hazard ratios (HR) for the primary outcome of overall survival between PCI and no intervention groups. This study is registered with the Open Science Framework, DOI: 10.17605/OSF. IO/BC359 and PROSPERO, CRD42021249466.

Findings

Of 4318 identified records, 223 were eligible for inclusion. 109 reported on overall survival in formats amenable to meta-analysis; PCI was associated with longer survival in all patients with SCLC (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.55–0.63; p < 0.001; n = 56,770 patients), patients with limited stage disease (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.55–0.65; p < 0.001; n = 78 studies; n = 27,137 patients), and patients with extensive stage disease (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.51–0.70; p < 0.001; n = 28 studies; n = 26,467 patients). Between-study heterogeneity was significant when pooled amongst all studies (I2 = 73.6%; 95% CI 68.4%-77.9%). Subgroup analysis did not reveal sources of heterogeneity. In a subgroup analysis on studies that used magnetic resonance imaging to exclude presence of brain metastases at restaging among all patients, overall survival did not differ significantly between patients who did or did not receive PCI (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.52–1.05; p = 0.08; n = 9 studies; n = 1384 patients).

Interpretation

Our findings suggested that administration of PCI is associated with a survival benefit, but not when considering studies that radiographically confirmed absence of brain metastases, suggesting that the survival benefit conferred by PCI might be therapeutic rather than prophylactic.

### The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^862dab4b]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is controversial in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of PCI in these patients.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS).

Results

We identified five studies comprising 984 patients, of whom 448 received PCI and 536 did not receive PCI. In pooled estimates, PCI did not statistically improve OS compared with controls (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60–1.11; I² = 77%; p = 0.19). However, the PCI group had a significant advantage in 1-year survival compared to the no-PCI group (37.1% versus 27.1%; risk ratio = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.80–0.95; I² = 47%; p = 0.002), and the pooled estimates indicated that progression-free survival and the risk of brain metastasis were associated with significant benefit in the PCI group (HR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70–0.98; I² = 22%; p = 0.03; and HR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.23–0.50; I² = 0%; p < 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that PCI in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer may lead to a significant benefit in 1-year survival, progression-free survival, and the risk of brain metastasis, despite the lack of a significant advantage in OS.

### Surgery for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer [^cf2c8e3c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Current treatment guidelines for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) recommend concomitant platinum-based chemo-radiotherapy plus prophylactic cranial irradiation, based on the premise that SCLC disseminates early, and is chemosensitive. However, although there is usually a favourable initial response, relapse is common and the cure rate for limited-stage SCLC remains relatively poor. Some recent clinical practice guidelines have recommended surgery for stage 1 (limited) SCLC followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, but this recommendation is largely based on the findings of observational studies.

Objectives

To determine whether, in patients with limited-stage SCLC, surgical resection of cancer improves overall survival and treatment-related deaths compared with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, or best supportive care.

Search Methods

We performed searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science up to 11 January 2017. We handsearched review articles, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with adults diagnosed with limited-stage SCLC, confirmed by cytology or histology, and radiological assessment, considered medically suitable for resection and radical radiotherapy, which randomised participants to surgery versus any other intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We imported studies identified by the search into a reference manager database. We retrieved the full-text version of relevant studies, and two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome measures were overall survival and treatment-related deaths; and secondary outcome measures included loco-regional progression, quality of life, and adverse events.

Main Results

We included three trials with 330 participants. We judged the quality of the evidence as very low for all the outcomes. The quality of the data was limited by the lack of complete outcome reporting, unclear risk of bias in the methods in which the studies were conducted, and the age of the studies (> 20 years). The methods of cancer staging and types of surgical procedures, which do not reflect current practice, reduced our confidence in the estimation of the effect. Two studies compared surgery to radiation therapy, and in one study chemotherapy was administered to both arms. One study administered initial chemotherapy, then responders were randomised to surgery versus control; following, both groups underwent chest and whole brain irradiation. Due to the clinical heterogeneity of the trials, we were unable to pool results for meta-analysis. All three studies reported overall survival. One study reported a mean overall survival of 199 days in the surgical arm, compared to 300 days in the radiotherapy arm (P = 0.04). One study reported overall survival as 4% in the surgical arm, compared to 10% in the radiotherapy arm at two years. Conversely, one study reported overall survival at two years as 52% in the surgical arm, compared to 18% in the radiotherapy arm. However this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). One study reported early postoperative mortality as 7% for the surgical arm, compared to 0% mortality in the radiotherapy arm. One study reported the difference in mean degree of dyspnoea as -1.2 comparing surgical intervention to radiotherapy, indicating that participants undergoing radiotherapy are likely to experience more dyspnoea. This was measured using a non-validated scale.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from currently available RCTs does not support a role for surgical resection in the management of limited-stage small-cell lung cancer; however our conclusions are limited by the quality of the available evidence and the lack of contemporary data. The results of the trials included in this review may not be generalisable to patients with clinical stage 1 small-cell lung cancer carefully staged using contemporary staging methods. Although some guidelines currently recommend surgical resection in clinical stage 1 small-cell lung cancer, prospective randomised controlled trials are needed to determine if there is any benefit in terms of short- and long-term mortality and quality of life compared with chemo-radiotherapy alone.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation effect on survival in patients with small cell lung cancer: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis [^3cdd7a8f]. Neurosurgical Focus (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is a companion treatment option for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. However, its efficacy and associated risk factors have not been clearly defined. In this study, the authors aimed to systematically assess the effectiveness and role of PCI in the treatment plan of SCLC.

Methods

The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched using the following key terms and their equivalents: "brain", "radiotherapy", "metastases", "prophylactic", and "small cell lung cancer". Studies comparing overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), brain metastasis-free survival (BMFS), and incidence of brain metastases between patients receiving PCI and those not receiving it were considered eligible. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. Meta-analysis was conducted on the mentioned outcomes with subgrouping based on different factors.

Results

The authors identified 74 studies published between 1983 and 2022 with 31,551 SCLC patients, of whom 26.7% received PCI. The studies were a mix of prospective randomized and retrospective observational studies. Patients with limited-stage disease receiving PCI had better OS, PFS, and BMFS than those not receiving PCI. Patients receiving PCI also had significantly longer OS times and developed brain metastases significantly later. However, findings regarding extensive-stage SCLC were not as promising.

Conclusions

PCI is an effective option for limited-stage SCLC patients. It improves OS and PFS, delays brain metastases, and reduces the incidence of brain metastases. However, it might not benefit patients with extensive-stage SCLC under adequate follow-up with MRI surveillance. Finally, the heterogeneity of the included studies and publication bias were the main limitations of this study.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive small-cell lung cancer [^bd855689]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

We conducted a randomized trial of prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer who had had a response to chemotherapy.

Methods

Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years with extensive small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned to undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation (irradiation group) or receive no further therapy (control group). The primary end point was the time to symptomatic brain metastases. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed when any predefined key symptom suggestive of brain metastases was present.

Results

The two groups (each with 143 patients) were well balanced regarding baseline characteristics. Patients in the irradiation group had a lower risk of symptomatic brain metastases (hazard ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.44; P < 0.001). The cumulative risk of brain metastases within 1 year was 14.6% in the irradiation group (95% CI, 8.3 to 20.9) and 40.4% in the control group (95% CI, 32.1 to 48.6). Irradiation was associated with an increase in median disease-free survival from 12.0 weeks to 14.7 weeks and in median overall survival from 5.4 months to 6.7 months after randomization. The 1-year survival rate was 27.1% (95% CI, 19.4 to 35.5) in the irradiation group and 13.3% (95% CI, 8.1 to 19.9) in the control group. Irradiation had side effects but did not have a clinically significant effect on global health status.

Conclusions

Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases and prolongs disease-free and overall survival. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00016211 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).

### Re-examining prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d9c51931]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 15% of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) present with brain metastases at the time of diagnosis and over half will develop brain metastases within two years. Despite advances in treatment, survival following development of brain metastases remains guarded, with a median survival estimated to be 3–6 months.

Many guidelines recommend prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) after completion of first-line therapy in all patients with SCLC and good treatment response, as data from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated prolonged survival and reduced incidence of brain metastases in patients who received prophylactic radiation. However, these favourable outcomes are counterposed by neurotoxicity associated with PCI. Furthermore, more recent studies incorporating improved systemic disease staging and surveillance brain imaging have failed to replicate the survival benefits seen in patients with SCLC who received PCI in the initial studies. There is an impetus to re-examine the indications for and the role of PCI in patients with SCLC.

To assess the efficacy and safety of PCI in patients with limited or extensive stage SCLC, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to examine survival, disease control, and safety reported in controlled trials and cohort studies.

Summary

Background

Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are at high risk for brain metastases. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended in this population to reduce the incidence of brain metastases and prolong survival. We aimed to assesses the efficacy of PCI in this population in the era of routine brain imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the use among patients who were radiographically confirmed not to have brain metastases after completion of first-line therapy.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, cohort studies and controlled trials reporting on the use of PCI for patients SCLC were identified in EMBASE, MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and grey literature sources. The literature search was conducted on November 12, 2023. Summary data were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses pooled hazard ratios (HR) for the primary outcome of overall survival between PCI and no intervention groups. This study is registered with the Open Science Framework, DOI: 10.17605/OSF. IO/BC359 and PROSPERO, CRD42021249466.

Findings

Of 4318 identified records, 223 were eligible for inclusion. 109 reported on overall survival in formats amenable to meta-analysis; PCI was associated with longer survival in all patients with SCLC (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.55–0.63; p < 0.001; n = 56,770 patients), patients with limited stage disease (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.55–0.65; p < 0.001; n = 78 studies; n = 27,137 patients), and patients with extensive stage disease (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.51–0.70; p < 0.001; n = 28 studies; n = 26,467 patients). Between-study heterogeneity was significant when pooled amongst all studies (I2 = 73.6%; 95% CI 68.4%–77.9%). Subgroup analysis did not reveal sources of heterogeneity. In a subgroup analysis on studies that used magnetic resonance imaging to exclude presence of brain metastases at restaging among all patients, overall survival did not differ significantly between patients who did or did not receive PCI (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.52–1.05; p = 0.08; n = 9 studies; n = 1384 patients).

Interpretation

Our findings suggested that administration of PCI is associated with a survival benefit, but not when considering studies that radiographically confirmed absence of brain metastases, suggesting that the survival benefit conferred by PCI might be therapeutic rather than prophylactic.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation — treatment recommendation for small cell lung cancer: Based on the currently available evidence, it is recommended that patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) achieving a complete or partial response to initial therapy should be offered prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) because it significantly improves survival, and the current standard dose-fractionation pattern is 25 Gy/10 fractions.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation versus observation in patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer: a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial [^e5a9da71]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Results from a previous phase 3 study suggested that prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the incidence of symptomatic brain metastases and prolongs overall survival compared with no prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer. However, because of the absence of brain imaging before enrolment and variations in chemotherapeutic regimens and irradiation doses, concerns have been raised about these findings. We did a phase 3 trial to reassess the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation in the treatment of extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer.

Methods

We did this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study at 47 institutions in Japan. Patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer who had any response to platinum-based doublet chemotherapy and no brain metastases on MRI were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive prophylactic cranial irradiation (25 Gy in ten daily fractions of 2·5 Gy) or observation. All patients were required to have brain MRI at 3-month intervals up to 12 months and at 18 and 24 months after enrolment. Randomisation was done by computer-generated allocation sequence, with age as a stratification factor and minimisation by institution, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and response to initial chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was overall survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number UMIN000001755, and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between April 3, 2009, and July 17, 2013, 224 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (113 to prophylactic cranial irradiation and 111 to observation). In the planned interim analysis on June 18, 2013, of the first 163 enrolled patients, Bayesian predictive probability of prophylactic cranial irradiation being superior to observation was 0·011%, resulting in early termination of the study because of futility. In the final analysis, median overall survival was 11·6 months (95% CI 9·5–13·3) in the prophylactic cranial irradiation group and 13·7 months (10·2–16·4) in the observation group (hazard ratio 1·27, 95% CI 0·96–1·68; p = 0·094). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events at 3 months were anorexia (six [6%] of 106 in the prophylactic cranial irradiation group vs two [2%] of 111 in the observation group), malaise (three [3%] vs one [< 1%]), and muscle weakness in a lower limb (one [< 1%] vs six [5%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred in either group.

Interpretation

In this Japanese trial, prophylactic cranial irradiation did not result in longer overall survival compared with observation in patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer. Prophylactic cranial irradiation is therefore not essential for patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer with any response to initial chemotherapy and a confirmed absence of brain metastases when patients receive periodic MRI examination during follow-up.

### A randomized trial of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) versus no PCI in extensive disease small cell lung cancer after a response to chemotherapy (EORTC 08993–22993) [^b72bf2fa]. ASCO (2007). Low credibility.

Abstract 4 Background: Prophylactic cranial irradiation significantly reduces the risk of brain metastases and improves survival in patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer. Development of BM is often accompanied by deterioration of physical and psychological functioning and response to therapy is poor. Patients with extensive disease are at high risk for BM. This randomized study assesses PCI in patients with ED SCLC. Methods: Patients with confirmed ED SCLC and any response to 4–6 cycles of chemotherapy, were randomized to receive PCI or no PCI. The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidence of symptomatic BM. CT or MRI of the brain was performed whenever any of the pre-defined "key-symptoms" was present at baseline or during follow-up. The study was sized to detect a hazard ratio of 0. 44 with 80% power and 2-sided 5% significance.

Acute toxicity was mild: nausea/vomiting was reported by about 30% of PCI-treated cases and about 30% reported late reactions. PCI significantly reduced the risk of symptomatic brain metastases. The 1-year cumulative incidence of symptomatic BM was 14. 6% on PCI versus
40. 4% in controls. PCI had no impact on extra-cranial progression rates, but it significantly prolonged progression-free survival time and overall survival. The 1-year survival rate was 27. 1% for the PCI and
13. 3% for the control arm. Conclusions: PCI significantly reduces the risk of symptomatic brain metastases, and significantly improves both disease-free and overall survival in patients with ED SCLC. PCI should be offered to all ED patients showing a response to initial chemotherapy.

### Management of small cell lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^683272ba]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Purposes

This guideline is for the management of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and is based on currently available information. As part of the guideline, an evidence-based review of the literature was commissioned that enables the reader to assess the evidence as we have attempted to put the clinical implications into perspective.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive review of the available literature and the previous American College of Chest Physicians guidelines of SCLC. Controversial and less understood areas of the management of SCLC were then subject to an exhaustive review of the literature and detail analyses. Experts in evidence-based analyses compiled the accompanying systematic review titled "Evidence for Management of SCLC". The evidence was then assessed by a panel of experts to incorporate "clinical relevance". The resultant guidelines were then scored according to the grading system outlined by the American College of Chest Physicians grading system task force.

Results

SCLC accounts for 13 to 20% of all lung cancers. Highly smoking related and initially responsive to treatment, it leads to death rapidly in 2 to 4 months without treatment. SCLC is staged as limited-stage and extensive-stage disease. Limited-stage disease is treated with curative intent with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with approximately 20% of patients achieving a cure. For all patients with limited-stage disease, median survival is 16 to 22 months. Extensive-stage disease is primarily treated with chemotherapy with a high initial response rate of 60 to 70% but with a median survival of 10 months. All patients achieving a complete remission should be offered prophylactic cranial irradiation. Relapsed or refractory SCLC has a uniformly poor prognosis.

Conclusion

In this section, evidence-based guidelines for the staging and treatment of SCLC are outlined. Limited-stage SCLC is treated with curative intent. Extensive-stage SCLC has high initial responses to chemotherapy but with an ultimately dismal prognosis with few survivors beyond 2 years.

### Is prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) needed in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer showing complete response to first-line chemotherapy? [^ef43cf92]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Throughout the entire world, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is the standard care for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in whom a favorable therapeutic effect is achieved after front-line treatment, regardless of whether the disease is in the limited stage or extensive stage. In the EORTC study, PCI was shown to confer a survival benefit for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) who experienced any positive response after initial chemotherapy. However, the Japan study failed to confirm a survival benefit. As a result, the guidelines in Japan recommend that PCI should not be carried out in cases of ES-SCLC. Complete response (CR) subset analysis in the Japan study suggested that PCI did not provide a survival benefit for patients with ES-SCLC. PCI with a risk of adverse events has poor significance, even if the patients show CR to chemotherapy.

### The role of postoperative thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation in early stage small cell lung cancer: patient selection among ESTRO experts [^cf7e7fff]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) is unclear in resected small cell lung cancer (SCLC).

Methods

Thirteen European radiotherapy experts on SCLC were asked to describe their strategies on PCI and TRT for patients with resected SCLC. The treatment strategies were converted into decision trees and analyzed for consensus and discrepancies.

Results

For patients with resected SCLC and positive lymph nodes most experts recommend prophylactic cranial irradiation and thoracic radiotherapy. For elderly patients with resected node negative SCLC, most experts do not recommend thoracic radiotherapy or prophylactic cranial irradiation.

Conclusion

PCI and TRT are considered in patients with resected SCLC and these treatments should be discussed with the patient in the context of shared decision-making.

### Standard-dose versus higher-dose prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer in complete remission after chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy (PCI 99–01, EORTC 22003–08004, RTOG 0212, and IFCT 99–01): a randomised clinical trial [^396af76f]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimum dose of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is unknown. A meta-analysis suggested that the incidence of brain metastases might be reduced with higher PCI doses. This randomised clinical trial compared the effect of standard versus higher PCI doses on the incidence of brain metastases.

Methods

Between September, 1999, and December, 2005, 720 patients with limited-stage SCLC in complete remission after chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy from 157 centres in 22 countries were randomly assigned to a standard (n = 360, 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions of 2.5 Gy) or higher PCI total dose (n = 360, 36 Gy) delivered using either conventional (18 daily fractions of 2 Gy) or accelerated hyperfractionated (24 fractions in 16 days with two daily sessions of 1.5 Gy separated by a minimum interval of 6 h) radiotherapy. All of the treatment schedules excluded weekends. Randomisation was stratified according to medical centre, age (≤ 60 and > 60 years), and interval between the start of induction treatment and the date of randomisation (≤ 90, 91–180, and > 180 days). Eligible patients were randomised blindly by the data centre of the Institut Gustave Roussy (PCI99-01 and IFCT) using minimisation, and by the data centres of EORTC (EORTC ROG and LG) and RTOG (for CALGB, ECOG, RTOG, and SWOG), both using block stratification. The primary endpoint was the incidence of brain metastases at 2 years. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00005062.

Findings

Five patients in the standard-dose group and four in the higher-dose group did not receive PCI; nonetheless, all randomised patients were included in the effectiveness anlysis. After a median follow-up of 39 months (range 0–89 months), 145 patients had brain metastases; 82 in the standard-dose group and 63 in the higher-dose group. There was no significant difference in the 2-year incidence of brain metastases between the standard PCI dose group and the higher-dose group, at 29% (95% CI 24–35) and 23% (18–29), respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80 [95% CI 0.57–1.11], p = 0.18). 226 patients in the standard-dose group and 252 in the higher-dose group died; 2-year overall survival was 42% (95% CI 37–48) in the standard-dose group and 37% (32–42) in the higher-dose group (HR 1.20 [1.00–1.44]; p = 0.05). The lower overall survival in the higher-dose group is probably due to increased cancer-related mortality: 189 patients in the standard group versus 218 in the higher-dose group died of progressive disease. Five serious adverse events occurred in the standard-dose group versus zero in the higher-dose group. The most common acute toxic events were fatigue (106 [30%] patients in the standard-dose group vs 121 [34%] in the higher-dose group), headache (85 [24%] vs 99 [28%]), and nausea or vomiting (80 [23%] vs 101 [28%]).

Interpretation

No significant reduction in the total incidence of brain metastases was observed after higher-dose PCI, but there was a significant increase in mortality. PCI at 25 Gy should remain the standard of care in limited-stage SCLC.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) versus active MRI surveillance for small cell lung cancer: the case for equipoise [^4111b877]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for SCLC offers a consistent reduction in the incidence of brain metastases at the cost of measurable toxicity to neurocognitive function and quality of life, in the setting of characteristic pathologic changes to the brain. The sequelae of PCI have historically been justified by the perception of an overall survival advantage specific to SCLC. This rationale has now been challenged by a randomized trial in extensive-stage SCLC demonstrating equivalent progression-free survival and a trend toward improved overall survival with PCI omission in the context of modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging and surveillance. In this article, we critically examine the randomized trials of PCI in extensive-stage SCLC and discuss their implications on the historical data supporting PCI for limited-stage SCLC from the pre-MRI era. Further, we review the toxicity of moderate doses of radiation to the entire brain that underlie the growing interest in active MRI surveillance and PCI omission. Finally, the evidence supporting prospective investigation of radiosurgery for limited brain metastases in SCLC is reviewed. Overall, our aim is to provide an evidence-based assessment of the debate over PCI versus active MRI surveillance and to highlight the need for contemporary trials evaluating optimal central nervous system management in SCLC.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation after definitive chemoradiotherapy for limited-stage small cell lung cancer: Do all patients benefit? [^c4423680]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) can improve overall survival (OS) and suppress brain metastases (BM) in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) after complete response to primary therapy. However, PCI can be toxic. We sought to identify characteristics of patients who may not benefit from PCI.

Methods

We identified 658 patients who received chemoradiotherapy at MD Anderson in 1986–2012; 364 received PCI and 294 did not. Median follow-up time was 21.2months (range 1.2–240.8months). Cox proportional hazards regression, competing-risk regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to identify factors influencing OS and BM.

Results

PCI reduced risks of death [HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61–0.88, P = 0.001] and BM [HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.39–0.76, P < 0.001]. Having tumors ⩾5cm increased the risk of BM [HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.22–2.55, P = 0.002] but not death [HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.96–1.40, P = 0.114]. Among patients ⩾70years with ⩾5-cm tumors, PCI did not improve OS [2-year rates 39.4% vs 40.9%, P = 0.739].

Conclusions

PCI remains standard therapy after complete response to chemoradiotherapy for LS-SCLC. However, older patients may be at risk from comorbidity or extracranial disease. Further work is warranted to identify patients who may not benefit from PCI.

### Limited-stage small cell lung cancer: is prophylactic cranial irradiation necessary? [^09f8fc30]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) reduces the incidence of brain metastases in patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC). However, PCI is associated with neurotoxicity. Previous studies have not consistently used pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging. Modern imaging improvements continue to enhance early metastasis detection, potentially decreasing the utility of PCI. We sought to determine whether PCI was associated with improved outcomes in LS-SCLC patients with modern imaging.

Methods and Materials

We identified LS-SCLC patients with no intracranial disease who were treated between 2007 and 2018. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were generated. The cumulative incidence of brain metastases was estimated using competing risks methodology.

Results

Ninety-two patients were identified without intracranial disease at initial staging, 39 of whom received PCI. Median follow-up was 56.7 months. The median OS for the cohort was 35.5 months (95% CI, 25.8–49.3), and median PFS was 19.1 months (95% CI, 12.3–30.5). Median OS with PCI versus observation was 37.9 months (95% CI, 31.8-not reached) versus 30.5 months (95% CI, 14.6–56.1; P = 0.07), whereas median PFS was 26.3 months (95% CI 19.1-not reached) versus 12.3 months (95% CI, 8.5–30.5; P = 0.02), respectively. Overall, at 2 years, the cumulative incidence of brain metastases was 10% with PCI and 29% without; this increased to 32% and 29% by 4 years (P = 0.66). In those patients who had negative magnetic resonance imaging of the brain after completing initial treatment, the 1-year cumulative incidence of brain metastasis was not significantly different at 8% versus 11% (P = 0.46) respectively. Both PCI and treatment response were independent predictors for PFS on multivariate analysis. Stratified by disease response, patients with a complete response did not benefit from PCI (P = 0.50), whereas those with partial response or stable disease experienced improved PFS (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Overall, PCI was associated with improved PFS and reduced early incidence of brain metastases. Patients achieving a complete response to initial therapy did not experience a PFS benefit with PCI. This may indicate that subsets of LS-SCLC patients can potentially be spared from PCI in the era of modern imaging.

### Randomized phase II study comparing prophylactic cranial irradiation alone to prophylactic cranial irradiation and consolidative extracranial irradiation for extensive-disease small cell lung cancer (ED SCLC): NRG oncology RTOG 0937 [^6475b2a6]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

NRG Oncology RTOG 0937 is a randomized phase II trial evaluating 1-year overall survival (OS) with prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) or PCI plus consolidative radiation therapy (PCI+cRT) to intrathoracic disease and extracranial metastases for extensive-disease SCLC.

Methods

Patients with one to four extracranial metastases were eligible after a complete response or partial response to chemotherapy. Randomization was to PCI or PCI+cRT to the thorax and metastases. Original stratification included partial response versus complete response after chemotherapy and one versus two to four metastases; age younger than 65 years versus 65 years or older was added after an observed imbalance. PCI consisted of 25 Gy in 10 fractions. cRT consisted of 45 Gy in 15 fractions. To detect an improvement in OS from 30% to 45% with a 34% hazard reduction (hazard ratio = 0.66) under a 0.1 type 1 error (one sided) and 80% power, 154 patients were required.

Results

A total of 97 patients were randomized between March 2010 and February 2015. Eleven patients were ineligible (nine in the PCI group and two in the PCI+cRT group), leaving 42 randomized to receive PCI and 44 to receive PCI+cRT. At planned interim analysis, the study crossed the futility boundary for OS and was closed before meeting the accrual target. Median follow-up was 9 months. The 1-year OS was not different between the groups: 60.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41.2–74.7) for PCI and 50.8% (95% CI: 34.0–65.3) for PCI+cRT (p = 0.21). The 3- and 12-month rates of progression were 53.3% and 79.6% for PCI and 14.5% and 75% for PCI+cRT, respectively. Time to progression favored PCI+cRT (hazard ratio = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.32–0.87, p = 0.01). One patient in each arm had grade 4 therapy-related toxicity and one had grade 5 therapy-related pneumonitis with PCI+cRT.

Conclusions

OS exceeded predictions for both arms. cRT delayed progression but did not improve 1-year OS.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) versus active surveillance in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a retrospective, multicentre study [^6af03d82]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The recommendation of PCI for limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) is primarily based on evidence from the pre-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) era. However, as MRI accuracy improves and stereotactic radiosurgery advances, the role of PCI for LS-SCLC has become uncertain. This study aims to compare the contemporary survival outcomes of patients with LS-SCLC treated with PCI versus active surveillance.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in which 1068 patients with LS-SCLC who achieved a good response to first-line chemoradiotherapy were consecutively enrolled from 5 tertiary medical centres between June 2009 and June 2019. Of these patients, 440 received PCI, while 628 received surveillance without PCI. Propensity score matching with a 1:1 ratio was performed to balance the baseline characteristics of the two cohorts. The endpoints were overall survival (OS) and the incidence of brain metastasis (BM).

Results

In total, 648 patients were matched. The baseline characteristics were generally well balanced. At a median follow-up of 64.5 months (range 2–190), patients who underwent PCI had a significantly lower risk for BM than those who underwent surveillance. The 3-year cumulative incidence rate of BM was 28.2% (95% CI 22.5–33.8%) in the PCI cohort and 38.5% (32.6–44.5%) in the surveillance cohort (Gray's p = 0.002). However, the lower incidence of BM in the PCI cohort did not translate into a significant extension of OS. The median OS was 35.8 months (95% CI 27.6–44.0 months) in the PCI cohort versus 32 months (26.4–37.6 months) in the surveillance cohort (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.10, p = 0.29). Multivariable analysis showed that disease stage, chemoradiotherapy sequence, and response to chemoradiotherapy were independent prognostic factors for BM or OS.

Conclusions

Overall, PCI reduces the risk for BM but does not substantially prolong OS compared with active surveillance. A phase 3, prospective clinical trial (NCT04829708) we initiated is currently underway, which is expected to corroborate our results.

### Role of prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer [^7a0cadfb]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are at significant risk of developing brain metastases during their disease course. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been incorporated into SCLC treatment guidelines to diminish the risk of developing brain metastases. In 2007, a randomized trial suggested that PCI decreases the incidence of brain metastases and prolongs overall survival (OS) in patients with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) who have responded to initial therapy. However, this study did not include modern central nervous system imaging with CT or MRI prior to randomization. A more recent Japanese trial with MRI staging and surveillance demonstrated that PCI diminished the incidence of brain metastases but did not improve survival. This review examines the largest clinical studies, controversies, and future directions of PCI in patients with ES-SCLC.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with lung cancer [^1009693e]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

The incidence of brain metastases in patients with lung cancer has increased as a result of improved local and systemic control and better diagnosis from advances in brain imaging. Because brain metastases are responsible for life-threatening symptoms and serious impairment of quality of life, resulting in shortened survival, prophylactic cranial irradiation has been proposed in both small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to try to improve incidence of brain metastasis, survival, and eventually quality of life. Findings from randomised controlled trials and a meta-analysis have shown that prophylactic cranial irradiation not only reduces the incidence of brain metastases in patients with SCLC and with non-metastatic NSCLC, but also improves overall survival in patients with SCLC who respond to first-line treatment. Although prophylactic cranial irradiation is potentially associated with neurocognitive decline, this risk needs to be balanced against the potential benefit in terms of brain metastases incidence and survival. Several strategies to reduce neurotoxicity are being investigated.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation for preventing brain metastases in patients undergoing radical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer [^0ae41088]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is a relatively high incidence of brain metastases following radical treatment. At present, the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in this group of patients is not clear.

Objectives

To investigate whether PCI has a role in the management of patients with NSCLC treated with radical intent.

Search Strategy

The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cancerlit, along with handsearching of journals, relevant books, and review articles used to identify potentially eligible trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCI with no PCI in NSCLC patients treated with radical intent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four RCTs were reviewed. Due to the small patient numbers, and variations in radiotherapy (RT) dose, no meta-analysis was attempted.

Main Results

PCI may reduce the incidence of brain metastases, but there is no evidence of a survival benefit. There is no evidence that any regimen is superior, and the effect of PCI on quality of life (QOL) is not known.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support the use of PCI in clinical practice. Where possible, patients should be offered entry into a clinical trial.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation for preventing brain metastases in patients undergoing radical treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer: a cochrane review [^438d3e11]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate whether prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has a role in the management of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with curative intent.

Methods and Materials

A search strategy was designed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PCI with no PCI in NSCLC patients treated with curative intent. The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cancerlit were searched, along with relevant journals, books, and review articles to identify potentially eligible trials. Four RCTs were identified and reviewed. A total of 951 patients were randomized in these RCTs, of whom 833 were evaluable and reported. Forty-two patients with small-cell lung cancer were excluded, leaving 791 patients in total. Because of the small patient numbers and trial heterogeneity, no meta-analysis was attempted.

Results

Prophylactic cranial irradiation did significantly reduce the incidence of brain metastases in three trials. No trial reported a survival advantage with PCI over observation. Toxicity data were poorly collected and no quality of life assessments were carried out in any trial.

Conclusion

Prophylactic cranial irradiation may reduce the incidence of brain metastases, but there is no evidence of a survival benefit. It was not possible to evaluate whether any radiotherapy regimen is superior, and the effect of PCI on quality of life is not known. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of PCI in clinical practice. Where possible, patients should be offered entry into a clinical trial.

### Multidisciplinary management of small cell lung cancer [^f80d522f]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The standard treatment of limited-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is concurrent cisplatin and etoposide with thoracic radiation therapy, whereas treatment of extensive-stage disease is typically chemotherapy alone with a platinum compound plus etoposide. Surgical resection of early disease is generally reserved for patients with small, node-negative disease. Prophylactic cranial irradiation reduces the development of brain metastases and prolongs survival in patients with both limited-stage and extensive-stage disease who have responded to chemotherapy. Further understanding of the molecular underpinnings of SCLC is necessary to develop better treatment options and improve outcomes for patients.

### Evolving practice patterns in the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer [^e97cc351]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The recent phase 3 trial by Takahashi et alshowed no overall survival benefit with prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) over active magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance among patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), questioning the previously established benefit of PCI for this patient group. Consequently, in 2018, the National Comprehensive Cancer Networkestablished equipoise between MRI surveillance and PCI in ES-SCLC. These developments have fueled debate over the role of PCI in this setting, and current practice patterns remain unclear. We conducted a nationwide survey study of radiation oncologists (ROs) to assess changes in the use of PCI for patients with ES-SCLC following publication of the trial by Takahashi et al.

### Factors influencing the utilization of prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer [^37360e1c]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) is typically treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) to the primary tumor. However, the brain is a frequent site of metastasis due to the inability of most chemotherapeutics to penetrate the blood–brain barrier and may be the sole site of recurrence in patients with otherwise good responses to initial therapy. Brain metastasis is associated with significant neurocognitive symptoms and poor survival and has been observed in more than 50% of patients with SCLC. Although the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is debated in patients with very early stage SCLC, such as T1N0M0 disease, PCI is currently considered a standard-of-care intervention in patients with LS-SCLC who achieve a complete or partial response to initial chemotherapy.

PCI has been studied extensively in clinical trials and was shown to improve overall survival (OS) in patients with SCLC in 2 meta-analyses of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend the use of PCI for a limited number of patients with SCLC who respond well to initial therapy.

PCI is associated with chronic neurocognitive deficits in attention, memory, and problem-solving ability; however, these toxicity concerns must be weighed against the potential for neurologic deficits caused by disease progression in the brain. Currently, data on the utilization rates of PCI and the precise reasons for omission are limited. Therefore, in this study, we examined the rate of PCI use and factors associated with a lack of use in patients with LS-SCLC at a large academic institution.

### Clinical outcome in patients with early-stage small cell lung cancer treated with surgery or radiation in the absence of prophylactic cranial irradiation: a single-center retrospective study [^71b06c82]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PCI has been frequently used to avert brain metastasis in patients who have SCLC. However, the benefit of PCI for early-stage SCLC is not clear. In some circumstances, MRI surveillance may be preferable. Individualized risk assessment is necessary, and patients should be involved in the decision-making process. This cohort, despite being too small to draw any conclusions, concurs with the most recent American Society for Radiation Oncology recommendations to defer routine PCI treatment for stage I SCLC. Until we have the results of the ongoing SWOG trial, we recommend that health care providers have a comprehensive discussion with patients regarding the risks and benefits of PCI within the setting of limited, early-stage SCLC; randomized clinical trials and more extensive studies exploring the utility of PCI in patients with early-stage cancers are needed.

### Re-examining prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2b4fe8dd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis has several limitations. First, the majority of studies included were retrospective observational studies with poor study quality and limited reporting on patient eligibility for PCI, leading to confounding and selection bias. However, sensitive search criteria including retrospective studies allowed for description and analysis of real-world practices and comprehensive subgroup analysis. Second, only one randomised controlled trial was available reporting on outcomes on patients who were restaged using magnetic resonance imaging, limiting our ability to rely on this highest level of evidence. The remaining studies included in this subgroup analysis were retrospective cohort studies with an overall "good" Newcastle Ottawa Score, the highest one possible. We eagerly await the results of ongoing trials that investigate the use of PCI versus routine surveillance in patients who were confirmed to have no brain metastases using magnetic resonance imaging (MAVERICK, NCT04155034; PRIMALung, NCT04790253). Third, there was significant in-between study heterogeneity in terms of study design, inclusion criteria, follow-up, and treatment schedules. Despite extensive subgroup analysis, we were unable to identify a statistical source for this heterogeneity, an expected finding given the large number of included studies, which makes it unlikely to identify a single causal variable. Fourth, neurotoxicity and quality of life, key outcomes that inform patient-physician discussion of administration of PCI, were underreported. Given that PCI in patients with SCLC with imaging evidence confirming absence of brain metastases following first-line therapy was associated with a reduction in brain metastases but no survival advantage, the issue of neurotoxic sequelae, which has prompted the field otherwise toward stereotactic radiosurgery rather than whole brain radiation therapy, is in critical need of reassessment in prospective studies. Last, PCI was assessed only in subgroup or multivariable analysis in many studies, leading to disparate confounders included in multivariable models. In consideration of this concern, we performed a sensitivity analysis of only adjusted and unadjusted hazard ratios and found no change in overall hazard ratio.

In summary, in patients with SCLC, PCI was associated with improved overall survival and reduced cumulative incidence of brain metastases in patients with SCLC, irrespective of disease stage. However, following exclusion of patients with radiographic evidence of intracranial disease on imaging performed at the completion of first-line therapy, PCI was associated with decreased incidence of brain metastases but had no effect on survival. Our findings suggest that the survival benefit conferred by PCI might be therapeutic rather than prophylactic in nature and should prompt reconsideration in its default role in clinical care in the modern context of magnetic resonance imaging.

### Re-examining prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b858bbb1]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study outcomes

As in previous meta-analyses, the primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcomes were: incidence of intracranial metastatic disease, brain metastasis-free survival, time to brain metastases, progression-free survival, disease-free survival, incidence of brain metastases as first site of recurrence, neurocognitive decline, and adverse events. No restrictions were made based on endpoint reporting format, and studies were eligible regardless of whether PCI was the primary intervention under investigation or examined in secondary analyses. All outcomes were prespecified, collected, and reported; outcomes not shown in the manuscript were not reported by included studies.

Statistical analysis

Four reviewers (KG, AL, AY, BS) extracted study-level data in duplicate using predetermined extraction forms, including study characteristics (author, country, design), patient characteristics (age, sex, smoking status, performance status), treatment characteristics (regimen, response, imaging, treatment following brain metastasis diagnosis), and primary and secondary outcomes. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Only variables specific to management of brain metastases in patients with SCLC were extracted. Investigators were not contacted due to resource constraints. Quality assessment of observational studies and RCTs was performed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2), respectively.

Where summary survival estimates were not reported, Kaplan–Meier curves were digitised and summary estimates were calculated using the method by Guyot et al. The extracted pseudo-individual patient data was used to generate HRs for PCI versus no intervention. For any given analysis, all patients were included if their corresponding outcome was reported in a format amenable to pooling.

### Re-examining prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3fd3b069]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Nearly 25% of patients with SCLC present with synchronous brain metastases and a large proportion of patients may further develop brain metastases between diagnosis and completion of first-line therapy with the majority of patients remaining asymptomatic from their intracranial progression. Conversely, more than half of patients with SCLC will not have intracranial disease following completion of first-line therapy. In this context, one reasonable alternative to treatment with PCI is active surveillance imaging to limit unnecessary exposure to cranial radiation and the attendant risk of neurotoxicity. Previous cost-benefit analyses have demonstrated no cost benefit to the use of PCI compared with magnetic resonance imaging surveillance in extensive disease SCLC. To this effect, the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guidelines and the Canadian Consensus recommendations suggest magnetic resonance surveillance as an alternative in patients with extensive disease SCLC. Although prospective data in limited disease SCLC are inconclusive, the benefit of this approach could be longstanding, as patients with SCLC found to have brain metastases on surveillance imaging may be treated with stereotactic radiosurgery instead of whole brain irradiation, thus further improving quality of life in these patients without compromising survival outcomes.

At the same time, access to magnetic resonance imaging technology is not uniformly available across the world. In clinical contexts where consistent follow-up with brain imaging is not a viable option, the decision to omit PCI needs to be approached with caution. This is particularly important given the potential risk of developing functionally impairing brain metastases, regardless of whether the primary benefit of PCI is prophylactic or therapeutic in nature. To our knowledge, there is no real-world data on the implementation on surveillance guideline recommendations for brain imaging. This lack of data limits our analysis of the feasibility of offering routine brain imaging as an alternative to PCI outside the context of clinical trials. Based on current treatment guidelines, the omission of PCI should be contemplated only in scenarios where regular, systematic brain imaging follow-up can be reliably implemented. This approach is crucial to ensure optimal patient outcomes and to minimise the risk of late-stage diagnosis of brain metastases, which can significantly impair patient quality of life and limit treatment options.

The lower incidence of BM in the PCI cohort did not translate to a substantial extension of OS. The median OS was 35.8 months (95% CI 27.6–44.0 months) in the PCI cohort versus 32 months (95% CI 26.4–37.6 months) in the surveillance cohort (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.10, p = 0.29, Fig. 3). The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS rates in the PCI and surveillance cohorts were 86.6% (82.9–90.3%) vs. 85.8% (81.9–89.7%), 49.4% (43.7–55.1%) vs. 45.5% (39.8–51.2%), 39.9% (34.0–45.8%) vs. 34.1% (28.2–40.0%), respectively. Further exploratory subgroup analyses of OS did not find any factors favouring PCI (Fig. 4). OS was not significantly different between the two cohorts among several key subgroups.

### Radiation therapy for small cell lung cancer: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^6f684ba1]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) shows substantial brain metastasis (BM) risk without PCI after negative restaging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and remains generally standard care; however, in stage I disease the risk–benefit favors avoidance and shared decision-making, and dosing should use 2500 cGy with avoidance of higher-dose regimens due to neurotoxicity. Studies after MRI following chemoradiation show BM development in 37% to 41% of patients managed without PCI, and "the literature suggests that PCI remains the standard of care for most patients with LS-SCLC who respond to upfront chemoradiation". For stage I disease, "the risk for BM development in stage I disease is relatively low and OS benefit associated with PCI has not been established", and "this population should not be routinely treated with PCI, and the risk–benefit ratio of PCI should be discussed with the individual patient in the context of shared decision-making". The guideline states, "The recommended regimen of 2500 cGy in 10 fractions of 250 cGy for patients with LS-SCLC who undergo PCI is supported by randomized data", with "No significant reduction in the 2-year incidence of BMs… with higher doses", and "Given the increased mortality in the higher dose arm, 2500 cGy is recommended as the standard of care in LS-SCLC", as RTOG 0212 "(2500 cGy vs 3600 cGy) demonstrated a significant increase in the occurrence of chronic neurotoxicity in the higher dose cohort".

### Decision analysis for prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small-cell lung cancer [^cc464afc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been shown to provide survival benefit in patients with limited disease small-cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC) who have achieved complete response. However, PCI may also produce long-term neurotoxicity (NT). The benefits and risks of PCI in LD-SCLC are evaluated.

Methods

We developed a decision-analytic model to compare quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in a cohort of SCLC patients who do or do not receive PCI by varying survival rates and the frequency and severity of PCI-related NT. Sensitivity analyses were applied to examine the robustness of the optimal decision.

Results

At current published survival rates (26% 5-year survival rate with PCI and 22% without PCI) and a low NT rate, PCI offered a benefit over no PCI (QALE = 4.31 and 3.70 for mild NT severity; QALE = 4.09 and 3.70 for substantial NT severity, respectively). With a moderate NT rate, PCI was still preferred. If the PCI survival rate increased to 40%, PCI outperformed no PCI with a mild NT severity. However, no PCI was preferred over PCI (QALE = 5.72 v 5.47) with substantial NT severity. Two-way sensitivity analyses showed that PCI was preferred for low NT rates, mild NT severity, and low long-term survival rates. Otherwise, no PCI was preferred.

Conclusion

The current data suggest PCI offers better QALE than no PCI in LD-SCLC patients who have achieved complete response. As the survival rate for SCLC patients continues to improve, NT rate and NT severity must be controlled to maintain a favorable benefit-risk ratio for recommending PCI.

### Small-cell lung cancer: a review of clinical trials [^d0433096]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is expected to account for 25% of the approximate 170,000 cases of lung cancer diagnosed in the United States in 2002. Although sensitive and responsive to chemotherapy, SCLC has an increased propensity for early metastases, with relapses being common and long-term survival rates being poor. Clinical trials have played a vital role in expanding our knowledge base for this disease and have resulted in newer modalities, including chemotherapeutic agents, prophylactic cranial irradiation, and thoracic radiotherapy designed to improve overall outcomes. Clinical trials have also served to clarify the role of surgery in a disease that traditionally has been thought to be nonoperable. This review will focus on the results of clinical trials that have had an effect on the treatments of patients with limited and extensive-stage SCLC, with recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network being emphasized.

### Evidence for management of small cell lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^5865ed0f]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Purposes

This systematic review addressed the following key questions on managing small cell lung cancer (SCLC): the sequence, timing, and dosing characteristics of primary thoracic radiotherapy (TRTx) for limited-stage disease; primary TRTx for extensive-stage disease; effect of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI); positron emission tomography (PET) for staging; treatment of mixed histology tumors; surgery; and second-line and subsequent-line treatment for relapsed/progressive disease.

Methods

The review methods were defined prospectively in a written protocol. We primarily sought randomized controlled trials that compared the interventions of interest.

Results

Robust evidence was lacking for all questions except PCI, for which a patient-level metaanalysis showed that PCI improves survival of SCLC patients who achieved complete response after primary therapy from 15.3 to 20.7% (p = 0.01). The case for concurrent over sequential radiation delivery rests largely on a single multicenter trial. Support for early concurrent therapy comes from one multicenter trial, but two other multicenter trials found no advantage. Metaanalysis did not find significant reductions in 2-year and 3-year mortality rates for early TRTx. Favorable results from a single-center trial on TRTx for extensive stage disease need replication in a multicenter setting. Relevant comparative studies were nonexistent for management of mixed histology disease and surgery for early limited SCLC. PET may be more sensitive in detecting extracranial disease than conventional staging modalities, but studies were of poor quality.

Conclusions

PCI improves survival among those with a complete remission to primary therapy. A research agenda is needed to optimize the effectiveness of TRTx and its components.

### Treatment of small-cell lung cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology endorsement of the American College of Chest Physicians guideline [^4af80d09]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) produced an evidence-based guideline on treatment of patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Because of the relevance of this guideline to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) membership, ASCO reviewed the guideline, applying a set of procedures and policies used to critically examine guidelines developed by other organizations.

Methods

The ACCP guideline on the treatment of SCLC was reviewed for developmental rigor by methodologists. An ASCO Endorsement Panel updated the literature search, reviewed the content, and considered additional recommendations.

Results

The ASCO Endorsement Panel determined that the recommendations from the ACCP guideline, published in 2013, are clear, thorough, and based on current scientific evidence. ASCO endorses the ACCP guideline on the treatment of SCLC, with the addition of qualifying statements.

Recommendations

Surgery is indicated for selected stage I SCLC. Limited-stage disease should be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with good performance status. Thoracic radiotherapy should be administered early in the course of treatment, preferably beginning with cycle one or two of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy should consist of four cycles of a platinum agent and etoposide. Extensive-stage disease should be treated primarily with chemotherapy consisting of a platinum agent plus etoposide or irinotecan. Prophylactic cranial irradiation prolongs survival in patients with limited-stage disease who achieve a complete or partial response to initial therapy and may do so in similarly responding patients with extensive-stage disease as well. Additional information is available at http://www.asco.org/endorsements/sclc and http://www.asco.org/guidelineswiki.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation in stage IV small cell lung cancer: selection of patients amongst European IASLC and ESTRO experts [^751278be]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Due to conflicting results between major trials the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in stage IV small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is controversial.

Methods

We obtained a list of 13 European experts from both the European Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ESTRO) and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). The strategies in decision making for PCI in stage IV SCLC were collected. Decision trees were created representing these strategies. Analysis of consensus was performed with the objective consensus methodology.

Results

The factors associated with the recommendation for the use of PCI included the fitness of the patient, young age and good response to chemotherapy. PCI was recommended by the majority of experts for non-elderly fit patients who had at least a partial response (PR) to chemotherapy (for complete remission (CR) 85% of radiation oncologists and 69% of medical oncologists, for PR: 85% of radiation oncologists and 54% of medical oncologists). For patients with stable disease after chemotherapy, PCI was recommended by 6 out of 13 (46%) radiation oncologists and only 3 out of 13 medical oncologists (23%). For elderly fit patients with CR, a majority recommended PCI (62%) and no consensus was reached for patients with PR.

Conclusion

European radiation and medical oncologists specializing in lung cancer recommend PCI in selected patients and restrict its use primarily to fit, non-elderly patients who responded to chemotherapy.

### Patterns of failure after prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung cancer: analysis of 505 randomized patients [^ef827d30]. Annals of Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has a beneficial effect on overall survival in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) in complete remission as shown in a worldwide meta-analysis. The current analysis aimed to evaluate PCI effects on patterns of failure in this patient category.

Patients and Methods

The Institut Gustave-Roussy coordinated two parallel randomized studies including a total of 511 patients with SCLC. Patients were randomly assigned to either PCI (24 Gy in eight fractions and 12 days) or no PCI. Patterns of failure were analyzed according to (i) total event rates and (ii) isolated first site of relapse using a competing risk approach.

Results

Five hundred and five patients were analyzed. The 5-year cumulative rate of brain metastasis as an isolated first site of relapse was 37% in the control group and 20% in the PCI group (P < 0.001). The overall 5-year rates of brain metastasis were 59% and 43%, respectively [relative risk (RR) 0.50; P < 0.001]. The 5-year overall survival rates were 15% in the control group and 18% in the PCI group (RR 0.84; P = 0.06).

Conclusions

PCI decreased significantly the risk of brain metastasis. Other events were not influenced. The relative death risk reduction was of borderline significance. Results reported as isolated first cause of failure and subsequent competing events may explain why a major treatment effect on brain metastases rate has a rather moderate effect on survival.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation vs observation in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a long-term update of the NRG oncology / RTOG 0214 phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^cce51c3f]. JAMA Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Brain metastasis (BM) rates are high in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), approaching rates seen in small cell lung cancer, where prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is standard of care. Although PCI decreases the incidence of BM in LA-NSCLC, a survival advantage has not yet been shown.

Objective

To determine if PCI improves survival in LA-NSCLC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0214 was a randomized phase 3 clinical trial in stage III NSCLC stratified by stage (IIIA vs IIIB), histologic characteristics (nonsquamous vs squamous) and therapy (no surgery vs surgery). The study took place at 291 institutions in the United States, Canada, and internationally. Of 356 patients with stage III NSCLC entered onto this study, 16 were ineligible; therefore, 340 patients were randomized.

Intervention For Clinical Trials

Observation vs PCI.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). The secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and incidence of BM.

Results

Of the 340 total participants, mean (SD) age was 61 years; 213 of the participants were men and 127 were women. The median follow-up time was 2.1 years for all patients, and 9.2 years for living patients. The OS for PCI was not significantly better than observation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.63–1.06; P = 0.12; 5- and 10-year rates, 24.7% and 17.6% vs 26.0% and 13.3%, respectively), while the DFS (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.97; P = 0.03; 5- and 10-year rates, 19.0% and 12.6% vs 16.1% and 7.5% for PCI vs observation) and BM (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24–0.77; P = 0.003; 5- and 10-year rates, 16.7% vs 28.3% for PCI vs observation) were significantly different. Patients in the PCI arm were 57% less likely to develop BM than those in the observation arm. Younger patients (< 60 years) and patients with nonsquamous disease developed more BM. On multivariable analysis, PCI was associated with decreased BM and improved DFS, but not improved OS. Multivariable analysis within the nonsurgical arm suggests that PCI effectively prolongs OS, DFS, and BM.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with stage III LA-NSCLC without progression of disease after therapy, PCI decreased the 5- and 10-year rate of BM and improved 5- and 10-year DFS, but did not improve OS. Although this study did not meet its primary end point, the long-term results reveal many important findings that will benefit future trials. Identifying the appropriate patient population and a safe intervention is critical.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation in extensive stage small cell lung cancer: outcomes at a comprehensive cancer centre [^2953919f]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) remains controversial in extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) with the publication of 2 randomized control trials demonstrating differing outcomes in overall survival. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of PCI on survival and the development of brain metastasis while addressing the disparate use of postchemotherapy brain imaging in the aforementioned trials.

Methods and Materials

The medical records of 397 consecutive patients with ES-SCLC between Jan. 1, 2005 and Dec. 31, 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. In those eligible patients (n = 155) without baseline brain metastases and who had at least a partial response to chemotherapy, overall survival and time to brain metastasis were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method comparing patients receiving PCI or not, using both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients were stratified by their receipt of initial postchemotherapy brain imaging. Follow-up did not include serial brain imaging, which was performed when clinically indicated. Differences between the groups with covariates were analyzed using χ 2 statistics and Student's t-tests.

Results

By multivariate analysis, statistically significant predictors of overall survival were the presence of extrathoracic metastases, performance status and use of PCI. There was a statistically significant difference in overall survival (HR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.39–0.77; P = 0.0005) and time to brain metastasis (HR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.23–0.66; P = 0.0004) with the use of PCI. Median survival for the PCI and non-PCI groups was 13.5 and 8.5 months respectively. A survival difference with PCI was observed in both patients that received postchemotherapy brain imaging (HR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.35–0.88; P = 0.012) and those who did not (HR 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29–0.77; P = 0.0025).

Conclusions

PCI in the setting of at least a partial response to chemotherapy was found to have a survival benefit and prolongation of the time to development of brain metastases, when factoring in the use of initial postchemotherapy but not routine surveillance brain imaging.

### Re-examining prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^60578e2e]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A major shortcoming of most prior studies on PCI in patients with SCLC has been the dearth of radiographic screening for brain metastases after completion of chemotherapy, without which it is impossible to discern if radiation is therapeutic or preventive,: of 109 reports that investigated associations between PCI and overall survival, as reflected in our subgroup analysis only nine ensured that all patients had no brain metastases after initial therapy, which is historically when PCI is delivered. Additionally, of 95 studies that reported survival outcomes and were not amenable to meta-analysis, only five excluded patients with radiographic evidence for brain metastases. The present analysis is the first to include all available published evidence on the use of PCI in SCLC, raising the concern that survival estimates following PCI in patients with SCLC might be inflated by inclusion of patients with asymptomatic intracranial disease.

In the present study, the incidence of brain metastases was lower in patients who received prophylactic cranial radiation irrespective of subgroup analysis. The reduction in brain metastases in the light of non-equivocal survival is not surprising, given similar outcomes following PCI in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. A possible explanation is that intracranial progression may not be a primary driver of mortality. In a recent meta-analysis, our group has shown that patients with stable extracranial disease have superior survival outcomes compared with those who have progressive extracranial disease. This suggests that the reduced overall survival in patients with brain metastases may be a consequence of extracranial rather than intracranial disease progression and would therefore be independent of administration of PCI. Assessing the relationship between overall survival and development of intracranial disease is further confounded by the fact that PCI is preferentially administered to patients with response to first-line treatment and better performance status.

Results

Study population

A total of 223 studies reporting on 73,777 patients with SCLC were identified that compared outcomes between patients who did and did not receive PCI (Fig. 1). The majority were retrospective cohort studies (n = 199); other study designs included randomised controlled trials (n = 13), prospective cohort studies (n = 10), and non-randomised controlled trials (n = 1); 163 were published as full-text manuscripts, and 60studies were reported as abstracts. Median follow-up duration ranged from 5.6–165 months.

Overall survival

Out of 201 studies that reported overall survival, more than half (n = 109 studies, n = 56,770 patients) reported adjusted or unadjusted hazard ratios and were eligible for meta-analysis (Fig. 2). PCI was associated with longer survival in all patients with SCLC (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.55–0.63; p < 0.001), patients with limited stage disease (HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.55–0.65; p < 0.001; n = 78 studies; n = 27,137 patients), and patients with extensive stage disease (HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.51–0.70; p < 0.001; n = 28 studies; n = 26,467 patients). On post-hoc sensitivity analyses of unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios, PCI was associated with longer survival (unadjusted HR 0.60; 95% CI, 0.55–0.65; p < 0.001; n = 91 studies; n = 52,928 patients; adjusted HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.55–0.64; p < 0.001; n = 72 studies; n = 32,879 patients; Supplementary Figs.

### Clinical outcome in patients with early-stage small cell lung cancer treated with surgery or radiation in the absence of prophylactic cranial irradiation: a single-center retrospective study [^f7b5bb08]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In patients who have various types of cancer, brain metastases are a common source of morbidity and mortality. For instance, more than half of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) will develop central nervous system metastases at some time during the course of their disease.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has been the standard of care when treating patients with limited-stage SCLC, and this approach has been validated in clinical studies that have shown a lower rate of brain metastasis in patients who have had PCI. Also, a meta-analysis by Aupérin et alindicated a survival benefit in patients with SCLC who were treated with PCI.

However, information about the utility of PCI for patients who have early-stage SCLC is limited, as SCLC is often diagnosed at later stages. Currently, no large, nationally representative data on the risk of brain metastases in patients with early-stage SCLC are available. Additionally, very little data on the clinical outcomes for this patient population exist, and this information is necessary for defining appropriate adjuvant therapy recommendations in patients whose SCLC has been identified early.

Although one might assume that improved treatments for central nervous system disease would lead to higher quality of life, prospective studies have not been done to explore this possibility. Retrospective investigations have revealed that cranial irradiation has some negative effects on brain function, in addition to increasing costs and being inconvenient to patients. As a result of these data and clinical experiences, defining the financial and physical toxicity profiles of PCI has become a topic of interest, and some physicians are foregoing PCI therapy for certain patients with early-stage cancers. Because physicians thoroughly discuss the risks of PCI with patients when planning a treatment strategy, some patients opt not to have PCI for various reasons, highlighting the need to define how outcomes are affected when therapies are performed in the absence of this prophylactic treatment. Therefore, our study focused on answering this question by assessing outcomes in patients with early-stage SCLC. The aim of this study was to define the outcomes of patients with early-stage SCLC in the absence of PCI therapy to determine whether stereotactic body radiation treatment (SBRT) or surgery would be associated with different survival and cancer recurrence outcomes for patients treated at our institution.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) versus active surveillance in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a retrospective, multicentre study [^4ac1591b]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this cohort analysis indicated that PCI led to a consistent reduction in BM rate but did not substantially prolong OS compared with active surveillance. The results challenge the standard recommendation of PCI for LS-SCLC in contemporary practice. Disease stage, CRT sequence, and response to CRT were demonstrated to be independent prognostic factors for BM or OS, with important implications for establishing stratified factors in future clinical trials. A phase 3, prospective clinical trial (NCT04829708) we initiated is currently underway, which is expected to validate our results.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) versus active surveillance in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a retrospective, multicentre study [^34c01856]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) remains the standard recommendation for LS-SCLC with a good response to first-line chemoradiotherapy (CRT), but this suggestion is primarily based on a large meta-analysis conducted before the MRI era that showed a 5.4% overall survival (OS) benefit with PCI for LS-SCLC. Generally, SCLC, characterized by rapid growth and early dissemination, has a higher propensity for brain metastasis than many other solid tumours, with an incidence of BM within 2 years of up to 50–60%. Historically, BMs are usually accompanied by devastating complications, resulting in an appreciably decreased quality of life (QoL) and shortened OS. PCI, with the aim of eradicating all potential subclinical lesions in the brain, is preferred in LS-SCLC management based on several previous studies that consistently demonstrated decreased BM rates and improved survival benefits with PCI. However, as medical technology and discoveries evolve and advance, this dogma is being challenged. A multicentre randomized trial of extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) in Japan was the first to demonstrate that PCI omission did not compromise survival benefits and even had a trend towards improved OS (median OS PCI vs. PCI omission, 13.7 vs. 11.6 months, p = 0.09) in the contemporary era with periodic MRI examinations.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) versus active surveillance in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer: a retrospective, multicentre study [^abe47c40]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the largest multicentre, retrospective cohort study, to our knowledge, to explore the role of PCI for patients with LS-SCLC who achieved a good response to first-line CRT in the contemporary MRI era. The findings demonstrated that PCI did appreciably reduce the risk of BM. However, the lower incidence of BM did not translate to a significant gain in OS. There was no statistically significant difference in OS between the PCI cohort and surveillance cohort in the matched population or among several key subgroups. PCI was associated with improved PFS, which might be attributed to the reduction in BM but not extracranial metastasis. Multivariable analysis indicated that disease stage, CRT sequence, and response to CRT were independent prognostic factors for BM and OS, providing an important reference and basis for establishing stratification factors in future clinical trials.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation — dose and fractionation comparison in limited-stage SCLC: In an international phase 3 randomized trial of 720 patients with LS-SCLC in complete remission after chemotherapy and thoracic radiation, patients were assigned to standard PCI dose (n = 360, 25 Gy in 10 daily fractions of 2.5 Gy) or higher total dose (n = 360, 36 Gy) delivered as 18 daily fractions of 2 Gy or as 24 fractions in 19 days with two daily sessions of 1.5 Gy; the primary end point was the incidence of brain metastases at 2 years, with no significant difference at 2 years (29% vs 23%; P = 0.18), 2-year overall survival of 42% vs 37% (P = 0.05), common acute toxic events including fatigue 30% vs 34%, headache 24% vs 28%, and nausea or vomiting 23% vs 28%, and a nonsignificant reduction in total brain metastases but a significant increase in mortality after higher-dose PCI.

### Radiation therapy for small cell lung cancer: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^021d1081]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASTRO guideline — Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) recommendations and dose-fractionation in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are as follows: For SCLC responding to initial therapy, restaging with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide PCI decision-making is recommended. For stage I SCLC, PCI is conditionally not recommended, and in lieu of PCI, surveillance using brain MRI with contrast can serve as an alternative. For stage II-III limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) who are less than 70 years of age with good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 0–2) and respond to thoracic chemoradiation, PCI is recommended. For LS-SCLC with limited performance status, older age, and/or significant comorbidities, shared decision-making on PCI (considering patient- and disease-specific characteristics) is recommended. For LS-SCLC receiving PCI, 2500 cGy in 10 fractions is recommended. For extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) who respond to chemotherapy, consultation with a radiation oncologist to enhance shared decision-making on PCI versus MRI surveillance (considering patient- and disease-specific characteristics) is recommended. For ES-SCLC who elect PCI, 2500 cGy in 10 fractions or 2000 cGy in 5 fractions is recommended.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with SCLC – A new perspective in the immunotherapy era [^d2cc5696]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has long been used for SCLC to reduce the risk of brain metastases and potentially improve overall survival. Nevertheless, recent immunotherapy trials have provided limited data on its impact, as few patients were treated with PCI. The ADRIATIC trial reported improved outcomes with consolidation immunotherapy in limited-stage SCLC, and PCI was a stratification factor. Notably, patients receiving PCI in both arms had better outcomes than those who did not. Ongoing studies, such as EORTC-1901 PRIMALung (NCT04790253) and SWOG 1827-MAVERICK (NCT04155034), are further investigating PCI's role in the era of immunotherapy, highlighting its potential importance in evolving treatment strategies.

### The role of radiation therapy in small cell lung cancer [^5db21d58]. Current Oncology Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Radiotherapy (RT) is fundamental to the care of patients diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). In the setting of limited stage disease (LS-SCLC), the addition of thoracic RT to chemotherapy (CHT) improves survival and local control, as demonstrated in decades-worth of randomized clinical trials and subsequent meta-analyses. In extensive stage disease (ES-SCLC), thoracic RT is invaluable in the palliation of chest symptoms but there are suggestions that its use in selected patients may potentially improve overall survival. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) also improves outcomes in SCLC. For LS-SCLC patients, it reduces brain metastases rates by half and improves overall survival with minimal impact on quality-of-life. Recently, favorable results for PCI with respect to survival and prevention of symptomatic brain disease have been observed for ES-SCLC patients with any response to CHT. Current phase III trials in SCLC RT include studies looking at the optimal dose and target for limited disease and the role of thoracic RT in extensive disease.

### The role of radiotherapy in lung cancer: where is the evidence? [^9197a21b]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Radiotherapy is one of the main treatment modalities in lung cancer, contributing to both its cure and palliation. Thoracic irradiation has traditionally been considered the mainstay of treatment in inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer. However, despite technical developments and the addition of chemotherapy, the curative potential of radiotherapy in this subset of patients is disappointingly poor. The role of radiotherapy as an adjunct to pulmonary resection (preoperative and postoperative) is questionable, but well-designed and executed phase III studies are lacking. An important application of radiotherapy is palliation of tumor-related symptoms in the chest and in metastatic sites, such as bones and brain. In small cell lung cancer, routine applications of radiotherapy include chest radiotherapy in limited disease and prophylactic cranial irradiation in complete responders to chemotherapy, each increasing survival by about 5%.

Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation

Lung cancer has a high incidence of BMs, this predilection for brain failure led to studies attempting to prophylactically treat micrometastatic disease in the brain in patients at highest risk for BM with prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). The Auperin meta-analysis previously demonstrated that PCI lowered the rate of new BM by 60% and led to an OS benefit of 5% in patients who achieve remission with chemotherapy for small-cell lung cancer. Similarly, a randomized PCI trial was performed with patients with advanced-stage NSCLC which revealed no statistically significant improvement in OS, but there was a 57% decrease in the rate of new BM, and this led to a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival of 3% at 5 years and 5% at 10 years.

A recent phase III trial for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer failed to demonstrate a survival benefit compared to close observation with brain imaging, calling into question the indiscriminate use of PCI. Due to the risk of cognitive decline and lack of routine close interval MRI imaging in prior studies, the NCCN guidelines allow close observation with MRI imaging an alternative, especially for patients at high risk of WBRT-induced cognitive failure which includes patients with a poor cognitive baseline or patients with advanced age. A large phase III study, NRG CC003 will provide further insight into the cognitive impact of HA-PCI versus conventional PCI for patients with small-cell lung cancer, this study is actively accruing. In addition, a phase III trial (SWOG S1827) will randomize limited and extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer patients to MRI surveillance with and without PCI in an effort to evaluate whether MRI surveillance along allowing for early salvage therapy can result in similar OS and improved cognitive preservation and quality of life.

Future studies utilizing PCI may provide additional benefit as there is a clear improvement in the incidence of BM and disease-specific survival. This is most relevant for patients at high risk of BM such as small-cell lung cancer, NSCLC, and HER2+ or triple-negative breast cancer. If further improvements can be made to decrease the cognitive impact of PCI this may translate into an excellent treatment to improve survival and spare toxicity.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation in limited disease small-cell lung cancer in complete remission: a retrospective analysis [^1c7fe55b]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Recently a meta-analysis showed an improved survival probability of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in limited disease small-cell lung cancer (LD SCLC) in complete remission after chemotherapy. We evaluated treatment results of PCI+ and PCI- in these patients. Whether PCI (n = 65) or no PCI (n = 37) was administered did not depend either on patients or on tumour characteristics. After 2 years the incidence of brain metastases was 11% in PCI+ patients and 51% in PCI- patients. Both disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly longer after PCI. PCI reduces the incidence of brain metastases, prolongs brain metastases-free period, and overall survival in LD SCLC patients in complete remission after chemotherapy.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation in small-cell lung cancer: findings from a north central cancer treatment group pooled analysis [^2d90db24]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This pooled analysis evaluated the outcomes of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in 739 small-cell lung cancer (SCLC patients with stable disease (SD) or better following chemotherapy ± thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) to examine the potential advantage of PCI in a wider spectrum of patients than generally participate in PCI trials.

Patients and Methods

Three hundred eighteen patients with extensive SCLC (ESCLC) and 421 patients with limited SCLC (LSCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Four hundred fifty-nine patients received PCI (30 Gy/15 or 25 Gy/10) and 280 did not. Survival and adverse events (AEs) were compared.

Results

PCI patients survived significantly longer than non-PCI patients {hazard ratio [HR] = 0.61 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.52–0.72]; P < 0.0001}. The 1- and 3-year survival rates were 56% and 18% for PCI patients versus 32% and 5% for non-PCI patients. PCI was still significant after adjusting for age, performance status, gender, stage, complete response, and number of metastatic sites (HR = 0.82, P = 0.04). PCI patients had significantly more grade 3+ AEs (64%) compared with non-PCI patients (50%) (P = 0.0004). AEs associated with PCI included alopecia and lethargy. Dose fractionation could be compared only for LSCLC patients and 25 Gy/10 was associated with significantly better survival compared with 30 Gy/15 (HR = 0.67, P = 0.018).

Conclusions

PCI was associated with a significant survival benefit for both ESCLC and LSCLC patients who had SD or a better response to chemotherapy ± TRT. Dose fractionation appears important. PCI was associated with an increase in overall and specific grade 3+ AE rates.

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation: 5 years on… [^cfc7d352]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2014). Medium credibility.

With advances in cancer management, patients are living with the long-term sequelae of both cancer and its treatment. This era of cancer survivorship poses unique challenges to the interdisciplinary cancer team in terms of management and prevention of treatment-related toxicities. This paper describes the case of a 55-year-old patient with neurocognitive disturbance as a result of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). Five years after a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, she is now an inpatient at a specialist palliative care unit. The current evidence for PCI and for potentially modifiable risk factors for neurocognitive disturbance as a consequence of PCI is explored.

### WITHDRAWN: cranial irradiation for preventing brain metastases of small cell lung cancer in patients in complete remission [^34a36aab]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prophylactic cranial irradiation halves the rate of brain metastases in patients with small cell lung cancer. Individual randomized trials conducted on patients in complete remission were unable to clarify whether this treatment improves survival.

Objectives

This study aims to test whether prophylactic cranial irradiation prolongs survival of patients with small cell lung cancer in complete remission.

Search Methods

Published and unpublished trials were eligible. Electronic databases (Medline, Cancerlit, Excerpta Medica, Biosis from 1965 to 1998), reference lists of trial publications, review articles and relevant books were used to identify potentially eligible trials. The search was also guided by discussions with investigators and experts, and the examination of meeting proceedings and of the Physician Data Query clinical trial registry.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing prophylactic cranial irradiation with no prophylactic cranial irradiation in patients with small cell lung cancer in complete remission.

Data Collection and Analysis

Meta-analysis based on updated individual data. The main endpoint was survival.

Main Results

Seven trials with a total of 987 participants were included. The relative risk of death in the treatment group compared to the control group was 0.84 (95% confidence interval = 0.73 to 0.97, P = 0.01), corresponding to a 5.4 percent increase in the 3-year survival rate (from 15.3 percent in the control group to 20.7 percent in the treatment group). Prophylactic cranial irradiation also increased disease-free survival (relative risk = 0.75, 95% confidence interval = 0.65 to 0.86, P < 0.001) and decreased the risk of brain metastases (relative risk = 0.46, 95% confidence interval = 0.38 to 0.57, P < 0.001). Increasing doses of irradiation decreased the risk of brain metastases when four groups (8 Gy, 24–25 Gy, 30 Gy, 36–40 Gy) were analyzed [trend test, P = 0.02], but the effect on survival did not differ significantly according to the dose. We found a trend (P = 0.01) for a decrease in the brain metastasis risk in favour of earlier administration of cranial irradiation after the initiation of induction treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic cranial irradiation significantly improves survival and disease-free survival for patients with small cell lung cancer in complete remission. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the potential greater benefit on brain metastasis rate suggested when cranial irradiation is given earlier or at higher doses.

### Re-examining prophylactic cranial irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2f32928e]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, PCI was associated with improved overall survival and reduced cumulative incidence of brain metastases in patients with SCLC, irrespective of disease stage. However, in a subgroup analysis limited to studies in which all patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging after completion of initial chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and excluded patients found to have brain metastases, PCI was associated with decreased incidence of brain metastases but had no effect on survival. This systematic review and meta-analysis captures the entire literature on PCI, making it feasible for the first time to address concerns around the efficacy of routine brain imaging as part of restaging investigations.

Our findings are discordant with those of prior meta-analyses that have found a protective effect of the use of PCI on survival. Several meta-analyses have also been published in an attempt to assess the results by Takahashi et al. however these only examined the impact of restaging modalityor did not control for absence of brain metastases among patients who did not receive PCI. None of these studies, therefore, excluded the presence of brain metastases among the control cohort of patients who did not receive PCI. In a previous study, 13% of patients presented with asymptomatic brain metastases at the time of diagnosis, which remained asymptomatic in a substantial portion of patients after completion of chemotherapy. In another report, asymptomatic brain metastases were identified in 33% of patients with limited stage SCLC initially thought to have good response to chemoradiotherapy. Consequently, previous evidence likely included patients in the treatment or control groups who harboured asymptomatic brain metastases and received a therapeutic benefit from PCI in the treatment groups or showed shortened survival confounded by the presence of brain metastases in the control groups. The current study is the first to control for the absence of brain metastases among all patients irrespective of PCI receipt — a pivotal differentiating feature between study by Takahashi et al. and previous trials — and suggest a need to re-examine the conclusions derived from remote studies while we await results from prospective trials.

MRI, which has high fidelity, has led to a paradigm shift in brain management and is now recommended as a preferred means to detect BM in patients with SCLC. The conflicting survival outcomes in the EORTC trial and Japanese trial of ES-SCLC challenged the contemporary rationality to recommend PCI for LS-SCLC, which was mainly based on pre-MRI data. Several small retrospective studies have explored the role of PCI for LS-SCLC in the contemporary era. Nevertheless, the findings varied. Michael Yan et al. reported the outcomes of PCI for LS-SCLC over a 20-year period at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. The findings showed that PCI contributed to improved OS and lower BM risk (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.32–2.69; HR 4.66, 95% CI 2.58–8.40, respectively). Conversely, in a recent analysis of 297 patients with LS-SCLC, PCI was not independently associated with substantial improvement in OS (HR 0.844, 95% CI 0.604–1.180, p = 0.32). S. Ghanta et al. demonstrated that PCI significantly prolonged neurological survival (HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08–0.65; p = 0.01) and brain metastasis-free survival (HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12–0.51; p < 0.01) but had no role in improving OS (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.49–1.11; p < 0.01). We included 1068 patients with LS-SCLC, including 324 in each cohort who were matched for further comparisons. The findings revealed that PCI led to a consistent reduction in BM rate, but this reduction failed to translate into significantly improved OS. This analysis, which has the largest sample size thus far, offers an important reference for future exploration.

The median progression-free survival (PFS) was substantially longer with PCI (14.7 months, 95% CI 11.5–17.9 months) than with surveillance (10.0 months, 95% CI 7.8–12.2 months), with an HR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.61–0.90, p = 0.002). A total of 410 patients developed disease progression during follow-up, of which 192 patients were included in the PCI cohort. At the time of confirmed disease progression, 84 patients had only BM (22 of 192 [11.5%] in the PCI cohort vs. 62 of 218 [28.4%] in the surveillance cohort); 23 patients had BM combined with extracranial progression (6 of 192 [3.1%] vs. 17 of 218 [7.8%]); and 303 patients had only extracranial progression (164 of 192 [85.4%] vs. 139 of 218 [63.8%]).

Results

Patient characteristics

Between June 2009 and June 2019, 1068 patients with LS-SCLC who achieved a good response to first-line CRT were consecutively enrolled in this study; among these patients, 440 received PCI (Fig. 1). The baseline and therapeutic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Overall, the majority were male (69.9%) and had a good performance status (ECOG 0–1 96.0%). Most patients (82.2%) had stage III disease at the time of diagnosis, and 96.3% of patients received etoposide + platinum chemotherapy. Patients in the PCI cohort were relatively younger than those in the surveillance cohort, with a median age of 57 (IQR 51–63) vs. 59 (52–64). The proportion of patients with concurrent CRT was significantly higher in the PCI cohort than in the surveillance cohort (44.8% vs. 28.0%, p < 0.001). In addition, 32.7% of patients in the PCI cohort achieved CR after CRT, while 26.1% achieved CR in the surveillance cohort (p = 0.019).

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in SCLC — incidence and survival effects: Intracranial metastases occur in > 50% of patients with SCLC, and randomized studies show that PCI is effective in decreasing the incidence of cerebral metastases; a meta-analysis of randomized PCI trials reported a reduction in the 3-year incidence of brain metastases from 58.6% (control) to 33.3% (PCI) and an increase in 3-year overall survival (OS) from 15.3% (control) to 20.7% (PCI), supporting that PCI seems to prevent, and not simply delay, brain metastases, with a retrospective study also finding increased survival at 2, 5, and 10 years versus no PCI.

### Small cell lung cancer, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^7b6cad36]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN small cell lung cancer — prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI): Intracranial metastases occur in greater than 50% of patients with SCLC, and randomized studies show that PCI is effective in decreasing the incidence of cerebral metastases, though most individual studies did not have sufficient power to show a meaningful survival advantage. A meta-analysis of randomized PCI trials reported a reduction in the 3-year incidence of brain metastases from 58.6% in the control group to 33.3% in the PCI-treated group and an increase in 3-year overall survival from 15.3% in the control group to 20.7% in the PCI group; although the number of patients with extensive-stage SCLC was small, the observed benefit was similar in patients with both limited-stage and extensive-stage SCLC. In limited-stage SCLC responding to chemoradiotherapy and MRI-negative before and after primary treatment, median overall survival was 26 months (range, 19.4–32.6 months) with PCI versus 14 months without PCI (range, 11.4–16.6 months; P < .0001). In an MRI-staged limited-stage cohort of 49 patients, median overall survival was 55 months with PCI versus 24 months without PCI (P < .05), and at 1 year the probability of symptomatic brain metastases was 4% with PCI versus 22% without PCI (P < .05). For extensive-stage SCLC without brain metastases, a large retrospective analysis of 4257 patients showed median overall survival 13.9 vs. 11.1 months with PCI versus no PCI (P < .0001), and another analysis (n = 397) found overall survival 13.5 vs. 8.5 months, respectively (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.77; P = 0.0005). In an EORTC randomized trial of 286 patients with extensive-stage SCLC responding to chemotherapy, PCI decreased symptomatic brain metastases (14.6% vs. 40.4%) and increased the 1-year survival rate.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation — evidence of survival benefit in complete-response and limited-stage settings: PCI has been shown to positively influence survival in patients with LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC who achieve a complete response (CR), with a meta-analysis of seven randomized studies showing the 3-year survival rate was 5.4% better for PCI (20.7% vs 15.3%, P = 0.01), reflecting a 35% increase in 3-year survivors, and a retrospective SEER analysis of 7,995 LS-SCLC patients showing 5-year survival of 11% without PCI vs 19% with PCI (P < .001) and concluding PCI is indicated for LS-SCLC.

### Models support prophylactic cranial irradiation… [^b1dc4eea]. ASCO (2006). Low credibility.

In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Lee et al 1present a rather unique and useful statistical interpretation of the waxing question of prophylactic cranial irradiation for patients with small-cell lung cancer. The concept of PCI for SCLC has its origins in the comparison of the behavior of this disease with childhood leukemia, a disease that is essentially systemic in nature, widespread at diagnosis, and exquisitely chemosensitive, with a high rate of complete response. Several clinical trials of PCI have demonstrated clearly a dramatic decrease in the development of brain metastasis in patients receiving PCI, and meta-analysis of the data demonstrate that control of intracranial disease actually results in a modest but real survival gain, the magnitude of which is comparable to that achieved with thoracic irradiation in SCLC.

This survival benefit is not unexpected, given that the survival of patients who develop brain metastases is only about 3 months, and hence any retardation of this process should lengthen survival. v3. 7 and
4. 1 v3. 7). Therefore, for a low rate of toxicity, the degree of toxicity does not overwhelm the QALE benefit. Even with a moderate incidence of neurotoxicity, PCI continues to offer superior QALE. Thus, current survival expectations would predict superior QALE for most scenarios for SCLC patients in complete response treated with PCI. 9From these data, it might be logical to assume that smaller fractions would be equally effective in controlling microscopic disease in the brain, hypothetically resulting in lower neurocognitive decline, thereby improving the therapeutic ratio and changing the model described by the authors.

Recently, we and others have started exploring the possibility of hippocampal-sparing whole-brain radiotherapy, which could also potentially alter the PCI therapeutic ratio.
10. 12Patients with SCLC who do not receive PCI are obviously spared the neurotoxicity of PCI but are also exposed to the neurologic decline associated with progressive brain metastases, resulting in a lowering of their QALE, which has not been modeled in the article by Lee et al. 1However, despite these limitations of the model, at current rates of survival and observed neurotoxicity, PCI consistently results in superior QALE for patients with SCLC, and this conclusion should provide further support to continue its use in appropriately selected patients.

### Radiation therapy for small cell lung cancer: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^29acfe8e]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASTRO guideline — Prophylactic cranial RT rationale and imaging restaging state that among patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who undergo chemoradiation, approximately 59% to 69% ultimately develop brain metastases (BMs), and a meta-analysis demonstrated an absolute 5.4% OS advantage at 3 years with PCI. In the context of PCI consideration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) restaging after completion of chemoradiation is recommended, with studies indicating interval development of BMs in 20% to 32% of patients. MRI with contrast is the recommended imaging modality given higher sensitivity for small lesions, while contrast-enhanced CT maintains a role in staging and surveillance for patients with pacemakers or other MRI contraindications.

### Hippocampal avoidance prophylactic cranial irradiation: a new standard of care? [^2e763f93]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

Accompanying ArticleFree accessORIGINAL REPORTSRandomized Phase III Trial of Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation With or Without Hippocampal Avoidance for Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A GICOR-GOECP-SEOR Study Given the high propensity for small-cell lung cancer to develop brain metastases, prophylactic cranial irradiation is a standard for care for patients with limited-stage SCLC and a therapeutic option for those with extensive-stage SCLC. 5-7In an effort to decrease these cognitive risks, hippocampal avoidance techniques have been developed using intensity-modulated radiotherapy to significantly lower radiation dose exposure to the hippocampal neural stem-cell compartment, while delivering tumoricidal radiation dose to the remainder of the brain.
8.

In the article that accompanies this editorial, to address some of these questions Rodríguez De Dios et al 13reported on a phase III trial comparing HA-PCI to standard PCI in 150 patients with SCLC conducted by the Oncologic Group for the Study of Lung Cancer-Spanish Radiation Oncology Group. The primary end point was delayed free recall on the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test at 3 months. 16Figure 1C demonstrates an example where real-time pretreatment central review of a patient enrolled on NRG CC001 prevented an unacceptable protocol deviation related to hippocampal delineation. 18, 19To address this knowledge gap, NRG CC009 randomly assigns patients with SCLC and 1–10 brain metastases to either stereotactic radiosurgery or HA-WBRT plus memantine with a primary end point of cognitive toxicity.

There is also interest in whether the addition of immunotherapy in SCLC management improves brain metastasis outcomes, and trials are being launched to evaluate the brain activity of chemoimmunotherapy for patients with SCLC brain metastases.
20. In conclusion, PCI for patients with SCLC continues to evolve with opportunities to prevent associated cognitive toxicity through improvements in radiation delivery and greater sensitivity of brain surveillance. Trials of HA during PCI have contributed significantly to this evolution. Ongoing and future trials incorporating rigorous methodology and knowledge from cognitive neuroscience will continue to refine and personalize brain management strategies for patients with SCLC.

### Radiation therapy for small cell lung cancer: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^e23cdcc0]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC) reduces symptomatic BMs in a randomized trial but MRI surveillance may be an alternative; for those electing PCI, acceptable dose-fractionations include 2500 cGy in 10 fractions or a regimen delivering 2000 cGy in 5 fractions of 400 cGy used in randomized data. In ES-SCLC, PCI in "a randomized trial of patients with any response to upfront chemotherapy" "reduced symptomatic BMs and resulted in improved OS". A Japanese randomized study of "MRI surveillance compared with PCI" showed that PCI "resulted in a significantly decreased burden of BMs… (48% vs 69%). However, OS was not improved", so "for patients who can adhere to the schedule, MRI surveillance can be considered an alternative to PCI", and "The task force recommends consultation with a radiation oncologist regarding the benefits and risks of PCI versus MRI surveillance". Also, "patients with ES-SCLC who progress after initial therapy should not be recommended for PCI". If PCI is chosen, "data supporting utilization of 2500 cGy in 10 fractions are likely applicable", and "the strongest randomized data supporting PCI for ES-SCLC delivered 2000 cGy in 5 fractions of 400 cGy to 62% of the patients… that fractionation scheme also garnered support… although neurocognitive effects for this scheme have not been studied".

### Prophylactic cranial irradiation for small-cell lung cancer: time for a reassessment… [^770537b2]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

1, 2Drawing on experience in pediatric acute leukemia, investigators developed PCI with the rationale that sterilization of the CNS, a sanctuary site for SCLC, could improve survival in treated LSCLC. In addition, there is the position that the reduction of CNS metastases is inherently beneficial as this will prevent potentially devastating complications. For PCI to be recommended, one or both of the following must be demonstrated: overall survival is improved, or quality of life is improved. The burden of proof is on those who advocate for this approach. The standard should be similar to that for a new drug: Evidence should be provided in controlled clinical trials. The relative risk for CNS metastasis was more striking at 0.
46.

There was no effect on the cumulative incidence of other metastases or locoregional relapse; therefore, the conclusion was that PCI reduced the incidence of CNS metastases and that the improvement in OS was solely a consequence of superior control in the CNS. Absolute reduction in mortality was 5. 4%. It is important to note that the criteria for entry, treatment, and assessment of patients enrolled in these studies were highly variable: some patients with ESCLC were enrolled, chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens differed with some patients receiving induction chemotherapy or radiation or the combination, and the methods of establishing response differed. A retrospective study of 280 patients with LSCLC who achieved a partial or complete response from Korea found that use of initial PET scanning for determining stage eliminated the value of PCI.

Risk of brain metastasis as the first site of treatment failure was lower in patients who received PCI versus those who did not, with the cumulative incidence of intracranial metastasis being 25. 4% versus
38. 9%, respectively. 6At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 283 patients were evaluated. There was a relatively low risk of failure in the CNS of patients with low-stage disease versus those with locally advanced disease.
7. Biologically equivalent doses for these schedules range from 25 to 39 Gy. The primary end point for the trial was the development of symptomatic brain metastases. There was a substantial reduction in the risk of symptomatic brain metastases and an improvement in OS.

### Radiation therapy for small cell lung cancer: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^587136b5]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2020). High credibility.

ASTRO small cell lung cancer radiation therapy guideline — abstract recommendations state: The task force strongly recommends definitive thoracic radiation therapy (RT) administered once or twice daily early in the course of treatment for limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC); adjuvant RT is conditionally recommended in surgically resected patients with positive margins or nodal metastases; involved field RT delivered using conformal advanced treatment modalities to postchemotherapy volumes is also strongly recommended. For patients with stage I or II node negative disease, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or conventional fractionation is strongly recommended, and chemotherapy should be delivered before or after SBRT. In LS-SCLC, prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is strongly recommended for stage II or III patients who respond to chemoradiation, conditionally not recommended for stage I patients, and should be a shared decision for patients at higher risk of neurocognitive toxicities. In extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC), radiation oncologist consultation for consideration of PCI versus magnetic resonance surveillance is strongly recommended, and the use of thoracic RT is strongly recommended in select patients with ES-SCLC after chemotherapy treatment, including a conditional recommendation in those responding to chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

### Current role of surgery in small cell lung carcinoma [^840ea6e9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Small cell lung carcinoma represents 15–20% of lung cancer. Is is characterized by rapid growth and early disseminated disease with poor outcome. For many years surgery was considered a contraindication in Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) since radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy were found to be more efficient in the management of these patients. Never the less some surgeons continue to be in favor of surgery as part of a combined modality treatment in patients with SCLC. The reevaluation of the role of surgery in this group of patients is based on clinical data indicating a much better prognosis in selected patients with limited disease (T1-2, N0, M0), the high rate of local recurrence after chemoradiotherapy with surgery considered eventually more efficient in the local control of the disease and the fact that surgery is the most accurate tool to access the response to chemotherapy, identify carcinoids misdiagnosed as SCLC and treat the Non Small Cell Lung Cancer component of mixed tumors. Performing surgery for local disease SCLC requires a complete preoperative assessment to exclude the presence of nodal involvement. In stage I surgery must always be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, while in stage II and III surgery must be planned only in the context of clinical trials and after a pathologic response to induction chemoradiotherapy has been confirmed. Prophylactic cranial irradiation should be used to reduce the incidence of brain metastasis.
