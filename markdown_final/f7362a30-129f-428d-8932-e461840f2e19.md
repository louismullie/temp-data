## Question

Tell me the indications of abscess resection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when abscess resection is indicated across different anatomic sites and etiologies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that abscess resection is not the default and that source control plus antibiotics is first-line. Then, I should categorize abscess types by location and etiology to anchor indications. Next, I will outline universal triggers for urgent or elective resection. After that, I will examine site-specific nuances for diverticular, Crohn's, anorectal, brain, liver, and other abscesses. Finally, I will integrate patient factors, timing, and a practical decision algorithm, while double-checking areas of controversy and correcting any misstatements as needed.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: abscess resection is generally reserved for failure of nonoperative management, persistent or complicated disease, or specific anatomic scenarios where resection changes outcomes; otherwise, antibiotics with or without percutaneous drainage is the initial approach, and I need to ensure I do not overcall surgery as first-line therapy [^111Zm4rP] [^116aGUP5].

> I will now categorize the clinical contexts because indications vary by site and etiology; the major buckets include diverticular abscesses, Crohn's-related intra-abdominal abscesses, anorectal abscesses, brain abscesses, liver abscesses, and miscellaneous entities like tuberculous chest wall or thyroid abscesses, and I should keep these separate as I proceed to avoid conflating guidance.

> Next, I should review universal triggers for resection that cut across etiologies; failure of antibiotics with or without percutaneous drainage with ongoing sepsis or clinical deterioration mandates operative source control, diffuse peritonitis requires emergency surgery, persistent or recurrent abscess despite appropriate therapy is a strong indication, and fistula formation to adjacent organs often necessitates resection of the diseased segment rather than repeated drainage attempts, so I need to keep these as high-priority red flags in decision-making [^111rUmTH] [^111Zm4rP] [^116aGUP5] [^112waPhf].

> For diverticular abscesses, let me think about size thresholds and sequencing; small abscesses under about 3–5 cm can often be managed with antibiotics alone, larger abscesses generally merit image-guided percutaneous drainage plus antibiotics, and elective sigmoid resection after nonoperative resolution is commonly recommended due to substantial recurrence risk, though I should acknowledge that some contemporary data question routine elective resection and support individualized decisions, so I must not overstate this as obligatory in all patients [^112rHHz4] [^116nqLEZ] [^115LnGMd] [^112MjRYT] [^111Zm4rP].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing and operative strategy; after successful nonoperative treatment of a diverticular abscess, elective resection is typically offered, with colonoscopy 6–8 weeks later to exclude malignancy, and laparoscopic approaches are reasonable when feasible, though evidence quality is limited and patient factors should guide the choice of approach and timing [^117WK26h] [^111Zm4rP] [^111whkip].

> For Crohn's disease intra-abdominal abscesses, I need to ensure I sequence therapy correctly; first-line is antibiotics with or without percutaneous drainage, immunosuppression should be held until source control is achieved, and then interval elective resection or continuation of medical therapy is individualized, with percutaneous drainage serving as a bridge to reduce stoma rates and extent of resection in high-risk or malnourished patients [^114QAcGc] [^112zqB9R] [^116aGUP5] [^114rAJyF].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence on avoiding surgery after drainage; some series suggest that after successful drainage and optimization, up to about 30% may avoid bowel resection, but recurrence is higher with drainage alone than with resection, so I should frame nonresection as a conditional strategy rather than a blanket alternative, especially in patients with strictures, fistulas, or refractory disease [^115Z7Khm] [^116aGUP5] [^111do7rZ].

> For anorectal abscesses, I should confirm that the primary treatment is incision and drainage, not resection; routine fistula exploration at the index drainage is discouraged to avoid iatrogenic injury, antibiotics are reserved for systemic illness or immunocompromise, and recurrence risk is high, which underscores the need for complete drainage and appropriate follow-up rather than immediate resection [^1171Dzox] [^115oWPSD] [^1153wkw9] [^115kbXLr].

> But wait, what if the abscess is in the brain; I need to check neurosurgical indications carefully; for brain abscess, early neurosurgical aspiration or excision is recommended whenever feasible, except in toxoplasmosis, because surgery provides diagnostic material, reduces mass effect, and improves outcomes, so I should not delay neurosurgical consultation in suspected cases [^117Va5vM] [^117EbUSe].

> For liver abscesses, let me reconsider the role of resection; most pyogenic or amebic abscesses are managed with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, and hepatic resection is reserved for refractory, multiloculated, or fungal disease, or when malignancy is suspected, so I should avoid implying routine resection for liver abscess without these features [^112ukZKN] [^114YGvk1].

> I should also remember special sites; for tuberculous chest wall abscesses, complete resection with rib removal plus antituberculous therapy is recommended to reduce recurrence, and for acute suppurative thyroiditis with abscess, surgical drainage is indicated alongside antibiotics, so etiology-specific guidance still matters [^115WhqwF] [^115mWBaJ].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers that tilt toward resection; immunocompromised hosts, malnutrition, multiple or multiloculated abscesses, and failure to improve within 48–72 hours despite appropriate therapy increase the likelihood that resection will be needed, and I need to integrate these into the risk-benefit discussion with the patient [^116aGUP5] [^111rUmTH] [^117Va5vM].

> I will now examine timing considerations; urgent resection is indicated for diffuse peritonitis, uncontrolled sepsis, or abscess rupture, whereas elective resection is appropriate after sepsis control and optimization, often 6–8 weeks later, with the added benefit of allowing colon evaluation to exclude cancer in diverticular disease, and I should confirm that this interval balances safety and oncologic prudence [^111Zm4rP] [^117WK26h].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway without oversimplifying; start with source control and antibiotics, add percutaneous drainage for larger or complex abscesses, reassess clinically and radiologically at 48–72 hours, escalate to operative management if there is deterioration or nonresponse, and after stabilization, discuss elective resection for diverticular disease or interval resection versus continued medical therapy for Crohn's, tailoring to anatomy, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^111Zm4rP] [^116aGUP5] [^114QAcGc].

> Hold on, I should verify one potential misstatement from the trace; I initially thought "laparoscopic resection is preferred for diverticular abscess", but wait, the evidence base is limited and heterogeneous, so I should correct that to "laparoscopic resection is a reasonable option in experienced hands when anatomy and patient factors permit, with outcomes comparable to open in selected series, though high-quality randomized data are sparse", which aligns with the Cochrane review and contemporary guidance [^111whkip].

> Finally, I need to ensure shared decision-making is explicit; recurrence after nonoperative management of diverticular abscess is common but not universal, and some patients will prefer observation after successful nonoperative care, so I should present recurrence rates, risks of emergency surgery, and the potential benefits and risks of elective resection to support individualized choices rather than a one-size-fits-all recommendation [^115LnGMd] [^112MjRYT] [^111Zm4rP].

Abscess resection is indicated when there is **failure of medical therapy** or **percutaneous drainage** [^116aGUP5], or when the abscess is **large, multiloculated, or refractory** [^114rAJyF] [^114jqSEM]. Additional indications include **persistent infection** despite appropriate antibiotics, **suspicion of malignancy** [^notfound], or **recurrent abscesses** [^116nqLEZ]. In Crohn's disease, resection is considered for refractory abscesses or when medical therapy fails [^117SPgkx] [^114Ho9J8]. For diverticular abscesses, elective resection is recommended after successful nonoperative management to prevent recurrence [^116nqLEZ] [^116EmP2a]. Brain abscesses require surgical intervention when there is mass effect, failure of medical therapy, or diagnostic uncertainty [^114jqSEM] [^112YEXnr]. The decision to resect should be individualized based on clinical judgment, patient comorbidities, and anatomical location [^111Zm4rP].

---

## General indications for abscess resection

- **Failure of medical therapy**: Persistent infection despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care [^114YGvk1].

- **Failure of percutaneous drainage**: In cases where percutaneous drainage is technically unsuccessful or contraindicated [^111rUmTH].

- **Large or multiloculated abscesses**: Abscesses that are large, multiloculated, or refractory to conservative management [^116aGUP5].

- **Persistent or recurrent abscesses**: Abscesses that recur despite adequate initial treatment [^111rXLuU].

- **Suspicion of malignancy**: When there is a concern for underlying malignancy, particularly in cases of colorectal or hepatic abscesses [^notfound].

---

## Specific indications by anatomical location

### Intra-abdominal abscesses

- **Diverticular abscesses**: Elective resection is recommended after successful nonoperative management of diverticular abscesses to prevent recurrence and complications [^116nqLEZ] [^116EmP2a].

- **Crohn's disease-associated abscesses**: Surgical resection is indicated for refractory abscesses or when medical therapy fails [^117SPgkx] [^111rUmTH].

- **Appendiceal abscesses**: Interval appendectomy is recommended after initial nonoperative management to prevent recurrence [^notfound].

---

### Hepatic abscesses

In hepatic abscesses, **pyogenic abscesses** warrant resection when there is failure of medical therapy, persistent infection, or suspicion of malignancy [^notfound]. For **amebic abscesses**, surgical intervention is indicated in cases of rupture, secondary infection, or failure of medical therapy.

---

### Brain abscesses

In brain abscesses, **mass effect** with neurological compromise warrants surgical intervention [^112YEXnr]. Surgery is also indicated when there is failure of medical therapy or diagnostic uncertainty [^112YEXnr].

---

### Perianal abscesses

In perianal abscesses, **complex or recurrent abscesses** may require surgical excision or fistulotomy, particularly in patients with Crohn's disease [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing surgical decision

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Higher risk of recurrence and complications, often necessitating surgical intervention [^114LXYf8].

- **Comorbidities**: Patients with significant comorbidities may require individualized decision-making regarding surgical intervention [^111Zm4rP].

- **Patient preference**: Shared decision-making is essential, considering patient preferences and clinical judgment [^111Zm4rP].

---

## Timing of abscess resection

Urgent or emergent resection is indicated for **uncontrolled sepsis**, **rapidly progressing infection**, or **failure of conservative management** [^111rUmTH]. Elective resection is appropriate after stabilization of the patient and control of infection, particularly in cases of recurrent or persistent abscesses [^116nqLEZ].

---

## Contraindications to abscess resection

Contraindications include **poor surgical candidates** — patients with significant comorbidities or unstable hemodynamics — and **small, uncomplicated abscesses** that are likely to respond to medical therapy or percutaneous drainage [^116aGUP5].

---

Abscess resection is indicated for failure of medical therapy or percutaneous drainage, large or multiloculated abscesses, persistent or recurrent infections, and suspicion of malignancy. The decision to resect should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, anatomical location, and clinical judgment [^111Zm4rP].

Indications for liver volumetry

Future liver volume prior to major hepatectomy

Liver volumetry is indicated in patients undergoing major hepatic resection, defined as resection of four or more segments according to the Couinaud classification. Most hepatectomies are performed for the treatment of neoplasms, including primary liver cancer (e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma), liver metastases (e.g. from colorectal cancer) or certain benign tumours (e.g. giant haemangioma, adenoma, cystadenoma). Hepatectomies may also be performed for the management of localised abscesses (pyogenic, amoebic) or after trauma to the liver or biliary system. Different types of major hepatectomies — including left and right complete and extended hepatectomies — are outlined in Fig. 2. There has been a recent rise in the number of extended hepatectomies being performed as definitions of resectability have expanded; extended right hepatectomies are currently the most common form of hepatectomy, representing 70% of all hepatectomies.

### Surgical resection of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer: a systematic review of published studies [^116c9vtp]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

No consensus on the indications for surgical resection of colorectal liver metastases exists. This systematic review has been undertaken to assess the published evidence for its efficacy and safety and to identify prognostic factors. Studies were identified by computerised and hand searches of the literature, scanning references and contacting investigators. The outcome measures were overall survival, disease-free survival, postoperative morbidity and mortality, quality of life and cost effectiveness, and a qualitative summary of the trends across all studies was produced. Only 30 of 529 independent studies met all the eligibility criteria for the review, and data on 30-day mortality and morbidity only were included from a further nine studies. The best available evidence came from prospective case series, but only two studies reported outcomes for all patients undergoing surgery. The remainder reported outcomes for selected groups of patients: those undergoing hepatic resection or those undergoing curative resection. Postoperative mortality rates were generally low (median 2.8%). The majority of studies described only serious postoperative morbidity, the most common being bile leak and associated perihepatic abscess. Approximately 30% of patients remained alive 5 years after resection and around two-thirds of these are disease free. The quality of the majority of published papers was poor and ascertaining the benefits of surgical resection of colorectal hepatic metastases is difficult in the absence of randomised trials. However, it is clear that there is group of patients with liver metastases who may become long-term disease-free survivors following hepatic resection. Such survival is rare in apparently comparable patients who do not have surgical treatment. Further work is needed to more accurately define this group of patients and to determine whether the addition of adjuvant treatments results in improved survival.

### Systematic review of evidence and consensus on diverticulitis: an analysis of national and international guidelines [^112H69fh]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

The study aimed to analyse the currently available national and international guidelines for areas of consensus and contrasting recommendations in the treatment of diverticulitis and thereby to design questions for future research.

Method

MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were systematically searched for guidelines on diverticular disease and diverticulitis. Inclusion was confined to papers in English and those < 10 years old. The included topics were classified as consensus or controversy between guidelines, and the highest level of evidence was scored as sufficient (Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine Level of Evidence of 3a or higher) or insufficient.

Results

Six guidelines were included and all topics with recommendations were compared. Overall, in 13 topics consensus was reached and 10 topics were regarded as controversial. In five topics, consensus was reached without sufficient evidence and in three topics there was no evidence and no consensus. Clinical staging, the need for intraluminal imaging, dietary restriction, duration of antibiotic treatment, the protocol for abscess treatment, the need for elective surgery in subgroups of patients, the need for surgery after abscess treatment and the level of the proximal resection margin all lack consensus or evidence.

Conclusion

Evidence on the diagnosis and treatment of diverticular disease and diverticulitis ranged from nonexistent to strong, regardless of consensus. The most relevant research questions were identified and proposed as topics for future research.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114Ho9J8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease — when to refer for surgery and common indications: Surgery may be considered for symptomatic CD localized to a short segment of bowel, and surgery is required to treat emergent complications. A resection of a segment of diseased intestine is the most common surgery for a patient with CD. Indications include intractable hemorrhage, perforation, persisting or recurrent obstruction, abscess, dysplasia or cancer, or medically refractory disease; the most common indication for intestinal resection is small bowel obstruction from a fibrostenotic stricture, with penetrating CD as the second most common. Although resection is the most definitive treatment for a stricture, strictureplasty is an option as a bowel‑preserving measure in patients at risk for short bowel syndrome; multidisciplinary management and early surgical consultation are appropriate.

Esophageal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic aspergillosis — management indicates that for localized lesions that are refractory to medical therapy, surgical intervention should be considered (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). Because of the paucity of data for esophageal and gastrointestinal aspergillosis, there is no clear indication of optimal therapy, and a rational approach is to combine both medical and surgical therapy, and medical therapy for hepatic abscesses may be effective and preclude the need for surgical resection.

### Multicentre study of non-surgical management of diverticulitis with abscess formation [^113yyiZz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The comparison of PCD and no PCD in this cohort showed that patients who underwent PCD seemed to have worse outcomes, in terms of a greater likelihood of short‐term emergency resections, complications, disease progression and treatment failure, as well as more long‐term complications. However, confounding by indication cannot be excluded from this analysis and differences may primarily reflect disease and clinical severity. Indeed, patients undergoing PCD had more advanced disease than those in the no‐PCD group, with the majority of patients having Hinchey stage II disease (84.3 versus 40.7 per cent; P < 0.001). Patients in the PCD group had larger abscesses, as well as significantly more distant abscesses or multiple abscesses. Hence, when the patients were stratified by Hinchey grade, most short‐ and long‐term outcomes did not differ between the PCD and no‐PCD groups, with the exception of short‐term complications and long‐term resections among patients with Hinchey II disease, and long‐term complications in those with Hinchey Ib diverticulitis. More importantly, in the multivariable analyses, the initial treatment strategy did not seem to be a predictor with regard to treatment failure, emergency surgery, or sigmoid resection in long‐term follow‐up, strengthening the conclusion that treatment strategy has no effect on the outcome.

The short‐term mortality rate in the present study ranged between 0 and 2 per cent across the groups analysed, which is comparable to pooled average mortality rates derived from previous studies of treatment with antibiotics (0.6 per cent) and PCD (1.6 per cent) 14. Short‐term emergency surgery rates ranged from 5.1 to 15 per cent, which is also largely in accordance with the pooled average of 12.1 per cent 14. Reported rates of diverticulitis recurrence vary from 3 to 68 per cent, with an average of 28 per cent; recurrent disease consists mostly of uncomplicated or locally complicated diverticulitis 10. Although rates may vary between studies because of differences in median follow‐up or in definitions, the recurrence rates reported in the present study seem to be in line with earlier reports 27, 28. In light of the long‐term surgery and recurrence rates in the present study, which were relatively low (and the recurrences mostly uncomplicated), it can be questioned whether elective surgery is indicated in conservatively managed patients, as surgery comes with an inherent risk of complication and most patients seem to fare well with conservative management alone.

### Elective resection versus observation after nonoperative management of complicated diverticulitis with abscess: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115LnGMd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Initial management of diverticulitis with abscess formation has progressed from a surgical emergency to nonoperative management with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage followed by delayed resection. Controversy has arisen regarding the necessity of elective surgery, when nonoperative management has successfully resolved the index attack.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the literature to determine the recurrence rate in those patients who were successfully managed nonoperatively and determine the role of elective surgical resection.

Data Sources

An electronic literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Collected Reviews performed from 1986 to 2014. The search terms used were as follows: "diverticulitis", "abscess", "diverticular abscess", "percutaneous drainage", and "surgery".

Study Selection

Studies included for review evaluated the management of diverticular abscesses and the subsequent role of delayed elective resection.

Interventions

All of the studies were systematically reviewed and underwent a meta-analysis.

Main Outcome Measures

End points were the need for surgery and recurrent attacks without surgery.

Results

Twenty-two studies reporting a total of 1051 patients with acute diverticulitis with abscess formation (modified Hinchey grades IB and II) were included in the review. Percutaneous drainage was successful in 49% patients (diameter, > 3 cm) and antibiotic therapy in 14% patients. Urgent surgery during the index hospitalization was performed in 30% of patients, elective resection in 36%, and no surgery in 35%. Recurrence rates were high, with 39% in patients awaiting elective resection and 18% in the nonsurgery group, with an overall recurrence rate of 28%. Of the whole cohort, only 28% had no surgery and no recurrence during follow-up.

Limitations

Sample size, heterogeneity, selection and treatment bias, and limited follow-up of included studies were limitations to this study.

Conclusions

The evidence from the literature is weak but still suggests that complicated diverticulitis with abscess formation is associated with a high probability of resective surgery, whereas conservative management may result in chronic or recurrent diverticular symptoms.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the surgical management of Crohn's disease [^116aGUP5]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2020). High credibility.

Penetrating Crohn's disease with abscess — antibiotics, percutaneous drainage (PD), and surgery: Patients with penetrating Crohn's disease with abscess formation may be managed with antibiotics with or without drainage followed by interval elective resection or medical therapy depending on the clinical situation and patient preferences (Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B). Smaller abscesses (< 3 cm) can generally be treated with antibiotics alone, whereas larger abscesses are typically treated with antibiotics and PD. Successful PD, defined as abscess resolution and avoidance of subsequent surgery, occurs in 23% to 78% of patients; abscess recurrence is significantly higher after PD alone versus surgical intervention (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.03–4.54; p = 0.04), and factors associated with PD failure include concomitant steroid use, colonic disease, and large, multiloculated, or multifocal abscesses. Preoperative PD combined with antibiotics typically improves postoperative outcomes and shortens length of stay; in a meta-analysis of 513 patients with spontaneous abscesses, postoperative complications were significantly lower with PD followed by surgery versus surgery at presentation (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23–0.83; p = 0.03).

### Indications for elective sigmoid resection in diverticular disease [^114LXYf8]. Annals of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

To prevent an acute surgery, classic indications for elective sigmoid resections concerning diverticulitis have usually been based on the number of recurrent episodes. Since 2005 these indications have been challenged, primarily because the majority of patients first present themselves with acute complications at their first episode.

Methods

Between 1990 and 2000, a cohort analysis was conducted involving all patients admitted to the VU University Medical Center with the diagnosis of diverticulitis, with a follow-up until January 2009. To identify those patients who might benefit from elective sigmoid resection, several risk factors were analyzed.

Results

Of 291 patients examined, 111 (38%) were treated conservatively and 180 (62%) underwent surgery, of which 108 acute and 72 elective. The conservatively treated episodes of diverticulitis showed a recurrence rate of 48% (88 patients). Indications for elective surgery were recurrent attacks of diverticulitis with persistent complaints (36%), complaints of stenosis (40%), fistula (14%), persistent abscesses (3%), and recurrent diverticular bleeding (7%). Of the 74% of the patients approached laparoscopically, the overall morbidity was 22% with no mortality. The main indication for an AO was perforation with general peritonitis, holding for 57% of the acutely operated patients. Other indications were abscesses (22%), stenosis with obstruction (11%), failure of conservative therapy (6%), or diverticular bleeding (4%). Hartmann's procedure was the most frequently performed procedure (58%). This acutely operated population was associated with high morbidity (56%) and mortality (13%), perforation leads to 10% mortality and other causes to 3%. Of those patients undergoing acute surgery, 20% had a history of diverticulitis. Moreover, risk factor analysis showed that those patients having one or more of the following indications: (1) using immunosuppression therapy, (2) having chronic renal failure, or (3) collagen-vascular diseases, had a significant 5-fold greater risk (36% vs. 7%) of a perforation in recurrent episodes of diverticulitis.

Conclusion

In the treatment of diverticular disease, indications for an elective sigmoid resection should not be based on the number of episodes only. Clear indications for elective sigmoid resections are complaints of stenosis, fistulas, or recurrent diverticular bleeding. Furthermore, an elective sigmoid resection might be justified in high-risk patients, after a conservatively treated episode of diverticulitis, who use immunosuppression therapy and have chronic renal failure or collagen-vascular diseases.

### Surgical treatment of tuberculous abscess in the chest wall [^115WhqwF]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

We reviewed surgical cases of tuberculous abscess in the chest wall and analyzed the indications and methods of surgery, results, perioperative complications, and postoperative treatment.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 13 patients who underwent surgical treatment of tuberculous abscess in the chest wall between January 1994 and December 2003 at National Hospital Organization Tokyo Hospital.

Results

There was a past history of tuberculosis in 3 patients, concomitant active pulmonary tuberculosis in 5, concomitant active tuberculosis in the neck lymph node in 1, and no antecedent tuberculosis in 4. The locations of the tuberculous abscesses were right chest wall in 8 patients, left chest wall in 3, and anterior chest wall in 2. All of the patients underwent surgical treatment. In all patients, postoperative antituberculous treatments were administered. The combination regimens consisted of isoniazid (400 mg/d), rifampicin (450 mg/d), ethambutol (750 mg/d), pyrazinamide (1,500 mg/d), or some combination of these, and the duration ranged more than 6 months. Postoperative complications were not seen, and there was no recurrence.

Conclusions

We recommend a complete resection of the abscess with rib resection, and postoperative treatment by tuberculous chemotherapy regimen. We consider that these treatments reduce postoperative recurrence.

### Role of percutaneous abscess drainage in the management of young patients with Crohn disease [^114ZLC9v]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-abdominal abscess is a common complication of Crohn disease in children. Prior studies, primarily in adults, have shown that percutaneous abscess drainage is a safe and effective treatment for this condition; however, the data regarding this procedure and indications in pediatric patients is limited.

Objective

Our aim was to determine the success rate of percutaneous abscess drainage for abscesses related to Crohn disease in pediatric patients with a focus on treatment endpoints that are relevant in the era of biological medical therapy.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 25 cases of patients ages ≤ 20 years with Crohn disease who underwent percutaneous abscess drainage. Technical success was defined as catheter placement within the abscess with reduction in abscess size on post-treatment imaging. Clinical success was defined as (1) no surgery within 1 year of drainage or (2) surgical resection following drainage with no residual abscess at surgery or on preoperative imaging. Multiple clinical parameters were analyzed for association with treatment success or failure.

Results

All cases were classified as technical successes. Nineteen cases were classified as clinical successes (76%), including 7 patients (28%) who required no surgery within 1 year of percutaneous drainage and 12 patients (48%) who had elective bowel resection within 1 year. There was a statistically significant association between resumption of immunosuppressive therapy within 8 weeks of drainage and both clinical success (P < 0.01) and avoidance of surgery after 1 year (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Percutaneous abscess drainage is an effective treatment for Crohn disease-related abscesses in pediatric patients. Early resumption of immunosuppressive therapy is statistically associated with both clinical success and avoidance of bowel resection, suggesting a role for percutaneous drainage in facilitating prompt initiation of medical therapy and preventing surgical bowel resection.

4.8.2 Medical therapy

In the first instance, patient optimisation is required when localised perforation in Crohn's disease has led to abscess formation. Surgical intervention is mandatory within the context of free peritonitis and highly likely to be required at some stage in the setting of localised abscess formation. Ideally, surgery takes place following treatment of sepsis and treatment of nutritional deficiencies. Exclusive enteral nutrition can be an effective means of controlling intestinal inflammation without use of corticosteroids.

Good Practice Recommendation 10. Following treatment of an abdominal abscess in the setting of non-perianal fistulising Crohn's disease, joint medical and surgical discussion is required, but interval surgical resection is not always necessary (Agreement: 100%).

Some observers suggest that surgery may be avoided by percutaneous radiological drainage of abscesses and then resumption of medical therapy. The largest case series to date of 51 patients identified retrospectively from review of medical charts from a single centre over a 10-year period has shown that patients undergoing surgical resection were significantly less likely to develop abscess recurrence than those treated with antibiotics alone or percutaneous drainage over a mean follow-up of 3.75 years (12% vs 56%). Nevertheless, non-surgical approaches were successful in preventing subsequent surgery in almost half of the patients treated medically. An almost identical proportion of patients avoided surgery over long-term follow-up in a different series of 32 patients managed with percutaneous drainage for perforating Crohn's disease. This strategy, if successful in treating sepsis, is likely to lead to lower morbidity and potentially lower stoma rates.

### Outcomes following surgery for perforating Crohn's disease [^113DjYj8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The most common indications for surgery for patients with ileocolic Crohn's disease are fibrostenotic or perforating disease. The objective was to compare surgical outcomes of patients with perforating versus non-perforating disease following ileocolic resection.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of all patients who had their first ileocolic resection between 1990 and 2010, identified from a prospectively maintained inflammatory bowel disease database. Demographic information, preoperative medication, intraoperative findings and postoperative outcome data were collected. Outcomes in patients who had an abscess drained before surgery or were found to have a fistula or abscess at surgery or at pathology were compared with outcomes in all others.

Results

A total of 434 patients (56.2 per cent women) were included, 293 with perforating and 141 with non-perforating disease. Median age, tobacco use, and preoperative steroid and biological agent use were similar in the two groups. Forty patients (13.7 per cent) in the perforating group had abscesses drained before surgery and 251 patients had at least one fistula, most commonly to the sigmoid colon. Patients with perforating disease were more likely to require preoperative total parenteral nutrition, need another resection, have an ileostomy and a longer mean postoperative stay, and less likely to undergo a laparoscopic procedure. Patients in this group also developed more postoperative abscesses or leaks (4.8 versus 0 per cent; P = 0.006). The reoperation rate was similar (3.1 versus 0.7 per cent; P = 0.178).

Conclusion

Patients with penetrating Crohn's disease are more likely to require a more complex procedure, and an ileostomy, and to a have longer postoperative stay.

### Laparoscopic versus open resection for sigmoid diverticulitis [^111whkip]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Diverticular disease is a common condition in Western industrialised countries. Most individuals remain asymptomatic throughout life; however, 25% experience acute diverticulitis. The standard treatment for acute diverticulitis is open surgery. Laparoscopic surgery - a minimal-access procedure - offers an alternative approach to open surgery, as it is characterised by reduced operative stress that may translate into shorter hospitalisation and more rapid recovery, as well as improved quality of life.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgical resection compared with open surgical resection for individuals with acute sigmoid diverticulitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2) in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 23 February 2017); Ovid Embase (1974 to 23 February 2017); clinicaltrials.gov (February 2017); and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry (February 2017). We reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials to search for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing elective or emergency laparoscopic sigmoid resection versus open surgical resection for acute sigmoid diverticulitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the domains of risk of bias from each included trial, and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we planned to calculate mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for outcomes such as hospital stay, and standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs for quality of life and global rating scales, if researchers used different scales.

Main Results

Three trials with 392 participants met the inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in three European countries (Switzerland, Netherlands, and Germany). The median age of participants ranged from 62 to 66 years; 53% to 64% were female. Inclusion criteria differed among studies. One trial included participants with Hinchey I characteristics as well as those who underwent Hartmann's procedure; the second trial included only participants with "a proven stage II/III disease according to the classification of Stock and Hansen"; the third trial considered for inclusion patients with "diverticular disease of sigmoid colon documented by colonoscopy and 2 episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis, one at least being documented with CT scan, 1 episode of complicated diverticulitis, with a pericolic abscess (Hinchey stage I) or pelvic abscess (Hinchey stage II) requiring percutaneous drainage". We determined that two studies were at low risk of selection bias; two that reported considerable dropouts were at high risk of attrition bias; none reported blinding of outcome assessors (unclear detection bias); and all were exposed to performance bias owing to the nature of the intervention. Available low-quality evidence suggests that laparoscopic surgical resection may lead to little or no difference in mean hospital stay compared with open surgical resection (3 studies, 360 participants; MD -0.62 (days), 95% CI -2.49 to 1.25; I² = 0%). Low-quality evidence suggests that operating time was longer in the laparoscopic surgery group than in the open surgery group (3 studies, 360 participants; MD 49.28 (minutes), 95% CI 40.64 to 57.93; I² = 0%). We are uncertain whether laparoscopic surgery improves postoperative pain between day 1 and day 3 more effectively than open surgery. Low-quality evidence suggests that laparoscopic surgery may improve postoperative pain at the fourth postoperative day more effectively than open surgery (2 studies, 250 participants; MD = -0.65, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.25). Researchers reported quality of life differently across trials, hindering the possibility of meta-analysis. Low-quality evidence from one trial using the Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaire six weeks after surgery suggests that laparoscopic intervention may improve quality of life, whereas evidence from two other trials using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) v3 and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score, respectively, suggests that laparoscopic surgery may make little or no difference in improving quality of life compared with open surgery. We are uncertain whether laparoscopic surgery improves the following outcomes: 30-day postoperative mortality, early overall morbidity, major and minor complications, surgical complications, postoperative times to liquid and solid diets, and reoperations due to anastomotic leak.

Authors' Conclusions

Results from the present comprehensive review indicate that evidence to support or refute the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgical resection for treatment of patients with acute diverticular disease is insufficient. Well-designed trials with adequate sample size are needed to investigate the efficacy of laparoscopic surgery towards important patient-oriented (e.g. postoperative pain) and health system-oriented outcomes (e.g. mean hospital stay).

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^116EmP2a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Systemic antibiotic treatment alone is usually the most appropriate treatment for patients with a small (< 4 cm in diameter) diverticular abscess and image guided percutaneous drainage is for those with a large (> 4 cm in diameter) one (Recommendation 2 B).

For patients in whom diverticulitis is complicated by peridiverticular abscess formation, the size of the abscess is an important determinant of the need for percutaneous drainage. Many patients who have small pericolic abscesses (4 cm or less in diameter) without peritonitis (Hinchey stage 1) can be treated conservatively with bowel rest and broad-spectrum antibiotics. For patients with peridiverticular abscesses that are larger than 4 cm in diameter (Hinchey stage 2), observational studies indicate that CT-guided percutaneous drainage can be beneficial. This procedure typically eliminates or reduces the size of the abscess, with a reduction in pain, resolution of leukocytosis, and defervescence usually seen within several days. Percutaneous drainage may allow for elective rather than emergency surgery, increasing the likelihood of a successful one-stage procedure. Patients whose abscess cavities contain gross feculent material tend to respond poorly, and early surgical intervention is usually required.

Elective colon resection should typically be advised if an episode of complicated diverticulitis is treated non-operatively (Recommendation 2 C).

After percutaneous drainage of a diverticular abscess, a later colectomy usually should be planned, because 41 percent of patients will otherwise develop severe recurrent sepsis. Some, but not all, retrospective studies suggest that the number of recurrences is associated with the chance that emergency surgery will be required at some point in the future.

The resection should be carried proximally to the compliant bowel and extend distally to the upper rectum (Recommendation 1 C).

It is usually sufficient to remove only the most severely affected segment; however, the proximal margin of resection should be in an area of pliable colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed. Usually a sigmoid colectomy will suffice; however, occasionally the proximal resection margin must extend well into the descending colon or to the left transverse colon. Distally, the margin of resection should be where the taenia coli splay out onto the upper rectum. After sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis, an important predictor of recurrent diverticulitis is a colosigmoid rather than a colorectal anastomosis.

Outcomes and definitions

The primary outcome parameter was the overall complication rate in both treatment groups, defined as the proportion of patients experiencing at least one complication.

Complications of NOT included but were not limited to failure of NOT, i.e. patients not responding to the initial antibiotic treatment (with or without initial percutaneous drainage) and thus requiring additional interventions (e.g. additional drainage procedures, delayed appendectomy), and complications after interval appendectomy (as defined by the original authors).

Complications of operative treatment included but were not limited to extensive bowel resection and reoperations (as defined by the original authors).

Overall complications in both treatment groups included but were not limited to intra-abdominal abscess formation (IAA), superficial site infection (SSI) and ileus, as defined by the original authors.

If possible, complications were listed according to the Clavien–Dindo scale. Grade 1: Any deviation from normal postoperative course without the need for farmacological treatment or a surgical/radiological intervention, Grade 2: Requiring farmacological treatment, Grade 3: Requiring surgical/radiological intervention, Grade 4: Life-threatening complication requiring ICU-admittance, Grade 5: Death of a patient.

Secondary outcomes included initial and total length of hospital stay (days) (total length of stay included interval appendectomy), readmission rate (defined as number of discharged patients that were admitted to the hospital again with complaints related to the previously experienced appendicitis), recurrent appendicitis (defined as number of patients who experienced symptomatic recurrence of disease with histopathologically proven recurrent appendicitis after completion of the initial course of antibiotics), number and type of imaging studies (ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)), usage of pain medication (number of doses and type of pain medication (acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and morphine)), unexpected findings during surgery or at histopathological examination, number of surgical and/or radiological interventions, and Quality of Life (as defined by the original authors).

### Management of diverticular disease in scandinavia [^115Te7AQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Throughout the last century, the incidence of diverticular disease of the colon has increased tremendously in industrialized countries; nevertheless, the management of this condition is still controversial. Although several international guidelines for the management of diverticular disease are based on the same evidence, the recommendations differ greatly, emphasizing the lack of high-quality prospective studies. In Scandinavia, official guidelines for the management of diverticular disease exist only in Denmark. However, the treatment policies are quite similar in all Scandinavian countries. Computed tomography is the first choice for imaging of acute diverticulitis and its complications. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis is nearly abandoned in Scandinavia, whereas several international guidelines still recommend their use. There is a broad consensus that abscesses secondary to acute diverticulitis can safely be managed with percutaneous drainage, which is in line with international recommendations. The surgical management of perforated diverticulitis with peritonitis is still as controversial in Scandinavia as elsewhere. Common surgical options are laparoscopic peritoneal lavage, primary resection with anastomosis, and primary resection with terminal colostomy (Hartmann's procedure). Elective sigmoid resection in patients with diverticular disease seems to be performed less frequently in Scandinavia than in other European countries; the right indications are a current matter of debate. Symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease in the absence of diverticulitis has not gained great attention in Scandinavia.

### Determinants of treatment and outcomes of diverticular abscesses [^116yXDQF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotics is not superior to antibiotics only in terms of treatment failure, recurrence of diverticulitis, or incidence of elective sigmoid resections regardless of the abscess size. Unless emergency surgery is needed, antibiotics could be considered as the primary treatment. Percutaneous drainage is an invasive procedure and does not seem to improve treatment results. Therefore, drainage should be considered when it is technically feasible and antibiotic treatment does not improve the patient. A prospective randomized study is needed to comprehensibly evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of percutaneous drainage in diverticular abscesses. This will be challenging to commence because of the rarity of the disease and would probably need an international collaboration to be successfully carried out.

### Towards a tailored approach for patients with acute diverticulitis and abscess formation. the divAbsc2023 multicentre case-control study [^111V5qS9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Definition of outcomes

The primary study endpoint was the occurrence of non-operative treatment failure, defined as failure whenever a patient required emergency surgery or died due to abdominal sepsis during the hospital stay despite the planned non-operative treatment. The non-operative treatment was defined as successful when the acute infective condition was resolved conservatively, with the regression of symptoms and the normalization of inflammatory indexes, and the patient was discharged without the need for surgical intervention. Clinical definitions of non-operative treatment failure included at least one of the following: the occurrence of diffuse peritonitis, septic shock, increased size of the abscess at the follow-up CT scan, presence of four-quadrant free abdominal fluid at the follow-up CT scan, or lack of dimensional improvement of the abscess at the follow-up CT scan. Follow-up CT scans were performed during the index hospital admission. In all cases, in order to define the failure of conservative therapy, patient's clinical deterioration had to be documented.

Patients with planned colorectal resection for complicated acute diverticulitis after the success of non-operative treatment were excluded. Any adverse events after the discharge date (readmission, radiologic interventions, surgical intervention, and mortality) were not considered failures of non-operative treatment.

The secondary outcome was the recurrence of acute diverticulitis requiring hospital readmission within 90 days after discharge (within 30 days or after 30 days from the index episode). Admissions for elective operations were excluded from this outcome. In-hospital morbidity (infections, surgical complications, adverse drug reactions) was graded based on severity according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, based on the number of patients with at least one complication. Although policies for percutaneous drainage placement may differ from centre to centre, guidelines for establishing the correct indication of the procedure were followed in the participating sites.

After the initial attempt of conservative treatment with antibiotics plus/minus percutaneous drainage, if the patient required emergency surgery, a consultant-level on-call surgeon decided to operate based on the clinical condition, laboratory parameters, and radiological findings suggestive of patient deterioration, clinical worsening, or not improving conditions. The reasons for the decision to operate were registered in the clinical notes and translated into the database. The > 30 days patient follow-up was conducted by contacting the patients via telephone and obtaining all the pertinent clinical notes on eventual further episodes of recurrent sigmoid diverticulitis requiring hospital admission after the initial non-operative approach.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^113TVViM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic cavitary coccidioidal pneumonia — indications for surgical resection (Recommendation 9): We recommend that surgical options be explored when the cavities are persistently symptomatic despite antifungal treatment. We recommend that surgical options be considered when cavities have been present for more than 2 years and if symptoms recur whenever antifungal treatment is stopped (strong, very low). Early literature indicates that approximately half of coccidioidal cavities close within 2 years of the initial infection, so it is therefore recommended that surgical resection be avoided for this period; after a cavity has been documented to be present for > 2 years, surgical options seem more appropriate with persistent or recurrent symptoms, often when cavities are large, near the pleural surface, and cause pleuritic pain, chronic symptomatic infection, or frequent or severe hemoptysis.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^117VBR31]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

To create these guidelines, a panel of experts was designed and charged by the boards of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), to develop questions on seven main topics that thoroughly cover the field of this pathology (retained anorectal bodies, perineal necrotizing fasciitis, complicated hemorrhoids, acute anal fissure, anorectal abscess, bleeding anorectal varices, complicated anorectal prolapse). Leading specialists in the field then were asked to perform a thorough search on each of these topics in different databanks (MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE) for relevant papers between 1985 and November 2019 and a systematic review of the available literature. They were asked to focus their search to provide evidence-based answers to every question with immediate practical application and to summarize them in statements. Furthermore, the references were kept up to date and the last literature search was performed in January 2021. All the statements were presented and discussed during the WSES - AAST - WJES Consensus Conference on Anorectal Emergencies held in Parma, Italy, on December 12, 2019, and for each statement, a consensus among the WSES - AAST panelists was reached. An international expert panel discussed the different issues in subsequent rounds. At each round, the manuscript was revised and improved. The final version about which agreement was reached resulted in the present manuscript. All the members contributed to the development of the manuscript.

The questions were created according to the PICO criteria, and the following guidelines adopt the GRADE methodology.

### Conservative management of pelvic abscess following sacrocolpopexy: a report of three cases and review of the literature [^1129vFFA]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sacrocolpopexy has become the gold standard for the management of apical vaginal prolapse. In spite of prophylactic antibiotics and a careful surgical technique, pelvic abscesses remain disconcerting complications of pelvic reconstructive surgery. Reports indicate that mesh-related infection is an uncommon complication of pelvic organ prolapse repair: 0.7–8.0% for vaginal mesh placement and 0.3% after laparoscopic mesh placement sacrocolpopexy. When infection occurs after the placement of a mesh, such as in sacrocolpopexy, treatment usually involves resection of the mesh. Most published literature is based on case reports of treatment strategies and thus it is difficult to reach a conclusion regarding a standard treatment based on what is published. With the incorporation of type I, lightweight polypropylene mesh for sacrocolpopexy, however, it is possible that mesh resection may not be required in the face of a pelvic abscess. There are minimal data to necessarily support mesh resection for the treatment of pelvic abscess after vaginal mesh placement in all cases.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^117Va5vM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Independent risk factors for PD failure are bowel wall thickness, disease length, bowel dilation, and abscess size of greater than 6 cm. Furthermore, multiple percutaneous drainage procedures have been required in 8–20% of patients and it could increase the risk of complications such as damage to vital structures in close proximity to the abscess or severe hemorrhage.

Complications of PD, for both spontaneous and post-surgical abscesses (not specific to CD), occur in approximately 10% of procedures. Major complications such as sepsis, small bowel fistulae, colon perforation, and death (due to sepsis or hemorrhage) have been described in 5–11% of cases. Minor complications (such as bacteremia or infection at the site of the catheter insertion) occur in approximately 3%.

Feagins et al. suggested that non-drainable abscesses smaller than 3 cm and without evidence of fistula and no steroid therapy are likely to respond to antibiotic therapy alone although with high recurrence rates. In this setting, antibiotics should cover Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes and it is important to closely observe the clinical condition of the patient in case of any deterioration.

Antibiotic therapy, including a combination of fluoroquinolones or third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole in patients with CD, should be adapted to the sensitivity of the bacteria (and sometimes fungi) to antibiotics, if PD is performed.

The appropriate duration of antibiotic therapy is unclear. Clinical improvement should be seen within 3–5 days after starting antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, with a decrease in drainage production. If a patient's condition does not improve, re-evaluation and repeat imaging are indicated to determine whether the abscess has been adequately drained. If not, repositioning of the drain or surgical intervention is required.

If sepsis is controlled after adequate PD, CD medication should be started to prevent recurrence. Patients with a concomitant stenosis, an entero-cutaneous fistula or refractory active disease are likely to require surgery, but preoperative PD, if it is feasible, associated with delayed surgery, can decrease the extent of intestinal resection, postoperative septic complications, and potentially reduce stoma rates.

Q.4: In patients presenting with complications related to IBD, what is the appropriate medical treatment and nutritional support?

### WSES / GAIS / SIS-E / WSIS / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with intra-abdominal infections [^117GBQHg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abdominal abscess

Antibiotic therapy alone in patients with small diverticular abscesses.
Percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy for 3–5 days in large diverticular abscesses. Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, based on the clinical conditions, unless emergency surgery is needed, antibiotics could be considered the primary treatment.

The size of 4–5 cm may be a reasonable limit between antibiotic treatment alone, versus percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment in the management of diverticular abscesses.

Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, based on the clinical conditions, patients with large abscesses can be initially treated with antibiotic therapy alone. However, careful clinical monitoring is mandatory.

Diffuse peritonitis

Primary resection and anastomosis with or without a diverting stoma (in clinically stable patients with no co-morbidities)
Hartmann's procedure (HP) (in critically ill patients and/or in patients with multiple major comorbidities).
Laparoscopic peritoneal lavage and drainage suitable only for patients with purulent (but not fecal) peritonitis due to complicated diverticulitis. Very controversial.

+

Antibiotic therapy for 4 days (immunocompetent and stable patients) (more days if there are signs of ongoing infection).

HP has been considered the procedure of choice in patients with generalized peritonitis and remains a safe technique for emergency colectomy in diverticular peritonitis. It is especially useful in critically ill patients and in patients with multiple comorbidities. However, restoration of bowel continuity after a HP is associated with significant morbidity and resource utilization. As a result, many of these patients do not undergo reversal surgery and remain with a permanent stoma.

### Internal drainage for interdisciplinary management of anastomotic leakage after pancreaticogastrostomy [^111xrNML]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Across pancreatic cancer surgery centers post-operative fistula and anastomotic leakage are widely regarded the Achilles' heel. We have learned that complication management is key for decreasing morbidity and mortality after pancreatic resection. Through institutional experience as a high-volume center, we to further advanced on interdisciplinary concepts for treating pancreatic fistulas and anastomotic leakage. This study demonstrates the feasibility, efficiency, and safe application of an endoscopic technique with the placement of peri-anastomotic stents for internal drainage of peri-anastomotic fluid collection after pancreatoduodenectomy. Consequently, we demonstrate earlier resolution and reduced hospitalization of patients with anastomotic leakage, better aligning with modern ERAS concepts that ultimately allow for earlier admission of oncologic patients to adjuvant treatments.

EUS-guided concepts for the drainage of peri-luminal fluid collections are not new and have been tested for some time. The main indications remain in the treatment of digestive fluids after pancreatic surgery for preventing severe complications. Such techniques have been initially conducted in pseudocysts or peri-gastric fluid collections after distal pancreatectomies, however focusing on late abscess formation with mature walls. We and others have shown that the trans-gastric route allows for uncomplicated and safe internal drainage even in the absence of abscess formation for early post-operative treatment of clinically relevant pancreatic fistulas. Compared to percutaneous interventions, success rates revealed advantages of transmural drainage systems in some settings. Positive experiences have also been documented for other indications, including bariatric surgery and liver resections.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^111SFoXq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Brandt et al. retrospectively compared patients with CT confirmed abscesses, treated by antibiotics alone and patient treated by antibiotics with percutaneous drainage. The patients treated with antibiotics alone achieved an outcome similar to patients treated with percutaneous drainage. The average abscess size was 4 cm in the antibiotic only group and 6 cm in percutaneous group. Failure rate of percutaneous drainage in this series was 33%.

Siewert et al. reported that antibiotics alone were effective in resolving acute symptoms for abscess size less than 3 cm.

Urgent surgery for colonic diverticula perforations is indicated in patients with large or/and multiloculated diverticular abscesses inaccessible to percutaneous drainage or in whom clinical symptoms persist after CT guided percutaneous drainage, diverticulitis associated with free perforation and purulent or fecal diffuse peritonitis.

There is still controversy about the optimal surgical management of colonic diverticular disease, complicated by peritonitis.

Hartmann's resection has been considered the procedure of choice in patients with generalized peritonitis and remains a safe technique for emergency colectomy in perforated diverticulitis, especially in elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities. More recently, some reports have suggested that primary resection and anastomosis is the preferred approach to diverticulitis, even in the presence of diffuse peritonitis.

In 2006 a sistematic review by Constantinides et al. about primary resection with anastomosis vs. Hartmann's procedure in nonelective surgery for acute colonic diverticulitis was published. Patients selected for primary resection and anastomosis had a lower mortality than those treated with Hartmann's procedure in the emergency setting and comparable mortality under conditions of generalized peritonitis. This analysis highlighted the need for high-quality randomized trials comparing the two techniques.

Emergency laparoscopic resection in complicated diverticular disease is feasible and safe and may be performed by expert surgeons without additional morbidity and mortality. In 2009 a randomized multicenter trial on laparoscopic sigmoid resection for diverticulitis was published. In this trial patients with symptomatic diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon were randomized to either laparoscopic sigmoid resections or open sigmoid resections. The laparoscopic sigmoid resection was associated with a 15.4% reduction in major complication rates, less pain, improved quality of life, and shorter hospitalization at the cost of a longer operating time.

In high risk patients, a laparoscopic approach may be used for exploration and peritoneal lavage and drainage.

### Surgical treatment of cerebral abscess with the use of a mobile ultralow-field MRI [^112YEXnr]. Neurosurgical Review (2009). Low credibility.

Surgical intervention in cerebral abscess is indicated to confirm diagnosis, to identify pathogens for specific antibiotic therapy, or to reduce mass effect. Regarding long-term outcome, freehand or stereotactic aspiration are equally efficient compared to surgical resection. However, direct observation of relief of mass effect is not possible by either method. Six patients presenting with neurological symptoms and laboratory signs of infection and diagnosed with an intra-axial cystic lesion underwent frameless stereotactic aspiration of a cerebral abscess in our institution with the use of a mobile intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a field strength of 0.15 T. Images were acquired before and during the procedure and used for neuronavigation. In all six cases, complete evacuation of the abscess with collapse of the cyst could be achieved and documented intraoperatively. No complications were observed. All patients showed clinical improvement postoperatively. We highlight the advantages of using a mobile intraoperative MRI unit with an illustrative case of a patient who had already undergone abscess evacuation without alleviation of symptoms before using intraoperative MRI. Finally, we discuss surgical treatment options of cerebral abscesses.

### Diverticular abscess managed with long-term definitive nonoperative intent is safe [^112MjRYT]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Initial nonoperative management of diverticular abscess has become the standard of care; however, the need for elective resection after this index episode is unclear.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes of expectant management after initial nonoperative treatment of diverticular abscess.

Design

This was a retrospective chart review with prospective telephone follow-up of patients.

Settings

The study was conducted at a large tertiary academic colorectal surgery practice in Canada.

Patients

Adult patients with CT-documented acute sigmoid diverticulitis complicated by abscess managed nonoperatively from 2000 to 2013 were included.

Interventions

Long-term definitive nonoperative management of diverticular abscess.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was emergency sigmoidectomy or death from recurrent diverticulitis. Secondary outcomes were recurrent diverticulitis and elective sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis.

Results

Of 135 patients with acute diverticulitis complicated by abscess, a total of 73 patients were managed with nonoperative intent and long-term expectant management. The median follow-up was 62 (Q1 to Q3: 28–98) months. After resolution of the index episode, 22 patients [30.1% (95% CI, 19.6%-40.6%)] experienced a recurrent episode of diverticulitis at a median of 23 (range, 9–40) months. Two patients [2.7% (95% CI, -1.0% to 6.4%)] had a recurrent episode with peritonitis that required sigmoidectomy with stoma at 6 and 64 months. Both patients underwent reversal after 4 and 8 months. Seven [9.6% (95% CI, 2.8%-16.4%)] patients experienced a complicated recurrence and underwent an elective sigmoidectomy [median time to colectomy, 33 (range, 16–56) months]. Thirteen patients [17.8% (95% CI, 9.0%-26.6%)] experienced an uncomplicated recurrence, all of whom were managed with continued nonoperative intent [median follow-up, 81 (range, 34–115) months]. No mortality occurred. On multivariate logistic regression, female gender (p = 0.048) and a previous episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis before the index diverticular abscess (p = 0.020) were associated with a recurrent episode.

Limitations

This study was limited by its retrospective design and modest sample size.

Conclusions

After initial successful nonoperative management of diverticulitis with abscess, expectant management with nonoperative intent is a safe long-term option with low rates of surgery, especially in the emergency setting. See Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, on the nonoperative management of diverticular abscess at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A234.

### Vascular graft infections, mycotic aneurysms, and endovascular infections: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116LgWpy]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Open surgical resection with extra-anatomic revascularization — comparative considerations indicate historical use, lack of randomized trials, and when it may be considered. The text states that "Numerous studies have reported results of resection and extra-anatomic revascularization compared with in situ reconstruction in patients primarily with infrarenal aortic MA, which was once considered to be the surgical procedure of choice for patients with aortic MA". It emphasizes "There are no published randomized controlled studies that compare in situ with extra-anatomic reconstruction". It adds that "Although in selected patients, resection and extra-anatomic revascularization may be appropriate, for the majority of patients, resection and in situ revascularization rather than extra-anatomic reconstruction are reasonable". For infrarenal MA, "extra-anatomic revascularization followed by resection may be considered only for the following selected patients:" including "those with the presence of gross pus in the intraoperative field", "those with retroperitoneal or psoas abscess", "those with adjacent vertebral osteomyelitis", "those with inadequate response preoperatively to antimicrobial therapy with persistence of fever and signs of sepsis", and "selected patients with aortoenteric fistula". It also notes "One study suggested that patients with nontyphoidal Salmonella infection should be treated with resection and extra-anatomic reconstruction".

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^113AzVzP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

On the basis of clinical conditions, patients with diverticular smaller abscesses may be treated by antibiotics alone (Recommendation 1C).

Patients with abscesses having a large diameter should be treated by percutaneous drainage and intravenous antibiotics (Recommendation 1C).

Whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, based on the clinical conditions patients with large abscesses can be initially treated by antibiotic therapy alone. However careful clinical monitoring is mandatory (Recommendation 1C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with ALCD have an abscess, and the treatment should be either antibiotics with or without percutaneous and/or surgical drainage. The use of antibiotics and percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses facilitates single-stage operation to perform subsequently an elective sigmoidectomy. The size of 3–6 cm has been generally accepted, despite the low level of evidence, to be a reasonable limit between antimicrobial versus percutaneous drainage in the management of diverticular abscesses.

A retrospective study assessing the effectiveness of antibiotics as sole initial therapy in patients with large diverticular abscess was published in 2015 by Elagili et al. Thirty-two patients were managed by antibiotics alone while 114 underwent percutaneous drainage.

Failure of initial treatment required urgent surgery in eight patients with persistent symptoms during treatment with antibiotics alone (25%) and in 21 patients (18%) after initial percutaneous drainage (p = 0.21). Patients treated with antibiotics had a significantly smaller abscess diameter (5.9 versus 7.1 cm, p = 0.001). Postoperative complications in patients treated with antibiotics alone were significantly less severe than after percutaneous drainage based on the Clavien-Dindo classification (p = 0.04).

Hartmann's procedure remains useful in the management of diffuse peritonitis in critically ill patients. However, in clinically stable patients, primary resection with anastomosis, with or without a diverting stoma, may be performed (Recommendation 1B).

### Diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. EAES consensus development conference 2015 [^113sMYNa]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Intra-operative unexpected findings

When an appendicular mass is encountered during surgery, one should restrain from continuing the operation. Continuation of the operation can necessitate bowel resection. Antibiotic treatment of phlegmon and drainage of any abscess should be performed.

The extent of surgical resection in case of suspected malignancy depends on the location and size of the appendicular mass. Routine inclusion of the meso-appendix with the appendectomy is advised. Definitive histological findings determine whether an additional resection after total appendectomy is indicated. In cases of small neuroendocrine tumours (NET) or low-grade appendicular mucinous neoplasms (LAMN), a total meso-appendicular resection can be sufficient. In cases of a NET > 1 cm, LAMN grade 3–4 or an adenocarcinoma of the appendix, a formal right hemicolectomy is indicated to provide an oncologically sufficient resection. It is advised to perform a total meso-appendicular resection at the primary operation and an additional hemicolectomy at a later stage when indicated (Tables 5, 6, 7, 8).

### Management of colonic diverticulitis [^111Zm4rP]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Left sided colonic diverticulitis is a common and costly gastrointestinal disease in Western countries, characterized by acute onset of often severe abdominal pain. Imaging is necessary to make an initial diagnosis and determine disease severity. Colonoscopy should be done six to eight weeks after diagnosis to rule out a missed colon malignancy. Antibiotic treatment is used selectively in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. The clinical course of diverticulitis commonly includes unpredictable recurrences and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, which are a detriment to quality of life. A better understanding of prognosis has prompted a shift toward non-operative approaches. The decision to undergo prophylactic colon resection should be individualized to consider the severity of diverticulitis, the patient's health and immune status, and the patient's preferences and values, as well as benefits and risks. Because only a section of colon is removed, recurrent diverticulitis remains a risk. Acute diverticulitis with an abscess is treated with antibiotics that cover Gram negative and anaerobic bacteria, with or without percutaneous drainage. Acute diverticulitis with purulent or feculent contamination of the peritoneal cavity is managed with surgery; primary resection and anastomosis is the procedure of choice in stable patients.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons' clinical practice guidelines for the management of pilonidal disease [^115c2u4e]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). High credibility.

Operative management — acute pilonidal abscess: Patients with an abscess should be treated with incision and drainage (I&D) regardless of whether it is primary or recurrent, with a Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate‑quality evidence, 1B. For first‑episode abscesses, overall successful healing reaches 60%, but simple I&D carries an estimated 15% to 40% recurrence rate; I&D also appears to have a protective effect on recurrence after surgical excision at 20‑year follow‑up. An unroofing (lay open) and curettage procedure is a 1‑step option that potentially avoids the need for a second procedure, and in a randomized trial curettage achieved greater complete healing at 10 weeks (96% versus 79%).

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^111ms8LD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

What is the best treatment for patients with a small diverticular abscess (< 4–5 cm)? What is the best treatment for patients with large diverticular abscess?

For patients with a small (< 4–5 cm) diverticular abscess, we suggest an initial trial of non-operative treatment with antibiotics alone (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

We suggest to treat patients with large abscesses with percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic treatment; whenever percutaneous drainage of the abscess is not feasible or not available, we suggest to initially treat patients with large abscesses with antibiotic therapy alone, clinical conditions permitting. Alternatively, an operative intervention is required (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

Approximately 15–20% of patients admitted with acute diverticulitis have an abscess on CT scan. The treatment of abscess always requires antibiotic therapy. If the abscess is limited in size, systemic antibiotic therapy alone is considered safe and effective in removing the abscess and solving acute inflammation with a pooled failure rate of 20% and a mortality rate of 0.6%.

### Gastrointestinal surgery in patients with ovarian cancer [^112W6br2]. Gynecologic Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives were to assess indications for and outcome and morbidity of gastrointestinal surgery in patients with ovarian cancer.

Methods

We reviewed 364 patients with ovarian cancer who underwent a total of 491 operations including a gastrointestinal procedure over a 10-year period. The 491 operations comprised 180 primary surgical procedures (37%), 44 second-look laparotomies (9%), and 267 procedures for recurrence or palliation (54%).

Results

Debulking of disease was the indication for bowel surgery for 87, 45, and 62% of cases in the three groups, respectively. Bowel obstruction was an indication in 14% of patients at primary surgery and in 34% at secondary surgery (P < 0.05). Rectosigmoid resection was the most common bowel operation overall, particularly in the primary surgery group (65%). Colostomy was performed in 30% of the cases of rectosigmoid resection at primary surgery. Small-bowel resection was most common in the surgery for recurrence or palliation group. The blood transfusion rate was 79%. Febrile morbidity was the most common complication overall (29%), with no significant differences among groups. Four patients (0.8%) required reoperation for an abscess or anastomotic leak. Nineteen operations (3.9%) were followed by death within 30 days, with no significant differences among groups. A weighted Cox model estimated that 21, 42, and 11% of patients would be alive 5 years after primary surgery, second-look laparotomy, and surgery for recurrence or palliation, respectively (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Gastrointestinal surgery is frequently indicated during operations for ovarian cancer. Gynecologic cancer surgeons should be trained accordingly. Patients with possibly malignant ovarian masses should receive preoperative bowel preparation and be counseled that bowel surgery may be needed but colostomy is not frequently required.

### Colorectal intervention as part of surgery for patients with gynaecological malignancy [^112ajBSn]. Colorectal Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was conducted to determine the indications for and outcome of colorectal intervention in patients with advanced gynaecological malignancy.

Methods

Between January 1999 and June 2004, 27 gynaecological cancer patients underwent 36 colorectal intervention performed by general surgeons. The 36 operations were associated with 14 (39%) primary surgical procedures, 9 (25%) second-look laparotomies, and 13 (36%) procedures for recurrence or palliation.

Results

The mean age was 56 years (range 32–83 years). The majority of operations were performed in patients with ovarian (67%), endometrial (18%) and cervical (15%) malignancy. The primary indications for colorectal resection was tumour cytoreduction in 56% of the 36 operations. Other indications included repair of iatrogenic bowel injuries (n = 9, 25%), resection for multiple iatrogenic enterotomies (n = 4, 11%), and bowel obstruction (n = 3, 8%). The most frequently performed bowel operation was rectosigmoid resection with end-to-end anastomosis (n = 19, 53%). Colostomy was performed in 14% of the rectosigmoid resections at primary surgery. Small-bowel resection was required in 31% of the 36 operations. Postoperative complications included wound complications (14%), pulmonary infections (8%), cardiac complications (6%) and intra-abdominal abscess (6%). There was a single surgical mortality (3%).

Conclusion

Colorectal intervention is frequently indicated during operations for advanced gynaecological malignancy, and they are associated with a significant rate of postoperative complications. Specialists operating on gynaecological malignancy should have the technical skills necessary to perform these procedures.

### Trends in the surgical management of diverticulitis [^1156vgdf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Hinchey III-IV

The incidence of free perforation (purulent and feculent peritonitis) appears to have remained stable in recent years at around 1.5%. Patients who present with sepsis and diffuse peritonitis require urgent operative intervention. Two single institution studies, however, have recently suggested nonoperative management for select patients in the absence of severe sepsis.

When treated nonoperatively, complicated diverticulitis is associated with high recurrence rates, reported up to 50%. When compared to those with uncomplicated diverticulitis higher incidences of late complications including persistent symptoms, abscess, fistula and stricture have been reported. In several studies, the severity of the initial disease presentation, based on CT findings, is directly correlated to an increased risk of recurrence and subsequent complications. To further evaluate this relationship, Ambrosetti et al developed a CT-based severity grade and correlated this retrospectively with patient outcomes, elucidating the value of imaging as a prognostic indicator to guide management. A "severe grade" on CT, which included evidence of abscess, extraluminal air, or extraluminal contrast was statistically predictive of medical treatment failure in the acute phase, and for increased risk of recurrence or additional complications after successful nonoperative management.

Location and size of the abscess on presentation also contributed to the risk of recurrence and failure of nonoperative treatment. In a prospective study of 73 patients with diverticular abscesses, pelvic abscesses were associated with worse outcomes when compared to mesocolic abscesses. In a retrospective study of 218 patients undergoing percutaneous drainage, a larger abscess, defined as size greater than 5 cm, was also significantly associated with higher recurrence rates.

Controversy exists as to whether or not elective colon resection after successful nonoperative management of complicated diverticulitis is necessary. This notion is supported by the fact that observation after percutaneous drainage appears to be safe in selected patients.

According to the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS) practice parameters, elective colon resection should typically be advised after a complicated episode is initially treated nonoperatively, due to the high incidence of medical treatment failure, recurrence, and late complications. In addition, patients with fistula formation or stricturing disease are recommended for resection. A summary of recommendations from the ASCRS Practice Parameters for Sigmoid Diverticulitis and the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) Position Statement on Elective Resection for Diverticulitis are presented in Table 2.

### The effect of biologics on postoperative complications in children with inflammatory bowel disease and bowel resection [^115tWgpt]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There has been limited investigation of pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who have been treated with biologic agents and undergo operative management. Postoperative complications in the adult setting have been mixed and in the pediatric population the data have been limited. This study compares children with IBD treated with biologic agents to patients treated with nonbiologic therapy before bowel resection.

Methods

This is a single-center, retrospective chart review study of 62 children with IBD who underwent bowel resection between 2001 and 2017. Analysis included patient demographics, medications used before surgery, incidence of postoperative complications, indication for surgery, type of operation, and additional surgeries required. Postoperative complications were defined as superficial skin infection, leak at anastomotic site, intra-abdominal abscess, wound dehiscence, and so on. Complications were compared based on medical therapy.

Results

Of the 62 children reviewed, 21 carried the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, 40 had Crohn disease, and 1 had IBD-unspecified. Thirty-seven of the patients were treated with infliximab, adalimumab, or vedolizumab before their bowel resection. There were 4 complications documented within 30 days of the operation, with an overall complication rate of 6.45%. There were 2 complications in each of the cohorts, including intra-abdominal abscess (2), abdominal wall abscess (1), and pouchitis (1).

Conclusion

The number of complications was the same between those who did and did not receive a preoperative biologic agent. This study suggests that biologics may be safe to use in patients undergoing bowel resection.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^115kbXLr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, CT, MRI, and EUS could have a role in the diagnosis of perianal abscesses, with the principal aims of excluding related conditions and correctly determining the regional anatomy and extent of the disease; the choice of the appropriate imaging investigation should take into account multiple factors, such as patient's past medical history, clinical presentation, local availability of resources, and skills. After the resolution of the acute phase, routine imaging after incision and drainage of the anorectal abscess is usually not required. An imaging follow-up is otherwise suggested in cases of recurrence, in the presence of suspected IBD and when there is evidence of a fistula and/or non-healing wound.

1.C - In patients with an anorectal abscess, what are the indications for surgical treatment and what is the appropriate timing for surgery?

In patients with anorectal abscess, we recommend a surgical approach with incision and drainage (strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C).

In patients with anorectal abscess, we suggest to base the timing of surgery on the presence and severity of sepsis (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In fit, immunocompetent patients with a small perianal abscess and without systemic signs of sepsis we suggest considering an outpatient management (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

The primary treatment of anorectal abscesses remains surgical drainage, with the timing being dictated by the severity and nature of any sepsis. In general, the incision should be kept as close as possible to the anal verge to minimize the length of a potential fistula, while still providing adequate drainage and avoiding sphincteral damage. It is important to stress the high rate of recurrence after drainage, which can be as high as 44%. The risk factors associated with recurrence are inadequate drainage, loculations, horseshoe-type abscess, and time from disease onset to incision. The high recurrence rate and the associated risk factors emphasize the need for a complete and accurate drainage of the abscess. A recent randomized prospective study on needle aspiration treatment vs. incision and drainage of acute simple perianal abscess emphasized the importance of a complete drainage of the perianal abscess, with recurrence rates of 41% following needle aspiration compared to 15% after incision and drainage.

### Transanal endoscopic microsurgery: long-term experience, indication expansion, and technical improvements [^114Wgi5h]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to review the authors' 16-year experience with transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). Mortality, morbidity, recurrence rate, and functional outcome were assessed. New indications and technical improvements are presented.

Methods

From November 1991 to August 2008, 123 patients (72 men and 51 women; median age, 68 years; range, 21–91 years) underwent TEM for excision of 105 adenomas with low- or high-grade dysplasia, 9 invasive adenocarcinomas (5 curative and 4 palliative resections), 2 neuroendocrine tumors, and 2 extramucosal lesions. Five additional patients had excisional biopsies, allowing staging after previous endoscopic resection. Most of the resections were full-thickness rectal resections using electrocautery or, more recently, the Harmonic scalpel. The latest mucosectomies were performed using the endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) technique. In addition, nontumoral indications included pelvic abscess (7 patients) and rectal strictures, which were either anastomotic or chemical. Pelvic abscesses were drained transrectally, whereas rectal stenoses were treated by strictureplasty. Foreign object retrieval and collagen plug placement for anal fistulas were performed using TEM in three patients.

Results

No mortality occurred. One intraoperative rectal perforation required conversion to laparotomy. The postoperative complications included one pneumoperitoneum, which was treated medically, and one rectal perforation requiring Hartmann's procedure. In the polyp subgroup, six patients (6/91, 7%) experienced local recurrence. Pelvic abscesses were successfully treated, and stenosis did not recur after strictureplasty. Anorectal manometry showed functional alterations without significant clinical impact.

Conclusions

The findings showed TEM to be a safe and effective procedure for local excision of rectal lesions with a low recurrence rate and minimal consequences in terms of anorectal function. In addition, TEM proved to be feasible and effective for pelvic abscess drainage and rectal stenosis treatment. New technologies such as the Harmonic scalpel and ESD increase the precision already offered by this approach.

### Multicentre study of non-surgical management of diverticulitis with abscess formation [^113DhiKe]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

An important limitation of this study is its retrospective design, which introduces the potential for selection bias and confounding by indication. However, registration of a wide range of baseline patient and disease characteristics allowed correction for potential known confounders in multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses. Another inevitable consequence of retrospective observational research is the potential risk of missing data, as the availability of baseline and outcome data is largely dependent on the completeness of medical records. It was hypothesized that re‐evaluation of CT images by one or more radiologists could have led to the introduction of (hindsight) bias, as a result of the radiologists' foreknowledge of the reasons for and outcomes of reviewing the images. To prevent selection bias introduced by missing data, multiple imputation methods were used to handle the missing data. Sensitivity analyses of the non‐imputed data set did not significantly change the results. With regard to outcome data, it is possible that patients might have received care at a general practitioner or in other hospitals during follow‐up, creating the potential for an underestimation of disease recurrences and readmissions. Finally, the multicentre setting of this study could have introduced heterogeneity through between‐hospital differences in treatment, such as reasons for choosing PCD or criteria for drain removal. However, these differences were considered small, because all hospitals base their practice on the national guideline for treatment of acute diverticulitis and hospital‐adjusted analyses showed comparable outcomes. In addition, the multicentre setting had beneficial effects by increasing both the study's generalizability and sample size.

This study of a large cohort of patients with Hinchey stage Ib and II abscesses has provided evidence that patients with abscesses of at least 3 or 5 cm are at a higher risk of short‐term treatment failure or emergency surgery respectively, regardless of the choice of non‐surgical treatment strategy. As no clear difference between the two treatment strategies was found, it remains debatable how to treat these patients appropriately. Nevertheless, these data help facilitate informed and shared decision‐making, as well as providing valuable information for future prospective studies regarding PCD treatment in patients with abscess formation.

### The surgical treatment of peritonsillar abscess: a retrospective analysis in 584 patients [^116Ph3cd]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There are three surgical treatment options for patients with peritonsillar abscess (PTA): needle aspiration, incision and drainage (ID), and abscess tonsillectomy (ATE). The updated German national guideline (2015) included changes in the treatment of PTA. The indication for tonsillectomy (TE) in patients became more stringent and preference was given to ID in certain cases.

Study Design

Retrospective analysis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective systematic analysis of patient data using the in-house electronic patient records and considered a 4-year period from 2014 to 2017. About 584 patients were identified. Our aim was to analyze the influence of the updated guideline on clinical practice.

Results

236 of 584 patients (40.4%) underwent ATE with contralateral TE. In 225 patients (38.5%), unilateral ATE was performed. Mean surgery time was significantly shortened when only unilateral ATE was performed. Concerning postoperative bleeding, we noted a tendency toward a lower incidence after ATE in comparison to ATE with contralateral TE. Less than 1% of patients who underwent ATE had to be revised surgically due to postoperative hemorrhage. After the revision of the guideline, unilateral ATE and ID were conducted more frequently.

Conclusion

These results support that ATE in an inpatient setting is a considerably safe and effective primary therapeutic option. ID represents a favorable treatment option for patients with PTA and comorbidities, nevertheless, patient compliance is required and insufficient drainage or recurrence of PTA may occur. The revision of the guideline had a significant impact on the choice of interventions (P < .001), which is reflected by the increased number of unilateral ATE.

### Fluorescence of cladophialophora bantiana after administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride: case report [^114iHQyW]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, 5-ALA has been clinically shown to produce intracellular tumor-specific fluorescence through tumor-specific uptake of the protoporphyrin (PpIX) fluorescent molecule and is widely used to aid in the resection of neoplastic tissue. - 5-ALA fluorescence has been reported with demyelinating disease, brain abscess and neurocysticercosis. Solis and Hansen first describe the use of 5-ALA in fungal abscesses. They detail a 54-year-old patient presenting with dysarthria and left facial droop with imaging suggestive of high-grade primary intracerebral neoplasm. In using 5-ALA, the abscess fluoresced pink whereas the surrounding healthy brain tissue remained blue, further suggesting a diagnosis of glioma. However, histopathological analysis confirmed Cryptococcus infection, and the patient was started on antifungal therapy. The 4-month follow up showed no remaining evidence of intracerebral infection, and there were no significant neurologic deficits at 9 months postresection. Aside from this report, the literature regarding intraoperative 5-ALA in the context of intracerebral fungal abscesses is extremely limited. To date, 5-ALA fluorescence of C. bantiana has not been documented. Meanwhile, in 2017, Aljuboori et al reported treatment of C. bantiana using antifungals and surgical resection without intraoperative 5-ALA fluorescence. They report a 59-year-old man with bilateral frontal ring enhancing lesions initially thought to be bacterial abscess but later confirmed as C. bantiana. The patient had undergone stereotactic aspiration with enlargement of abscesses 1 week later, followed by attempted aggressive total resection. Several months later, the patient showed enlarging lesions and underwent repeat surgical debridement and further antifungals, which ultimately resolved the fungal infection. This is consistent with several other incidences of worsening abscesses after surgical resection of C. bantiana, highlighting the importance of complete resection of the abscess capsule in preventing serial surgeries. As described in our case, 5-ALA successfully highlighted the fungal abscess capsule with impressive clarity. The use of 5-ALA in malignant glioma resection is widely recognized to facilitate significantly higher rates of complete resection, enhancing surgical precision and outcomes. Therefore, we propose that 5-ALA indication for non-neoplastic lesion resection be considered to support comprehensive removal and promote improved patient outcomes.

### Recent developments in the surgical management of perianal fistula for Crohn's disease [^115yr44V]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Incision and drainage of abscesses

The most common indication for operative intervention with perianal CD is septic complications, which include abscesses or undrained fistulas. All clinically symptomatic abscesses require incision and drainage. This is usually required urgently or emergently to control sepsis. Small (< 1 cm), clinically occult abscesses that are demonstrated on imaging can generally be treated with medical therapy alone.

It is important to recognize the relationship between an abscess and, most likely, an associated fistulous tract in CD patients. In one small series by Williamson et al, all patients who underwent drainage of abscesses only failed treatment. Conflicting results were found by Michelassi et al, who demonstrated complete healing in 68%, with only 32% going on to develop fistulizing disease. It is important to note that perianal abscesses have been reported to represent a complication of IFX treatment, possibly due to cutaneous end closure prior to internal opening closure. In a population-based study, Jones et al found that since the approval of biologics for use in CD, the incidence of anal fistula repair has remained stable, but perianal abscess incision and drainage has increased threefold.

Seton placement

A seton is a silastic loop or suture that is placed in a fistulous tract and left in place. Setons are used to keep fistulous tracts open, allowing them to drain in order to prevent reaccumulation of undrained sepsis. As long as non-cutting setons are used, the risk of sphincter damage or compromising continence are low. Also, setons can be left in place long-term while medical treatments are used. Unfortunately, when setons are removed, there is a high recurrence rate of recurrent local sepsis, up to 70%. Removing setons may have initial short-term healing success, but if followed longer, most patients will have recurrence, especially in the absence of additional treatment. For this reason, some advocate permanent seton placement in this patient population.

If removal of a seton is planned, optimal timing of when to remove it is unclear. If setons are removed too early, there is a high risk of development of recurrent perianal abscess. If one is not removed quickly enough, however, the presence of a foreign body will prevent complete fistula healing. Furthermore, timing of seton placement and removal in coordination with IFX use is controversial.

Seton drainage is often used as a temporary control of fistula drainage until the patient's condition is appropriate to undergo a definitive fistula closure.

### Practice parameters for the treatment of perianal abscess and fistula-in-ano (revised) [^113cK3Mc]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2005). Low credibility.

The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons is dedicated to assuring high-quality patient care by advancing the science, prevention, and management of disorders and diseases of the colon, rectum, and anus. The Standards Committee is composed of Society members who are chosen because they have demonstrated expertise in the specialty of colon and rectal surgery. This Committee was created to lead international efforts in defining quality care for conditions related to the colon, rectum, and anus. This is accompanied by developing Clinical Practice Guidelines based on the best available evidence. These guidelines are inclusive, and not prescriptive. Their purpose is to provide information on which decisions can be made, rather than dictate a specific form of treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners, health care workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient.

Acute thyroiditis — presentation and treatment: Patients with acute thyroiditis (also referred to as suppurative thyroiditis or thyroid abscess) are generally euthyroid, but on occasion the condition presents as destructive thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis. The etiology is most frequently a bacterial infection, and therapy involves systemic antibiotics as well as abscess drainage or removal, and excision or occlusion of the offending pyriform sinus; thyrotoxicosis should be treated symptomatically with β-blocking agents, and in other forms of destructive thyroiditis, there is no role for ATDs. Acute thyroiditis should be treated with antibiotics and surgical drainage as determined by clinical judgement, and beta-blockers may be used to treat symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses after incision… [^117K9Mud]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- TMP-SMX or clindamycin can be combined with incision and drainage of skin abscesses to decrease the risk of treatment failure and recurrence.
- TMP-SMX is weakly recommended over clindamycin because of its lower risk of diarrhea.
- Cephalosporins are not likely to have reduced rates of treatment failure compared with incision and drainage alone. From the AFP Editors Skin abscesses, which are a collection of pus in the dermis and deeper tissues and often appear as erythematous and indurated nodules, typically result from a bacterial infection. Current clinical guidelines recommend against the use of antibiotics for uncomplicated lesions after incision and drainage. Recently, however, a collaboration between the BMJ and the MAGIC group led an international panel made up of a variety of health care professionals and adults with experience treating and living with skin abscesses to create recommendations regarding antibiotic use based on identified benefits, harms, cost, treatment burden, evidence quality, and patient preferences. The recommendations apply to all adults and children with uncomplicated skin abscesses who present to the emergency department or family physician offices, including those with abscesses of all sizes, first occurrence or recurrence of abscesses, and abscesses with unknown pathogens. They do not apply to patients with systemic illnesses, deep tissue infection, superficial infection, hidradenitis suppurativa, or immunocompromising conditions, or to patients who do not require abscess incision and drainage.

Recommendations Based on high-quality evidence, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin combined with incision and drainage has been shown to decrease the risk of treatment failure by approximately 5% at one month and the risk of recurrence by approximately 8% at three months compared with no antibiotic treatment. TMPSMX and clindamycin also are associated with decreases in pain, hospitalizations, and infections in household contacts based on moderate-quality evidence. There is no crucial difference in treatment failure between TMP-SMX and clindamycin, and both have similar risk of recurrence. TMP-SMX is typically taken twice per day, and clindamycin is taken three or four times per day; both are often combined with over-the-counter pain medication. TMP-SMX is usually inexpensive, whereas clindamycin can be expensive in some areas. However, both are available by prescription or over the counter in many countries.

Using the GRADE framework, the panel gave a weak recommendation in favor of TMP-SMX over clindamycin. Either agent is recommended over incision and drainage alone. Adverse effects depend on which antibiotic is prescribed. For example, clindamycin is mainly associated with a greater risk of diarrhea and other gastrointestinal effects compared with no antibiotic treatment, and TMP-SMX is associated with an increased risk of nausea and diarrhea, although to a slightly lesser degree than clindamycin. Because of this lower risk of diarrhea, TMP-SMX is recommended over clindamycin. This decision should be made in conjunction with the patient to ensure that the option chosen is in line with what the patient determines is most important with regard to desirable outcomes and undesirable consequences. Patients who prefer to avoid recurrence may opt to take clindamycin, whereas those who prefer avoiding diarrhea may select TMP-SMX.

### Expanded criteria for percutaneous abscess drainage… [^117Vkeg7]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The original criteria for percutaneous abscess drainage were limited to simple abscesses with safe drainage routes. We expanded these entry criteria to include complex abscesses, multiple abscesses, abscesses with enteric fistulas or whose drainage routes traversed normal organs, as well as complicated abscesses. Using these expanded criteria, cure was achieved nonoperatively in 92 of 125 abscesses with ten deaths, and 11 complications. Cure was achieved in 82% of simple abscesses, but only 45% of complex abscesses. There was no correlation between size, depth, drainage route, or etiology of the abscess with either cure or complications.

We recommend a trial of percutaneous drainage in all simple abscesses and most complex abscesses with clinical response as the key determinant of the need for operative intervention.

### Drainage sufficient treatment for smaller uncomplicated… [^115niZ3T]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

The incision and drainage technique has historically been the standard of care for skin abscesses. However, because of concerns about community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, antibiotic therapy is often added to incision and drainage for abscess management, even though it is unknown whether it improves clinical outcomes. Duong and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of antibiotics versus placebo in the treatment of abscesses after incision and drainage. The Study: The authors evaluated 149 children three months to 18 years of age who presented with a skin abscess. Following incision and drainage, probing for loculations, and wound culturing, patients were randomized to receive placebo or a 10-day course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

All patients had symptoms for less than one week, did not appear to have any signs of toxicity, and had a temperature of less than 101. 1°F. Patients with chronic health problems, recent immunosuppressant or antibiotic use, and contraindications to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were excluded. Patients were told not to use topical antiseptics or antibiotics at home to avoid potential confounding factors, and were reevaluated 10 and 90 days later for signs of recurrence. Treatment failure was defined as worsening signs or symptoms, or presence of persistent cellulitis or abscess at the 10-day follow-up visit. Results: Mean abscess diameter before incision and drainage was 2. 2 ±

1. 5 cm as determined by ultrasonography. Community-acquired MRSA accounted for 80 percent of culture-isolated bacteria; however, all isolates were sensitive to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.

Adverse effect rates were similar between the groups, with no serious effects reported. Failure rates also were similar between groups at follow-up on day 10 and day 90, and did not correlate with abscess size or the presence of community-acquired MRSA. The authors note that more patients in the placebo group experienced new lesions at day 10, but suggest that future studies be conducted to support this. Conclusion: The authors conclude that adding antibiotic therapy to incision and drainage does not improve abscess resolution rates more than incision and drainage alone among children, even when MRSA is the responsible organism.

editor's note: A study of adults with uncomplicated abscesses also reported that antibiotics did not improve cure rates beyond incision and drainage alone — although the authors reported that 87. 8 percent of cases were caused by MRSA and cephalexin was used. 1 Nevertheless, the study by Duong and colleagues has several caveats. Compliance rates were low, which could have artificially decreased the antibiotic group's reported cure rate. Furthermore, the current study was restricted to previously healthy children who did not appear toxic and had temperatures of less than 101. 1°F. Despite the proven historic benefit of incision and drainage for treating abscesses, further studies would be useful to determine if the technique is sufficient to treat more complicated conditions. — k. t. m.
