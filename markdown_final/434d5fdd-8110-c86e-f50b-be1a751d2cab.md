## Question

Asthma treatment

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about asthma treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment philosophy and goals. Then, I should verify the stepwise framework and how severity and control guide therapy. Next, I will examine controller options, including ICS, ICS-LABA, and SMART/MART, and reconcile guideline differences. After that, I need to check acute management, including SABA, systemic corticosteroids, and adjuncts. I will then review special populations and severe asthma strategies, including biologics. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, step-down principles, and practical implementation details, making sure each claim is supported by current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the treatment philosophy and goals. Asthma management is control-based and iterative, aiming for good symptom control and minimized future risk of exacerbations, lung function decline, and medication adverse effects, with treatment adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review, incorporating patient preferences and modifiable risk factors [^55ce005b] [^eb946f0d] [^93ee64d1].

> I need to verify the stepwise framework. GINA organizes therapy into Steps 1–5 by age group, with population-level "preferred" regimens at each step and allowance for individualized choices based on phenotype, comorbidities, and patient goals; severity is defined retrospectively by the treatment intensity required to achieve control, which is crucial for identifying severe asthma and guiding escalation [^44fe7b15] [^ba8dc1b8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about controllers. I should confirm the role of ICS. ICS are foundational across ages because they reduce severe exacerbations and mortality; SABA-only therapy is no longer recommended due to increased risk of severe events, and ICS should be initiated even in patients with infrequent symptoms if risk factors for exacerbations are present [^0dd9f0c2] [^4ad523f0] [^ac67696c].

> Next, I should review reliever strategies. Let me verify the shift toward anti-inflammatory reliever therapy. GINA's preferred Track 1 uses low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed for mild asthma and ICS-formoterol MART for Steps 3–5, which reduces severe exacerbations versus SABA alone; Track 2 retains SABA plus daily ICS, but SABA-only is discouraged; AAFP similarly supports as-needed ICS-formoterol to reduce severe exacerbations in mild asthma [^4ad523f0] [^547ea506].

> Wait, I should double-check the evidence base for SMART/MART. Large RCTs and real-world data show SMART reduces exacerbations versus higher-dose ICS-LABA and versus SABA-only strategies; NAEPP endorses SMART for Steps 3–4 and notes feasibility in Step 2, with explicit dose ceilings and counseling on increased reliever use signaling the need to adjust maintenance dosing [^c3760644] [^b593eb25].

> I will now examine combination therapy. ICS-LABA is preferred when symptoms are more frequent or control is suboptimal; adding LAMA to ICS-LABA can further reduce exacerbations in moderate-to-severe asthma, and this is reflected in both GINA and AAFP guidance, with triple therapy considered when dual therapy is insufficient [^55ce005b] [^2001384e].

> Let me consider LTRA positioning. LTRA are less effective than ICS for exacerbation prevention and are generally reserved for add-on therapy or when ICS are not tolerated, so I should avoid overpromising their role as controllers [^da3e4e19].

> Next, I should review acute management. Rapid reversal with inhaled SABA is first-line, ideally via pMDI with spacer; frequent dosing every 20 minutes up to three cycles is reasonable in mild-to-moderate exacerbations, with cessation if response is adequate; systemic corticosteroids should be given early for moderate-to-severe exacerbations or if there is no sustained SABA response, as they speed resolution and reduce relapse [^feae4a2d] [^5ff0ef99] [^d0103655].

> Hold on, I should verify adjuncts in the ED. Adding ipratropium to SABA reduces hospitalizations and improves lung function in moderate-to-severe exacerbations; intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended for severe or life-threatening attacks, particularly with poor response to initial therapy; heliox may be considered in severe cases, though evidence is weaker; conversely, routine IV aminophylline/theophylline is not recommended due to limited benefit and higher adverse effects [^ffe4805f] [^05ea8315] [^43fb50ba].

> I need to ensure I address antibiotics. Routine antibiotics are not indicated for acute asthma exacerbations without clear evidence of bacterial infection; recent real-world data show no reduction in treatment failure or subsequent exacerbations when antibiotics are added to oral corticosteroids in primary care, reinforcing a conservative approach [^e5307e4b] [^6ad66147] [^c91cdbdc].

> Let me think about special populations. In children 6–11 years, preferred initial therapy mirrors adults but with lower ICS doses; SMART/MART is an option in Steps 3–4, and systemic corticosteroid dosing is weight-based with shorter courses; in children 5 years and younger, low-dose ICS are first-line for persistent symptoms, with careful attention to growth monitoring and caregiver education [^da3e4e19] [^9c664514].

> For severe asthma, I should confirm the pathway. Severe asthma is defined retrospectively by the need for high-intensity therapy or uncontrolled disease despite it; after confirming the diagnosis and optimizing basics (adherence, inhaler technique, comorbidities), add-on options include LAMA, macrolides in Type 2 inflammation, and biologics targeting IgE, IL-5/5R, or IL-4Rα for Type 2–high phenotypes; FeNO-guided strategies can reduce exacerbations in selected patients [^ba8dc1b8] [^7f184487] [^ce2a34d8].

> But wait, what about step-down and follow-up. Once control is stable for 2–3 months, I should step down to the lowest effective dose, monitor closely, and provide a written action plan; after an exacerbation, review the action plan, ensure ICS-containing therapy is continued, and arrange follow-up within 2–7 days; patients with repeated exacerbations despite Step 4–5 therapy should be referred for specialist evaluation [^ff163c6f] [^0953331a] [^da0a3408].

> I should confirm practical implementation details. Inhaler technique must be checked at every visit, spacers improve delivery, and adherence counseling is essential; shared decision-making improves engagement and outcomes; for cost-sensitive settings, as-needed ICS-formoterol can be more cost-effective by reducing exacerbations and healthcare utilization, though local pricing and access matter [^55ce005b] [^a29205c4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought SABA-only might still be acceptable for truly mild, infrequent symptoms, but I should correct that. Even patients labeled "mild" can have severe or fatal exacerbations, and SABA-only increases risk; therefore, ICS-containing therapy is recommended even for mild disease, with as-needed ICS-formoterol as the preferred reliever strategy when available [^4ad523f0] [^ba8dc1b8].

> In summary, I need to ensure the care cycle remains explicit: assess control and risk, treat with ICS-containing therapy tailored to step and phenotype, review response in 1–3 months, escalate if uncontrolled or step down if stable, and embed education and action plans to close the loop; this approach aligns with GINA, NAEPP, and AAFP and is supported by RCTs, meta-analyses, and real-world effectiveness data [^55ce005b] [^c3760644] [^547ea506].

---

Asthma treatment is a **stepwise, control-based approach** that balances symptom control with risk reduction, using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the cornerstone [^0dd9f0c2] and escalating therapy based on severity and control [^55ce005b]. For mild asthma, **as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol** is preferred over SABA-only therapy to reduce exacerbations [^4ad523f0] [^547ea506]; for moderate-to-severe asthma, daily ICS-LABA with add-on therapies (LAMA, biologics) is used [^55ce005b] [^741f8255]. Acute exacerbations require rapid-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and oxygen; magnesium sulfate or heliox are added for severe cases [^d0103655] [^05ea8315]. Patient education, inhaler technique, and written action plans are essential to optimize adherence and outcomes [^3b601924] [^29257e37].

## Chronic asthma management

### Stepwise treatment approach

GINA and NAEPP recommend a **stepwise approach**, tailoring therapy to symptom control and exacerbation risk [^55ce005b] [^741f8255]:

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed | Mild asthma |
| 2 | Daily low-dose ICS or ICS-formoterol as needed | Mild persistent asthma |
| 3 | Low-dose ICS-LABA daily or ICS-formoterol MART | Moderate asthma |
| 4 | Medium/high-dose ICS-LABA ± LAMA or LTRA | Severe asthma |
| 5 | Add biologics or oral corticosteroids | Severe, uncontrolled asthma |

---

### Controller medications

- **Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)**: Cornerstone therapy reducing symptoms and exacerbations [^0dd9f0c2].
- **Long-acting beta-agonists (LABA)**: Added to ICS for moderate-to-severe asthma [^55ce005b].
- **Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA)**: Add-on for moderate-to-severe asthma [^2001384e].
- **Biologics**: For severe, uncontrolled asthma (e.g. anti-IgE, anti-IL5, anti-IL4R) [^597da5fa].

---

### Reliever medications

- **Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)**: Rapid relief of acute symptoms [^feae4a2d].
- **ICS-formoterol**: Preferred reliever in mild asthma; reduces exacerbations vs SABA-only [^4ad523f0] [^547ea506].

---

## Acute asthma exacerbations

### Initial management

- **Rapid-acting bronchodilators**: Albuterol via MDI/spacer or nebulizer [^feae4a2d].
- **Systemic corticosteroids**: Oral prednisone preferred; IV for severe cases [^d0103655].
- **Oxygen**: Target SpO2 ≥ 93% [^notfound].

---

### Adjunctive therapies for severe exacerbations

- **Magnesium sulfate**: IV for severe/refractory cases [^05ea8315].
- **Heliox**: Consider in severe airway obstruction [^05ea8315].
- **Noninvasive ventilation**: For respiratory failure [^notfound].

---

## Special populations

### Pediatric asthma

In pediatric asthma, **ICS are first-line**; leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are alternatives [^da3e4e19]. For children aged 6–11 years, the stepwise approach is similar to adults, with lower doses [^da3e4e19]. In children ≤ 5 years, ICS are first-line; intermittent ICS may be used for viral wheeze [^da3e4e19].

---

### Pregnancy

During pregnancy, **ICS are safe and recommended**; maintain control to avoid maternal/fetal complications.

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions include **patient education** on inhaler technique, adherence, and trigger avoidance [^3b601924]. Written action plans enable early recognition and treatment of worsening symptoms [^c5eabd05]. Smoking cessation and weight management improve control [^7f184487]. Allergen immunotherapy may be considered for allergic asthma [^741f8255].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up every 3–12 months should assess **control, adherence, and inhaler technique** [^fea5b03e]. Lung function testing (FEV1, peak flow) tracks control and guides therapy [^478f45d0]. After exacerbations, follow-up within 2–7 days is recommended [^0953331a].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Digital health tools, including telemedicine and mobile apps, support **remote monitoring and adherence** [^notfound]. Novel biologics targeting specific pathways (e.g. TSLP, prostaglandin D2) are in development [^notfound]. Personalized medicine uses biomarkers (e.g. FeNO, eosinophils) to tailor therapy [^ce2a34d8].

---

Asthma treatment is a **stepwise, control-based strategy** anchored by ICS, with therapy escalated to ICS-LABA and biologics as needed. Acute care relies on bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and oxygen, with adjuncts for severe cases. Education, adherence, and regular follow-up are critical to achieving optimal outcomes [^55ce005b].

Background

Asthma is an illness that commonly affects adults and children, and it serves as a common reason for children to attend emergency departments. An asthma exacerbation is characterised by acute or subacute worsening of shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness and may be triggered by viral respiratory infection, poor compliance with usual medication, a change in the weather, or exposure to allergens or irritants. Most children with asthma have mild or moderate exacerbations and respond well to first-line therapy (inhaled short-acting beta-agonists and systemic corticosteroids). However, the best treatment for the small proportion of seriously ill children who do not respond to first-line therapy is not well understood. Currently, a large number of treatment options are available and there is wide variation in management.

Objectives

Main objective - To summarise Cochrane Reviews with or without meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment for children with acute exacerbations of asthma (i.e. after first-line treatments, titrated oxygen delivery, and administration of intermittent inhaled short-acting beta 2 -agonists and oral corticosteroids have been tried and have failed) Secondary objectives - To identify gaps in the current evidence base that will inform recommendations for future research and subsequent Cochrane Reviews - To categorise information on reported outcome measures used in trials of escalation of treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma in children, and to make recommendations for development and reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews - To identify relevant randomised controlled trials that have been published since the date of publication of each included review METHODS: We included Cochrane Reviews assessing interventions for children with acute exacerbations of asthma. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 28 December 2019. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but were not currently included in, published reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the ROBIS criteria (tool used to assess risk of bias in systematic reviews). We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials. Primary outcomes were length of stay, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and adverse effects. We summarised all findings in the text and reported data for each outcome in 'Additional tables'.

Main Results

We identified 17 potentially eligible Cochrane Reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, 13 reviews that reported results for children alone. We excluded four reviews as one did not include any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one did not provide subgroup data for children, and the last two had been updated and replaced by subsequent reviews. The 13 reviews included 67 trials; the number of trials in each review ranged from a single trial up to 27 trials. The vast majority of comparisons included between one and three trials, involving fewer than 100 participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 2630. All studies included children; 16 (24%) included children younger than two years of age. Most of the reviews reported search dates older than four years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane Reviews. Key findings, in terms of our primary outcomes, are that (1) intravenous magnesium sulfate was the only intervention shown to reduce hospital length of stay (high-certainty evidence); (2) no evidence suggested that any intervention reduced the risk of intensive care admission (low- to very low-certainty evidence); (3) the risk of hospital admission was reduced by the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists (moderate-certainty evidence), the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate (high-certainty evidence), and the use of inhaled heliox (low-certainty evidence); (4) the addition of inhaled magnesium sulfate to usual bronchodilator therapy appears to reduce serious adverse events during hospital admission (moderate-certainty evidence); (5) aminophylline increased vomiting compared to placebo (moderate-certainty evidence) and increased nausea and nausea/vomiting compared to intravenous beta 2 -agonists (low-certainty evidence); and (6) the addition of anticholinergic therapy to short-acting beta 2 -agonists appeared to reduce the risk of nausea (high-certainty evidence) and tremor (moderate-certainty evidence) but not vomiting (low-certainty evidence). We considered 4 of the 13 reviews to be at high risk of bias based on the ROBIS framework. In all cases, this was due to concerns regarding identification and selection of studies. The certainty of evidence varied widely (by review and also by outcome) and ranged from very low to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on interventions for escalation of therapy for acute exacerbations of asthma in children from Cochrane Reviews of randomised controlled trials. A vast majority of comparisons involved between one and three trials and fewer than 100 participants, making it difficult to assess the balance between benefits and potential harms. Due to the lack of comparative studies between various treatment options, we are unable to make firm practice recommendations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate appears to reduce both hospital length of stay and the risk of hospital admission. Hospital admission is also reduced with the addition of inhaled anticholinergic agents to inhaled beta 2 -agonists. However, further research is required to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Due to the relatively rare incidence of acute severe paediatric asthma, multi-centre research will be required to generate high-quality evidence. A number of existing Cochrane Reviews should be updated, and we recommend that a new review be conducted on the use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy. Important priorities include development of an internationally agreed core outcome set for future trials in acute severe asthma exacerbations and determination of clinically important differences in these outcomes, which can then inform adequately powered future trials.

### Mechanisms and management of asthma exacerbations [^cab59bba]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute asthma remains an important medical emergency, the most frequent cause of acute admissions in children and a major source of morbidity for adults with asthma. In all ages with asthma, the presence of exacerbations is an important defining characteristic of asthma severity. In this review, we assess the epidemiology of acute asthma, the triggers of acute exacerbations, and the mechanisms that underlie these exacerbations. We also assess current treatments that prevent exacerbations, with an emphasis on the role of type 2 airway inflammation in the context of acute exacerbations and the novel treatments that effectively target this. Finally we review current management strategies of the exacerbations themselves.

### Corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma [^34bd996f]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease, which is characterised by reversible airflow obstruction in response to a variety of stimuli. Exacerbations in response to airway irritants are part of the natural history of asthma, but often they also represent a failure in chronic treatment. Presentations to emergency departments and other acute care settings are common and frequently lead to hospitalisation and other complications. After treatment, however, most patients are discharged to the care of their primary care physician for further management. This review highlights the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids as mainstays of treatment in the acute and sub-acute phase of an exacerbation. These agents form the basis of most current clinical practice guidelines, yet their use is not universal. We will review the evidence for the use of these agents that arises from the Cochrane Collaboration of Systematic Reviews contained in the Cochrane Library.

### Asthma exacerbations: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment [^b0338993]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline-based management of asthma focuses on disease severity and choosing the appropriate medical therapy to control symptoms and reduce the risk of exacerbations. However, irrespective of asthma severity and often despite optimal medical therapy, patients may experience acute exacerbations of symptoms and a loss of disease control. Asthma exacerbations are most commonly triggered by viral respiratory infections, particularly with human rhinovirus. Given the importance of these events to asthma morbidity and health care costs, we will review common inciting factors for asthma exacerbations and approaches to prevent and treat these events.

### Practical management of acute asthma in adults [^a09665f4]. Respiratory Care (2002). Low credibility.

All asthma patients are at risk for acute asthma exacerbations. Moderate to severe exacerbations account for many emergency department visits and subsequent hospitalizations each year. Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of acute asthma. The purpose of this review is to provide practical guidance in the assessment and treatment of adults with acute asthma in the hospital setting. Managing patients with acute asthma involves assessing the severity of the exacerbation, implementing measures to rapidly reverse airflow limitation, and instituting therapies that limit the progression of airway inflammation. Some patients may benefit from other supportive measures such as heliox and noninvasive ventilation. If the patient continues to deteriorate and requires mechanical ventilation, then ventilator settings that minimize the risk of hyperinflation should be chosen. After an episode of acute asthma, long-term preventive medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids, should be prescribed and education should be provided to prevent future episodes.

### Increased versus stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids for exacerbations of chronic asthma in adults and children [^ba7dc490]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

People with asthma may experience exacerbations, or 'attacks', during which their symptoms worsen and additional treatment is required. Written action plans sometimes advocate a short-term increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the first sign of an exacerbation to reduce the severity of the attack and to prevent the need for oral steroids or hospital admission.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and safety of increased versus stable doses of ICS as part of a patient-initiated action plan for the home management of exacerbations in children and adults with persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, which is derived from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and handsearched abstracts to 20 December 2021. We also searched major trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that allocated people with persistent asthma to take a blinded inhaler in the event of an exacerbation which either increased their daily dose of ICS or kept it stable (placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed quality, and extracted data. We reassessed risk of bias for all studies at the result level using the revised risk of bias tool for RCTs (Risk of Bias 2), and employed the GRADE approach to assess our confidence in the synthesised effect estimates. The primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as the need for rescue oral steroids in the randomised population. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure in the subset who initiated the study inhaler (treated population), unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, serious and non-serious adverse events, and duration of exacerbation.

Main Results

This review update added a new study that increased the number of people in the primary analysis from 1520 to 1774, and incorporates the most up-to-date methods to assess the likely impact of bias within the meta-analyses. The updated review now includes nine RCTs (1923 participants; seven parallel and two cross-over) conducted in Europe, North America, and Australasia and published between 1998 and 2018. Five studies evaluated adult populations (n = 1247; ≥ 15 years), and four studies evaluated child or adolescent populations (n = 676; < 15 years). All study participants had mild to moderate asthma. Studies varied in the dose of maintenance ICS, age, fold increase of ICS in the event of an exacerbation, criteria for initiating the study inhaler, and allowed medications. Approximately 50% of randomised participants initiated the study inhaler (range 23% to 100%), and the included studies reported treatment failure in a variety of ways, meaning assumptions were required to permit the combining of data. Participants randomised to increase their ICS dose at the first signs of an exacerbation had similar odds of needing rescue oral corticosteroids to those randomised to a placebo inhaler (odds ratio (OR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.25; 8 studies; 1774 participants; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence). We could draw no firm conclusions from subgroup analyses conducted to investigate the impact of age, time to treatment initiation, baseline dose, smoking history, and fold increase of ICS on the primary outcome. Results for the same outcome in the subset of participants who initiated the study inhaler were unchanged from the previous version, which provides a different point estimate with very low confidence due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and risk of bias (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; 7 studies; 766 participants; I² = 42%; random-effects model). Confidence was reduced due to risk of bias and assumptions that had to be made to include study data in the intention-to-treat and treated-population analyses. Sensitivity analyses that tested the impact of assumptions made for synthesis and to exclude cross-over studies, studies at overall high risk of bias, and those with commercial funding did not change our conclusions. Pooled effects for unscheduled physician visits, unscheduled acute care, emergency department or hospital visits, and duration of exacerbation made it very difficult to determine where the true effect may lie, and confidence was reduced by risk of bias. Point estimates for both serious and non-serious adverse events favoured keeping ICS stable, but imprecision and risk of bias due to missing data and outcome measurement and reporting reduced our confidence in the effects (serious adverse events: OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.71; 2 studies; 394 participants; I² = 0%; non-serious adverse events: OR 2.15, 95% CI 0.68 to 6.73; 2 studies; 142 participants; I² = 0%).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence from double-blind trials of adults and children with mild to moderate asthma suggests there is unlikely to be an important reduction in the need for oral steroids from increasing a patient's ICS dose at the first sign of an exacerbation. Other clinically important benefits and potential harms of increased doses of ICS compared with keeping the dose stable cannot be ruled out due to wide confidence intervals, risk of bias in the trials, and assumptions that had to be made for synthesis. Included studies conducted between 1998 and 2018 reflect evolving clinical practice and study methods, and the data do not support thorough investigation of effect modifiers such as baseline dose, fold increase, asthma severity and timing. The review does not include recent evidence from pragmatic, unblinded studies showing benefits of larger dose increases in those with poorly controlled asthma. A systematic review is warranted to examine the differences between the blinded and unblinded trials using robust methods for assessing risk of bias to present the most complete view of the evidence for decision makers.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute asthma exacerbations [^d09cb637]. The Journal of Asthma (2006). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of asthma may represent reactions to airway irritants or failures of chronic treatment. The costs to both the patient and society are high. Exacerbations often are frightening episodes that can cause significant morbidity and sometimes death. The emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations often required lead to significant health care expenses. Thus, preventing and optimizing management of acute exacerbations is critical. Corticosteroids are a cornerstone of asthma therapy. They have been shown to lower admission rates and reduce risk of relapse. This article provides an overview of the role of corticosteroids (including betamethasone, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone) in the management of acute asthma exacerbations, with an aim toward effective decision making about the choice of therapy.

### Treatment strategies for reducing asthma-related emergency department visits [^cd29ffd6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acute asthma exacerbations reflect inadequate long-term disease control. Treatment to control acute asthma exacerbations includes: 1) rapid reversal of airflow obstruction with bronchodilators and systemic corticosteroids and reversing hypoxemia with oxygen in the emergency department (ED); 2) preventing early relapse by prescribing beta(2) agonists and oral corticosteroids at discharge and ensuring patients have an adequate supply of their other asthma medications; and 3) preventing future asthma exacerbations and ED visits through effective treatment in primary care. This article discusses each treatment and reviews the role of emergency physicians in treating patients to reverse airflow obstruction and prevent early relapse, future exacerbations, and ED visits by communicating the need for additional asthma control to patients' primary care physicians.

### Macrolide antibiotics and asthma treatment [^b888a3dd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment for acute asthma exacerbations is a major need not adequately met by current therapies. Although virus infections are the major cause of acute exacerbations, other factors can increase the risk/severity of exacerbations. Increasing evidence suggests atypical bacterial infections contribute to exacerbation severity, as well as stable asthma, particularly severe asthma. Macrolide antibiotics and the new ketolide antibiotic telithromycin are active against atypical bacteria and also have anti-inflammatory activity. A recent study has shown telithromycin to be effective in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma, although the mechanism or mechanisms of action were not determined. Controlled studies report small improvements in lung function with macrolide treatment of stable asthma. Further studies are urgently required to assess the role of such therapies in acute exacerbations and in severe stable asthma, in which the risk/benefit ratios are likely to be most in favor of therapy demonstrated to be effective.

### Management of acute exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department [^10fc1cda]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are the most common respiratory diseases requiring emergent medical evaluation and treatment. Asthma and COPD are chronic, debilitating disease processes that have been differentiated traditionally by the presence or absence of reversible airflow obstruction. Asthma and COPD exacerbations impose an enormous economic burden on the US health care budget. In daily clinical practice, it is difficult to differentiate these 2 obstructive processes based on their symptoms, and on their nearly identical acute treatment strategies; major differences are important when discussing anatomic sites involved, long-term prognosis, and the nature of inflammatory markers.

### Asthma update [^4c03a984]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma continues to be one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and a leading cause of hospitalization. Acute management involves severity-based treatment of bronchoconstriction and underlying airway inflammation. Optimal treatment has been defined and standardized through randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and consensus guidelines. Implementation of clinical practice guidelines may improve clinical, quality, and safety outcomes. Asthma morbidity is disproportionately high in poor, urban, and minority children. Children treated in emergency departments commonly have persistent chronic severity, significant morbidity, and infrequent follow-up and primary asthma care, and prescription of inhaled corticosteroids is appropriate.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^db0a98d6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Global Strategy for Asthma — initial presentation during an acute exacerbation indicates that for "Initial asthma presentation is during an acute exacerbation," the preferred initial treatment (Track 1) is "Treat as for exacerbation (Box 9–4, p.167 and Box 9–6, p.171), including short course of OCS if severe; commence medium-dose MART (Evidence D)." The alternative initial treatment (Track 2) is "Treat as for exacerbation (Box 9–4, p.167 and Box 9–6, p.171), including short course of OCS if severe; commence medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA (Evidence D)."

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^f06e4a52]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Acute asthma — Although there is a strong emphasis on minimizing oral corticosteroid (OCS) use to reduce long-term cumulative adverse effects, OCS are essential in management of acute severe asthma, and the occurrence of any severe exacerbation should be a prompt to assess the patient thoroughly, optimize their asthma treatment, and consider referral for expert advice to reduce the risk of another exacerbation occurring; evidence about use of dexamethasone has been updated based on the latest evidence.

### Asthma [^1d7a819d]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Asthma-one of the most common chronic, non-communicable diseases in children and adults-is characterised by variable respiratory symptoms and variable airflow limitation. Asthma is a consequence of complex gene-environment interactions, with heterogeneity in clinical presentation and the type and intensity of airway inflammation and remodelling. The goal of asthma treatment is to achieve good asthma control-ie, to minimise symptom burden and risk of exacerbations. Anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator treatments are the mainstay of asthma therapy and are used in a stepwise approach. Pharmacological treatment is based on a cycle of assessment and re-evaluation of symptom control, risk factors, comorbidities, side-effects, and patient satisfaction by means of shared decisions. Asthma is classed as severe when requiring high-intensity treatment to keep it under control, or if it remains uncontrolled despite treatment. New biological therapies for treatment of severe asthma, together with developments in biomarkers, present opportunities for phenotype-specific interventions and realisation of more personalised treatment. In this Seminar, we provide a clinically focused overview of asthma, including epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, asthma phenotypes, severe asthma, acute exacerbations, and clinical management of disease in adults and children older than 5 years. Emerging therapies, controversies, and uncertainties in asthma management are also discussed.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^55ce005b]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

### Corticosteroids for preventing relapse following acute exacerbations of asthma [^ee27c27b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute asthma is responsible for many emergency department visits annually. Between 12–16% will relapse to require additional interventions within two weeks of ED discharge. Treatment of acute asthma is based on rapid reversal of bronchospasm and reducing airway inflammation and this review examines the evidence for using systemic corticosteroids to improve outcomes after discharge from the ED.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of corticosteroids (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous) for the treatment of asthmatic patients discharged from an acute care setting (i.e. usually the emergency department) after assessment and treatment of an acute asthmatic exacerbation.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Airways Group "Asthma and Wheez* RCT" register was searched using the terms: a) Asthma OR Wheez* b) Glucocorticoid OR Steroid* AND c) Exacerbat* OR Relapse* OR Emerg*. In addition, authors of all included studies were contacted to determine if unpublished studies which met the inclusion criteria were available. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews and texts were also searched for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

Only randomized controlled trials were eligible for selection. Studies were included in this review if they dealt with the outpatient treatment of asthmatic exacerbations using glucocorticoids at discharge and reported either relapse rate or PFTs. Two independent reviewers first identified potentially relevant studies and then selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers. Agreement was assessed using kappa (k) statistics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two reviewers; authors were contacted to verify the extracted data and clarify missing information. When author contact was unsuccessful, missing data were estimated from graphs where possible. Sensitivity, sub-group and overall analyses were performed using the Cochrane Review Manager.

Main Results

A search that yielded 229 references identified 169 (73%) original publications. Reviewers identified 8 studies for potential inclusion (k = 0.76); 18 references were added by searching publication reference lists and contact with authors. Of these 26 articles, a total of 7 were included in the overview. Two studies used intramuscular corticosteroids, five studies used oral corticosteroids. Significantly fewer patients in the corticosteroid group relapsed to receive additional care in the first week (odds ratio (OR) 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17, 0.73). This favourable effect was maintained over the first 21 days (OR 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.82). Patients receiving corticosteroids had less need for beta-agonists (weighted mean difference (WMD) -3.3 activations/day; 95% CI: -5.5, -1.0). Changes in pulmonary function tests (SMD 0.045; 95% CI: -0.47, 0.56) and side effects (SMD 0.03; 95% CI: -0.38, 0.44) in the first 7–10 days, while rarely reported, showed no differences between the treatment groups. Statistically significant heterogeneity was identified for the side effect results; all other outcomes were homogeneous. It appears that IM corticosteroids are similarly efficacious to a 7–10 day tapering course of oral agents. From these results, as few as 13 patients need to be treated to prevent relapse to additional care after an exacerbation of asthma.

Reviewer's Conclusions

A short course of corticosteroids following assessment for an acute exacerbation of asthma significantly reduces the number of relapses to additional care and decreases beta-agonist use without an apparent increase in side effects. Intramuscular corticosteroids appear as effective as oral agents.

### Management of acute asthma exacerbations [^6b2ef94e]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Asthma exacerbations can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. Criteria for exacerbation severity are based on symptoms and physical examination parameters, as well as lung function and oxygen saturation. In patients with a peak expiratory flow of 50 to 79 percent of their personal best, up to two treatments of two to six inhalations of short-acting beta2 agonists 20 minutes apart followed by a reassessment of peak expiratory flow and symptoms may be safely employed at home. Administration using a hand-held metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is at least equivalent to nebulized beta2 agonist therapy in children and adults. In the ambulatory and emergency department settings, the goals of treatment are correction of severe hypoxemia, rapid reversal of airflow obstruction, and reduction of the risk of relapse. Multiple doses of inhaled anticholinergic medication combined with beta2 agonists improve lung function and decrease hospitalization in school-age children with severe asthma exacerbations. Intravenous magnesium sulfate has been shown to significantly increase lung function and decrease the necessity of hospitalization in children. The administration of systemic corticosteroids within one hour of emergency department presentation decreases the need for hospitalization, with the most pronounced effect in patients with severe exacerbations. Airway inflammation can persist for days to weeks after an acute attack; therefore, more intensive treatment should be continued after discharge until symptoms and peak expiratory flow return to baseline.

### Exacerbation-prone asthma [^4a2736ed]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients who are prone to exacerbations of asthma experience significant costs in terms of missed work and school, acute care visits, and hospitalizations. Exacerbations are largely driven by environmental exposures including pollutants, stress, and viral and bacterial pathogens. These exposures are most likely to induce acute severe "asthma attacks" in high-risk patients. These personal risk factors for exacerbations can vary with the phenotype of asthma and age of the patient. In children, allergic sensitization is a strong risk factor, especially for those children who develop sensitization early in life. Airway inflammation is an important risk factor, and biomarkers are under evaluation for utility in detecting eosinophilic and type 2 inflammation and neutrophilic inflammation as indicators of risk for recurrent exacerbations. Insights into inflammatory mechanisms have led to new approaches to prevent exacerbations using mAb-based biologics that target specific type 2 pathways. Challenges remain in developing an evidence base to support precision interventions with these effective yet expensive therapies, and in determining whether these treatments will be safe and effective in young children. Unfortunately, there has been less progress in developing treatments for acute exacerbations. Hopefully, greater understanding of mechanisms relating airway viruses, bacteria, mucin production, and neutrophilic inflammatory responses will lead to additional treatment options for patients experiencing acute exacerbations.

### Inhaled budesonide in the management of acute worsenings and exacerbations of asthma: a review of the evidence [^6801914c]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The use of systemic corticosteroids, together with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy, has become established for the management of acute asthma. These agents are undoubtedly effective, but are also associated with problems such as metabolic adverse effects. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) offer potential benefit in the acute setting because they are delivered directly to the airways. They are also likely to reduce systemic exposure, which would lead in turn to reductions in rates of unwanted systemic effects. In order to evaluate the role of budesonide in the management of acute asthma exacerbations we conducted a review of the literature and critically evaluated the rationale for the use of ICS in general in this setting. Trials in adults and children requiring treatment for acute exacerbation of asthma have shown clinical and/or spirometric benefit for budesonide when delivered via nebulizer, dry powder inhaler, or aerosol in the emergency department, hospital and follow-up settings. The efficacy seems to benefit from high doses given repeatedly during the initial phase of an acute exacerbation. These acute effects are likely to be linked to the drug's distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. The current evidence base revealed encouraging results regarding the efficacy of the ICS budesonide in patients with wheeze and acute worsening of asthma. Future studies should focus on the efficacy of these agents in more severe asthma worsenings.

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

### Real-world treatment trajectories of adults with newly diagnosed asthma or COPD [^d43fff07]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prevalent chronic respiratory conditions with a large global health burden (21.6 and 74.4 million disability-adjusted life-years, respectively). Both diseases have a negative impact on all aspects of life when not properly controlled and are responsible for (preventable) deaths, often as a result of acute exacerbations. Treatment is mainly organised via primary care and is aimed to minimise symptoms and prevent acute exacerbations. To support clinicians in the management of patients with asthma or COPD, several national and international guidelines have been developed which are frequently updated based on the latest research and insights. These guidelines suggest a stepwise treatment approach where treatment is initiated and tailored on the needs (ie, symptoms, severity, disease control and future risk) of the individual patient.

There is a lack of global knowledge on how patients with asthma or COPD are treated in the real world, especially with regard to the initial pharmacological treatment of newly diagnosed patients and the different treatment trajectories (encompassing both treatment step-up and treatment step-down strategies). Therefore, the purpose of this global characterisation study was to shed light on real-world treatment trajectories of newly diagnosed adults with asthma and COPD across different countries and continents. This descriptive study provides high-level insight into real-world treatment practices and helps to generate hypotheses for follow-up studies to address current gaps in clinical practice.

### Management of acute, severe asthma in children [^258da61d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To briefly present the current options available for the treatment of acute, severe asthma in children, with a special focus on emergency department and inpatient treatment, and to describe newer therapies that may aid treatment in the future.

Data Sources and Study Selection

A MEDLINE search (1966-May 2001) of the English-language literature pertaining to drug therapy of acute asthma was performed. Key word searches included acute asthma, albuterol, ipratropium, corticosteroids, magnesium, and theophylline. Additional articles from these sources and published national guidelines were identified. Relevant studies pertaining to current therapy of acute asthma in pediatric patients were selected; if there were minimal pediatric data, adult data were included.

Data Synthesis

Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the airways. Acute exacerbations can occur and are challenging to manage. Albuterol, ipratropium, and systemic corticosteroids have been shown to be effective in acute asthma exacerbations. Because some patients do not respond to maximal therapy, older therapies such as magnesium and theophylline are being reevaluated. Theophylline may have some therapeutic effect, but given its toxicity profile, it is unclear whether it offers any advantage over maximal beta(2)-agonist therapy. There are only minimal published data evaluating the use of magnesium in pediatrics, and most are small trials or case reports. Newer therapies such as ventilation strategies with heliox and intravenous leukotriene modifiers currently being evaluated may or may not prove to be beneficial in the future.

Conclusions

beta(2)-agonists, ipratropium, and corticosteroids remain the most useful therapeutic agents for acute asthma exacerbations in pediatric patients. However, these agents are not ideal in all patients and, given the existing questions regarding safety and/or efficacy of available alternatives, more effective options are needed.

### Real-world effectiveness of antibiotics in addition to oral corticosteroids for managing asthma exacerbations in adults [^e92c32ea]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

There remains a need for real-world studies to gain insight into the short- and long-term effectiveness of add-on antibiotics to guide their appropriate use, as existing evidence for add-on antibiotics in managing acute asthma exacerbations is contradictory. Its indications and benefits remain poorly documented, particularly in primary care settings. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the added value of antibiotic treatment alongside OCSs for managing acute asthma exacerbations among adults.

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^9dc37e6c]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^44fe7b15]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 3–4. Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment — population-level selection states that when choosing between treatment options at a population level (e.g., national formularies, health maintenance organizations, national guidelines), the 'preferred' medication at each step is the best treatment for most patients, based on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and availability and cost at the population level, mainly based on evidence about symptoms and exacerbations (from randomized controlled trials, pragmatic studies and strong observational data). For Steps 1–5, there are different population-level recommendations by age-group (adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, children 5 years and younger), and in Step 5, there are also different population-level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non-Type 2.

### Asthma evaluation and management [^88444381]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory illness with acute exacerbations, which often is encountered in the ED setting. Knowledge of the presentation and treatment of asthma is crucial for any physician treating patients with this disease. Beta-agonist, anticholinergic, and corticosteroid therapy continue to be the mainstay of emergency therapy despite advances in newer medications. Proper attention to long-term treatment of asthma and aggressive treatment of acute exacerbations should help reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^c5eabd05]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Management of worsening asthma and exacerbations — adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — terminology and written asthma action plans emphasize that exacerbations represent an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function, and that the term 'flare-up' is preferable for most patients; patients at increased risk of asthma-related death should be identified and flagged for more frequent review. All patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their age, current treatment, and reliever inhaler (short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol), with the plan stating when and how to change reliever and/or maintenance medications, use oral corticosteroids if needed, and access medical care if symptoms fail to respond; advise patients with a history of rapid deterioration to seek acute care or see their doctor immediately, and base the plan on changes in symptoms or (only in adults) peak expiratory flow (PEF).

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^29257e37]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care clinicians play a key role in asthma and asthma exacerbation management worldwide because most patients with asthma are treated in primary care settings. The high burden of asthma exacerbations persists and important practice gaps remain, despite continual advances in asthma care. Lack of primary care-specific guidance, uncontrolled asthma, incomplete assessment of exacerbation and asthma control history, and reliance on systemic corticosteroids or short-acting beta 2 -agonist-only therapy are challenges clinicians face today with asthma care. Evidence supports the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) + fast-acting bronchodilator treatments when used as needed in response to symptoms to improve asthma control and reduce rates of exacerbations, and the symptoms that occur leading up to an asthma exacerbation provide a window of opportunity to intervene with ICS. Incorporating patient perspectives and preferences when designing asthma regimens will help patients be more engaged in their therapy and may contribute to improved adherence and outcomes. This expert consensus contains 10 Best Practice Advice Points from a panel of primary care clinicians and a patient representative, formed in collaboration with the International Primary Care Respiratory Group (IPCRG), a clinically led charitable organization that works locally and globally in primary care to improve respiratory health. The panel met virtually and developed a series of best practice statements, which were drafted and subsequently voted on to obtain consensus. Primary care clinicians globally are encouraged to review and adapt these best practice advice points on preventing and managing asthma exacerbations to their local practice patterns to enhance asthma care within their practice.

Asthma risk — managing other modifiable risk factors — Some patients continue to experience exacerbations even with maximal doses of current treatment, and having even one exacerbation increases the risk that a patient will have another within the next 12 months. In clinical practice, exacerbation risk can be reduced both by optimizing asthma medications, and by identifying and treating modifiable risk factors, and not all risk factors require or respond to a step up in controller treatment.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^d0103655]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Treatment in acute care settings — systemic corticosteroids — Systemic corticosteroids speed resolution of exacerbations and prevent relapse, and in acute care settings should be utilized in all but the mildest exacerbations in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years (Evidence A). Where possible, systemic corticosteroids should be administered to the patient within 1 hour of presentation. Use of systemic corticosteroids is particularly important in the emergency department if initial SABA treatment fails to achieve lasting improvement in symptoms, the exacerbation developed while the patient was taking OCS, or the patient has a history of previous exacerbations requiring OCS. For route of delivery, oral administration is as effective as intravenous, the oral route is preferred because it is quicker, less invasive and less expensive, and OCS require at least 4 hours to produce a clinical improvement.

### Acute asthma in adults: a review [^894ba4b5]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

All patients with asthma are at risk of having exacerbations. Hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits account for a large proportion of the health-care cost burden of asthma, and avoidance or proper management of acute asthma (AA) episodes represent an area with the potential for large reductions in health-care costs. The severity of exacerbations may range from mild to life threatening, and mortality is most often associated with failure to appreciate the severity of the exacerbation, resulting in inadequate emergency treatment and delay in referring to hospital. This review describes the epidemiology, costs, pathophysiology, mortality, and management of adult AA in the ED and in the ICU.

Best Practice Advice 3: Recognize and support education and management plans addressing exacerbation risk for people with all severities of asthma

Asthma exacerbations can occur in all severities of asthma despite guideline-directed treatment. A history of ED visits or hospitalization for an exacerbation increase the risk of future exacerbations, irrespective of severity, patient demographics, or clinical characteristics. Patients with intermittent, mild, and moderate asthma are all at risk for exacerbations, which is often related to unrecognized lack of asthma control.

Recently in the US, approximately 60% of adults and 44% of children were reported to have uncontrolled asthma, with more than 80% of whom had mild or moderate asthma. In an international cohort of 1115 patients classified as GINA Step 1 or Step 2, 25% had uncontrolled asthma and about 33% reported rescue inhaler use in the previous 4 weeks. Based on United Kingdom data from the National Review of Asthma Deaths, up to 45% of patients across asthma severities dies without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided, indicating a need for improved education and management plans.

Appropriate and optimal therapy to minimize symptoms, exacerbations risk, and routine exacerbation assessment and history is important for all patients with asthma, regardless of severity.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^c0664696]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) — in the emergency department, high-dose ICS given within the first hour after presentation reduces the need for hospitalization in patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids (Evidence A); when added to systemic corticosteroids, evidence is conflicting in adults, and in children early ICS with or without systemic corticosteroids might reduce hospital admission and need for systemic corticosteroids (Evidence B). Overall, add-on ICS are well tolerated, but the agent, dose and duration remain unclear and cost may be significant; patients admitted to hospital for an asthma exacerbation should continue on, or be prescribed, ICS-containing therapy. On discharge home, patients should be prescribed ongoing ICS-containing treatment because severe exacerbation is a risk factor for future exacerbations (Evidence B) and ICS-containing medications significantly reduce asthma-related death or hospitalization (Evidence A); SABA-only treatment of asthma is no longer recommended, and adding ICS to systemic corticosteroids after discharge showed no significant short-term benefit, though post-discharge ICS were as effective as systemic corticosteroids for milder exacerbations with wide confidence limits.

Reviewing response during treatment for an exacerbation: During treatment, patients should be closely monitored, and treatment titrated according to their response. Patients who present with signs of a severe or life-threatening exacerbation, who fail to respond to treatment, or who continue to deteriorate should be transferred immediately to an acute care facility, and those with little or slow response to SABA treatment should be closely monitored. For many patients, lung function can be monitored after SABA therapy is repeated, and additional treatment should continue until PEF or FEV1 reaches a plateau or ideally returns to the patient's previous best, after which a decision can be made whether to send the patient home or transfer them to an acute care facility.

Treatment in acute care settings — inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists (SABA) — Currently, inhaled salbutamol (albuterol) is the usual bronchodilator in acute asthma management, and the most cost-effective and efficient delivery is by pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) with a spacer (Evidence A). Systematic reviews of intermittent versus continuous SABA in acute asthma provide conflicting results, use of nebulizers can disseminate aerosols and potentially contribute to spread of respiratory viral infections, and current evidence does not support the routine use of intravenous beta2 agonist in most patients with severe asthma exacerbations (Evidence A).

Future Directions

Life-threatening asthma and COPD exacerbations are encountered commonly in the ICU and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is important to understand both the commonalities and differences in the pathophysiologic features and management of these diseases to provide evidence-based care and improve outcomes. A stepwise treatment approach will aim to reduce airway inflammation, to reverse bronchospasm, and if needed, to support patients with mechanical ventilation or advanced therapies until clinical improvement is achieved.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^c45e0a27]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

While considerable improvement in the management of acute asthma should lead to better outcomes over time, practice variation does exist and many patients presenting to EDs do not always receive evidence-based treatment. Moreover, what works in certain settings may not be applicable to others. Despite the dissemination of effective interventions for the prevention of relapses after asthma exacerbations, these outcomes still occur, affect the quality of lifeof patients with asthma and represent significant costs to the healthcare system.

A number of studies have examined factors associated with relapse outcomes in adults after ED discharge. Notwithstanding this research, there remains a relative paucity of literature attempting to compile the existing information to influence management. The objective of this study was to summarise the evidence regarding relapses and factors associated with increased relapse in patients discharged from EDs after being treated for asthma exacerbations.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: asthma control and exacerbations: standardizing endpoints for clinical asthma trials and clinical practice [^478f45d0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The assessment of asthma control is pivotal to the evaluation of treatment response in individuals and in clinical trials. Previously, asthma control, severity, and exacerbations were defined and assessed in many different ways.

Purpose

The Task Force was established to provide recommendations about standardization of outcomes relating to asthma control, severity, and exacerbations in clinical trials and clinical practice, for adults and children aged 6 years or older.

Methods

A narrative literature review was conducted to evaluate the measurement properties and strengths/weaknesses of outcome measures relevant to asthma control and exacerbations. The review focused on diary variables, physiologic measurements, composite scores, biomarkers, quality of life questionnaires, and indirect measures.

Results

The Task Force developed new definitions for asthma control, severity, and exacerbations, based on current treatment principles and clinical and research relevance. In view of current knowledge about the multiple domains of asthma and asthma control, no single outcome measure can adequately assess asthma control. Its assessment in clinical trials and in clinical practice should include components relevant to both of the goals of asthma treatment, namely achievement of best possible clinical control and reduction of future risk of adverse outcomes. Recommendations are provided for the assessment of asthma control in clinical trials and clinical practice, both at baseline and in the assessment of treatment response.

Conclusions

The Task Force recommendations provide a basis for a multicomponent assessment of asthma by clinicians, researchers, and other relevant groups in the design, conduct, and evaluation of clinical trials, and in clinical practice.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

### Acute asthma [^c2c3a15d]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: Asthma is the most common medical emergency in children. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality rates and poses a tremendous societal burden worldwide. Management of the acute attack involves a stepwise approach that includes beta-agonist and steroid therapy, the mainstay of emergency treatment. Most patients will respond to this regime and can be discharged from the emergency department. Failure to respond to treatment necessitates hospital admission and sometimes admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Management in the ICU involves intensification of pharmacologic therapy, including nonstandard therapies, in an attempt to avoid intubation and ventilation. When needed, mechanical ventilatory support can be rendered fairly safe with little morbidity if the likely cardiorespiratory physiologic derangements are appreciated and if appropriate ventilatory strategies are used. In the past two decades, the availability of newer potent medications and changes in approach to monitoring and ventilatory strategies have resulted in a decrease in ICU morbidity and mortality rates. Research endeavors are presently underway to further characterize the underlying mechanisms of the disease and are likely to lead to novel therapies. This article reviews the approach to management of acute severe asthma.

### Factors associated with relapse in adult patients discharged from the emergency department following acute asthma: a systematic review [^74fd40be]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma affects over 17.5 million adults in North America and its prevalence continues to rise, as evidenced by the 12.3% relative increase from 2001 (7.3%) to 2009 (8.2%). Worldwide, asthma prevalence ranges from low (underdeveloped countries) to high (developed countries). Asthma is predominantly a chronic disease that can be controlled with appropriate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions; however, exacerbations do not always respond to standard or additional treatment options, leading to urgent visits to health providers, admissions to hospital and, in severe and rare cases, death. In the USA, patients with exacerbations had significantly higher asthma-related healthcare costs: $1740 over 1 year compared with $847 for asthmatics without exacerbations. While patients with acute asthma often seek care in the emergency department (ED), most are successfully treated and subsequently discharged; only 6–12% of adult patients presenting to the ED with an exacerbation of asthma will be admitted.

The understanding and management of acute asthma have advanced considerably in recent years. Current evidence-based guidelines (National Asthma Education and Prevention Plan (NAEPP), Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), and Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS)) suggest that early treatment with short-acting β 2 -agonists, inhaled short-acting anticholinergic agents and systemic corticosteroids (SCS) will reduce hospitalisations. On ED discharge, SCS are recommended, and further studies suggest that prescribing inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at discharge can reduce relapse following discharge at least in adult patients. ICS in combination with long-acting β-agonists (ICS/LABA) are more effective than ICS monotherapy in patients with persistent asthma, with the number needed to treat of 19 to prevent one exacerbation. On the other hand, the impact of non-pharmacological interventions (ie, ED-based educational strategies) on relapses remains unclear.

Asthma step-down to minimum effective treatment: Once good asthma control has been maintained for 2–3 months, consider stepping down gradually to find the lowest treatment that controls symptoms and exacerbations, provide a written asthma action plan, monitor closely with a follow-up visit, and do not completely withdraw ICS unless needed temporarily to confirm the diagnosis of asthma.

### New and emerging drug treatments for severe asthma [^597da5fa]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic inflammatory condition of the airways affecting over 300 million people world-wide. In 5%-10% of cases, it is severe, with disproportionate healthcare resource utilization including costs associated with frequent exacerbations and the long-term health effects of systemic steroids. Characterization of inflammatory pathways in severe asthma has led to the development of targeted biological and small molecule therapies which aim to achieve disease control while minimizing corticosteroid-associated morbidity. Herein, we review currently licensed agents and those in development, and speculate how drug therapy for severe asthma might evolve and impact on clinical outcomes in the near future.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting, SABAs, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to administer inhaled short-acting β-agonists up to 4–10 puffs every 20 minutes for a total of 3 doses if needed to achieve rapid reversal of airflow limitation in patients with mild-to-moderate exacerbations.
Do not administer additional short-acting β-agonists if there is a good response to initial treatment, such as peak expiratory flow > 60–80% of predicted or personal best for 3–4 hours.

### The effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma: a meta-analysis [^259925c4]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are of proven benefit in the treatment of chronic asthma; however, their role in the management of acute asthma is unclear.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials involving children or adults treated in the emergency department for acute asthma with or without the addition of ICSs. Outcome measures included hospital admission, pulmonary function tests, and side effects.

Results

Seven trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analyses. ICSs versus placebo were compared; data were not available on 1 of these trials. In the remaining 6 trials, a total of 352 patients were studied (179 ICS-treated and 173 non-ICS-treated patients). Two trials compared ICSs plus systemic corticosteroids versus placebo plus systemic corticosteroids; 4 trials compared ICSs versus placebo. Patients treated with ICSs were less likely to be admitted to the hospital (odds ratio 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.16 to 0.57) and showed small improvements in peak expiratory flows (weighted mean difference 8%; 95% CI 3% to 13%) Overall, the treatment was well tolerated, with few reports of adverse side effects. A secondary analysis compared ICSs alone versus systemic corticosteroids alone; in the 4 included trials, significant heterogeneity between the study results for admission rates precluded meaningful pooling of admission data.

Conclusion

There is evidence of decreased admission rates for patients with acute asthma treated with ICSs. However, there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function when used in acute asthma, and there is insufficient evidence that ICSs alone are as effective as systemic corticosteroids.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0dd9f0c2]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Initial treatment for safety and clinical efficacy — For asthma, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are essential, either alone or in combination with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA), to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not treat with LABA and/or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) alone without ICS. For patients with features of both asthma and COPD, treat as asthma; ICS-containing therapy is important to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations and death, and do not give LABA and/or LAMA alone without ICS. For COPD, treat according to current recommendations from the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), i.e., initial treatment with LAMA and LABA, plus as-needed SABA.

### It is time to change the way we manage mild asthma: an update in GINA 2019 [^93ee4aca]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is a heterogeneous lung disease, usually characterised by chronic airway inflammation. Asthma poses a significant level of morbidity and mortality globally. Although evidence-based treatments are available in most countries, asthma control remains suboptimal, and asthma-related deaths continue to be an ongoing concern. Generally, it is believed that between 50 to 75% of patients with asthma can be considered as having mild asthma. Although the symptoms may not be very troublesome or frequent, airway inflammation is usually present in those with mild asthma and patients may be at risk of acute asthma exacerbations and death. An expert review estimated that the frequency of severe exacerbations in mild asthma ranged between 0.12 to 0.77 per patient-year. Further, the review highlighted that between 30 and 40% of exacerbations requiring emergency care appear to be in patients with mild asthma. In general, asthma exacerbations impose a significant disease burden, including hospitalisation, a greater progressive decline in lung function, impairment in quality of life (QoL) and death. Moreover, asthma patients with exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation are at increased risk for future exacerbations, independent of demographic, clinical factors, asthma severity and asthma control. Asthma exacerbations also have been shown to cause a significant financial burden on health systems. For example, in a US study which retrospectively analysed administrative claims data, asthma patients who experienced exacerbations had nearly twice the health care and asthma specific costs compared with patients without exacerbations. Preventing the risk of future exacerbations is, therefore, an important target, particularly in patients with mild asthma, where there may be complacence both by the patient or their health professionals.

Asthma quick-relief medications — individuals ages 0–4 years: Use inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms, with intensity based on symptom severity allowing up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed. Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment. Consider short course of oral systemic corticosteroid if exacerbation is severe or individual has history of previous severe exacerbations.

### Single maintenance and reliever therapy in treatment of asthma exacerbations [^c7c7716d]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) in the treatment of asthma exacerbation.

Data Sources

PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Clinical Trial databases using the keywords SMART therapy, maintenance and reliever therapy, and budesonide and formoterol.

Study Selections

Articles were selected based on their relevance and applicability to this topic.

Results

Multiple studies have evaluated the efficacy of SMART in reducing asthma exacerbations in comparison to standard inhaled corticosteroid maintenance and short-acting beta-agonist rescue therapy. Most of the randomized trials demonstrated a reduction in asthma exacerbation with open-label studies revealing similar effectiveness in reducing asthma exacerbation. Previously, concerns have been raised regarding the administration of increased doses of long-acting beta-agonist that may potentially mask symptoms and delay appropriate medical attention. However, studies have not demonstrated an increase in morbidity or mortality. The primary concern regarding many of these trials is that they have been sponsored by pharmaceutical companies.

Conclusion

Although not all studies demonstrated the effectiveness of SMART, most revealed a substantial reduction in asthma exacerbation frequency and severity.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^4ad523f0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

SECTION IV: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF INTERMITTENT ICS IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA

Background

Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages. Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (EPR-3), published in 2007, suggested that intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, but the evidence at that time was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond a recommendation based on expert consensus.

Definitions of terms used in this section

"Intermittent" ICS dosing in this section includes courses of ICS treatment used for brief periods, usually in response to symptoms or as an add-on with or without a LABA. "Intermittent ICS dosing" does not refer to a single regimen, and its definition is specified in each of the recommendations. Intermittent ICS dosing allows providers to prescribe specific doses, frequencies, and durations of ICS use. When to use intermittent ICS dosing could depend on an individual's decision (based on need, which is also known as "as-needed" or "pro re nata" dosing), a predefined index showing worsening asthma, or some other predefined criterion.

"Controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. Both controller therapy and intermittent dosing may involve daily use of a specific dose of an ICS. The terms "ICS-LABA" (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta 2 -agonist combination, typically in a single device) and "ICS-formoterol" indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler.

"Quick-relief" therapy refers to medications (eg, an inhaled SABA) used to treat acute symptoms or exacerbations. In this section, "as-needed" dosing (eg, of a SABA) is intermittent and is based on the patient's decision (Figs 2–4).

The definitions of "low-," "medium-," and "high-dose" ICS are based on the recommendations from EPR-3.

The term "puff" refers to a single actuation and inhalation of a medication delivered through any type of inhaler.

"Recurrent wheezing" as used for the studies included in this section is defined as three or more episodes of wheezing triggered by apparent respiratory tract infections in a child's lifetime or two episodes in the past year.

### The role of magnesium sulfate in the acute and chronic management of asthma [^812e2c31]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Acute asthma is common and severe exacerbations may result in hospitalization, need for endotracheal intubation and, rarely, death. Standard emergency care includes systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators, but additional treatments may be required in severe cases. We summarize the substantial evidence regarding the role of MgSO4 in acute asthma and comments on the potential benefit in chronic asthma.

Recent Findings

Inhaled and intravenous MgSO4 agents are used in the treatment of acute asthma, but only the intravenous formulation is effective. In severe asthma exacerbations, a single bolus dose of intravenous MgSO4 reduces admissions and improves pulmonary functions. Inhaled MgSO4 is more effective than placebo as a bronchodilator, but performs no better than salbutamol and there is no apparent synergy when the two are combined. Whereas intravenous MgSO4 treatments appear to be effective, long-term 'replacement' therapy with magnesium does not appear to affect chronic asthma.

Summary

Evidence suggests that intravenous MgSO4 is beneficial in acute asthma, while the evidence for inhaled MgSO4 is less convincing. Moreover, the role of replacement therapy with oral magnesium remains to be clarified. The use of intravenous MgSO4 remains uncommon, with emergency physicians appropriately restricting its use to patients with severe exacerbations.

### Real-world effectiveness of antibiotics in addition to oral corticosteroids for managing asthma exacerbations in adults [^6ad66147]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, this study found no beneficial effect from the addition of antibiotics to OCS treatment for managing acute asthma exacerbations in adults in Dutch primary care. Usage of antibiotics did not reduce the risk of treatment failure or the time until the next exacerbation. Taking into account available literature, we suggest that antibiotics should not be used for treating acute asthma exacerbations in primary care among adults, unless there are clear signs of bacterial infection.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management recommendations… [^741f8255]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. STEP 1 Step 1 options are for those with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations. An inhaled low-dose ICS/formoterol combination used as needed is the preferred treatment in adults and adolescents. The guideline also strongly discourages the use of long-acting bronchodilators without an ICS because of increased risk of exacerbation. If the ICS/formoterol combination is not available or affordable, a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA is recommended.

STEP 3 Options in adults and adolescents include low-dose ICS/long-acting beta 2-agonist as daily treatment with a SABA as needed, or low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily treatment and as needed. In children six to 11 years of age, either a medium-dose ICS or a low-dose ICS/LABA combination should be used as a controller, with a SABA as needed. STEP 4 Preferred options for adults and adolescents include a low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily and as-needed treatment or a medium-dose ICS/LABA as daily maintenance treatment with a SABA as needed. The addition of sublingual allergen immunotherapy may be considered in adults with allergic rhinitis and suboptimally controlled asthma despite ICS therapy. Referral is recommended for children six to 11 years of age if asthma is not controlled with a medium-dose ICS.

STEP 5 Patients with persistent and severe symptoms despite optimal use of step 4 treatments should be referred for allergist evaluation and consideration of add-on treatments. These additional treatments include high-dose ICS/LABA, tiotropium, azithromycin, anti-immunoglobulin E, anti-interleukin-5/5R, anti-interleukin-4R alpha, sputum-guided treatment, bronchial thermoplasty, and low-dose oral corticosteroids. Adverse effects and the risk of antibiotic resistance should be taken into account when considering these treatments.

### The use of ipratropium bromide for the management of acute asthma exacerbation in adults and children: a systematic review [^90e5908d]. The Journal of Asthma (2001). Low credibility.

Ipratropium bromide is a quaternary anticholinergic bronchodilator that is commonly used to treat obstructive lung disease. Although ipratropium is not usually employed as a first-line bronchodilator to treat chronic asthma, it has been used extensively in hospital emergency departments as adjunctive therapy for the emergency treatment of acute asthma exacerbation. This review will summarize the physiological actions of ipratropium and the rationale for its use as an anticholinergic bronchodilator. Evidence available from randomized trials and from two meta-analyses is summarized to determine whether the addition of inhaled ipratropium to inhaled beta2-agonist therapy is effective in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation in children and adults. Published reports of randomized, controlled trials assessing the use of ipratropium and concurrent beta2-agonists in adult acute asthma exacerbation were identified by a search of electronic databases, as well as by hand searching. Data from 10 studies of adult asthmatics, reporting on a total of 1377 patients, were pooled in a meta-analysis using a weighted-average method. Use of nebulized ipratropium/beta2-agonist combination therapy was associated with a pooled 7.3% improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8–10.9%] and a 22.1% improvement in peak expiratory flow (95% CI, 11.0–33.2%) compared with patients who received beta2-agonist without ipratropium. For the three trials in adults reporting hospital admission data (n = 1064), adult patients receiving ipratropium had a relative risk of hospitalization of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.61–1.06). Similarly, randomized controlled studies of pediatric asthma exacerbation and a meta-analysis of pediatric asthma patients suggest that ipratropium added to beta2-agonists improves lung function and also decreases hospitalization rates, especially among children with severe exacerbations of asthma. The adult and pediatric studies did not report any severe adverse effects attributable to ipratropium when it was used in conjunction with beta2-agonists. In conclusion, there is a modest statistical improvement in airflow obstruction when ipratropium is used as an adjunctive to beta2-agonists for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation. In pediatric asthma exacerbation, use of ipratropium also appears to improve clinical outcomes; however, this has not been definitively established in adults. It would seem reasonable to recommend the use of combination ipratropium/beta2-agonist therapy in acute asthmatic exacerbation, since the addition of ipratropium seems to provide physiological evidence of benefit without risk of adverse effects.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0db302b6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma treatment step-down — pre-step-down assessment should account for current treatment, risk factors and preferences, with few data on optimal timing, sequence and magnitude of reductions. Factors associated with greater risk after step-down include a history of exacerbations and/or emergency department visit for asthma in the previous 12 months, and a low baseline FEV1; other predictors include airway hyperresponsiveness and sputum eosinophilia, but these tests are not readily available in primary care. Any treatment step-down should be considered as a therapeutic trial, evaluating symptom control and exacerbation frequency, and before stepping down, the patient should be given a written asthma action plan and instructions for how and when to re-start their previous treatment if their symptoms worsen.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^eb946f0d]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Personalized control-based asthma management — Asthma control has two domains: symptom control and risk reduction, and in control-based asthma management treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle that involves assessment of symptom control and risk factors, treatment and review by appropriately trained personnel to achieve the goals of asthma treatment; asthma outcomes have been shown to improve after the introduction of control-based guidelines or practical tools; since 2014, GINA has emphasized personalized management of modifiable risk factors and patient preferences while non‑modifiable risk factors such as a history of past ICU admission should also be documented; for many patients in primary care, achieving good symptom control is a good guide to a reduced risk of exacerbations, and when ICSs were introduced into asthma management, large improvements were observed in symptom control and lung function with decreases in exacerbations and asthma-related mortality; however, patients with few or intermittent symptoms may be still at risk of severe exacerbations, some continue to exacerbate despite well-controlled symptoms, and side-effects may be an issue if ICS doses are stepped up, therefore both domains of asthma control (symptom control and future risk) should be considered when choosing treatment and reviewing response.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^45d20568]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute loss of asthma control (yellow zone) — definition, goals, and cautions on systemic steroids: The yellow zone signifies the transition zone signaling the onset of loss of asthma control and may occur over hours to days, and the chief goal is to prevent progression to a full asthma exacerbation (red zone). The definition of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone should distinguish it from occasional asthma symptoms that do not indicate an impending exacerbation and from severe asthma symptoms that require administration of OCSs and immediate medical attention. Because there is generally a narrow window of opportunity for a yellow zone intervention to work, early identification of symptoms and aggressive intervention may optimize the chances for a good outcome, and although a "false" start may begin treatment when not needed, the risk of a "late" start may result in episode progression and the need for treatment with systemic corticosteroids. For established red zone exacerbations, OCSs have been shown to be effective if started early; however, their palatability and side effects, especially if repeated courses are given, limit their use in the yellow zone, and recent studies have suggested that systemic corticosteroids may not provide clinical benefit in preschool children with acute wheezing episodes.

### The GINA asthma strategy report: what's new for primary care? [^ac67696c]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

6. Expanded indications for starting regular controller (preventer) treatment

The GINA report now includes a new table with evidence-based recommendations for initiating controller treatment. The most important change is a recommendation for earlier initiation of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids; for example, in patients with symptoms twice or more a month and/or risk factors for exacerbations, such as a need for oral corticosteroids in the last year. The aim is to reduce asthma risk, even if day-to-day symptoms are not frequent enough to be burdensome.

7. Tailoring asthma treatment for individual patients

The GINA report now describes a framework for personalised asthma management. While national guidelines provide recommendations about the treatment that may be most cost-effective across the whole population, patient-level decisions should also take into account any characteristics or phenotypes that predict the patient's risk or likely treatment response (e.g. smoking status, blood eosinophilia, admission to hospital for asthma in the previous year) together with patient goals and concerns and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence and cost to the patient.

8. Patients with features of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

A new feature in GINA relates to the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome. Past guidelines for asthma and COPD have been separate, and most regulatory studies have excluded patients with both conditions. However, many patients have features of both asthma and COPD, including symptomatic smokers with a history of childhood asthma, and patients with asthma and fixed airflow limitation. In collaboration with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GINA 2014 included a new chapter outlining a syndromic approach to diagnosis in primary care, with pragmatic advice about safety considerations in choice of initial treatment (avoidance of long-acting β 2 -agonist alone if the features suggest asthma, and avoiding inhaled corticosteroid-only treatment if the features suggest COPD). Therefore, it is important that asthma (or asthma–COPD overlap syndrome) should remain in the patient's list of diagnoses, even if they develop fixed airflow limitation.

Asthma treatment goals — GINA emphasizes achieving the best possible long-term asthma outcomes for the individual patient, including both long-term symptom control and minimization of risks such as exacerbations, lung function decline, and medication adverse effects (including long-term adverse effects of OCS), and highlights the importance of eliciting the patient or caregiver's treatment goals, which may differ from medical goals.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^aec7a445]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

One of the main uncertainties with both algorithms is the paucity of evidence on which to base the thresholds for changing treatment steps, a limitation that is shared with the current GINA algorithm. Current evidence suggests that the presence of biomarkers of type 2 airway inflammation is the most effective way to identify patients likely to respond to higher-intensity ICS treatment. In their absence, a reasonable approach is to base changes in treatment on two key factors, namely whether there has been a recent severe exacerbation and the frequency of reliever use. A severe exacerbation could prompt medical review for consideration of an increase in the treatment step, as such an event is associated with an increased risk of future severe exacerbations. Transition points based on high SABA use could be used for the traditional SABA reliever–based algorithm, as increasing use is a marker of poor asthma control and exacerbation risk. However, there is a different relationship with increasing ICS/formoterol use, in which higher use reduces the level of risk of an exacerbation, compared with SABA use. This could be addressed by guiding the patient to assign the higher reliever use to a higher regularly scheduled maintenance dose for the period of increased use. For both algorithms, "treatable traits" would be identified and managed in their own right.

In conclusion, the scientific evidence that ICS/formoterol reliever therapy is more effective at reducing severe exacerbation risk than SABA reliever therapy, either alone or when received together with maintenance ICS/formoterol therapy, has led to a paradigm shift in asthma management, which has the potential to cause confusion, as it replaces the long-established clinical practice that all patients should receive SABA reliever therapy. The potential confusion is evident from the current stepwise treatment algorithm's complexity, due to the attempt to represent all treatment options, and the inclusion of two reliever therapy regimens with differing efficacy in a single figure (Figure 1). These structural problems can be addressed by separating the current algorithm into two separate algorithms based on antiinflammatory ICS/formoterol and SABA reliever therapy strategies. The priority now is to investigate the practical implementation of the algorithms to better inform their use in clinical practice.

### The revised 2014 GINA strategy report: opportunities for change [^0e7ad76f]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This document reviews a major revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention that was published in 2014. The report aimed not only to update evidence-based recommendations for asthma diagnosis and management but also to innovate through a new format and layout to make its recommendations more clinically relevant and easier to implement.

Recent Findings

The GINA 2014 report includes a new definition of asthma that recognizes the heterogeneity of the disease and its phenotypes, and a new chapter about the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome. Among key messages, the report stresses that therapeutic decisions should be based not only on assessment of symptoms but also on risk factors for exacerbations, side effects of therapy and development of fixed airflow limitation. Asthma management includes not only medications but also nonpharmacological therapies and strategies, in a coordinated and personalized approach to individual patient care. On the basis of evidence about how to achieve behaviour change by health professionals, the recommendations are presented in a user-friendly format, with numerous tables, algorithms and flow-charts facilitating implementation. Background supporting material has been gathered online.

Summary

The GINA 2014 report provides updated and more easily implementable recommendations on optimal asthma management.

### Balancing the needs of the many and the few: where next for adult asthma guidelines? [^98b88260]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Asthma differs from many other chronic conditions in that most key management decisions are made in non-specialist settings, such as general practitioner surgeries and accident and emergency departments. Diagnosis in primary care relies on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms and the occurrence of asthma attacks, sometimes supplemented by basic lung function tests. Ongoing management is guided by the assessment of symptoms and simple lung function measures of airflow obstruction, with little attempt made to personalise management. This approach is flawed because the inadequate specificity of symptoms, as well as the low sensitivity of variable airflow obstruction, means that a diagnosis of asthma is often difficult to exclude with confidence. Moreover, even if diagnosed correctly, dissociation between inflammation, airflow obstruction, and symptoms means that a generalised stepwise approach to managing asthma on the basis of symptoms is unlikely to be successful in a substantial proportion of patients. As a result, effective treatments are used inefficiently, and outcomes are often worse than they could be. Rather than use of either a population-based or personalised approach for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we recommend a new combined approach, in which treatment decisions are driven by objective assessment of key treatable mechanistic traits.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^ba8dc1b8]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma severity — The current definition of asthma severity is based on retrospective assessment, after at least 2–3 months of asthma treatment, from the intensity of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. This definition is clinically useful for severe asthma, as it identifies patients whose asthma is relatively refractory to high intensity treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) and who may benefit from additional treatment such as biologic therapy, and it is important to distinguish between severe asthma and asthma that is uncontrolled due to modifiable factors such as incorrect inhaler technique and/or poor adherence. However, the retrospective definition of mild asthma as 'easy to treat' is less useful, and short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) alone actually increases the risk of exacerbations. 'Mild asthma' is a retrospective label, so it cannot be used to decide which patients are suitable to receive Step 1 or Step 2 treatment, and GINA suggests that the term 'mild asthma' should generally be avoided in clinical practice if possible or, if used, qualified with a reminder that patients with infrequent symptoms can still have severe or fatal exacerbations, and that this risk is substantially reduced with ICS-containing treatment.

### Uniform definition of asthma severity, control, and exacerbations: document presented for the World Health Organization consultation on severe asthma [^75ff2cce]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Asthma is a global health problem affecting around 300 million individuals of all ages, ethnic groups and countries. It is estimated that around 250,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of asthma. Concepts of asthma severity and control are important in evaluating patients and their response to treatment, as well as for public health, registries, and research (clinical trials, epidemiologic, genetic, and mechanistic studies), but the terminology applied is not standardized, and terms are often used interchangeably. A common international approach is favored to define severe asthma, uncontrolled asthma, and when the 2 coincide, although adaptation may be required in accordance with local conditions. A World Health Organization meeting was convened April 5–6, 2009, to propose a uniform definition of severe asthma. An article was written by a group of experts and reviewed by the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases review group. Severe asthma is defined by the level of current clinical control and risks as "Uncontrolled asthma which can result in risk of frequent severe exacerbations (or death) and/or adverse reactions to medications and/or chronic morbidity (including impaired lung function or reduced lung growth in children)". Severe asthma includes 3 groups, each carrying different public health messages and challenges: (1) untreated severe asthma, (2) difficult-to-treat severe asthma, and (3) treatment-resistant severe asthma. The last group includes asthma for which control is not achieved despite the highest level of recommended treatment and asthma for which control can be maintained only with the highest level of recommended treatment.

### Severity, control, and responsiveness in asthma [^f5d98fec]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Guidelines for asthma management have proposed that initial treatment should be based on assessment of asthma severity. The treatments proposed for different degrees of asthma severity are essentially estimates of the intensity of treatment needed to achieve asthma control. Responsiveness to treatment is heterogeneous, however, even among asthmatic patients with asthma of similar severity. This heterogeneity calls attention to the importance of assessing asthma control and adjusting treatment accordingly. Application of a guidelines-based approach to asthma management thus requires general agreement on what is meant by severity, control, and responsiveness and requires further an awareness of asthma as causing symptoms and functional impairment in the present and also as causing risk of adverse events in the future.

### Early use of inhaled corticosteroids in the emergency department treatment of acute asthma [^0d9a0440]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is central to the management of acute asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) may also be beneficial in this setting.

Objectives

To determine the benefit of ICS for the treatment of patients with acute asthma managed in the emergency department (ED).

Search Methods

We identified controlled clinical trials from the Cochrane Airways Group specialised register of controlled trials. Bibliographies from included studies, known reviews, and texts also were searched. The latest search was September 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs. Studies were included if patients presented to the ED or its equivalent with acute asthma, and were treated with ICS or placebo, in addition to standard therapy. Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant articles, and then independently selected articles for inclusion. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. There were three different types of studies that were included in this review: 1) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with no systemic corticosteroids given to either treatment group, 2) studies comparing ICS vs. placebo, with systemic corticosteroids given to both treatment groups, and 3) studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroids. For the analysis, the first two types of studies were included as separate subgroups in the primary analysis (ICS vs. placebo), while the third type of study was included in the secondary analysis (ICS vs. systemic corticosteroid).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two review authors if the authors were unable to verify the validity of extracted information. Missing data were obtained from the authors or calculated from other data presented in the paper. Where appropriate, individual and pooled dichotomous outcomes were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, individual and pooled continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs. The primary analysis employed a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model was used for sensitivity analysis. Heterogeneity is reported using I-squared (I(2)) statistics.

Main Results

Twenty trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analysis (13 paediatric, seven adult), with a total number of 1403 patients. Patients treated with ICS were less likely to be admitted to hospital (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 12 studies; 960 patients) and heterogeneity (I(2) = 27%) was modest. This represents a reduction from 32 to 17 hospital admissions per 100 patients treated with ICS in comparison with placebo. Subgroup analysis of hospital admissions based on concomitant systemic corticosteroid use revealed that both subgroups indicated benefit from ICS in reducing hospital admissions (ICS and systemic corticosteroid versus systemic corticosteroid: OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.81; 5 studies; N = 433; ICS versus placebo: OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 7 studies; N = 527). However, there was moderate heterogeneity in the subgroup using ICS in addition to systemic steroids (I(2) = 52%). Patients receiving ICS demonstrated small, significant improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF: MD 7%; 95% CI 3% to 11%) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1): MD 6%; 95% CI 2% to 10%) at three to four hours post treatment). Only a small number of studies reported these outcomes such that they could be included in the meta-analysis and most of the studies in this comparison did not administer systemic corticosteroids to either treatment group. There was no evidence of significant adverse effects from ICS treatment with regard to tremor or nausea and vomiting. In the secondary analysis of studies comparing ICS alone versus systemic corticosteroid alone, heterogeneity among the studies complicated pooling of data or drawing reliable conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

ICS therapy reduces hospital admissions in patients with acute asthma who are not treated with oral or intravenous corticosteroids. They may also reduce admissions when they are used in addition to systemic corticosteroids; however, the most recent evidence is conflicting. There is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy results in clinically important changes in pulmonary function or clinical scores when used in acute asthma in addition to systemic corticosteroids. Also, there is insufficient evidence that ICS therapy can be used in place of systemic corticosteroid therapy when treating acute asthma. Further research is needed to clarify the most appropriate drug dosage and delivery device, and to define which patients are most likely to benefit from ICS therapy. Use of similar measures and reporting methods of lung function, and a common, validated, clinical score would be helpful in future versions of this meta-analysis.

### Effectiveness of drug treatment strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations and increase symptom-free days in asthmatic children: a network meta-analysis [^50de911a]. The Journal of Asthma (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and safety of current maintenance therapies that include inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting β-agonists (LABA) and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) in preventing exacerbations and improving symptoms in pediatric asthma.

Methods

A systematic review with network meta-analysis was conducted after a comprehensive search for relevant studies in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Clinical Trials databases, up to July 2014. Randomized clinical trials were selected comparing treatment strategies of the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines. The full-text randomized clinical trials compared maintenance treatments for asthma in children (≤ 18 years) of ≥ 4 weeks duration, reporting exacerbations or symptom-free days. The primary and secondary effectiveness outcomes were the rates of moderate/severe exacerbations and symptom-free days from baseline, respectively. Withdrawal rates were taken as the safety outcome.

Results

Included in the network meta-analysis was 35 trials, comprising 12,010 patients. For both primary and secondary outcomes, combined ICS and LABA was ranked first in effectiveness (OR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.52–0.97 and OR 1.23, 95% CI: 0.94–1.61, respectively, compared with low-dose ICS), but the result of secondary outcomes was statistically insignificant. Low-dose ICS, medium- or high-dose ICS and combined ICS and LTRA strategies were comparable in effectiveness. ICS monotherapies, and ICS+LABA and ICS+LTRA strategies were similarly safe. High-dose ICS had the highest rate of total withdrawals, but the difference was not significant.

Conclusions

Combined ICS and LABA treatments were most effective in preventing exacerbations among pediatric asthma patients. Medium- or high-dose ICS, combined ICS and LTRAs, and low-dose ICS treatments seem to be equally effective.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^7f184487]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Box 8–2. Decision tree – investigate and manage difficult to treat asthma in adult and adolescent patients — applies to adolescents and adults with symptoms or acute exacerbations despite medium or high dose ICS-LABA, or taking maintenance OCS, and advises to consider referring to specialist or severe asthma clinic at any stage. Confirm the diagnosis (asthma/differential diagnoses), then look for factors contributing to symptoms, exacerbations and poor quality of life, including incorrect inhaler technique, suboptimal adherence, comorbidities including obesity, GERD, chronic rhinosinusitis, OSA, modifiable risk factors and triggers at home or work (including smoking, environmental exposures, allergen exposures if sensitized; medications such as beta-blockers and NSAIDS), overuse of SABA relievers, medication side effects, and anxiety, depression and social difficulties. Optimize management, including optimize treatment (e.g. check and correct inhaler technique; add spacer; optimize adherence; switch to ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy, if available), consider non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, mucus clearance, influenza and COVID-19 vaccination), treat comorbidities and modifiable risk factors, and consider trial of high dose ICS-LABA, if not used. Review response after ~3–6 months; if the answer to "Is asthma still uncontrolled?" is yes, diagnosis is Severe asthma and, if not done by now, refer to a specialist, if possible. If no, consider stepping down treatment, OCS first (if used); if asthma becomes uncontrolled when treatment is stepped down, restore previous dose, otherwise continue optimizing management.

### Promoting prevention and targeting remission of asthma: a EUFOREA consensus statement on raising the bar in asthma care [^39ea7a19]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common, multifaceted respiratory disease with a major impact on quality of life. Despite increased insights into mechanisms underlying various asthma phenotypes and endotypes and the availability of targeted biologic treatment options, the disease remains uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients with risk of exacerbations, requiring systemic corticosteroids, and with progressive disease. Current international guidelines advocate for a personalized management approach to patients with uncontrolled severe asthma. The European Forum for Research and Education in Allergy and Airway Diseases (EUFOREA) asthma expert panel was convened to discuss strategies to optimize asthma care and to prevent systemic corticosteroid overuse and disease progression. In this meeting report, we summarize current concepts and recommendations and provide a rationale to implement personalized asthma management at earlier stages of the disease. The ultimate goal is to move away from the current one-size-fits-most concept, which focuses on a symptom-driven treatment strategy, and shift toward a phenotype- and endotype-targeted approach aimed at curbing the disease course by improving clinical outcomes and preserving health-related quality of life. Herein, we provide a consensus view on asthma care that advocates a holistic approach and highlight some unmet needs to be addressed in future clinical trials and population studies.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^1af92dca]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and one important outcome (rescue medication use) for this question. The summary of evidence for Recommendation 9 is in EtD Table XIII in Appendix B.

Three RCTs with high certainty of evidence, compared SABA alone to intermittent ICS with SABA for quick relief. This treatment resulted in a 33% relative risk (RR) reduction in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Two of these three trials assessed growth but found different effects on this outcome. Ducharme et alfound a 5% lower gain in height and weight in study participants receiving intermittent fluticasone (750 μg twice daily at onset of a respiratory tract infection for up to 10 days) than in participants receiving a placebo. The authors noted a significant correlation between the cumulative dose of fluticasone and changes in height. In contrast, Bacharier et aldid not find an effect on linear growth of budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily for 7 days) in comparison with placebo in children with an "identified respiratory tract illness." Whether these differences in growth effects were due to differences in drugs, doses, duration of treatment, or other factors is not clear.

Rationale and discussion

The main comparator for which data are available is SABA-only therapy. The demonstrated efficacy but conflicting data regarding the effect of a short course of a daily ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy on growth led the Expert Panel to develop a conditional recommendation for this therapy starting at the on set of an apparent respiratory tract infection for children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing. Although one study that compared short ICS courses with regular daily ICS treatment showed no differences in exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids with moderate certainty of evidence, the Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison because this study was not adequately powered to demonstrate equivalence. No studies produced robust data on comparisons of intermittent ICS use with no treatment or a nonpharmacologic therapy.

Question 4.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of intermittent ICS compared to ICS controller therapy in individuals aged 5 years and older with persistent asthma?

Recommendation 10: In individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends either daily low-dose ICS and as needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

### BTS / NICE / SIGN guideline for asthma 2024: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management. how does this compare to GINA 2024? [^a29205c4]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological management in people with asthma age 12 and over

The 2019 GINA Strategyheralded a major shift in asthma management amongst concerns about the overuse of short-acting Beta -2 agonists increasing the risk of severe asthma exacerbations.

A large-scale randomised controlled trialdemonstrated the superiority of as-needed inhaled anti-inflammatory reliever(AIR)therapy using low-dose budesonide/formoterol in reducing asthma exacerbations compared to short-acting beta-2 agonists (SABA) alone. Similarly, a large real -world studyshowed that AIR therapy significantly reduced severe exacerbations compared to traditional ICS plus SABA reliever therapy. In patients with moderate asthma, regular maintenance and as-needed reliever therapy (MART) with budesonide/formoterol further reduced exacerbations compared to traditional therapy with maintenance ICS or ICS/long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) plus on-demand SABA. As a result, GINA recommends a major shift in asthma management from maintenance ICS with SABA reliever therapy to ICS/formoterol as single reliever therapy (AIR) in mild asthma and as maintenance and reliever therapy(MART) in more symptomatic patients.

The BTS/NICE/SIGN Guideline group has also carried out an economic analysis of the interventions and has found that AIR and MART are "dominant" i.e. more effective and cost less, han corresponding SABA therapy alone or maintenance ICS or ICS/LABA plus SABA therapy.

This analysis gives major support by BTS/NICE/SIGN for the GINA recommendations and shows that AIR and MART therapy are not only effective, but also cost-effective. (albeit based on United Kingdom costs).

GINA and BTS/NICE/SIGN both recommend similar preferred management pathways and are shown in Fig. 2. Initial treatment should be commenced with AIR therapy if symptoms are relatively infrequent and with low or medium -dose MART if symptoms are more persistent, there is night waking or post-exacerbation, although the evidence for the efficacy of this treatment approach is relatively lacking.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0953331a]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, primary care setting (monitoring and discharge), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to include regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment, as-needed reliever medication (low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-short-acting β-agonist, or short-acting β-agonist), and a short course of oral corticosteroids in the discharge medications. Do not prescribe short-acting β-agonist-only treatment. Review inhaler technique and adherence before discharge. Advise patients to use their reliever inhaler only as needed rather than routinely. Schedule a follow-up appointment for 2–7 days later, depending on the clinical and social context.

### Aminophylline [^6bebb964]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Studies:

Inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids are the treatments of first choice for management of acute exacerbations of asthma. The results of controlled clinical trials on the efficacy of adding intravenous theophylline to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists and systemically administered corticosteroids in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma have been conflicting. Most studies in patients treated for acute asthma exacerbations in an emergency department have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline does not produce greater bronchodilation and increases the risk of adverse effects. In contrast, other studies have shown that addition of intravenous theophylline is beneficial in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in patients requiring hospitalization, particularly in patients who are not responding adequately to inhaled beta-2 selective agonists.

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), clinical studies have shown that theophylline decreases dyspnea, air trapping, the work of breathing, and improves contractility of diaphragmatic muscles with little or no improvement in pulmonary function measurements.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^3b601924]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma post–emergency department or hospitalization follow-up — Patients discharged following an emergency department presentation or hospitalization for asthma should be especially targeted for an asthma education program, if one is available, and healthcare providers should take the opportunity to review the patient's understanding of the cause of their asthma exacerbation, modifiable risk factors for exacerbations (including, where relevant, smoking), the patient's understanding of the purposes and correct uses of medications including ICS-containing maintenance treatment and anti-inflammatory reliever, if prescribed, and the actions the patient needs to take to respond to worsening symptoms or peak flows. After an emergency department presentation, comprehensive intervention programs that include optimization of asthma treatment, inhaler technique, and elements of self-management education are cost effective and have shown significant improvement in asthma outcomes (Evidence B). Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma, or who have had several presentations to an acute care setting despite having a primary care provider, and follow-up by a specialist is associated with fewer subsequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations and better asthma control.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^970fec3b]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 6: Consider the use of AIR, MART (formerly known as SMART) or ICS-SABA quick reliever regimens for treating asthma and exacerbations to address underlying inflammation as well as provide bronchodilation

For patients requiring maintenance treatment (GINA Steps 3–5), maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART), formerly known as single-inhaler maintenance-and-reliever therapy (SMART), is referred to by the GINA report as a "treatment regimen in which the patient uses an ICS-formoterol inhaler every day (maintenance dose), and also uses the same medication as needed for relief of asthma symptoms (reliever doses)."The clinical rationale for recommending MART, or a combination of ICS and fast-acting bronchodilator, is based on the increased risk of severe or fatal exacerbations with SABA-only use, as well as evidence showing a lower frequency of exacerbations with ICS + formoterol as maintenance and rescue therapy.

For patients only requiring reliever treatment (Steps 1–2), GINA recommends the use of AIR, or low dose as-needed ICS-formoterol, as the preferred treatment (Track 1).

Use of ICS along with a SABA for rescue therapy can reduce exacerbations compared to SABA-only rescue therapy. In the PREPARE trial, adults with moderate-to-severe asthma who were instructed to take ICS every time they used rescue therapy had a lower annualized rate of severe exacerbations than those who weren't instructed to take ICS with rescue therapy. In the MANDALA randomized, double-blind trial, adults and adolescents with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma receiving albuterol-budesonide as rescue therapy had a significantly lower risk of severe asthma exacerbations than those receiving albuterol alone. Of note, albuterol-budesonide is approved for the as-needed treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction and to reduce the risk of exacerbations in patients with asthma 18 years of age and older in the United States.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^b593eb25]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol in individuals aged 4 years and older:
No patient characteristics exclude consideration of this option in individuals aged 4 years and older with asthma.
The studies demonstrating reduced exacerbations (see below) enrolled individuals with a severe exacerbation in the prior year. The results suggest that such individuals are particularly good candidates for SMART to reduce exacerbations.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled on alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
SMART is appropriate for Step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol) treatment.
ICS-formoterol should be administered as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once to twice daily (depending on age, asthma severity, and ICS dose in the ICS formoterol preparation) and one to two puffs as needed for asthma symptoms. The maximum number of puffs per day is 12 (54 μg formoterol) for individuals aged 12 years and older and 8 (36 μg formoterol) for children aged 4 to 11 years. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma or their caregivers to contact their physician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
ICS-formoterol should not be used as quick-relief therapy in individuals taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that in studies, this intervention consistently reduced asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits or systemic corticosteroids. In addition, this intervention improved asthma control and quality of life in some studies. No differences have been documented in harms between this type of therapy and the comparators (ICS or ICS-LABA) in individuals aged 12 years and older. The reductions in exposure to oral corticosteroids and to ICS treatment in most studies suggest that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms. In children aged 4 to 11 years, there may be a lower risk of growth suppression among those taking SMART versus daily higher-dose ICS treatment. This recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals with asthma for such reasons as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance. However, the additional cost of the medication may be offset by the decrease in exacerbations and the associated improvement in quality of life and reduction in costs to both the patient and the payer. A 1-month supply of ICS-formoterol medication that is sufficient for maintenance therapy may not last a month if the inhaler is used for reliever therapy as well. Providers, individuals with asthma, pharmacists, and payers need to be aware of this possibility and prescribe, plan, dispense, or provide coverage accordingly.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^97da05c3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

The Expert Panel specified three critical outcomes (exacerbations, asthma control, and quality of life) and three important outcomes (quick-relief medication, adverse events [harms], and long-term medication use). The summary of evidence for Recommendation 18 can be found in EtD Table XXVII in Appendix B.

The evidence shows that SLIT provides a trivial benefit for the critical outcomes of exacerbations, asthma control, – and quality of life –, (moderate certainty of evidence). No studies assessed the impact of SLIT on emergency department visits, clinic visits, or hospitalizations. Three studies evaluated exacerbations using different end points. One study did not report the number of exacerbations, but it did report on the time to first exacerbation.SLIT decreased the severity of the first moderate exacerbation, but it did not increase the time to first severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids. Another study did not provide any raw data or rates of the critical outcomes, and the authors only noted that the results showed no statistically significant improvement in asthma exacerbations. The third study, which enrolled only 60 participants, found a significantly lower number of exacerbations in the treatment group. Four studies (N = 1193) that evaluated asthma control using validated outcome tools (three used the ACQ, and one used the ACT) found no consistent improvement after treatment. – Finally, multiple studies showed no difference in quality of life in those treated with SLIT or placebo. (high certainty of evidence).

For important outcomes, SLIT reduced the use of quick-relief medications,– and doses of ICSs, with moderate certainty of evidence.

The harms were difficult for the Expert Panel to evaluate. Local reactions were frequent and occurred in up to 80% of individuals treated with SLIT, but adverse local reactions were also common in those receiving placebo. The rate of side effects did not differ by the setting of administration (home, clinic, or other), and the relationship between the risk of side effects and the strength of the dose administered was not consistent across studies. None of the RCTs (N = 1772),– reported episodes of anaphylaxis. The Expert Panel found no reports of death that was secondary to SLIT.

### Real-world effectiveness of antibiotics in addition to oral corticosteroids for managing asthma exacerbations in adults [^c91cdbdc]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Antibiotics are widely used to manage acute asthma exacerbations, despite little evidence for their effectiveness. This study assesses the added value of antibiotics alongside oral corticosteroids (OCSs) in treating asthma exacerbations.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included individuals from the Netherlands between 1994 and 2022 from the IADB.nl pharmacy dispensing database. Individuals had to be 16–45 years old, use inhaled asthma medication and have a first recorded prednisone/prednisolone (OCS) dispense of ≥ 30 mg/day for 3–14 days. Patients were compared regarding treatment failure (a new dispense of OCS or antibiotics, 15–30 days after initial dispense), based on whether or not they were dispensed antibiotics (AB) alongside their first recorded OCS dispense. Regression analyses with inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to adjust for various confounders.

Results

Of the 5401 individuals included, 38% received antibiotics alongside the first-recorded OCS dispense, with a decreasing trend from 47% in 2009 to 24% in 2020. The OR for treatment failure was 1.36 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.16) for AB+OCS versus OCS-only. The HR for a new exacerbation within 31–365 days of follow-up was 1.20 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.56) for AB+OCS versus OCS-only. The lack of beneficial effect of AB was consistent across subcohorts.

Conclusions

This study found no reduction in treatment failure, nor in risk of subsequent exacerbation, from adding AB to OCS for treating acute asthma exacerbations. We suggest that antibiotics should not be used in primary care settings to treat acute asthma exacerbation unless there are clear signs of bacterial infection.
