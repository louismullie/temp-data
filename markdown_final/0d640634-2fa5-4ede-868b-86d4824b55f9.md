## Question

Went to stop breast cancer screening

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to stop breast cancer screening and how to make that decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that stopping screening should not be based on age alone. Then, I should verify the role of life expectancy and the 10-year horizon. Next, I will review the evidence base for women 75 and older, including randomized and observational data. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus harms in older adults, including overdiagnosis and false positives. Then, I should align with major guideline positions and the shared decision-making framework. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical steps and a concise bottom line recommendation, making sure I double-check any conflicting data along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: age alone should not dictate stopping screening. Decisions should be individualized based on health status, comorbidities, and life expectancy, with shared decision-making emphasized by WPSI and ACOG, and reflected in USPSTF's I statement for women 75 and older, which signals insufficient evidence for a blanket recommendation to continue or stop beyond 74 years [^114jW2nH] [^111VgZPM] [^111v445a].

> I need to check the life expectancy threshold next. The most consistent, clinically actionable anchor is a 10-year life expectancy; if life expectancy is under 10 years, the time-lag to benefit from screening (roughly a decade) makes it unlikely that screening will improve survival, and harms may predominate, so stopping is reasonable; conversely, if life expectancy exceeds 10 years, continuing screening can be considered, especially if the patient values potential mortality reduction and accepts trade-offs [^116FTBAX] [^112SjnVL] [^115CDdsy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about benefits in the very old. I should review the evidence base for women 75 and older. There are no randomized trials of screening mammography in women older than 74, so the best available data are observational and modeling studies; some observational analyses suggest a mortality benefit for continuing screening in selected older women, whereas others, including a large Medicare emulation, found no significant mortality reduction beyond age 75, highlighting uncertainty and the need for individualized decisions [^111v445a] [^115uzzRT] [^116bMxHF].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of potential benefit and harms in older adults. Modeling and observational data suggest that for women in their 70s with at least a 10-year life expectancy, continued biennial screening may avert about 2 breast cancer deaths per 1000 over 10 years, but it also yields approximately 200 false positives and about 13 cases of overdiagnosis per 1000 over that period; overdiagnosis can lead to overtreatment with surgery, radiation, and endocrine therapy, which carry higher risks in older adults, and false positives can cause anxiety and invasive procedures without benefit [^116FTBAX] [^1115AMor] [^111Ktw7R].

> I should confirm how different guidelines frame this. USPSTF gives a B recommendation for biennial screening ages 40–74 and an I statement for 75+, reflecting insufficient evidence. ACS advises continuing screening as long as health is good and life expectancy is at least 10 years. ACR/SBI support continuing past 74 without an upper age limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy. ACOG emphasizes shared decision-making beyond 75 rather than stopping purely by age [^111v445a] [^112SjnVL] [^111BpqKv] [^111VgZPM].

> Let me consider practical clinical steps to operationalize this. First, I should estimate life expectancy using validated tools (for example, ePrognosis) and review comorbidities and functional status. Second, I should discuss benefits, harms, and uncertainties in plain language, including the 10-year lag to benefit, false-positive risks, and overdiagnosis. Third, I should elicit patient values and preferences, using decision aids when available. Finally, I should document the shared decision and revisit periodically as health status changes, aligning with WPSI's emphasis on periodic SDM and ACOG's guidance to individualize beyond 75 [^114jW2nH] [^111VgZPM] [^114Vygcd].

> But wait, what if the patient is 76 and exceptionally healthy with a 15-year life expectancy and strongly values early detection? I should acknowledge that some observational data and radiology literature suggest potential benefit in carefully selected older women, even though high-quality RCT evidence is lacking, so continuing annual screening may be reasonable after confirming understanding of harms and trade-offs. Conversely, if life expectancy is under 10 years or comorbidities are substantial, I should recommend stopping and pivot the conversation to symptom-driven care and goals of care [^116bMxHF] [^116FTBAX] [^114jW2nH].

> I should double-check communication strategies because stopping screening can be counterintuitive for patients accustomed to annual mammograms. Randomized messaging trials show that clinician-delivered cessation messages, especially when reinforced over time or from multiple sources, increase acceptance of appropriate stopping, supporting proactive, empathetic conversations to reduce overscreening without undermining trust [^115d4px2] [^117S31ch].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the recommendation is clear and individualized: do not stop screening based on age alone. Use a 10-year life expectancy threshold to guide whether to continue or stop, integrate comorbidity and functional status, and engage in shared decision-making that weighs modest potential mortality benefit against meaningful risks of false positives and overdiagnosis. For women 75 and older with limited life expectancy or significant comorbidity, stopping screening is appropriate, whereas healthy women with more than a 10-year life expectancy may reasonably continue screening if they value the potential benefit and accept the harms [^114jW2nH] [^116FTBAX] [^111v445a].

---

Stop breast cancer screening when **life expectancy is under 10 years** [^114jW2nH] or when **severe comorbidities limit benefit** [^111VgZPM]. The USPSTF gives an **I statement for women ≥ 75** [^111v445a] due to insufficient evidence, so decisions should be individualized. For women 75 and older in good health, **continue screening** if they value potential benefits and accept harms [^116bMxHF]; for those with limited life expectancy or significant comorbidities, **stop screening** [^116FTBAX]. Use shared decision-making to align choices with values, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^114jW2nH] [^114Vygcd].

## Evidence and guidelines on stopping breast cancer screening

Several major organizations provide **guidelines** on when to stop breast cancer screening:

| **Organization** | **Recommendation on stopping screening** |
|-|-|
| USPSTF | - Insufficient evidence for women ≥ 75 years [^111v445a] <br/> - Individualize decisions based on health, comorbidities, and life expectancy [^notfound] |
| ACS | - Continue as long as health is good and life expectancy ≥ 10 years [^112SjnVL] <br/> - Individualize beyond 75 years [^116ZTVC4] |
| ACOG | - Do not base continuation or discontinuation on age alone [^111VgZPM] <br/> - Use shared decision-making considering health status and longevity [^117Bxvku] |
| ACR/SBI | - Continue past 74 years without an upper age limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy [^111BpqKv] |

---

## Factors influencing the decision to stop screening

The decision to stop screening is influenced by several **factors**:

- **Life expectancy**: Screening benefits lag by ~10 years; thus, women with < 10-year life expectancy are unlikely to benefit [^116FTBAX] [^112K3EUz].
- **Comorbidities**: Severe comorbidities may limit benefit and increase harms from screening and treatment [^112K3EUz] [^115CDdsy].
- **Patient preferences**: Values and preferences should guide decisions, especially in older adults [^114jW2nH].
- **Health status**: Overall health and functional status should be considered [^114jW2nH] [^112K3EUz].

---

## Benefits and harms of continuing or discontinuing screening

### Benefits of continuing screening

Potential benefits of continuing screening include **early detection** of asymptomatic cancers, which enables less invasive treatments and improved outcomes [^117LfpNJ], and **reduced mortality**, as screening is associated with lower breast cancer mortality in older women [^116bMxHF].

---

### Harms of continuing screening

- **False positives**: Lead to anxiety, additional imaging, and biopsies [^1115AMor].
- **Overdiagnosis**: Detection of indolent cancers unlikely to cause symptoms or death [^111Ktw7R].
- **Overtreatment**: Unnecessary treatment of indolent cancers, causing physical and psychological harm [^112bNFFr].

---

## Evidence on screening effectiveness in older women

Evidence on screening effectiveness in older women is limited; **no randomized controlled trials** have specifically evaluated screening in women ≥ 75 years [^111v445a] [^115marp3]. Observational studies suggest potential benefits in healthy older women [^116bMxHF], but benefits diminish with advancing age and comorbidities [^115uzzRT] [^112K3EUz].

---

## Role of shared decision-making

Shared decision-making is **essential** [^114jW2nH] when considering stopping screening. Discussions should cover:

- **Benefits and harms**: Clear communication of potential benefits and harms [^114jW2nH].
- **Patient values**: Incorporation of patient preferences and values [^117TZMnZ].
- **Individualized assessment**: Consideration of life expectancy, comorbidities, and health status [^114jW2nH].

---

## Practical recommendations for clinicians

Clinicians should **consider the following**:

- **Assess life expectancy**: Use validated tools to estimate life expectancy [^112VfMPy].
- **Evaluate comorbidities**: Consider severity and impact on life expectancy [^114jW2nH].
- **Engage in shared decision-making**: Discuss benefits, harms, and patient preferences [^114jW2nH].
- **Document decisions**: Clearly document the rationale for stopping or continuing screening [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Stop breast cancer screening when **life expectancy is < 10 years** or when **severe comorbidities limit benefit** [^1164hhhG]. For women ≥ 75 years, individualize decisions using shared decision-making that considers health status, comorbidities, and preferences [^111VgZPM].

### The WISDOM study: breaking the deadlock in the breast cancer screening debate [^116cofaV]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

There are few medical issues that have generated as much controversy as screening for breast cancer. In science, controversy often stimulates innovation; however, the intensely divisive debate over mammographic screening has had the opposite effect and has stifled progress. The same two questions-whether it is better to screen annually or bi-annually, and whether women are best served by beginning screening at 40 or some later age-have been debated for 20 years, based on data generated three to four decades ago. The controversy has continued largely because our current approach to screening assumes all women have the same risk for the same type of breast cancer. In fact, we now know that cancers vary tremendously in terms of timing of onset, rate of growth, and probability of metastasis. In an era of personalized medicine, we have the opportunity to investigate tailored screening based on a woman's specific risk for a specific tumor type, generating new data that can inform best practices rather than to continue the rancorous debate. It is time to move from debate to wisdom by asking new questions and generating new knowledge. The WISDOM Study (Women Informed to Screen Depending On Measures of risk) is a pragmatic, adaptive, randomized clinical trial comparing a comprehensive risk-based, or personalized approach to traditional annual breast cancer screening. The multicenter trial will enroll 100,000 women, powered for a primary endpoint of non-inferiority with respect to the number of late stage cancers detected. The trial will determine whether screening based on personalized risk is as safe, less morbid, preferred by women, will facilitate prevention for those most likely to benefit, and adapt as we learn who is at risk for what kind of cancer. Funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, WISDOM is the product of a multi-year stakeholder engagement process that has brought together consumers, advocates, primary care physicians, specialists, policy makers, technology companies and payers to help break the deadlock in this debate and advance towards a new, dynamic approach to breast cancer screening.

2015 breast cancer screening recommendations for women at average risk — evidence review scope and outcomes state that studies included controlled studies (randomized clinical trials [RCTs], pooled patient-level meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and study-level meta-analyses), observational studies published since 2000 that included 1000 or more average-risk women, and modeling/simulation studies; critical outcomes included breast cancer mortality, quality of life, life expectancy, false-positive test results, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment, while other outcomes such as morbidity related to treatment of breast cancer and radiation exposure from mammography were considered but not included in the evidence review.

### The recent US preventive services task force guidelines are not supported by the scientific evidence and should be rescinded [^113USqxK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The recent US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on mammographic screening ignore the scientific evidence and should be rescinded. There are no data to support the age of 50 years as a threshold for screening. There are no data to support screening women aged 40 to 49 years on the basis of risk. The USPSTF failed to understand the randomized controlled trials and used the lowest possible benefit in its calculations. The death rate from breast cancer has decreased by 30%, primarily because of screening. The agency ignored direct data with regard to decreasing deaths in real populations in favor of computer models. The USPSTF admits that its guidelines will result in unnecessary deaths from breast cancer that could be avoided by screening annually beginning at the age of 40 years.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112X673z]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Breast cancer screening overdiagnosis and program aims: The panel characterizes overdiagnosis as contested but affirms its existence while acknowledging uncertainty in magnitude, stating that "The issue of overdiagnosis is controversial", and that "The evidence review judged the evidence for the existence of overdiagnosis as high, but evidence for estimating the magnitude of overdiagnosis as low". Programmatically, "The main goal of mammography screening programs is to reduce breast cancer mortality by reducing the incidence rate of advanced breast cancer", recognizing that "A screening test that is successful in detecting small invasive cancers also will detect some precursors", and that "this likely does result in some overdiagnosis, but in other instances, it advances the time of diagnosis of a progressive lesion".

Breast cancer screening for women at average risk — evidence basis and study design considerations: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are positioned as the foundational evidence, but absolute benefit estimates are better tied to exposure-based outcomes from modern observational evaluations; consequently, "it is preferable to regard the RCTs as providing the foundation on which mortality outcomes based on exposure to screening (NNS) from well-designed observational studies and evaluations of modern service screening can be viewed with greater confidence", and, with appropriate methodological safeguards, "observational studies can provide evidence about the association between screening and outcomes among women who are exposed to screening".

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^117Lz4FM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to counsel average-risk females about breast self-awareness and encourage to notify their health care provider if they experience a change. Define breast self-awareness as a female awareness of the normal appearance and feel of her breasts.

### Randomized trial of information for older women about cessation of breast cancer screening invitations [^115ichWG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

There are consequences of providing information that should also be considered. Firstly, our interventions led some older women to be more unsure about whether to continue or stop breast screening and more likely to want to speak with their GP. Clinicians may need support and training to navigate these discussions and provide recommendations if requested. Verbal scripts have been developed in the US that suggest how the idea of stopping cancer screening could be introduced, how a recommendation to stop could be explained with further reasoning, or how the benefits and harms of screening could be discussed in a shared decision-making conversation. These strategies for discussing stopping screening could be further adapted for use in contexts where national screening programs are implemented. Secondly, women who did not receive additional messaging reported greater relief in response to the BreastScreen letter. This may be explained by the relieving nature of receiving a letter from a trusted organization that provides a reassuring screen result without needing to consider additional information, or because information about screening benefits and harms reminds women that they are getting older and therefore feel a lack of control. Given women perceive mammograms as a way of looking after their health, this information could lead to feelings of distress.

Health animations have shown promise in communicating complex information to people with low health literacy. There were no statistically significant differences observed between text and animation study arms. However, the format of information delivery is worth exploring in future studies with larger, more diverse samples. Animations may be particularly useful for low health literacy audiences when communicating conceptual knowledge rather than numerical risk information. Regardless, both intervention formats improved informed decision-making which could provide helpful flexibility in allowing for potential individual differences in needs and preferences for text or animation formats.

Early detection of cancer has long been thought to be the first step towards eradicating the mortality associated with the disease. National screening programmes for breast cancer have been implemented in many countries. However, there is controversy regarding the efficacy and optimal methods of screening, which is regularly discussed in articles, at conferences and is apparent in conflicting guidelines. In this article, Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology asks four experts their opinions on some of the pressing questions associated with breast cancer screening.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^1111zPu5]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

The other comparisons made by included studies do not provide direct evidence on the health benefits and harms of continuing to screen beyond age 75. Studies that compare older women to younger age groups, compare according to screening history or screening interval, or compare by whether a cancer is screen-detected or diagnosed clinically (by physician or patient) are prone to lead time bias and as a result may be inherently biased towards screening, and do not tell us how health outcomes change if the woman chooses to stop vs continue screening beyond age 75. For example, a study with a more informative comparison (stop vs continue screening) indicates a non-significant breast cancer death hazard ratio (1.00; 95% CI 0.83–1.19), whereas a study with a less informative comparison (within age-group clinical detection vs screen-detected) suggests a significant benefit to screen detection (HR 0.5; 95% CI 0.31–0.82). As such, the results of many of the studies with less informative comparisons need to be interpreted with caution.

Several studies reported screening detection measures, showing similar or higher cancer detection rates (depending on the comparison used) or PPV for recall (detection yield) for screening older women although several studies did not have a comparator. These metrics provide information about the performance of the screening process, but they provide less knowledge about the health benefit of continuing to screen. This comparison is particularly problematic when being made by age-groups as the detection metrics generally differ between younger and older women. For example, mammograms are more sensitive in older women, and underlying cancer rates higher, so more cancer detection would be expected at screening in older women (compared to younger groups) but this is not equivalent to evidence on whether screening beyond 75 years and older as opposed to stopping confers a mortality benefit.

Likewise, comparing cancer characteristics and treatment patterns between younger and older women is un-informative about screening effects because breast cancer biology and treatment are known to differ between younger and older women, so in extreme age, i.e. 75 years and older, these differences would be expected and could be more evident. Therefore reported differences related to cancer characteristics between age-groups do not provide direct evidence about health benefit of screening into older age.

### Harmonizing breast cancer screening recommendations: metrics and accountability [^112msx65]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purposes of this article are to summarize breast cancer screening recommendations and discuss their differences and similarities and to explain the differences between two national databases to aid in interpretation of their benchmarks.

Conclusion

The American College of Radiology, American Cancer Society, and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force all agree that annual mammography beginning at age 40 saves the most lives, and all acknowledge a woman's right to choose when to begin and stop screening. The National Mammography Database (NMD) differs from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium database in that it acquires data using the same approach used by almost all mammography facilities in the United States. Therefore, NMD benchmarks, which include standard metrics, provide more meaningful comparisons to help mammography facilities and radiologists improve performance.

### Risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^113Rops2]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk females, USPSTF 2019 guidelines recommend to do not offer routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or genetic testing in females with no personal or family history or ancestry not associated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2 gene mutations.

### The benefits and harms of breast cancer screening: an independent review [^111Ktw7R]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Whether breast cancer screening does more harm than good has been debated extensively. The main questions are how large the benefit of screening is in terms of reduced breast cancer mortality and how substantial the harm is in terms of overdiagnosis, which is defined as cancers detected at screening that would not have otherwise become clinically apparent in the woman's lifetime. An independent Panel was convened to reach conclusions about the benefits and harms of breast screening on the basis of a review of published work and oral and written evidence presented by experts in the subject. To provide estimates of the level of benefits and harms, the Panel relied mainly on findings from randomised trials of breast cancer screening that compared women invited to screening with controls not invited, but also reviewed evidence from observational studies. The Panel focused on the UK setting, where women aged 50–70 years are invited to screening every 3 years. In this Review, we provide a summary of the full report on the Panel's findings and conclusions. In a meta-analysis of 11 randomised trials, the relative risk of breast cancer mortality for women invited to screening compared with controls was 0·80 (95% CI 0·73–0·89), which is a relative risk reduction of 20%. The Panel considered the internal biases in the trials and whether these trials, which were done a long time ago, were still relevant; they concluded that 20% was still a reasonable estimate of the relative risk reduction. The more reliable and recent observational studies generally produced larger estimates of benefit, but these studies might be biased. The best estimates of overdiagnosis are from three trials in which women in the control group were not invited to be screened at the end of the active trial period. In a meta-analysis, estimates of the excess incidence were 11% (95% CI 9–12) when expressed as a proportion of cancers diagnosed in the invited group in the long term, and 19% (15–23) when expressed as a proportion of the cancers diagnosed during the active screening period. Results from observational studies support the occurrence of overdiagnosis, but estimates of its magnitude are unreliable. The Panel concludes that screening reduces breast cancer mortality but that some overdiagnosis occurs. Since the estimates provided are from studies with many limitations and whose relevance to present-day screening programmes can be questioned, they have substantial uncertainty and should be regarded only as an approximate guide. If these figures are used directly, for every 10,000 UK women aged 50 years invited to screening for the next 20 years, 43 deaths from breast cancer would be prevented and 129 cases of breast cancer, invasive and non-invasive, would be overdiagnosed; that is one breast cancer death prevented for about every three overdiagnosed cases identified and treated. Of the roughly 307,000 women aged 50–52 years who are invited to begin screening every year, just over 1% would have an overdiagnosed cancer in the next 20 years. Evidence from a focus group organised by Cancer Research UK and attended by some members of the Panel showed that many women feel that accepting the offer of breast screening is worthwhile, which agrees with the results of previous similar studies. Information should be made available in a transparent and objective way to women invited to screening so that they can make informed decisions.

### Collaborative modeling of the benefits and harms associated with different U.S. breast cancer screening strategies [^1152SscC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy persists about optimal mammography screening strategies.

Objective

To evaluate screening outcomes, taking into account advances in mammography and treatment of breast cancer.

Design

Collaboration of 6 simulation models using national data on incidence, digital mammography performance, treatment effects, and other-cause mortality.

Setting

United States.

Patients

Average-risk U.S. female population and subgroups with varying risk, breast density, or comorbidity.

Intervention

Eight strategies differing by age at which screening starts (40, 45, or 50 years) and screening interval (annual, biennial, and hybrid [annual for women in their 40s and biennial thereafter]). All strategies assumed 100% adherence and stopped at age 74 years.

Measurements

Benefits (breast cancer-specific mortality reduction, breast cancer deaths averted, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years); number of mammograms used; harms (false-positive results, benign biopsies, and overdiagnosis); and ratios of harms (or use) and benefits (efficiency) per 1000 screens.

Results

Biennial strategies were consistently the most efficient for average-risk women. Biennial screening from age 50 to 74 years avoided a median of 7 breast cancer deaths versus no screening; annual screening from age 40 to 74 years avoided an additional 3 deaths, but yielded 1988 more false-positive results and 11 more overdiagnoses per 1000 women screened. Annual screening from age 50 to 74 years was inefficient (similar benefits, but more harms than other strategies). For groups with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk, annual screening from age 40 years had similar harms and benefits as screening average-risk women biennially from 50 to 74 years. For groups with moderate or severe comorbidity, screening could stop at age 66 to 68 years.

Limitation

Other imaging technologies, polygenic risk, and nonadherence were not considered.

Conclusion

Biennial screening for breast cancer is efficient for average-risk populations. Decisions about starting ages and intervals will depend on population characteristics and the decision makers' weight given to the harms and benefits of screening.

### Breast cancer screening recommendations inclusive of all women at average risk: update from the ACR and society of breast imaging [^111BpqKv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer remains the most common nonskin cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths, and the leading cause of premature death in US women. Mammography screening has been proven effective in reducing breast cancer deaths in women age 40 years and older. A mortality reduction of 40% is possible with regular screening. Treatment advances cannot overcome the disadvantage of being diagnosed with an advanced-stage tumor. The ACR and Society of Breast Imaging recommend annual mammography screening beginning at age 40, which provides the greatest mortality reduction, diagnosis at earlier stage, better surgical options, and more effective chemotherapy. Annual screening results in more screening-detected tumors, tumors of smaller sizes, and fewer interval cancers than longer screening intervals. Screened women in their 40s are more likely to have early-stage disease, negative lymph nodes, and smaller tumors than unscreened women. Delaying screening until age 45 or 50 will result in an unnecessary loss of life to breast cancer and adversely affects minority women in particular. Screening should continue past age 74 years, without an upper age limit unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy. Benefits of screening should be considered along with the possibilities of recall for additional imaging and benign biopsy and the less tangible risks of anxiety and overdiagnosis. Although recall and biopsy recommendations are higher with more frequent screening, so are life-years gained and breast cancer deaths averted. Women who wish to maximize benefit will choose annual screening starting at age 40 years and will not stop screening prematurely.

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^117Bxvku]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, more specifically with respect to breast cancer screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to do not continue or discontinue screening based on age alone. Decide on discontinuing screening mammography beyond age 75 years based on a shared decision-making process informed by the females health status and longevity.

### Decision-making regarding mammography screening for older women [^115CDdsy]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

The population is aging, and breast cancer incidence increases with age, peaking between the ages of 75 and 79. However, it is not known whether mammography screening helps women aged 75 and older live longer because they have not been included in randomized controlled trials evaluating mammography screening. Guidelines recommend that older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy not be screened because it takes approximately 10 years before a screen-detected breast cancer may affect an older woman's survival. Guidelines recommend that clinicians discuss the benefits and risks of screening with women aged 75 and older with a life expectancy of 10 years or longer to help them elicit their values and preferences. It is estimated that two of 1,000 women who continue to be screened every other year from age 70 to 79 may avoid breast cancer death, but 12% to 27% of these women will experience a false-positive test, and 10% to 20% of women who experience a false-positive test will undergo a breast biopsy. In addition, approximately 30% of screen-detected cancers would not otherwise have shown up in an older woman's lifetime, yet nearly all older women undergo treatment for these breast cancers, and the risks of treatment increase with age. To inform decision-making, tools are available to estimate life expectancy and to educate older women about the benefits and harms of mammography screening. Guides are also available to help clinicians discuss stopping screening with older women with less than a 10-year life expectancy. Ideally, screening decisions would consider an older woman's life expectancy, breast cancer risk, and her values and preferences.

### Breast cancer screening in the precision medicine era: risk-based screening in a population-based trial [^116jrXTQ]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

Ongoing controversy over the optimal approach to breast cancer screening has led to discordant professional society recommendations, particularly in women age 40 to 49 years. One potential solution is risk-based screening, where decisions around the starting age, stopping age, frequency, and modality of screening are based on individual risk to maximize the early detection of aggressive cancers and minimize the harms of screening through optimal resource utilization. We present a novel approach to risk-based screening that integrates clinical risk factors, breast density, a polygenic risk score representing the cumulative effects of genetic variants, and sequencing for moderate- and high-penetrance germline mutations. We demonstrate how thresholds of absolute risk estimates generated by our prediction tools can be used to stratify women into different screening strategies (biennial mammography, annual mammography, annual mammography with adjunctive magnetic resonance imaging, defer screening at this time) while informing the starting age of screening for women age 40 to 49 years. Our risk thresholds and corresponding screening strategies are based on current evidence but need to be tested in clinical trials. The Women Informed to Screen Depending On Measures of risk (WISDOM) Study, a pragmatic, preference-tolerant randomized controlled trial of annual vs personalized screening, will study our proposed approach. WISDOM will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of risk-based screening beginning in the fall of 2016. The adaptive design of this trial allows continued refinement of our risk thresholds as the trial progresses, and we discuss areas where we anticipate emerging evidence will impact our approach.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to describe screening updates for women with average and high risk for breast cancer, compare different screening strategies, and describe new approaches in risk prediction, including radiomics. CONCLUSION. All women are at substantial risk for breast cancer. For women with average risk, annual mammography beginning at 40 years old maximizes the life-extending benefits and provides improved treatment options. Women at higher risk need earlier and more intense screening. Delaying initiation or decreasing frequency of mammographic screening adversely affects breast cancer detection.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^114wf3dd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening for women at average risk — key age bands and modalities are: Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation). Women should undergo regular screening mammography beginning at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation), and women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Clinical breast examination is not recommended for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). All women should become familiar with the potential benefits, limitations, and harms associated with breast cancer screening. Average-risk women were defined as those without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age. In contrast, ACS, 2003 guidance stated: Begin annual mammography screening at age 40 years; For women in their 20s and 30s, it is recommended that clinical breast examination be part of a periodic health examination, preferably at least every 3 years; Asymptomatic women aged 40 years and older should continue to receive a clinical breast examination as part of a periodic health examination, preferably annually.

### More than a half century of misinformation about breast cancer screening [^113HyfcG]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The following is an overview of the numerous efforts to reduce access for women to breast cancer screening. Misinformation has been promoted over the many years to suggest that screening only works for women aged 50 years and over. In fact, there are no, scientifically derived data, to support the use of the age of 50 years as a threshold for screening. The randomized, controlled trials have proved that screening saves lives for women aged 40 to 74 years (the age of the women who participated).

Women's Preventive Services Initiative — average-risk breast cancer screening recommendations state: "The Women's Preventive Services Initiative recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer initiate mammography screening no earlier than age 40 years and no later than age 50 years". "Screening mammography should occur at least biennially and as frequently as annually". If additional imaging is indicated, "these services also are recommended to complete the screening process for malignancies" and may include "magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, mammography". "Screening should continue through at least age 74 years, and age alone should not be the basis for discontinuing screening". Additionally, "Women at increased risk also should undergo periodic mammography screening, however, recommendations for additional services are beyond the scope of this recommendation".

Recommendation 2 — screening continuation in older women states that women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Breast cancer incidence continues to increase until ages 75 to 79 years, and 26% of breast cancer deaths each year are attributable to a diagnosis after age 74 years; none of the RCTs included women 75 years and older, although observational studies have observed a reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with mammographic detection among women aged 75 years and older. The guideline notes that the reduced life expectancy associated with being older decreases the likelihood of screening benefit in some women.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^117TZMnZ]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society breast cancer screening guideline — recommendation strength and user interpretation are defined using GRADE: "The GDC chose to assess recommendations as 'strong' or 'qualified', in accordance with GRADE guidance". "A strong recommendation conveys the consensus that the benefits of adherence to the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects", whereas "Qualified recommendations indicate there is clear evidence of benefit but less certainty about either the balance between benefits and harms, or about patients' values and preferences, which could lead to different decisions (Table 1)". Table 1 interprets strong recommendations for patients as "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not" and for clinicians as "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action. Adherence to the recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator". For qualified recommendations, patients: "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action but many would not. Patient preferences and informed decision making are desirable for making decisions", and clinicians: "Clinicians should recognize that different choices will be appropriate for different patients and that clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences", with the additions that "Decision aids may be useful to help individuals in making decisions consistent with their values and preferences" and "Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working toward a decision".

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116j7vjL]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Treatment or intervention considerations — Breast cancer treatment regimens are highly individualized according to clinical status, cancer stage, tumor biomarkers, clinical subtype, and personal preferences. When ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is identified at screening, there is clinical variability in treatment, and it is unknown what proportion of screen-detected DCIS represents overdiagnosis. In general, DCIS treatment, which may include surgery, radiation, and endocrine treatment, is intended to reduce the risk for future invasive breast cancer.

### Breast cancer screening is harmful after age 75… [^116WZNGJ]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on March 22, 2020 To increase acute care capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have suspended elective surgical procedures, and family medicine practices have postponed visits for preventive care and monitoring of stable chronic diseases
- particularly in patients older than 70 years, whose risk of developing serious illness from SARS-CoV-2 contracted in a health care setting likely outweighs potential benefits. For example, women in this age group should cancel or postpone screening mammograms. Even in the best of times, though, it's not known if screening mammography beyond 75 years of age is helpful or harmful. The U. S Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of breast cancer screening after age 75, and decision tools have been developed to help women decide whether or not to continue to be screened, relying on limited evidence and the patient's predicted life expectancy.

As the authors of a recent. AFP editorial observed, though, discussing the clinical implications of life expectancy with older patients can be challenging and fraught with pitfalls. Since it is unlikely that a randomized controlled trial of screening mammography in older women will be performed, researchers recently used observational data from the U. S. Medicare program to emulate such a trial in more than 1 million beneficiaries aged 70 to 84 years with a life expectancy of at least 10 years and no previous breast cancer diagnosis. The primary outcome was eight-year risk of breast cancer mortality. While women age 70 to 74 years who continued to have screening mammograms had a 22 percent lower risk than those who stopped being screened, there was no mortality benefit for women who continued screening after age 75 years.

Although guidelines already discourage screening for cancer in adults with a life expectancy of less than 10 years, this study suggested that stopping breast cancer screening after age 75 may be the right decision for all women, regardless of health status.

### Cancer screening in the older patient [^112NsWMT]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Although there are clear guidelines that advise at what age to begin screening for various cancers, there is less guidance concerning when it may be appropriate to stop screening. The decision to stop screening must take into account patients' age; overall health and life expectancy; the natural history of the disease; and the risks, expense, and convenience of the screening test, and any subsequent testing and treatment. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians suggest that Papanicolaou smears can be discontinued in women at 65 years of age, provided they have had adequate recent normal screenings. Evidence suggests that cessation of breast cancer screening at approximately 75 to 80 years of age is appropriate, although American Geriatric Society guidelines recommend cessation at a more advanced age. Studies support continuing colon cancer screening until approximately 75 years of age in men and 80 years of age in women for patients without significant comorbidities. Prostate cancer screening, if conducted at all, may be discontinued at approximately 75 years of age in otherwise healthy men. Ultimately, the decision to screen or to discontinue screening must be made after careful discussion with each patient, using evidence-based guidelines and individual patient preferences.

### The benefits and harms of breast cancer screening: an independent review [^112XiNPt]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

A specific issue raised by some commentators is that most of the randomised trials of breast screening date from the 1980s or earlier. Treatment and overall management of breast cancer have improved considerably since that time. Are the trials still relevant? Such a question can be asked of any area of medical investigation and treatment; trials refer to the past and our use of interventions relates to the future. It is an important area of judgement and one that the panel kept at the forefront of its consideration.

The purpose of screening is to prolong survival, but length of survival from diagnosis of breast cancer to death cannot be used as an end point in the RCTs, because the cancers diagnosed by screening are diagnosed earlier than those diagnosed without screening. Thus, even in the absence of any therapy, a cancer diagnosed earlier by screening will have a better survival than the same cancer presenting later symptomatically. Mortality after invitation to screening is the appropriate end point. However, concerns have been raised about the use of breast cancer mortality. If the adjudication of a death as due to breast cancer is influenced by the woman's screening history, then the estimate of the effects on breast cancer mortality can become biased. For this reason, some have argued that death from all cancers, or indeed all-cause mortality, should be the primary outcome of interest in the trials. The panel disagrees with this view (section 3.5). We also comment on the estimation of absolute risk differences, as opposed to RRs, and the difference between the effects expressed per woman invited and per woman screened.

The panel's view is that although the trials are far from perfect, they offer the most reliable evidence on the RR reduction in breast cancer mortality to be derived from screening.

### Randomized trial of information for older women about cessation of breast cancer screening invitations [^1145fCq1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Older women receive no information about why Australia's breast screening program (BreastScreen) invitations cease after 74 years. We tested how providing older women with the rationale for breast screening cessation impacted informed choice (adequate knowledge; screening attitudes aligned with intention).

Methods

In a three-arm online randomized trial, eligible participants were females aged 70–74 years who had recently participated in breast screening (within 5 years), without personal breast cancer history, recruited through Qualtrics. Participants read a hypothetical scenario in which they received a BreastScreen letter reporting no abnormalities on their mammogram. They were randomized to receive the letter: (1) without any rationale for screening cessation (control); (2) with screening cessation rationale in printed-text form (e.g., downsides of screening outweigh the benefits after age 74); or (3) with screening cessation rationale presented in an animation video form. The primary outcome was informed choice about continuing/stopping breast screening beyond 74 years.

Results

A total of 376 participant responses were analyzed. Compared to controls (n = 122), intervention arm participants (text [n = 132] or animation [n = 122]) were more likely to make an informed choice (control 18.0%; text 32.6%, p = .010; animation 40.5%, p < .001). Intervention arm participants had more adequate knowledge (control 23.8%; text 59.8%, p < .001; animation 68.9%, p < .001), lower screening intentions (control 17.2%; text 36.4%, p < .001; animation 49.2%, p < .001), and fewer positive screening attitudes regarding screening for themselves in the animation arm, but not in the text arm (control 65.6%; text 51.5%, p = .023; animation 40.2%, p < .001).

Conclusions

Providing information to older women about the rationale for breast cancer screening cessation increased informed decision-making in a hypothetical scenario. This study is an important first step in improving messaging provided by national cancer screening providers direct to older adults. Further research is needed to assess the impact of different elements of the intervention and the impact of providing this information in clinical practice, with more diverse samples.

### Is It the era for personalized screening? [^114FMb7q]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer screening is a recognized tool for early detection of the disease in asymptomatic women, improving treatment efficacy and reducing the mortality rate. There is raised awareness that a "one-size-fits-all" approach cannot be applied for breast cancer screening. Currently, despite specific guidelines for a minority of women who are at very high risk of breast cancer, all other women are still treated alike. This article reviews the current recommendations for breast cancer risk assessment and breast cancer screening in average-risk and higher-than-average-risk women. Also discussed are new developments and future perspectives for personalized breast cancer screening.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^116ZTVC4]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) average-risk screening — older age, health, and life expectancy: Health and life expectancy, not simply age, must be considered in screening decisions, and a significant proportion of women 75 years and older are in good health and can be expected to live considerably longer than 10 or more years. Based on 2010 US Life Tables, approximately 50% of 80-year-old women and 25% of 85-year-old women will live at least 10 years, and an older woman's life expectancy exceeding 10 years is generally defined as having greater than a 50% probability of surviving 10 years. For women who are healthy and have at least a 10-year life expectancy, individualized decisions about screening mammography should be considered, and the GDG recommends that women should continue screening as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer.

### Toward optimal screening strategies for older women. costs, benefits, and harms of breast cancer screening by age, biology, and health status [^117K1zbb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Optimal ages of breast cancer screening cessation remain uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate screening policies based on age and quartiles of life expectancy (LE).

Design and Population

We used a stochastic model with proxies of age-dependent biology to evaluate the incremental U.S. societal costs and benefits of biennial screening from age 50 until age 70, 79, or lifetime.

Main Outcome Measures

Discounted incremental costs per life years saved (LYS).

Results

Lifetime screening is expensive (151,434 dollars per LYS) if women have treatment and survival comparable to clinical trials (idealized); stopping at age 79 costs 82,063 dollars per LYS. This latter result corresponds to costs associated with an LE of 9.5 years at age 79, a value expected for 75% of 79-year-olds, about 50% of 80-year-olds, and 25% of 85-year-olds. Using actual treatment and survival patterns, screening benefits are greater, and lifetime screening of all women might be considered (114,905 dollars per LYS), especially for women in the top 25% of LE for their age (50,643 dollars per LYS, life expectancy of approximately 7 years at age 90).

Conclusions

If all women receive idealized treatment, the benefits of mammography beyond age 79 are too low relative to their costs to justify continued screening. However, if treatment is not ideal, extending screening beyond age 79 could be considered, especially for women in the top 25% of life expectancy for their age.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112oTWjo]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer is a leading cause of premature mortality among US women. Early detection has been shown to be associated with reduced breast cancer morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To update the American Cancer Society (ACS) 2003 breast cancer screening guideline for women at average risk for breast cancer.

Process

The ACS commissioned a systematic evidence review of the breast cancer screening literature to inform the update and a supplemental analysis of mammography registry data to address questions related to the screening interval. Formulation of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence and judgment (incorporating values and preferences) about the balance of benefits and harms.

Evidence Synthesis

Screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs, and inferential evidence supports breast cancer screening for women 70 years and older who are in good health. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk.

Recommendations

The ACS recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (strong recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (qualified recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (qualified recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (qualified recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (qualified recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (qualified recommendation).

Conclusions and Relevance

These updated ACS guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer. These recommendations should be considered by physicians and women in discussions about breast cancer screening.

### Breast screening policy: are we heading in the right direction? [^115Pj4cr]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

There is a large body of evidence supporting 2-yearly screening of women aged 50–69 years. There is good evidence for a mortality reduction from mammographic screening in women aged 40 to 49 years but a 1-year interval is required. The lack of specificity of screening in young women does remain a problem. There is no evidence to suggest that a single screen between the ages of 47 and 50 years within a programme screening at 3-year intervals will reduce mortality; the trials showing a mortality benefit in women in their 40s included multiple screening episodes and shorter screening intervals. There is no randomized, controlled trial evidence to support screening in women aged above 70 years and screening this age group will cause greater harm than in younger women through higher rates of over-diagnosis and consequent over-treatment. The randomized phase of the screening age extension, which at the moment is planned to last only 6 years, should not be immediately followed by general implementation of the policy. Only if and when additional mortality reductions and an acceptable balance between benefit and harms are shown to be achieved by the extra screens should the 2007 Cancer Reform Strategy policy on age extension be implemented. Resources saved by delaying or abandoning the roll-out of the age extension could potentially be redirected towards reducing the current 3 year screening interval to 2 years in women aged 50–69 years. However, reducing the screening interval to 2 years for women aged 50–69 years would require significantly more screening invitations and resources than the proposed age extension.

### Screening for breast cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112MthJP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2002 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for breast cancer in the general population.

Methods

The USPSTF examined the evidence on the efficacy of 5 screening modalities in reducing mortality from breast cancer: film mammography, clinical breast examination, breast self-examination, digital mammography, and magnetic resonance imaging in order to update the 2002 recommendation. To accomplish this update, the USPSTF commissioned 2 studies: 1) a targeted systematic evidence review of 6 selected questions relating to benefits and harms of screening, and 2) a decision analysis that used population modeling techniques to compare the expected health outcomes and resource requirements of starting and ending mammography screening at different ages and using annual versus biennial screening intervals.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends against routine screening mammography in women aged 40 to 49 years. The decision to start regular, biennial screening mammography before the age of 50 years should be an individual one and take into account patient context, including the patient's values regarding specific benefits and harms. (Grade C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women between the ages of 50 and 74 years. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the additional benefits and harms of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography in women 40 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends against clinicians teaching women how to perform breast self-examination. (Grade D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess additional benefits and harms of either digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging instead of film mammography as screening modalities for breast cancer. (I statement).

### The evidence base for breast cancer screening [^1179pXJG]. Preventive Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The history of breast cancer screening is littered with controversy. With 10 trials spanning 4 decades, we have a substantial body of evidence, but with different aims and flaws. Combined analysis of the intention-to-treat results gives an overall relative reduction in breast cancer mortality of 19% (95% CI 12%-26%), which, if adjusted for non-attendance gives an approximate 25% relative reduction for those who attend screening. However, given that 4% of all-cause mortality is due to breast cancer deaths, this translates into a less than 1% reduction in all-cause mortality. An emerging issue in interpretation is the improvements in treatment since these trials recruited women. Modern systemic therapy would have improved survival (models suggest between 12% and 21%) in both screened and non-screened groups, which would result in a lesser difference in absolute risk reduction from screening but probably a similar, or slightly smaller, relative risk reduction. However benefits and harms, particularly over-diagnosis, need to balanced and differ by age-groups. The informed views of recipients of screening are needed to guide current and future policy on screening.

### Effect of messaging on support for breast cancer screening cessation among older US women: a randomized clinical trial [^115d4px2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does a message describing rationales for stopping breast cancer screening affect older women's support for appropriate screening cessation?

Findings

This 2-wave randomized clinical trial of older women (3051 in wave 1, 2796 in wave 2) used an online survey to assess support for stopping screening in a hypothetical patient and self-screening intentions. A message about stopping screening from a clinician significantly increased support for appropriate screening cessation, with stronger effects (ie, an increase from 18% to 47%) when the message was delivered over time from multiple sources.

Meaning

These findings suggest that messaging is a viable strategy for reducing overscreening for breast cancer among older women.

### Women's views on overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening: a qualitative study [^116wxSd8]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Some women said they would still have screening but felt that, if they were subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer, treatment (or at least adjuvant therapies beyond surgery) may not be worth while if overdiagnosis were 50%. Rather than seeing treatment as the immediate logical consequence of a diagnosis, they would want to consider "watchful waiting" or alternative therapies. At the very least, women anticipated having more thorough discussions and desired greater involvement with their doctors to explore all their management options:

"If you were diagnosed you'd really go into what treatment involves.you'd want to make a really informed decision. [but] I probably would still have the breast screens and then make the decision after". (Participant 26, age 55, 3 screens)
"I'll still go [for screening]. Surgery's okay too, but. anything else being needed, any chemicals to be put through my body. then that's where I stop and think and look at the statistics". (Participant 15, age 47, 1 screen)
"It doesn't turn me off the screening, but I would certainly, probably second-think the treatment. Not that I wouldn't get it done, I probably may take a bit longer to think about it". (Participant 16, age 47, 0 screens).

There were suggestions that awareness of overdiagnosis (that is, knowing that not all cancers progress and need treatment) might help newly diagnosed women to feel less afraid and more hopeful about their prognosis. Some participants felt that this knowledge might also give such women more of a sense of control and reduce the pressure to follow a predetermined disease management pathway.

Importantly though, it was also suggested that awareness of overdiagnosis could worsen the experience of having cancer by making women feel less able to cope with the challenges of unpleasant treatment. As such, it was considered perhaps better for the woman concerned to believe the cancer to be life threatening and treatment crucial:

"That 50% is not good information. because if I was told. I've got cancer, I won't want to have in the back of my mind, 'Oh well, it might not be, and I'm going through all this and my family's all going bananas for nothing'. (Participant 42, age 72, 3 screens).

### Effect of messaging on support for breast cancer screening cessation among older US women: a randomized clinical trial [^117S31ch]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Many older women are screened for breast cancer beyond guideline-recommended thresholds. Messaging holds promise to reduce overscreening.

Objective

To investigate the effect of a message on older women's support for and intentions of stopping breast cancer screening.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A 2-wave randomized clinical online survey trial using a nationally representative online panel was performed from May 12 to June 19, 2023. Women 65 years or older without breast cancer were eligible to participate.

Intervention

A pilot-tested breast cancer screening cessation message delivered to a hypothetical older woman with serious illnesses and functional impairment. The message was described as from 1 of 3 sources (clinician, news story, or family member). Participants were randomized into 4 groups: no message (group 1 [control]), a single message from a clinician at wave 1 and no message at wave 2 (group 2), a message from a news story (wave 1) and a clinician (wave 2) (group 3), and a message from a family member (wave 1) and a clinician (wave 2) (group 4).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Support for stopping screening in the hypothetical older woman (primary) and screening intentions for oneself (secondary) were assessed on 7-point scales, with higher values indicating stronger support for and intentions to stop screening. Means were compared using analysis of variance. The message effect on screening intentions among participants 75 years or older and those with life expectancy of less than 10 years were also explored.

Results

A total of 3051 women participated in wave 1 of the trial. The mean (SD) age was 72.8 (5.9) years; 272 (8.9%) were non-Hispanic Black and 2506 (82.1%) were non-Hispanic White. Of these women, 2796 (91.6%) completed wave 2. Group 2 had significantly higher support for screening cessation in the hypothetical patient at wave 2 (mean score, 3.14 [95% CI, 2.99–3.29]) compared with group 1 (mean score, 2.68 [95% CI, 2.54–2.82]; P < .001). The effect was even stronger in group 3 (mean score, 4.23 [95% CI, 4.09–4.38]) and group 4 (mean score, 4.12 [95% CI, 3.97–4.27]) compared with both groups 1 and 2 (all P < .001). Message effects on self-screening intentions followed a similar pattern, with larger effects among participants 75 years or older or with limited life expectancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, a breast cancer screening cessation message significantly increased older women's support for and intentions of screening cessation. The strongest effects were observed when the message was delivered over time from multiple sources. Future work needs to engage potential message sources to examine the feasibility and acceptability of multilevel messaging strategies and their effect on screening behavior.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^112knnfT]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The majority of population-based organised breast screening programmes invite women aged 50–69 years to participate in mammography screening. This is based on evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which show that detection of breast cancer at an early-stage through mammography screening leads to a reduction in breast cancer mortality in this age-group. Evidence for screening women 70–74 years comes mainly from observational and modelling studies and there is limited additional evidence from the RCTs, with some programmes expanding the target age-group for screening to include women up to 74 years of age. For women older than 74 years, there is no trial evidence for the benefits and hence no specific guidance regarding the net health benefits (versus harms) of continuing mammography screening beyond that upper age limit of 74 years. Despite this, data indicate that screening women into their late 70s, 80s and 90s is occurring in practice. In the US, where there is no stipulated upper age limit for breast screening, there are no clear recommendations as to whether to continue or stop mammography screening beyond 75 years of age. The European Commission's recommendations are for biennial screening in women aged 50–69 years and a suggestion of every 2–3 year screening up to age 74 years.

Australia actively recruits women aged 50–74 years for two-yearly (biennial) mammography screening for breast cancer. Prior to 2013–14, the target age-group included women aged 50–69, however this was extended to invite women aged 70–74, based on a recommendation in a programme evaluation report. This report also recommended that women aged 75 years and over should no longer be eligible to attend the programme given limited evidence of health benefits. Nonetheless, currently, women aged 75 years and older can self-select to attend mammography screening. In 2016–2017, 14.4% of women aged 75–79 years, 5.4% of women aged 80–84 years and 1.2% of women aged 85 years and older underwent a screening mammogram despite not being actively invited to screening.

### The WISDOM study: breaking the deadlock in the breast cancer screening debate [^117WD5SD]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Individualized, informed choice

Overwhelmingly, women want information about their personal risk of breast cancer. Currently, only 10% have accurate perceptions of their personal risk and 40% have never discussed their personal breast cancer risk with a doctor. Yet, a realistic view of their risk is prerequisite to making informed screening decisions.

We have the tools to better inform women of their personal risk, through well characterized models that incorporate family history and breast density, endocrine exposures, gene mutations, and atypia, – along with a number of common gene variants. They teach us that not all women whom we classify for screening purposes as "average-risk", actually have the same lifetime risk of breast cancer. Armed with a better understanding of their individual risk, such women will expect — and demand — screening recommendations commensurate with their personal risk.

Unless we are prepared to ignore the modern tools available to us, we are therefore compelled to shepherd breast cancer screening into the era of precision medicine. Now is the time to begin evaluating a patient-centric model, focusing on individually tailored recommendations on when to start, when to stop, and how often to screen, depending upon a woman's personal risk. Only through clinical testing can we establish the evidence that tells us how best to apply risk.

The idea of risk-based screening is not revolutionary. In fact, we already do it, although in a crude fashion. It is standard of practice for high risk women with mutations in the BRCA genes and first degree relatives from high risk families to begin screening at a much earlier age, and to do so more frequently (annual mammogram alternating with annual MRI). But our understanding of breast cancer risk goes much further than our current screening recommendations reflect. Our failure to incorporate our current understanding of personal risk into our screening recommendations means we may be asking some women to accept risk/benefit ratios they might not be comfortable with if they were fully informed.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^115marp3]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite many studies having reported on outcomes of screening women aged 75 and older, findings from this systematic review highlight the limited evidence available from high quality studies to make a recommendation for or against continuing breast screening beyond the age of 75 years. Many of the comparisons used in published studies are not directly informative as far as benefit or harms associated with continuing to screen (as opposed to stopping) beyond 75. Further studies with more informative comparisons, specifically comparing continuing versus stopping screening at 75 years, are required before definitive recommendations can be made.

### Surveillance mammography in older patients with breast cancer-can we ever stop? a review [^1161D484]. JAMA Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Approximately 4% to 5% of breast cancer survivors will develop a new ipsilateral or contralateral cancer (in-breast event) over the 5 years following diagnosis, and annual surveillance mammography is recommended for those with residual breast tissue. The risk for such in-breast events persists over time, though increasing age at cancer diagnosis and treatment with hormonal therapy are associated with lower risk, and most older survivors of breast cancer will ultimately die from nonbreast cancer-related causes. Specific guidelines for surveillance strategies in older patients are limited. Prospective data on the benefits and harms of surveillance mammography in this population are lacking, and most of the evidence is derived from observational, retrospective data, often in the general population.

Observations

We review the current recommendations for breast cancer screening and surveillance for older patients, the current evidence for ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer risks in older survivors of breast cancer, and suggested approaches for discussions about surveillance mammography with older patients. We recommend individualized decision making for surveillance breast imaging in older survivors of breast cancer, with consideration of the following strategy for women 70 years or older: 1-time imaging 6 to 12 months after completion of local therapy followed by annual or biennial surveillance mammography for healthy women and cessation of mammography in patients whose life expectancy is less than 5 years to 10 years, regardless of age. Decisions on mammographic surveillance should also incorporate whether hormonal therapy is being administered, whether a patient's anticipated life expectancy is extraordinary, and whether a patient's individual risk for in-breast events is higher (or lower) than average risk for breast cancer survivors.

Conclusions and Relevance

We propose reframing discussions around surveillance mammography in older breast cancer survivors and to consider cessation while taking into account life expectancy, the estimated risk for subsequent in-breast events, and patient preferences.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111v445a]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Among all US women, breast cancer is the second most common cancer and the second most common cause of cancer death. In 2023, an estimated 43 170 women died of breast cancer. Non-Hispanic White women have the highest incidence of breast cancer and non-Hispanic Black women have the highest mortality rate.

Objective

The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different mammography-based breast cancer screening strategies by age to start and stop screening, screening interval, modality, use of supplemental imaging, or personalization of screening for breast cancer on the incidence of and progression to advanced breast cancer, breast cancer morbidity, and breast cancer-specific or all-cause mortality, and collaborative modeling studies to complement the evidence from the review.

Population

Cisgender women and all other persons assigned female at birth aged 40 years or older at average risk of breast cancer.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that biennial screening mammography in women aged 40 to 74 years has a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older and the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer with breast ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), regardless of breast density.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women 75 years or older. (I statement) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplemental screening for breast cancer using breast ultrasonography or MRI in women identified to have dense breasts on an otherwise negative screening mammogram.

### Current guidelines and gaps in breast cancer screening [^115XETkW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States. Mammography screening is proven to significantly decrease breast cancer mortality, with a 40% or more reduction expected with annual use starting at age 40 for women of average risk. However, less than half of all eligible women have a mammogram annually. The elimination of cost sharing for screening made possible by the Affordable Care Act (2010) encouraged screening but mainly for those already insured. The United States Preventive Services Task Force 2009 guidelines recommended against screening those 40 to 49 years old and have left women over 74 years of age vulnerable to coverage loss. Other populations for whom significant gaps in risk information or screening use exist, including women of lower socioeconomic status, black women, men at higher than average risk of breast cancer, and sexual and gender minorities. Further work is needed to achieve higher rates of screening acceptance for all appropriate individuals so that the full mortality and treatment benefits of mammography screening can be realized.

### Effect of messaging on support for breast cancer screening cessation among older US women: a randomized clinical trial [^117SbDBS]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This is the first national study, to our knowledge, to rigorously test the effects of messaging about breast cancer screening cessation. We found that message exposure increased support for and intentions of stopping screening among older women for whom stopping screening would be appropriate based on age (≥ 75 years) or health (life expectancy of < 10 years), and the effect was greatest when the message was delivered from multiple sources. Although messaging strategies have been used to change other health behaviors, they have not been used to encourage screening cessation to reduce overscreening in older women. These results show that messaging is a viable and potentially effective approach for reducing overscreening.

For a hypothetical older woman with multimorbidity and functional impairment, message exposure increased support for stopping screening by almost 30% (1.4–1.6 points on a 7-point scale). This was achieved with low rates of negative perception of mammograms or negative emotional response. The message effect was appropriately small on participants' own screening intentions since most participants did not meet guideline criteria for stopping screening. The message effect was also appropriately small among participants with higher cancer risk. In the subgroups of women who met guideline criteria for stopping screening, the message effect was larger. Among those 75 years or older or with life expectancy of less than 10 years, the increase in intention to stop screening was 1.0 to 1.2 points on a 7-point scale. This is a sizeable change; in a randomized clinical trial of a breast cancer decision aid among older women, each 1-point change on a 15-point scale of screening intention corresponded with a 10% decrease in screening rate; a 1-point change on a 7-point scale may potentially correspond to a 10% or larger decrease in screening rate but needs to be confirmed in future studies that measure screening behavior. Although these analyses were exploratory, our findings suggest that messaging holds promise to selectively reduce screening in older women for whom it would be appropriate to stop screening without significantly reducing screening in older women who may still benefit.

Our study of the cumulative effects from multiple message exposures on screening was novel. Literature on individualized cancer screening for older adults highlights the importance of multilevel influences. Our findings suggest that while clinicians are an important target for efforts to reduce overscreening, leveraging other information sources may increase impact. Although we found low levels of negative reactions to the message, engaging key partners to devise message delivery can help identify strategies to further minimize undesirable outcomes from messaging.

### Screening for breast cancer [^113WVQLe]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Strong evidence supports the value of breast cancer screening with mammography, and high-quality mammography screening can be considered a major public health achievement. As noted earlier in the discussion about the evaluation of service screening, the group of women who did not participate in mammographic screening in the decades after screening had been introduced had essentially unchanged or only minor improvements in mortality compared with the pattern before the introduction of screening, despite widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Breast cancer should be treated in its preclinical phase if we are to save the lives of women with this disease, and a considerable body of evidence outlines best practices that, with broader adherence, would result in greater breast cancer mortality reductions than have been observed to date.

### Screening for breast cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111EN7pj]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Scope of review — To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the comparative effectiveness of mammography-based screening strategies by age to start and stop screening, screening interval, modality, use of supplemental imaging, or personalization, focusing on outcomes including progression to advanced breast cancer, morbidity, and breast cancer–specific or all-cause mortality. Inclusion required studies to report detection and stage distribution over more than 1 round of screening, and studies reporting only performance characteristics or detection rates were not eligible. The USPSTF also commissioned collaborative modeling from 4 CISNET teams that developed race-specific breast cancer models for Black women to provide information about effectiveness and harms of different screening strategies in Black women.

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^114PTzJb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain screening mammography every 1 or 2 years based on an informed, shared decision-making process including a discussion of the benefits and harms of annual and biennial screening and incorporating patient values and preferences in females at average risk of breast cancer. Consider obtaining biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, to reduce the frequency of harms, as long as patient counseling includes a discussion that with decreased screening comes some reduction in benefits.

### Continuation of annual screening mammography and breast cancer mortality in women older than 70 years [^115uzzRT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized trials have shown that initiating breast cancer screening between ages 50 and 69 years and continuing it for 10 years decreases breast cancer mortality. However, no trials have studied whether or when women can safely stop screening mammography. An estimated 52% of women aged 75 years or older undergo screening mammography in the United States.

Objective

To estimate the effect of breast cancer screening on breast cancer mortality in Medicare beneficiaries aged 70 to 84 years.

Design

Large-scale, population-based, observational study of 2 screening strategies: continuing annual mammography, and stopping screening.

Setting

U.S. Medicare program, 2000 to 2008.

Participants

1 058 013 beneficiaries aged 70 to 84 years who had a life expectancy of at least 10 years, had no previous breast cancer diagnosis, and underwent screening mammography.

Measurements

Eight-year breast cancer mortality, incidence, and treatments, plus the positive predictive value of screening mammography by age group.

Results

In women aged 70 to 74 years, the estimated difference in 8-year risk for breast cancer death between continuing and stopping screening was -1.0 (95% CI, -2.3 to 0.1) death per 1000 women (hazard ratio, 0.78 [CI, 0.63 to 0.95]) (a negative risk difference favors continuing). In those aged 75 to 84 years, the corresponding risk difference was 0.07 (CI, -0.93 to 1.3) death per 1000 women (hazard ratio, 1.00 [CI, 0.83 to 1.19]).

Limitations

The available Medicare data permit only 8 years of follow-up after screening. As with any study using observational data, the estimates could be affected by residual confounding.

Conclusion

Continuing annual breast cancer screening past age 75 years did not result in substantial reductions in 8-year breast cancer mortality compared with stopping screening.

### Screening mammography in older women: a review [^116FTBAX]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend individualizing screening mammography decisions for women aged 75 years and older. However, little pragmatic guidance is available to help counsel patients.

Objective

To provide an evidence-based approach for individualizing decision-making about screening mammography in older women.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched PubMed for English-language studies in peer-reviewed journals published from January 1, 1990, to February 1, 2014, to identify risk factors for late-life breast cancer in women aged 65 years and older and to quantify the benefits and harms of screening mammography for women aged 75 years and older.

Findings

Age is the major risk factor for developing and dying from breast cancer. Breast cancer risk factors that reflect hormonal exposures in the distant past, such as age at first birth or age at menarche, are less predictive of late-life breast cancer than factors indicating recent hormonal exposures such as high bone mass or obesity. Randomized trials of the benefits of screening mammography did not include women older than 74 years. Thus it is not known if screening mammography benefits older women. Observational studies favor extending screening mammography to older women who have a life expectancy of more than 10 years. Modeling studies estimate 2 fewer breast cancer deaths/1000 women who in their 70s continue biennial screening for 10 years instead of stopping screening at age 69. Potential harms of continued screening over 10 years include false-positive mammograms in approximately 200/1000 women screened and overdiagnosis (ie, finding breast cancer that would not have clinically surfaced otherwise) in approximately 13/1000 women screened. Providing information about life expectancy along with potential benefits and harms of screening may help older women's decision-making about screening mammography.

Conclusions and Relevance

For women with less than a 10-year life expectancy, recommendations to stop screening mammography should emphasize increased potential harms from screening and highlight health promotion measures likely to be beneficial over the short term. For women with a life expectancy of more than 10 years, deciding whether potential benefits of screening outweigh harms becomes a value judgment for patients, requiring a realistic understanding of screening outcomes.

### Start mammograms at 40, not 50, USPSTF suggests [^114xeP6c]. Cancer Discovery (2023). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has proposed changing the recommended age for women to begin getting routine breast cancer screenings from 50 to 40. In new draft recommendations, the task force says the shift was driven by new data showing persistent racial disparities in breast cancer death rates, as well as rising diagnoses among younger women.

Objective

Screening mammography has been widely used for breast cancer detection and has been found to decrease mortality, but debate continues. The purpose of this article is to review screening recommendations and the benefits and perceived harms of earlier and more frequent screening.

Conclusion

Annual mammography beginning at age 40 decreases mortality. Clinicians should educate women and preserve recommendations for early and annual screening.

CURRENT SCREENING GUIDELINES

The uncertainty is reflected in the variation in current guidelines among countries for screening women below 50 years for breast cancer. A summary of guidelines used in 22 countries, from a survey conducted in 1995 by the International Breast Screening Network, reported that while a majority of countries or pilot projects had a lower age limit of 50 years, a number involved a lower limit of 40 years, although in countries such as Sweden and Australia policy can vary by county or state. Japan, which does not use mammography, reported a lower age limit of 30 years. In Sweden, the recommended screening interval is 1.5 years for women aged 40–49 years compared with 2 years for those aged 50 years and above. In the US, the recommendation (updated in February 2002) from the US Preventive Services Task Force is for 'screening mammography with or without clinical breast examination' (CBE) every 1 or 2 years for women aged 40 years and above. The age range was extended below 50 years despite the finding that 'the strongest evidence of benefit and reduced mortality is among women aged 50–69 years'. The US National Cancer Institute continues to recommend mammography for women in their 40s and older, while the American Cancer Society recommends 'yearly mammograms' (plus CBE) starting at 40 years. In 2001, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care concluded that 'upon reaching the age of 40 years, Canadian women should be informed of the potential benefits and risks of screening mammography and assisted in deciding at what age they wish to initiate the manoeuvre'.

The IARC Handbook of Cancer Prevention on breast cancer screening, published in 2002, concluded that the marginal cost-effectiveness of expanding a programme to younger women (aged 40–49 years) greatly depends on its effect on reducing breast cancer mortality as estimated from randomised controlled trials, 'and that it is likely to be more cost-effective to make other changes'.

Recommendations of other organizations for breast cancer screening — The American Cancer Society "recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years" and "suggests that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually", that those "55 years or older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually", may "begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years", and should continue "as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer". The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists "recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 years", and if not initiated in their 40s, "by no later than age 50 years", with screening "every 1 or 2 years" and continued "until at least age 75 years", with decisions "Beyond age 75 years" based on shared decision-making. The American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging "recommend annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years for women at average risk", advise continuing "past age 74 years, without an upper age limit, unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy", and the American College of Radiology "also recommends breast cancer risk assessment by age 25 years for all individuals".

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^117XwTA4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death in American women (1). Regular screening mammography starting at age 40 years reduces breast cancer mortality in average-risk women (2). Screening, however, also exposes women to harm through false-positive test results and overdiagnosis of biologically indolent lesions. Differences in balancing benefits and harms have led to differences among major guidelines about what age to start, what age to stop, and how frequently to recommend mammography screening in average-risk women (2–4). Breast cancer risk assessment is very important for identifying women who may benefit from more intensive breast cancer surveillance; however, there is no standardized approach to office-based breast cancer risk assessment in the United States. This can lead to missed opportunities to identify women at high risk of breast cancer and may result in applying average-risk screening recommendations to high-risk women. Risk assessment and identification of women at high risk allow for referral to health care providers with expertise in cancer genetics counseling and testing for breast cancer-related germline mutations (eg, BRCA), patient counseling about risk-reduction options, and cascade testing to identify family members who also may be at increased risk. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to discuss breast cancer risk assessment, review breast cancer screening guidelines in average-risk women, and outline some of the controversies surrounding breast cancer screening. It will present recommendations for using a framework of shared decision making to assist women in balancing their personal values regarding benefits and harms of screening at various ages and intervals to make personal screening choices from within a range of reasonable options. Recommendations for women at elevated risk and discussion of new technologies, such as tomosynthesis, are beyond the scope of this document and are addressed in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (5–7).

### Breast cancer screening: common questions and answers [^113AKxYP]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and accounts for 30% of all new cancers in the United States. The highest incidence of breast cancer is in women 70 to 74 years of age. Numerous risk factors are associated with the development of breast cancer. A risk assessment tool can be used to determine individual risk and help guide screening decisions. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend against teaching average-risk women to perform breast self-examinations. The USPSTF and AAFP recommend biennial screening mammography for average-risk women 50 to 74 years of age. However, there is no strong evidence supporting a net benefit of mammography screening in average-risk women 40 to 49 years of age; therefore, the USPSTF and AAFP recommend individualized decision-making in these women. For average-risk women 75 years and older, the USPSTF and AAFP conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society state that screening may continue depending on the woman's health status and life expectancy. Women at high risk of breast cancer may benefit from mammography starting at 30 years of age or earlier, with supplemental screening such as magnetic resonance imaging. Supplemental ultrasonography in women with dense breasts increases cancer detection but also false-positive results.

BREAST CANCER SCREENING

Screening for Breast Cancer: An Update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force

What was known?.

Breast cancer accounts for almost 1 in 4 cancers in U.S. women, and screening mammography reduces breast cancer mortality. However, when to start screening mammography remains controversial. A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in 2002 showed a 15% relative risk reduction among women aged 40–49; however, only one of the included trials was specifically designed to address this issue. Additionally, the analysis did not provide a comprehensive review of the harms associated with screening mammography. Questions also remained about the effectiveness of mammography in older women, and the utility of clinical and self breast exams.

What these studies add.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force updated the 2002 meta-analysis regarding mammography benefit in women aged 40–49 to include two new sources of data. Pooling these data with those from the previous meta-analysis resulted in a 15% relative risk reduction (95%CI 0.75–0.96) in breast cancer mortality among women aged 40–49 years. However, this was balanced with a high number needed to invite to prevent one breast cancer death (1904: 95%CI 929–6378) and a high false positive rate in this age group (97.8 per 1000 screened). Evidence was insufficient regarding the benefits of mammography in women older than 70 and the clinical breast exam; breast self-exam did not have any net benefit. A model of the effectiveness of various mammographic screening strategies for reducing breast cancer mortalityfound that the most efficient models initiated screening at age 50 with a biennial interval. Starting screening at age 40 reduced breast cancer mortality by an additional 3% but resulted in more false-positives, whereas biennial screening over the age of 50 retained 81% of the benefit achieved with annual screening.

How should I change my practice?.

Screening mammography for women aged 40–49 should not be reflexive. Biennial screening retains the same benefits as annual screening and should be recommended for women over 50 years. The benefits of clinical breast exam, and of mammography in women over 70 years, remain inconclusive.

### Personalising therapy for early-stage oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in older women [^112VfMPy]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

Screening

The US Preventative Services Task Force guidelines do not recommend screening beyond the age of 74 years because of the scarcity of evidence from randomised controlled trials on the benefits of screening mammography in this older population. With the exception of the Swedish Two-County trial that invited women to screen every 33 months up to the age of 74 years, randomised controlled trials to date have not included women older than 70 years. However, there are compelling data on screening in older women from the American College of Radiology's National Mammography Database that show reductions in false positives and increases in both cancer detection rates and the positive predictive value of biopsies done at increased ages, even beyond the age of 90 years. Mammographically detected cancers in women aged 75 years or older were much more likely to be diagnosed at a lower stage in several studies: only 12% of those assessed were node-positive at diagnosis compared with 38% of those clinically detected in the series of Malmgren and colleagues, and 11% of older women with screen-detected cancers had axillary metastases, as reported by Destounis and colleagues.

There is an approximately 10-year delay in observing any benefit in breast cancer mortality from screening mammography. Instead of using 74 years of age as a screening termination target, national guidelines suggest stopping screening when the patient is no longer in good health (Society of Breast Imaging, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and American Society of Breast Surgeons) or has a life expectancy of less than 10 years (American Cancer Society). Even the healthiest quartile of women older than 85 years has less than 10 years of life expectancy. An analysis of outcomes in women older than 65 years found that, even after correcting for prognostic index and potential confounders, breast cancer screening was associated with reduced all-cause mortality. This screening benefit was attenuated but persisted in women with reduced cognition. The authors of this analysis suggest that current algorithms might misclassify individuals as having a low life expectancy, resulting in cessation of screening that is inappropriately premature. Similar to these national guidelines, EUSOMA–SIOG recommend stopping screening after 75 years of age.

Taken together, a detailed geriatric and life expectancy assessment in conjunction with patient preferences should guide decision making for continued screening. Clinicians should make every effort to rely on validated measures to estimate remaining life expectancy (eg, ePrognosis) and the potential benefits of continued screening. Screening after the age of 74 years can be effectively stopped, as per multiple society guidelines including the recent EUSOMA–SIOG recommendations.

Age to start or stop screening — The USPSTF did not identify any randomized clinical trials designed to test the comparative effectiveness of different ages to start or stop screening that reported morbidity, mortality, or quality-of-life outcomes. An emulation study reported that continued screening between the ages of 70 and 79 years was associated with a 22% decrease in the risk of breast cancer mortality compared with cessation at age 70 years, although the trial emulation study found no difference in the hazard ratio or absolute rates of breast cancer mortality with continued screening vs discontinued screening from ages 70 to 79 years across 80 to 84 years.

### The benefits and harms of breast cancer screening: an independent review [^117HDLr2]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

1.5 The balance of benefit and harm

The panel estimates that an invitation to breast screening delivers about a 20% reduction in breast cancer mortality. For the UK screening programmes, this currently corresponds to about 1300 deaths from breast cancer being prevented each year, or equivalently about 22 000 years of life being saved. However, this benefit must be balanced against the harms of screening, especially the risk of overdiagnosis. In the panel's view, overdiagnosed cancers certainly occur, but the frequency in a screening programme of 20 years duration is unknown. Estimates from trials of shorter duration suggest overdiagnosis of about 11% as a proportion of breast cancer incidence during the screening period and for the remainder of the woman's lifetime, or equivalently about 19% as a proportion of cancers diagnosed during the screening period. Any excess mortality stemming from the investigation and treatment of breast cancer is considered by the panel to be small and considerably outweighed by the benefits of treatment. Some other harms, including increased anxiety and discomfort caused by screening, are also acknowledged.

Notionally, for 10 000 women invited to screening, from age 50 for 20 years, it is estimated that 681 cancers (invasive and DCIS) will be diagnosed, of which 129 will represent overdiagnosis (using the 19% estimate of overdiagnosis) and 43 deaths from breast cancer will be prevented.

Given that the treatment for breast cancer has improved, is screening no longer relevant? The panel's view is that the benefits of screening and those of better treatments are reasonably considered independent. Uncertainty about possible interaction between the benefits of screening and of contemporary treatments is not a reason for stopping breast screening.

The panel was not asked to comment on costs, both of interventions and the consequences of overdiagnosis. With accurate figures an estimate of cost-benefit could be made and compared with other interventions, but would be a significant piece of work in its own right.

An individual woman cannot know whether she is one of the numbers who will benefit or be harmed from screening. If she chooses to be screened, it should be in the knowledge that she is accepting the chance of benefit, having her life extended, knowing that there is also a risk of overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Similarly, a woman who declines the invitation to screening needs to recognise that she runs a slightly higher risk of dying from breast cancer.

### What should I know about stopping routine cancer screening? [^112bNFFr]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Zhang GY, Incze MA. What Should I Know About Stopping Routine Cancer Screening. JAMA Intern Med. 2023; 183:

500. doi:
10. 1001/jamainternmed.
2023. 0088. Cancer screening is a test performed on people without symptoms to detect certain types of cancer. For example, screening mammography looks for breast cancer. Guidelines on when to start and stop cancer screening are based on evidence from clinical studies of the benefits and harms of screening, the age at which specific cancers tend to occur, how fast cancers progress, and personal health factors. Screening tests are repeated at specific intervals. The recommended interval depends on age, medical history, family history, the type of test performed, and the results of previous screening tests. Only certain types of cancer have approved screening tests. Cancer screening tests are not perfect. Test results may suggest cancer when there is none.

They can also miss cancer even if it is present. False-positive results can lead to emotional stress and more testing without improving health. Screening tests may also lead to overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis is when screening tests find slow-growing forms of cancer that would never have caused symptoms or affected health if left undetected. Overdiagnosis can lead to emotional stress and unnecessary and potentially harmful testing and treatment. Other harms are associated with undergoing certain cancer screening tests. For example, radiation from computed tomographic scans to screen for lung cancer can slightly increase cancer risk. Screening tests such as colonoscopy may cause bleeding, pain, or complications from anesthesia. As people age, the risk of getting life-threatening forms of certain cancers decreases. The risk of serious adverse effects from some cancer screening tests increases.

Many cancers, including breast and colon cancers, tend to be less aggressive and grow more slowly in older persons. Early detection of these cancers is less likely to benefit people after a certain age or if someone has a serious medical illness. Many research studies on cancer screening have not included people older than 75 years. There is no strong evidence that the benefits of screening outweigh the harms in this group. The decision to stop routine cancer screening is often based on age and health status. Each cancer screening test includes an age cutoff. Often this age is 75 years. After this age, screening is no longer recommended for most people. People with life-limiting medical conditions may stop cancer screening earlier than age 75 years.

### A systematic assessment of benefits and risks to guide breast cancer screening decisions [^1169MUdZ]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among US women. Mammography screening may be associated with reduced breast cancer mortality but can also cause harm. Guidelines recommend individualizing screening decisions, particularly for younger women.

Objectives

We reviewed the evidence on the mortality benefit and chief harms of mammography screening and what is known about how to individualize mammography screening decisions, including communicating risks and benefits to patients.

Evidence Acquisition

We searched MEDLINE from 1960–2014 to describe (1) benefits of mammography, (2) harms of mammography, and (3) individualizing screening decisions and promoting informed decision making. We also manually searched reference lists of key articles retrieved, selected reviews, meta-analyses, and practice recommendations. We rated the level of evidence using the American Heart Association guidelines.

Results

Mammography screening is associated with a 19% overall reduction of breast cancer mortality (approximately 15% for women in their 40s and 32% for women in their 60s). For a 40- or 50-year-old woman undergoing 10 years of annual mammograms, the cumulative risk of a false-positive result is about 61%. About 19% of the cancers diagnosed during that 10-year period would not have become clinically apparent without screening (overdiagnosis), although there is uncertainty about this estimate. The net benefit of screening depends greatly on baseline breast cancer risk, which should be incorporated into screening decisions. Decision aids have the potential to help patients integrate information about risks and benefits with their own values and priorities, although they are not yet widely available for use in clinical practice.

Conclusions and Relevance

To maximize the benefit of mammography screening, decisions should be individualized based on patients' risk profiles and preferences. Risk models and decision aids are useful tools, but more research is needed to optimize these and to further quantify overdiagnosis. Research should also explore other breast cancer screening strategies.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^113GNvjf]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening — women at average risk: The ACS endorses beginning annual screening mammography at age 45 years and transitioning to biennial screening at age 55 years, while retaining the option to continue annual screening. The guideline development committee (GDC) recommends that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually, that women aged 40 to 44 years who choose to be screened should do so annually, and that women aged 55 and older should transition to biennial screening but also have the opportunity to continue screening annually. The GDC concluded that women aged 40 to 44 years should have the choice to begin screening mammography at age 40 years or before age 45 years, based on their preferences and their consideration of the trade-offs.

### Women 75 years old or older: to screen or not to screen? [^117LfpNJ]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with the incidence rising substantially with age. Older women are a vulnerable population at increased risk of developing and dying from breast cancer. However, women aged 75 years and older were excluded from all randomized controlled screening trials, so the best available data regarding screening benefits and risks in this age group are from observational studies and modeling predictions. Benefits of screening in older women are the same as those in younger women: early detection of smaller lower-stage cancers, resulting in less invasive treatment and lower morbidity and mortality. Mammography performs significantly better in older women with higher sensitivity, specificity, cancer detection rate, and positive predictive values, accompanied by lower recall rates and false positives. The overdiagnosis rate is low, with benefits outweighing risks until age 90 years. Although there are conflicting national and international guidelines about whether to continue screening mammography in women beyond age 74 years, clinicians can use shared decision making to help women make decisions about screening and fully engage them in the screening process. For women aged 75 years and older in good health, continuing annual screening mammography will save the most lives. An informed discussion of the benefits and risks of screening mammography in older women needs to include each woman's individual values, overall health status, and comorbidities. This article will review the benefits, risks, and controversies surrounding screening mammography in women 75 years old and older and compare the current recommendations for screening this population from national and international professional organizations. © RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available through the Online Learning Center.

### Should women under 50 be screened for breast cancer? [^1175eRpz]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Despite some controversy in recent years, the majority of experts agree on the evidence for effectiveness of breast screening by mammography for women aged 50 years and above, but for those under 50 years, the picture is much less clear. However, the issue remains of importance both to policy makers and to individual women; although the incidence of breast cancer is lower at younger ages, the life years lost due to cancers diagnosed below 50 years amount to a third of all those lost due to the disease.

### When would you screen this 39-year-old woman for breast cancer? Grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^115oW3EV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Screening mammography, which aims to detect asymptomatic breast cancers at earlier and more intervenable stages, has reduced breast cancer mortality, but not overall mortality, in randomized trials. As of 2024, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force now recommends biennial screening mammography for women aged 40 to 74 years (grade B recommendation). In these rounds, 2 experts, the first a primary care physician and member of the Task Force and the second an epidemiologist and family practitioner, debate this recommendation in the context of Ms. R, a 39-year-old woman. They discuss the benefits and harms of breast cancer screening, the ideal age and frequency at which to conduct screening, and the key points to include when having a conversation with a patient about breast cancer screening.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112SjnVL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society breast cancer screening guideline (2015) for average-risk women — Women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation), and women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation), and should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The target population is women at average risk — women without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age.

### Screening mammography: proven benefit, continued controversy [^111V4SjB]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Screening mammography, despite its limitations, remains the best means for diagnosing breast cancer in asymptomatic women. Regarding the continuing controversies concerning the age at which screening should start, evidence supports beginning regular screening at age 40 in women at average risk. Similarly, evidence suggests that the screening interval should be yearly, especially in younger women. Rather than an arbitrary age at which screening should stop, the decision on screening elderly women should be made on an individual basis, taking into account level of health and life expectancy. More work needs to be done on determining the optimum screening strategies for high-risk women. As to the interpretation of screening mammography, a certain level of observer variability and of false-negative and false-positive readings are inherent in the process. These should be kept to a minimum through efforts by the interpreting radiologist to improve performance through auditing of individual results and continuing education. The impact of double reading and computer-aided detection in the interpretation of screening mammograms warrants further evaluation in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Despite these continuing controversies, mortality from breast cancer in the United States has been decreasing steadily for the past 25 years. The magnitude of the decrease has been reported to range from 8% to 25%. Although some of this decrease may be attributable to improvements in the treatment of breast cancer, early detection through screening mammography has undoubtedly played a role in this mortality reduction. The controversies that surround the issue of screening should not detract from the fact that screening mammography has proved to save lives.

### Shared decision-making for supporting women's decisions about breast cancer screening [^114Vygcd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In breast cancer screening programmes, women may have discussions with a healthcare provider to help them decide whether or not they wish to join the breast cancer screening programme. This process is called shared decision-making (SDM) and involves discussions and decisions based on the evidence and the person's values and preferences. SDM is becoming a recommended approach in clinical guidelines, extending beyond decision aids. However, the overall effect of SDM in women deciding to participate in breast cancer screening remains uncertain.

Objectives

To assess the effect of SDM on women's satisfaction, confidence, and knowledge when deciding whether to participate in breast cancer screening.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 8 August 2023. We also screened abstracts from two relevant conferences from 2020 to 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs assessing interventions targeting various components of SDM. The focus was on supporting women aged 40 to 75 at average or above-average risk of breast cancer in their decision to participate in breast cancer screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and conducted data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and GRADE assessment of the certainty of the evidence. Review outcomes included satisfaction with the decision-making process, confidence in the decision made, knowledge of all options, adherence to the chosen option, women's involvement in SDM, woman-clinician communication, and mental health.

Main Results

We identified 19 studies with 64,215 randomised women, mostly with an average to moderate risk of breast cancer. Two studies covered all aspects of SDM; six examined shortened forms of SDM involving communication on risks and personal values; and 11 focused on enhanced communication of risk without other SDM aspects. SDM involving all components compared to control The two eligible studies did not assess satisfaction with the SDM process or confidence in the decision. Based on a single study, SDM showed uncertain effects on participant knowledge regarding the age to start screening (risk ratio (RR) 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 2.28; 133 women; very low certainty evidence) and frequency of testing (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.04; 133 women; very low certainty evidence). Other review outcomes were not measured. Abbreviated forms of SDM with clarification of values and preferences compared to control Of the six included studies, none evaluated satisfaction with the SDM process. These interventions may reduce conflict in the decision made, based on two measures, Decisional Conflict Scale scores (mean difference (MD) -1.60, 95% CI -4.21 to 0.87; conflict scale from 0 to 100; 4 studies; 1714 women; very low certainty evidence) and the proportion of women with residual conflict compared to control at one to three months' follow-up (rate of women with a conflicted decision, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.99; 1 study; 1001 women, very low certainty evidence). Knowledge of all options was assessed through knowledge scores and informed choice. The effect of SDM may enhance knowledge (MDs ranged from 0.47 to 1.44 higher scores on a scale from 0 to 10; 5 studies; 2114 women; low certainty evidence) and may lead to higher rates of informed choice (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.63; 4 studies; 2449 women; low certainty evidence) compared to control at one to three months' follow-up. These interventions may result in little to no difference in anxiety (MD 0.54, 95% -0.96 to 2.14; scale from 20 to 80; 2 studies; 749 women; low certainty evidence) and the number of women with worries about cancer compared to control at four to six weeks' follow-up (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.06; 1 study, 639 women; low certainty evidence). Other review outcomes were not measured. Enhanced communication about risks without other SDM aspects compared to control Of 11 studies, three did not report relevant outcomes for this review, and none assessed satisfaction with the SDM process. Confidence in the decision made was measured by decisional conflict and anticipated regret of participating in screening or not. These interventions, without addressing values and preferences, may result in lower confidence in the decision compared to regular communication strategies at two weeks' follow-up (MD 2.89, 95% CI -2.35 to 8.14; Decisional Conflict Scale from 0 to 100; 2 studies; 1191 women; low certainty evidence). They may result in higher anticipated regret if participating in screening (MD 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.41) and lower anticipated regret if not participating in screening (MD -0.28, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.14). These interventions increase knowledge (MD 1.14, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.62; scale from 0 to 10; 4 studies; 2510 women; high certainty evidence), while it is unclear if there is a higher rate of informed choice compared to regular communication strategies at two to four weeks' follow-up (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.92; 2 studies; 1805 women; low certainty evidence). These interventions result in little to no difference in anxiety (MD 0.33, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.99; scale from 20 to 80) and depression (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.45; scale from 0 to 21; 2 studies; 1193 women; high certainty evidence) and lower cancer worry compared to control (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.08; scale from 1 to 4; 1 study; 838 women; high certainty evidence). Other review outcomes were not measured.

Authors' Conclusions

Studies using abbreviated forms of SDM and other forms of enhanced communications indicated improvements in knowledge and reduced decisional conflict. However, uncertainty remains about the effect of SDM on supporting women's decisions. Most studies did not evaluate outcomes considered important for this review topic, and those that did measured different concepts. High-quality randomised trials are needed to evaluate SDM in diverse cultural settings with a focus on outcomes such as women's satisfaction with choices aligned to their values.

### Mammographic screening in older women: when is It time to stop? [^116bMxHF]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Mammographic screening guidelines in women aged 75 and older are inconsistent due to a lack of data from prospective randomized controlled trials, such as those that exist for women between 40–74 years of age. In addition, older women are perceived as less likely to benefit from early detection due to increased comorbidities and a greater proportion of biologically favorable cancers. With increasing life expectancy and quality of life in the elderly, the question of when to stop mammographic screening merits renewed discussion. Observational data support a survival benefit from regular screening in older women with no severe comorbidities. In addition, screening mammography in this age group has been shown to perform better than in younger age groups, tipping the balance toward greater benefits than harms. Early studies of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in older women suggest that performance metrics are further improved with DBT screening. While a biennial schedule in older women preserves some of the benefit of screening, annual mammography achieves the greatest reductions in breast cancer mortality and morbidity. As the medical community strives to offer personalized care for all age groups, health care providers are well positioned to offer shared decision-making based on existing data and tailored to each woman's individual risk profile, comorbid conditions, and personal values.

### Overestimated lead times in cancer screening has led to substantial underestimation of overdiagnosis [^113FVd6W]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Overdiagnosis can be measured accurately in a randomised trial with lifelong follow-up if people are assigned to a screening or control group for as long as screening would be offered in practice. In the absence of overdiagnosis, the initial increase in cancers in the screened age groups would be fully compensated for by a similar decrease in cancers among older age groups, who are no longer offered screening. Overdiagnosed cancers are the absolute difference in the number of cancers detected during the lifetime of the two groups, provided the control group is not screened.

A good approximation to the ideal trial is studying any compensatory drop in the incidence of breast cancer among older, previously screened women. All extra cancers detected during screening (the incidence increase when screening multiplied by women at risk) minus the reduction of cancers during the compensatory drop (the incidence decline after screening has stopped multiplied by the women at risk) is the absolute number of overdiagnosed cancers. This number should be compared with all cancers detected during screening, and in this way overdiagnosis can be estimated without using lead time. We used this method in a systematic review and found 52% overdiagnosis for screening mammography. Alternatively, the life-time risk of overdiagnosis can be calculated by including all cancers, also all those detected after screening stopped. Most researchers add cancers detected in a 5–15 years period after screening has stopped, arguing that this is a sufficient adjustment for lead time. Here we discuss how clinical lead time can be estimated and how adjustment for clinical and model-based lead times gives fundamentally different estimates of overdiagnosis.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: a recommendation from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative [^114jW2nH]. WPSI (2024). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for breast cancer screening emphasize shared decision-making and equity: "Decisions regarding when to initiate screening, how often to screen, and when to stop screening should be based on a periodic shared decision-making process involving the woman and her health care clinician". "The shared decision-making process assists women in making informed decisions and includes, but is not limited to, a discussion about the benefits and harms of screening, an assessment of the woman's values and preferences, and consideration of factors such as life expectancy, comorbidities, and health status". "Discussion and education related to screening should be culturally and linguistically congruent, particularly for patients experiencing health inequities". For higher-risk individuals, "Women considered at high risk of breast cancer (eg, previous diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer, known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, previous high-dose radiation to the chest) may require additional testing and closer follow-up, which are beyond the scope of this recommendation".

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: a recommendation from the Women's Preventive Services Initiative [^1167BzSG]. WPSI (2024). High credibility.

Breast cancer screening in women at average risk — research priorities include mammography screening with health outcomes for women aged 75 years and older. Additional priorities include comparative effectiveness trials of different screening modalities and screening intervals on health outcomes for women at various levels of breast cancer risk, evaluation of the impact of shared decision making on when to start and stop screening, examination of contributors to disparities in screening and barriers to follow-up care, and assessment of the effectiveness of education and engagement approaches to increase screening for patients at risk of health disparities.

### Breast cancer screening: ACP releases guidance… [^116ehGkf]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- The most significant breast cancer screening benefit for women at average risk is from biennial mammograms from 50 to 74 years of age, which can decrease breast cancer–related deaths without affecting overall longevity.
- Annual mammogram screening increases false-positive results by 45% with little to no difference in outcomes.
- Starting screening at age 40 has a small effect on breast cancer mortality at the cost of increasing false-positive results by more than 60%.
- There is no mortality benefit to screening women 75 years or older or with a life expectancy less than 10 years because screening benefits are not seen for 11 years. Breast cancer screening annually has little to no difference in breast cancer mortality compared with biennial screening. False-positive results are common even in biennial screening.

For 1, 000 women screened from 50 to 74 years of age, seven breast cancer deaths will be prevented at the cost of 953 false-positive screens, 146 unnecessary biopsies will be performed, and 19 cancers will be overdiagnosed that would not have affected the patient. Annual screening increases false-positive results by 45%. AGE 40 TO 49 YEARS Women 40 to 49 years of age should discuss the decision to screen for breast cancer with their clinician. For most women, the harms outweigh the benefits of screening for breast cancer with mammography. If 1, 000 women are screened from 40 to 74 years of age, one additional breast cancer death will be prevented at the cost of 576 additional false-positive screens, 67 additional unnecessary biopsies, and two cancers will be overdiagnosed compared with screening from 50 to 74 years of age.

AGE 75 OR OLDER OR LIFE EXPECTANCY LESS THAN 10 YEARS Women 75 years or older or who have a life expectancy of 10 years or less should not be screened for breast cancer. Older age, comorbid conditions that reduce life expectancy, and the patient value of the balance of benefits and harms are all reasons to discontinue breast cancer screening for this age group. ALL AGES Clinical breast examination should not be used to screen for breast cancer. Evidence does not show a breast cancer mortality benefit from clinical breast examination alone or in combination with mammography. Overdiagnosis and false-positive results can lead to overtreatment, which increases patient harm. Similarly, self-breast examination does not improve breast cancer outcomes and increases false-positive rates.

### Factors influencing elderly women's mammography screening decisions: implications for counseling [^115R8jDn]. BMC Geriatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There is great heterogeneity in health among older women leading to substantial differences in life expectancy. For instance, women aged 80–84 in the top quartile of health have 13 years of life expectancy while women aged 80–84 in the lowest quartile of health have only 4.6 years of life expectancy. Meanwhile, experts generally agree that a woman needs 5 to even 10 years of life expectancy to potentially benefit from mammography screening. Benefits of mammography screening among older women include possibly prolonging life or preventing morbidity associated with advanced breast cancer. However, potential risks include complications and anxiety related to finding and treating breast cancers that would never have become clinically significant in an older woman's lifespan. Therefore, guidelines recommend that clinicians consider older women's life expectancy and comorbidities before recommending mammography screening. Increasingly more women aged 80 and older are undergoing mammography screening and evidence suggests it is not being targeted to the oldest women in the best health and most likely to benefit.

To better understand elderly women's mammography screening decisions, we interviewed women aged 80 and older and physicians who cared for these women using qualitative methods. In that study, we developed a conceptual framework of the factors that influence mammography screening decisions of women aged 80 and older, including: 1) Patient factors (e.g. risk perception, habit, history of breast disease, etc.); 2) System factors (e.g. access, mailed reminders); 3) Social Influences (e.g. daughter's encouragement, family/friends' experience with breast cancer); and 4) Physician influences. We also found that physicians feel uncomfortable discussing stopping screening with women aged 80 and older. Since qualitative data cannot be used to determine the prevalence of attitudes or beliefs in a population and since qualitative methods do not allow for statistical comparisons between groups, we designed a telelphone survey to determine which factors identified in our qualitative study were most important to older women's mammography screening decisions. We were most interested in factors that influence elderly women to choose screening since these factors may need to be addressed before elderly women can feel comfortable stopping screening. We compared responses for women aged 80 and older with women aged 65–79 to see if certain factors need to be specifically addressed among the oldest women. In addition, we examined whether older women preferred that their physician make the decision whether or not they should get sreened or whether they preferred to make the decision on their own or share the decision with their physician.

Harms of screening for breast cancer — Potential harms include false-positive and false-negative results, need for additional imaging and biopsy, overdiagnosis, and radiation exposure, with the most common harm being a false-positive result that can lead to psychological harms such as anxiety or breast cancer–specific worry and to additional testing and invasive follow-up procedures without the potential for benefit.

### Randomized trial of information for older women about cessation of breast cancer screening invitations [^115h9Cf1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Finally, there are ongoing discussions around what thresholds should be set to define an informed choice. Our sensitivity analyses showed that the overall main effects remained significant with different thresholds. Using a threshold of below 30 on the attitudes scale as "less positive screening attitudes" due to the high within-sample median is justified in the context of this study. The public has well-documented strong positive attitudes toward cancer screening, which are particularly influential in older adults' cancer screening decisions, (likely due to a longer period of exposure to persuasive screening messaging). Scoring less than the maximum score on this scale may in fact have clinical significance.

### Why do older adults stop cancer screening? Findings from the Medicare current beneficiary survey [^114dpaUL]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prostate and breast cancer screening are prevalent among older adults, even among those unlikely to benefit. We aimed to evaluate why older adults stop cancer screening, including the role of physician recommendations.

Methods

We used nationally representative data from the 2019 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). We included women aged 76 and older without a history of breast cancer and men aged 71 and older without a history of prostate cancer. The primary outcome was reason for discontinuing screening, categorized as follows: (1) physician recommendation against screening; (2) absence of a recommendation to screen; and (3) patient-driven reason, such as patient preferences or beliefs. We evaluated reasons for screening discontinuation by health status and educational attainment using age-stratified multinomial logistic regression.

Results

The sample included 7350 participants representing a weighted population of 22,498,715. Overall, 53% of women underwent screening mammography in the past year or intended to continue screening. Among those who stopped screening, 5% reported a recommendation to stop screening from their doctor, 48% reported no recommendation, and 32% reported a patient-driven reason for cessation. Findings did not differ by educational attainment or health status, including among the oldest patients. For men, 61% were screened with PSA in the past year or intended to continue. Among those who stopped, 3% reported a recommendation against screening, 54% reported no recommendation, and 27% reported a patient-driven reason for cessation. Men with higher educational attainment were more likely to report that their physician recommended against screening (4% vs. 1%, p = 0.01) and that their doctor did not recommend screening (58% vs. 47%, p = 0.01). Reasons for screening cessation did not differ by health status, including among the oldest patients.

Conclusions

Cancer screening remains common, even among those with limited potential for benefit, but discussions around screening cessation are rare. Improving communication between patients and physicians may improve screening decision quality.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to offer screening mammography starting at age 40 years in females at average risk of breast cancer. Offer screening mammography no earlier than age 40 years in females at average risk of breast cancer. Begin screening mammography by no later than age 50 years in females not initiated screening in their 40s. Make the decision about the age to begin mammography screening through a shared decision-making process taking into account information about the potential benefits and harms.

A panel discussion on controversies in breast cancer screening held recently at the NCCN 21st Annual Conference included only a few controversies. Representatives of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, American Cancer Society, and NCCN disagreed primarily on 2 main areas: when to start screening (ages 40, 45, or 50 years) and frequency of screening (annual vs biennial). Panelists from these organizations presented the rationales for their respective recommendations.

### USPSTF recommendations and overdiagnosis [^114BobXk]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Overdiagnosis is the concept that some cancers detected at screening would never have become clinically apparent during a woman's lifetime in the absence of screening. This could occur if a woman dies of a cause other than breast cancer in the interval between mammographic detection and clinical detection (obligate overdiagnosis) or if a mammographically detected breast cancer fails to progress to clinical presentation. Overdiagnosis cannot be measured directly. Indirect methods of estimating overdiagnosis include use of data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to evaluate breast cancer mortality, population-based screening studies, or modeling. In each case, estimates of overdiagnosis must consider lead time, breast cancer incidence trends in the absence of screening, and accurate and predictable rates of tumor progression. Failure to do so has led to widely varying estimates of overdiagnosis. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) considers overdiagnosis a major harm of mammography screening. Their 2024 report estimated overdiagnosis using summary evaluations of 3 RCTs that did not provide screening to their control groups at the end of the screening period, along with Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network modeling. However, there are major flaws in their evidence sources and modeling estimates, limiting the USPSTF assessment. The most plausible estimates remain those based on observational studies that suggest overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening is 10% or less and can be attributed primarily to obligate overdiagnosis and nonprogressive ductal carcinoma in situ.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering screening clinical breast examination in asymptomatic, average-risk females in the context of an informed, shared decision-making approach recognizing the uncertainty of additional benefits and the possibility of adverse consequences of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography. Consider using intervals of every 1–3 years in females aged 25–39 years and annually in females aged ≥ 40 years if it is performed. Perform clinical breast examination as part of evaluation in high-risk females and females with symptoms.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to do not advise breast self-examination in average-risk females because there is a risk of harm from false-positive test results and a lack of evidence of benefit.

REORGANIZING BREAST CANCER SCREENING SERVICES

Differently from cervical and colon cancer screening, breast cancer screening has no alternative for a self-collected screening test. As the screening activities resume while the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, breast imaging and further assessment must be performed using safe practices. On that note, we must balance the need to avoid delays of a breast cancer diagnosis while avoiding infection, which requires careful attention to PPE, physical distancing, and vigilance to maintain these practices; resuming activities should also involve prioritization and implementation of innovative interventions.

Recommendations from different medical associations and experts are proposing that the diagnostic procedures in symptomatic patients should be prioritized over screening procedures. All efforts should be made to avoid delayed diagnosis in situations as clinical suspicion of inflammatory or locally advanced breast cancer, imaging findings of BI-RADS 5 (high priority) or BI-RADS 4 (medium priority), symptomatic women with a new palpable lump or breast thickening that is clinically concerning, and suspicion of breast cancer in a pregnant woman. -

Annual mammographic screening should be discouraged. One interesting strategy to reduce the number of clinic visits for the women may be a one-stop breast care. Health facilities would offer same-day diagnosis and integrated multidisciplinary care services, which include counseling, mammography, or clinical breast examination followed by appropriate diagnostic evaluation, which includes imprint cytology of breast core biopsy specimens. This model has been tested in both low- and high-resource settings, showing encouraging feasibility and outcomes.

### Randomized trial of information for older women about cessation of breast cancer screening invitations [^1112Vxxb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

There is uncertain benefit of screening mammography for older women, as women aged ≥ 74 years have not been included in randomized controlled trials. At a population level, potential harms become more likely with increasing age, including false positives and anxiety due to additional tests following detection of an abnormality, as well as overdiagnosis (diagnosis of a cancer that would never have caused problems) and overtreatment. In one Australian modeling study, if screening were extended to 1000 women aged 70–74 years (compared to inviting women up to 69 years), one additional breast cancer death would be averted, eight breast cancers would be overdiagnosed, and 102 additional tests would include 78 additional false positives. However, a US modeling study indicated that continued screening to 78 or 80 years for women with no comorbidity could have similar benefit-harm ratios as screening women aged 50–74 years at average risk.

United States (US) guidelines recommend individualized breast screening decisions beyond 74 years based on overall health, life expectancy, and personal preference. – Screening is not recommended for individual women with limited life expectancy (< 10 years) due to the 10-year lag-time to benefitand greater chance of harm. However, over 50% of women aged ≥ 74 years report recent screening in US national survey data, and around 38% of women with limited life expectancy continue breast screening. In Australia, the nationally funded screening program (BreastScreen) invites women to participate in mammography screening for breast cancer up to 74 years of age through local health districts. Women aged ≥ 74 years can continue free screening and are encouraged to speak with their primary care clinician (general practitioner [GP]) if they wish. Screening rates by life expectancy are unknown in Australia. However, since BreastScreen extended invitations to women aged 70–74 years in 2013, annual participation rates in this age group increased from 25.9 to 55.8%, and data suggests 7.6–10% of women continue to be screened beyond 74 years. One reason for this may be the high trust people living in Australia have in the healthcare system.

### Effect of messaging on support for breast cancer screening cessation among older US women: a randomized clinical trial [^112K3EUz]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Although mammography screening can reduce breast cancer–related mortality and morbidity, it can also cause harms such as false-positive findings and overdiagnosis. The benefits of mammography screening lag by about 10 years, whereas the harms and burdens of screening occur in the short term. In older women with multiple chronic conditions, functional impairment, and limited life expectancy, the harms of screening likely outweigh the benefits. Guidelines recommend screening up to 75 years of age or as long as life expectancy is 10 years or greater. However, many older women continue to receive screening beyond these thresholds. National data found that 50.6% of women 75 years or older and 42.8% of women with a life expectancy of less than 10 years received breast cancer screening, suggesting overscreening.

One important contributor to overscreening is that patients have received proscreening messages for many years from the media, the broader social environment, and health care professionals. In contrast, there has been little messaging about the harms of overscreening or that stopping screening may be appropriate for some women. Messaging strategies have been used successfully to reduce other unwanted health behaviors such as smoking but are an understudied approach to reduce overscreening. In prior work, we developed and evaluated messages on breast cancer screening cessation for older women. We combined the top-rated message elements from this prior work into a single message in the present study to examine whether message exposure would increase support for and intentions of stopping screening.

When considering effective communication strategies, message source also matters. Older adults consider clinicians the most trusted information source about cancer screening, but family members, friends, and the media are also important. Therefore, we also sought to experimentally evaluate whether receiving consistent messages about stopping screening from nonclinician sources may amplify the message effect compared with receiving a message from a clinician alone.

### Health benefits and harms of mammography screening in older women (75 + years)-a systematic review [^114KBKov]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Globally, there is no consensus or uniform policy on whether mammography screening should be ceased or even discouraged in older women (and if so what upper age limit should be set). Importantly, there is little evidence on the balance between potential benefits and harms in older women (specifically 75+) in whom competing causes of death and co-morbidities could render routine screening relatively harmful, and a shorter life expectancy could reduce the likelihood of experiencing benefit from screening. To support population-level, as well as individual, decisions about the age or age-range to stop (or recommend against) screening, we conducted a systematic review of the evidence on the outcomes of mammography screening in older women.

The aim of this study was to systematically review and synthesise the evidence on the outcomes of mammography screening in women aged 75 years and older, to guide screening recommendations.
