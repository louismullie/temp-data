## Question

differential diagnosis for blood in the semen

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis and evaluation of hematospermia, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical problem and risk stratify by age and symptom pattern. Then, I should categorize etiologies mechanistically. Next, I will map a tiered diagnostic approach aligned with appropriateness criteria and guidelines. After that, I need to consider special populations and rare causes. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight pitfalls, making sure I verify each step against the cited evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct and risk stratification, because that drives everything downstream. Hematospermia is the presence of blood in semen; it is uncommon but usually benign, with a prevalence around 0.21% among urologic outpatients, and malignancy is rare, comprising roughly 3.2% of cases in large series, so I should not jump to cancer without red flags [^111muABz]. I need to stratify by age under versus over 40, duration (single episode versus persistent/recurrent), and associated symptoms such as hematuria, fever, weight loss, bone pain, or lower urinary tract symptoms, since these features shift pretest probabilities and the intensity of workup [^1128hSZZ] [^113jnCfE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the malignancy risk framing. In men under 40 without risk factors, hematospermia is most often infectious or inflammatory and frequently self-limited, whereas in men over 40 or those with persistent symptoms, the threshold for evaluating for prostate cancer and other structural causes should be lower, consistent with EAU guidance to screen for prostate cancer in patients older than 40 with persistent hemospermia [^113jnCfE]. I should also remember that hematospermia is a recognized but uncommon manifestation of prostate cancer, reinforcing the need for a prostate exam and PSA in the appropriate context [^111muABz] [^1128hSZZ].

> Next, I will categorize etiologies mechanistically to keep the differential organized. Let me think about five broad buckets: infectious/inflammatory, iatrogenic/traumatic, structural/obstructive, vascular, and malignant/systemic, because this mirrors contemporary reviews and helps align testing and treatment pathways [^115pEyTG]. I should double-check that this framework also aligns with imaging-based reviews that emphasize infection, inflammation, obstruction, vascular malformations, stones/cysts, and tumors as key categories, which it does [^112QWhow].

> I will now examine infectious and inflammatory causes, since these dominate in younger men. Sexually transmitted infections and prostatitis are common culprits; I need to check for urethritis, cystitis, and seminal vesiculitis as well, and I should consider pyospermia on semen analysis as a clue to infection or inflammation, prompting targeted cultures and treatment rather than reflex imaging in low-risk presentations [^1128hSZZ] [^112ZX6Qo]. But wait, what if the patient has systemic features or travel history? Then I should broaden to entities like schistosomiasis or even Zika virus, which has documented associations with hematospermia and potential sexual transmission dynamics, albeit rare in many settings [^115KdP1R] [^112mDQmy] [^111YESXq].

> Let me consider iatrogenic and traumatic causes next, because they are frequent and often overlooked. Prostate biopsy commonly causes transient hematospermia, and vasectomy-related hematospermia in the early post-procedure period is expected and benign; I should confirm timing relative to procedures and counsel accordingly to avoid unnecessary testing [^112EEmVs] [^112xn8a4]. I need to check for less obvious trauma too, such as vigorous sexual activity, cycling, or instrumentation, and I should remember that prostatic artery embolization can rarely cause hematospermia via non-target embolization of seminal vesicle vessels, so procedural history matters [^111ypvqZ].

> Now, structural and obstructive etiologies. Ejaculatory duct obstruction, seminal vesicle cysts, and calculi can present with hematospermia and sometimes pain or infertility; transrectal ultrasound is first-line to detect these, and MRI helps when TRUS is inconclusive or when delineation is needed for intervention planning [^111yP9Hh] [^115KpMGx]. Wait, let me verify the sequence: ACR supports TRUS first with MRI as problem-solving, which matches this approach and avoids overuse of cross-sectional imaging in low-yield scenarios [^115KpMGx].

> I should review vascular causes, especially when hematospermia coexists with post-ejaculatory hematuria or urethral bleeding. Posterior urethral hemangioma and other urethral vascular malformations are classic and often missed; careful cystourethroscopy with attention to the verumontanum region and reduced irrigation after ejaculation can unmask these lesions, and endoscopic resection or fulguration is curative in most cases [^112yNc7d] [^114QNw1w]. Hold on, I should verify that this pattern is indeed a distinct phenotype; series consistently show PUH at the 6 o'clock position between the verumontanum and external sphincter, which helps anchor the diagnosis when considered early [^114gyr9X].

> Malignancy must be considered but kept in perspective. Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy associated with hematospermia, yet it remains uncommon overall; seminal vesicle and testicular cancers are rarer still, so I should avoid anchoring bias while maintaining vigilance in older men or those with persistent symptoms, abnormal DRE, or elevated PSA [^111muABz] [^115pEyTG]. I should confirm that guidelines endorse prostate cancer screening in men over 40 with persistent hematospermia, which they do, supporting DRE and PSA in that subgroup [^113jnCfE].

> Systemic and hematologic contributors can be subtle. Coagulopathies and anticoagulation increase bleeding risk across mucosal surfaces, and hyperuricemia has been reported as a probable cause in a subset of otherwise idiopathic cases, with symptom resolution after urate-lowering therapy; I should check medication and metabolic histories carefully before labeling a case idiopathic [^1128hSZZ] [^111Q7VkK]. Let me reconsider whether systemic inflammatory conditions or red cell disorders directly cause hematospermia; while they can impair spermatogenesis and alter semen quality, a direct causal link to hematospermia is less certain, so I should be cautious and focus on reversible contributors first [^1162UnPy].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and make sure it aligns with appropriateness criteria. For men under 40 with a single episode and no red flags, reassurance and selective testing for infection are reasonable; urinalysis and STI screening suffice in many cases, reserving imaging for persistence or recurrence [^1128hSZZ]. For men over 40 or those with persistent or recurrent hematospermia, I should perform a focused exam including DRE and consider PSA, then proceed to TRUS as first-line imaging; MRI is appropriate when TRUS is negative or equivocal but suspicion remains high, and cystoscopy is indicated for hematuria, urethral bleeding, or suspected urethral lesions [^115KpMGx] [^116vRcg6]. Wait, I almost said CT is first-line; that would be imprecise — CT has limited soft-tissue resolution for seminal vesicles and is not preferred initially, so I should correct that and keep TRUS/MRI as the primary modalities [^115KpMGx].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and rare causes so I do not miss outliers. In men with infertility or low ejaculate volume, I should evaluate for ejaculatory duct obstruction and consider seminal vesiculoscopy when noninvasive imaging is unrevealing but suspicion persists; TUSV can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in expert hands, though standardization and long-term sexual function data are evolving [^115Ha7ss] [^1136rxyy]. In travelers or those with epidemiologic risk, I should consider schistosomiasis or Zika, and in patients with prior splenectomy and a pelvic mass, splenosis can compress seminal vesicles and present with hematospermia, requiring surgical confirmation and resection if symptomatic [^115KdP1R] [^112mDQmy] [^112JyNG6]. But wait, what if the patient has post-coital hematuria with recurrent hematospermia? Then I should prioritize cystoscopy looking for posterior urethral hemangioma, which is highly treatable endoscopically [^114QNw1w].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it against guidelines. Initial triage hinges on age, duration, and associated symptoms; low-risk men under 40 with a single episode get reassurance and selective infection testing, whereas higher-risk men over 40 or those with persistence/recurrence get DRE, PSA, urinalysis, and STI testing, followed by TRUS and MRI if needed, with cystoscopy for hematuria or suspected urethral pathology; throughout, I should avoid over-imaging low-yield scenarios and escalate based on clinical evolution [^1128hSZZ] [^116vRcg6] [^113jnCfE]. I should confirm that this tiered strategy matches both primary care and urology perspectives, which it does, and that it balances cancer detection with avoidance of unnecessary biopsies and imaging [^115pEyTG].

> Finally, I should review pitfalls and self-corrections to ensure internal consistency. I initially considered CT early for persistent cases, but TRUS and MRI provide superior delineation of seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts and are preferred by ACR, so CT should be reserved for specific anatomic questions or alternative pathology, not routine hematospermia workup [^116vRcg6]. I also briefly equated pyospermia with infection; wait, I should verify that round cells must be differentiated from germ cells, and that cultures are not routinely indicated unless pyospermia is confirmed, aligning with AUA/ASRM guidance to avoid overtesting [^112ZX6Qo] [^114bKe93]. Lastly, I need to remember that most hematospermia resolves spontaneously or with treatment of infection or obstruction, so reassurance is appropriate in low-risk presentations while maintaining vigilance for red flags that warrant definitive evaluation [^111muABz] [^115pEyTG].

Blood in semen (hematospermia) is most often due to **benign causes** such as inflammation/infection, microtrauma, or iatrogenic injury, especially in men under 40 [^1128hSZZ] [^115pEyTG]. In men over 40, or with persistent/recurrent symptoms, **evaluate for prostate cancer** and other malignancies [^113jnCfE] [^115KpMGx]. Key etiologies include:

- **Inflammatory/infectious**: prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, urethritis, STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas), tuberculosis, schistosomiasis [^1128hSZZ] [^115KdP1R].
- **Structural**: ejaculatory duct obstruction, cysts, stones, hyperplasia, polyps [^111yP9Hh] [^112QWhow].
- **Vascular**: hemangioma, varices, telangiectasia [^112yNc7d] [^113xDwAa].
- **Trauma/iatrogenic**: prostate biopsy, catheterization, vigorous sexual activity [^112EEmVs] [^1128hSZZ].
- **Malignancy**: prostate cancer, seminal vesicle or testicular tumors (rare) [^111muABz] [^116qYEAY].
- **Systemic**: hypertension, bleeding disorders, anticoagulants [^1128hSZZ] [^115pEyTG].

Initial workup includes history, exam, urinalysis, and STI testing; **TRUS or MRI** if persistent or in men over 40, and cystoscopy for hematuria or suspected urethral lesions [^116vRcg6] [^115KpMGx]. Most cases resolve spontaneously or with treatment of the underlying cause; persistent cases may need endoscopic or surgical intervention [^115pEyTG] [^1136rxyy].

### A management algorithm for hematospermia [^115QFh8f]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2009). Medium credibility.

The presence of blood in the semen — hematospermia — is an anxiety-provoking but usually self-limiting condition. Its exact incidence remains unclear. The risk of underlying malignancy, despite being very low, drives evaluation. There is confusion amongst clinicians as to how best to refer, evaluate and treat men with hematospermia. We have reviewed the literature in an attempt to present a cohesive view of the etiologies and diagnostic and management strategies in patients with this condition.

### Evaluation and treatment of hematospermia [^1128hSZZ]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Hematospermia can be a distressing symptom for patients, but most cases are effectively managed by a primary care physician. Although the condition is usually benign, significant underlying pathology must be excluded by history, physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and, in select cases, other diagnostic modalities. In men younger than 40 years without risk factors (e.g., history of cancer, known urogenital malformation, bleeding disorders) and in men with no associated symptoms, hematospermia is often self-limited and requires no further evaluation or treatment other than patient reassurance. Many cases are attributable to sexually transmitted infections or other urogenital infections in men younger than 40 years who present with hematospermia associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. Workup in these patients can be limited to urinalysis and testing for sexually transmitted infections, with treatment as indicated. In men 40 years and older, iatrogenic hematospermia from urogenital instrumentation or prostate biopsy is the most common cause of blood in the semen. However, recurrent or persistent hematospermia or associated symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, weight loss, bone pain) should prompt further investigation, starting with a prostate examination and prostate-specific antigen testing to evaluate for prostate cancer. Other etiologies to consider in those 40 years and older include genitourinary infections, inflammations, vascular malformations, stones, tumors, and systemic disorders that increase bleeding risk.

### Hematospermia evaluation at MR imaging [^112QWhow]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Hematospermia is a challenging and anxiety-provoking condition that can manifest as a single episode or recur over the course of weeks to months. It is usually a benign self-limiting condition in younger sexually active males without a history of risk factors such as cancer, urogenital malformations, bleeding disorders, and their associated symptoms. However, patients with recurrent, refractory and painful hematospermia with associated symptoms, such as fever, pain, or weight loss, require evaluation through clinical assessment and noninvasive investigations to rule out underlying pathologic conditions such as ejaculatory obstruction, infectious and inflammatory causes, malignancy, vascular malformations, and systemic disorders that increase the risk of bleeding, especially when presenting in older men. If these investigations are negative, the patient should be reassured and treated accordingly. In the recent past, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has assumed a major role in the investigation of hematospermia due to its excellent soft-tissue contrast and multiplanar capabilities. In this review, we will discuss the potential causes of hematospermia and its diagnostic workup, including pathophysiology, anatomic considerations, the imaging appearance of associated pathologic conditions, and management.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® hematospermia [^116vRcg6]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hematospermia is an uncommon source of referral for imaging. When considering the adequate modalities for its evaluation, the patient's age, duration, and associated symptomatology need to be taken into consideration. Younger patients with transient hematospermia and without associated signs or symptoms usually require a clinical approach and reassurance. In the setting of symptomatic hematospermia, persistent hematospermia, and in older patients, imaging may be indicated to assess for possible etiologies. However, there are variations on the initial imaging approach for the evaluation of a patient with hematospermia, in which literature data, and clinical consensus provide guidance on the imaging modalities most suitable for the assessment of possible etiologies. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaHematospermia [^115KpMGx]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Most men with hematospermia or hemospermia (HS) are young (< 40 years of age), presenting with transient or episodic HS without other signs or symptoms of disease. The condition is self-limiting in most cases and idiopathic in nature. When a cause can be identified, infections of the urogenital tract are the most common. Imaging does not play a role in this patient population. In older men (> 40 years of age), clinical screening for prostate cancer is advised. Furthermore, when HS is persistent or has symptoms, causes include obstruction or stricture at the level of the verumontanum, calcifications or calculi in the prostate, ejaculatory ducts or seminal vesicles, and cysts arising within these structures. Noninvasive imaging, predominantly transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and MRI, can be used in men of any age with persistent or refractory HS, or other associated symptoms or signs. TRUS is considered as the first-line imaging with MRI used when TRUS is inconclusive or negative. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Hematospermia – the added value of transrectal ultrasound to clinical evaluation: is transrectal ultrasound necessary for evaluation of hematospermia? [^1155BnH2]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Hematospermia is usually caused by nonspecific inflammation of the prostate and seminal vesicles. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is a safe and inexpensive modality for evaluating patients with hematospermia. The aim of this study is to describe the findings of TRUS and its contribution to patients' management. A total of 115 consecutive patients presented with hematospermia and evaluated with TRUS between 2006 and 2012. All patients exhibited an abnormality in the TRUS examination. A 12-core TRUS-guided biopsy of the prostate was taken from 10 patients, but none of these samples were positive for tumor. In the vast majority of cases, a benign cause can be identified using TRUS. These causes usually do not require treatment.

### Hemospermia [^115pEyTG]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

With current diagnostic modalities the proportion of patients diagnosed with idiopathic hemospermia has decreased dramatically. The dilemma now is how far to investigate these patients since in the majority it is a benign and self-limiting symptom.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the literature on hemospermia with particular emphasis on etiology, diagnosis and management. A Medline search of the literature for the last 40 years was done and all relevant articles were studied in full.

Results

Etiological factors are often categorized into the various pathophysiological mechanisms. Most cases of hemospermia are the result of iatrogenic, inflammatory and infective pathologies. A literature review of the etiological studies of hemospermia identified a total of 33 tumors (25 prostatic) in 931 cases (3.5%). In patients younger than 40 years an infective cause in the urogenital tract is the most common etiological factor. Often only simple, tailored investigations and appropriate treatment are required. In patients older than 40 years with persistent hemospermia or associated symptoms such as hematuria it is essential to exclude urogenital malignancy. History, examination and simple investigation should also suffice in this group. If the diagnosis is still unclear, further investigation in the form of transrectal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and cystoscopy is of proven benefit. Treatment for hemospermia depends on the underlying pathological condition. In most cases bleeding is slight and self-limited, and it may be managed expectantly.

Conclusions

The majority of patients can be treated with minimal investigations and simple reassurance. In older patients or those with persistent hemospermia or associated symptoms modern diagnostic techniques are of proven benefit.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^111sT83M]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the past 40 years, since the publication of the original WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen, the laboratory methods used to evaluate semen markedly changed and benefited from improved precision and accuracy, as well as the development of new tests and improved, standardized methodologies. Herein, we present the impact of the changes put forth in the sixth edition together with our views of evolving technologies that may change the methods used for the routine semen analysis, up-and-coming areas for the development of new procedures, and diagnostic approaches that will help to extend the often-descriptive interpretations of several commonly performed semen tests that promise to provide etiologies for the abnormal semen parameters observed. As we look toward the publication of the seventh edition of the manual in approximately 10 years, we describe potential advances that could markedly impact the field of andrology in the future.

### The effect of red blood cell disorders on male fertility and reproductive health [^1162UnPy]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Male infertility is defined as a failure to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse owing to suspected male reproductive factors. Non-malignant red blood cell disorders are systemic conditions that have been associated with male infertility with varying severity and strength of evidence. Hereditary haemoglobinopathies and bone marrow failure syndromes have been associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunction, hypogonadism, and abnormal sperm parameters. Bone marrow transplantation is a potential cure for these conditions, but exposes patients to potentially gonadotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation that could further impair fertility. Iron imbalance might also reduce male fertility. Thus, disorders of hereditary iron overload can cause iron deposition in tissues that might result in hypogonadism and impaired spermatogenesis, whereas severe iron deficiency can propagate anaemias that decrease gonadotropin release and sperm counts. Reproductive urologists should be included in the comprehensive care of patients with red blood cell disorders, especially when gonadotoxic treatments are being considered, to ensure fertility concerns are appropriately evaluated and managed.

### Screening for prostate cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112MpW1V]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Harms of PSA screening and diagnostic workup — The harms of screening for prostate cancer include harms from the PSA screening test and subsequent harms from diagnosis and treatment, with potential harms of screening including frequent false-positive results and psychological harms. One major trial in men screened every 2 to 4 years concluded that, over 10 years, more than 15% of men experienced at least 1 false-positive test result. Harms of diagnostic procedures include complications of prostate biopsy, such as pain, hematospermia (blood in semen or ejaculate), and infection, and potential harms also include false-positive results that require additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction.

### Hematospermia is rarely related to genitourinary cancer: lessons learned from 15 years of experience with 342 cases [^111muABz]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2021). Medium credibility.

We investigated the prevalence of hematospermia among the 161,258 men with ≥ 18 years old, presenting to outpatient clinics with urologic complaints, between January 2003 and December 2017. We also recorded underlying causes of hematospermia to determine frequency of genitourinary cancer in 342 men who presented with hematospermia. Further evaluations such as urine/semen culture, Meares-Stamey four glass test, transrectal/scrotal ultrasound, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cystourethroscopy, and prostate biopsy were performed in the presence of additional symptoms and findings or recurrence of hematospermia after treatment of patients with monosymptomatic hematospermia. The prevalence of hematospermia was detected as 0.21% (342/161,258) among the urological patients. The mean age of the patients was 45.05 ± 14.04 years (range 18–85), and the median duration of hematospermia was 15 days (range 1–7200). In 306 (89.5%) of the patients, hematospermia was resolved after medical therapy for infections/inflammations, surgery for ductal obstruction and cysts, prostate and testicular cancer. However, 36 (10.5%) had persistent hematospermia. The most relevant etiologic cause of hematospermia was inflammation/infections in 169 patients (49.4%), and genitourinary cancers were detected in only 11 patients (3.2%) as prostate cancer in 8 and testicular cancer in 3. Hematospermia is seen frequently due to inflammatory or infectious causes, and is rarely associated with genitourinary cancer. However, genitourinary cancers should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent/persistent hematospermia and associated symptoms, such as hematuria, lower urinary tract symptom, and scrotal pain/swelling.

Hematospermia associated with schistosomal infection is a new topic of clinical interest. The features and incidence of this rare complication and the difficulties associated with its treatment have yet to be characterized. We describe 4 patients with hematospermia due to schistosome infection acquired during travel to an area of endemicity.

### Systematic review of complications of prostate biopsy [^112EEmVs]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Prostate biopsy is commonly performed for cancer detection and management. The benefits and risks of prostate biopsy are germane to ongoing debates about prostate cancer screening and treatment.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of complications from prostate biopsy.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature search was performed using PubMed and Embase, supplemented with additional references. Articles were reviewed for data on the following complications: hematuria, rectal bleeding, hematospermia, infection, pain, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), urinary retention, erectile dysfunction, and mortality.

Evidence Synthesis

After biopsy, hematuria and hematospermia are common but typically mild and self-limiting. Severe rectal bleeding is uncommon. Despite antimicrobial prophylaxis, infectious complications are increasing over time and are the most common reason for hospitalization after biopsy. Pain may occur at several stages of prostate biopsy and can be mitigated by anesthetic agents and anxiety-reduction techniques. Up to 25% of men have transient LUTS after biopsy, and < 2% have frank urinary retention, with slightly higher rates reported after transperineal template biopsy. Biopsy-related mortality is rare.

Conclusions

Preparation for biopsy should include antimicrobial prophylaxis and pain management. Prostate biopsy is frequently associated with minor bleeding and urinary symptoms that usually do not require intervention. Infectious complications can be serious, requiring prompt management and continued work into preventative strategies.

### Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy for intractable hematospermia: experience from 144 patients [^117EacHb]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Second, the complications of sexual function are important to discuss. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first research paying attention to sexual dysfunction after this surgery. The follow-up results showed that 12 patients seemed to suffer sexual dysfunction, including the tendency of premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction. After we investigated the specific surgical approaches of these 12 patients, we surprisingly discovered that all of them had been treated by puncturing using a guidewire through the SV. This fact triggers our thinking to one guess whether this approach would cause more sexual function influence than other two approaches. Sexuality, as an inherent need for human beings, attracts the attention of both patients and doctors. For this reason, we should concentrate on researching the potential relationship between the operation by puncturing using a guidewire through SV and sexual dysfunction. In case this kind of operation can cause sexual dysfunction, we should identify the specific mechanism and countermeasures to prevent these complications by abandoning or improving this method of TUSV. Therefore, our next purpose is to prepare a study to investigate this potential relationship.

### Clinical characteristics and endoscopic treatment of hematospermia with postcoital hematuria [^113xDwAa]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, as an exceedingly rare and easily misdiagnosed clinical symptom, hematospermia accompanied by postejaculatory or posterection hematuria can be diagnosed by its characteristic manifestations. PUH and abnormal blood vessels in the prostate (as confirmed by cystourethroscopy) were common causes of hematospermia and postejaculatory hematuria. We showed that transurethral resection or fulguration of urethral hemangioma or abnormal blood vessels constitutes a minimally invasive, simple, safe, and effective treatment method.

### Ejaculatory duct obstruction [^111yP9Hh]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Ejaculatory duct obstruction presents with infertility, pain, or hematospermia. Partial or functional forms of ejaculatory duct obstruction can be difficult to diagnose. Transrectal ultrasound has replaced formal vasography as the first-line diagnostic test but is not specific. Adjunctive procedures such as seminal vesicle aspiration, seminal vesiculography, and chromotubation further delineate the diagnosis. Using an evidence-based approach, this article reviews how best to approach the diagnosis and treatment of ejaculatory duct obstruction.

### Who and when should we screen for prostate cancer? Interviews with key opinion leaders [^112XuH6b]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

A Vickers and S Carlsson: You state that " patients and clinicians should discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening as it relates to the individual patient " and then cite two papers: your own review showing no benefit to screening and the USPSTF report that explicitly stated that there was a reasonable degree of 'certainty' that screening does more harm than good. So what should clinicians tell patients about the harms and benefits of screening?

D Ilic: Clinicians should refer to the ERSPC and PLCO studies, and their various strengths and limitations. The potential benefit of screening (as reported by the ERSPC) is a reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (0.11 per 1,000 person-years, or one prostate cancer death averted for every 781 men invited for screening). The PLCO study (and others) would suggest no reduction in prostate cancer mortality from screening. Potential harms include overdiagnosis, implications of false-positive test results, adverse events from further testing including hematospermia, hematuria, infection, bleeding, urinary difficulties and anxiety. Such detailed information can be difficult to convey to patients in a short period of time during a consultation – hence the need for greater use of decision aids and other patient education strategies to ensure that patients are truly informed of the benefits and risks of screening.

A Vickers and S Carlsson: You cite a review on the operating characteristics of PSA to suggest that its sensitivity is questionable. This review used the presence of prostate cancer as an endpoint. Many would argue that it is rather irrelevant whether PSA has good or bad sensitivity for prostate cancer, because most prostate cancer is indolent. The key question is whether PSA is sensitive for potentially lethal disease. What is your view on whether PSA is a good predictor for aggressive prostate cancer?

D Ilic: The PSA test is currently the frontline test that clinicians rely on with respect to diagnosing prostate cancer. However, the PSA test is problematic in distinguishing whether the cancer will become lethal in men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer. The PSA test has been demonstrated to be a poor predictor for detecting lethal prostate cancer, as evidenced by men who have been diagnosed with localized prostate cancer and managed by watchful waiting. Modifying existing strategies for using the PSA test, such as interval times and thresholds for biopsy, have been proposed, although greater emphasis is currently placed on the development of new markers that could differentiate between indolent and potential lethal cancers.

### Recurrent haematospermia: an unusual presentation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease [^117CUzdy]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Haematospermia, even though alarming, is usually benign and self-limiting, especially in a sexually active male. Nevertheless recurrent, refractory or painful haematospermia is troublesome and warrants thorough evaluation. In this context, we describe a rare case of recurrent haematospermia whereby evaluation revealed haemorrhage in seminal vesicle cysts and consequently established the aetiology of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

### Zika virus disrupts steroidogenesis and impairs spermatogenesis by stalling the translation of CYP17A1 mRNA [^111YESXq]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

To date, ZIKV is the only flavivirus that can get across the BTB and establish long-term infection in testis. The persistence of ZIKV particles in male semen for an extended duration after viremia clearance, along with its sexual transmission from male to female and vertical transmission exacerbate the concern of fetal infection in resulting pregnancies. Moreover, related reproductive symptoms, including hematospermia and oligospermia, have been reported in male ZIKV patients, implying its harmful effects on spermatozoa production and fertility. The testis functions as the primary organ for spermatogenesis, which is tightly regulated by hormones, particularly testosterone. Considering the testis is a potential reservoir for ZIKV and major steroidogenesis organ, there exists a theoretical basis for investigating the impact of ZIKV infection on testosterone production. Indeed, early clinical observations in male patients infected with ZIKV exhibited notably diminished testosterone levels, consistent with the observations both in ZIKV-infected IFNα/β receptor-deficient mice and immunocompetent macaques, suggesting the decrease in testosterone was independent of ZIKV-induced interferon activation, and some other mechanisms are involved. However, the absence of IFN signaling in A129 mice presents limitations for studying viral pathogenesis and antiviral immunity. For instance, IFN-α/β-dependent restrictions on viral tropism or effects on B and T cell priming will not be evident in this model. Although ZIKV infection in immune-deficient mice develop pronounced genital pathological changes, such as substantial inflammation in the testes and testicular atrophy, severe symptoms such as orchitis are rarely reported in humans, implying virus direct infection rather than the immune-mediated damage play more important roles in the decreased sex hormone production and oligospermia manifested in ZIKV-infected humans. However, the specific mechanisms by which ZIKV infection decreases testosterone secretion and impairs sperm production remain largely unknown.

### The hundred person wellness project and google's baseline study: medical revolution or unnecessary and potentially harmful over-testing? [^113j9n4o]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the enthusiastic endorsement of screening for prostate cancer in the 1990s and 2000s, the prospective randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that the incidence of prostate cancer in the screening group has increased significantly. One of the studies demonstrated that screening improves risk of prostate cancer-specific death but an additional 37 men needed to receive a diagnosis through screening, for every 1 saved prostate cancer death, after 11 years of follow-up. The harms associated with screening include false-positive results, over-diagnosis, over-treatment, and complications of biopsy and treatment. Among men who are undergoing prostatic biopsy, 75% of them do not have cancer; side effects include pain, fever, hematuria, hematochezia, and hematospermia. Side effects of radical prostatectomy include incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Other harms include anxiety and depression. The PIVOT trial has shown that among men with localized prostate cancer, randomized to receive radical prostatectomy or active surveillance, mortality was approximately the same after 10 years of follow-up.

The relevance of this data to the HPWP and the Baseline Study is obvious. In addition to over-diagnosis and over-treatment, we should also consider that more aggressive treatments for cancer and other diseases do not always lead to improved patient outcomes.

### Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy for intractable hematospermia: experience from 144 patients [^1136rxyy]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hematospermia is the presence of blood in the semen. There are various etiologies, including inflammation, duct obstruction, cysts, tumors, vascular abnormalities, systemic factors and iatrogenic causes. In the present study, most hematospermia was self-limiting and could resolve with appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Nevertheless, there remain some patients who suffered recurrent hematospermia, for which the conservative management is not effective. This is a condition that causes great anxiety and panic among patients, leading to damaged physical and mental health.

Current non-invasive imaging examinations used for the diagnosis of hematospermia include transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), pelvic computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Whereas examinations can diagnose, they may miss some small lesions or produce false positives. Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy (TUSV) can achieve both diagnosis and therapy and more and more operators have successfully performed this operation with good effect. Nevertheless, the long-term efficacy and safety have not been reported, especially regarding postoperative complication of sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, the procedure of the TUSV has not been standardized, because of unfamiliarity with the anatomy of the area of the verumontanum.

Here, we summarize our experience from 144 TUSV patients by illustrating detailed surgical methods, treatment outcomes, and intraoperative findings, with a discussion on the postoperative sexual function change and kinds of operative approaches. We supposed that transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy is an effective and safe procedure for the management of hematospermia, but still needs our future researches.

### Hyperuricemia: a possible cause of hemospermia [^111Q7VkK]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To report our experience with hemospermia and its relation to hyperuricemia.

Patients and Methods

Between July 2005 and July 2012, 143 patients with hemospermia presented to the outpatient clinic in our hospital. History, examination, workup, treatment outcomes, and long-term follow-up were reported in a prospective database. Patients were followed up monthly by semen examination till disappearance of hemospermia, then every 3 months for 1 year. We identified 43 patients, who had 4–12 hemospermia attacks for 2–10 months before presentation with no identifiable cause for hemospermia. Of them, 22 had hyperuricemia. The association between hemospermia and hyperuricemia was examined by comparing such 22 hyperuricemic hemospermic patients with the other 21 idiopathic hemospermic patients.

Results

The commonest 5 findings identified as possible causes of hemospermia were bilharziasis (21.6%), hyperuricemia (15.4%), idiopathic (14.7%), tuberculosis (8.4%), and chronic prostatitis (8.4%). Hyperuricemic hemospermic patients were significantly of younger age (median of 31.5 vs 45 years), complaining of more painful ejaculation (68.2% vs 9.5%), and had higher serum uric acid (median, 9.3 vs 4.5 mg/dL) compared with those of idiopathic hemospermia. Hemospermia disappeared completely in all patients of the hyperuricemia group vs only 25% of the idiopathic group (P < .001) within a mean of 2 months (range, 1–4 months).

Conclusion

Hyperuricemia is a new probable cause of hemospermia. Further randomized studies are mandatory for establishment of our postulation.

### Optimization of prostate biopsy: review of technique and complications [^1117qvsp]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

A 12-core systematic biopsy that incorporates apical and far-lateral cores in the template distribution allows maximal cancer detection and avoidance of a repeat biopsy while minimizing the detection of insignificant prostate cancers. Magnetic resonance imaging-guided prostate biopsy has an evolving role in both initial and repeat prostate biopsy strategies, potentially improving sampling efficiency, increasing the detection of clinically significant cancers, and reducing the detection of insignificant cancers. Hematuria, hematospermia, and rectal bleeding are common complications of prostate needle biopsy, but are generally self-limiting and well tolerated. All men should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis before biopsy.

### Clinical characteristics and endoscopic treatment of hematospermia with postcoital hematuria [^115MZx1d]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hematospermia accompanied by postejaculatory or posterection hematuria is a very rare clinical symptom in male patients. Although studies in recent years have shown that this phenomenon is primarily caused by posterior urethral hemangioma (PUH), it is still easy to misdiagnose and mistreat due to its atypical clinical manifestations and an overall lack of relevant knowledge in this area. According to our knowledge, until the end of 2019, the total number of reported male urethral hemangiomas in the MEDLINE database was less than 70 since the first case report in 1895. The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease is still not well understood. From May 2014 to October 2019, 39 patients with intractable hematospermia accompanied by postejaculatory hematuria were treated at our hospital, and we herein summarize the clinical characteristics, etiologic diagnosis, and endoscopic treatment effects.

### Pelvic mass causing hematospermia: splenosis [^114W3yGd]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hemospermia is usually caused by inflammation, the most common is seminal vesiculitis, but can also be caused by other reasons such as obstruction or cysts, stones, tumors, etc. The reported patient presented with hemospermia and testicular pain. Multiple preoperative imaging examinations revealed a large pelvic mass closely associated with the seminal vesicle, which was located posterior to the upper part of the seminal vesicle. Endoscopy of seminal vesicle showed no obvious tumors and stones, and the ejaculatory ducts were unobstructed on both sides, but the right seminal vesicle showed chronic inflammatory changes. Therefore, it was considered that the clinical symptoms of the patient might be related to long-term pelvic mass compression of the seminal vesicle and secondary chronic infection. Combined with the patient's history of splenectomy for splenic rupture in childhood, the possibility of splenosis was not ruled out. The nature of the tumor could no longer be determined by routine preoperative imaging, and further pathological examination or expensive radionuclide scan was needed to determine the nature of the tumor. Considering that the large mass had caused obvious symptoms in the patient and there were clear indications for surgery, it was decided to conduct surgical exploration of the mass and submit the intraoperative frozen section for examination. The appropriate treatment was made according to the pathological results.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on sexual and reproductive health-2021 update: male sexual dysfunction [^117S3cte]. European Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The present summary of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines is based on the latest guidelines on male sexual health published in March 2021, with a last comprehensive update in January 2021.

Objective

To present a summary of the 2021 version of the EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature review was performed up to January 2021. The guidelines were updated, and a strength rating for each recommendation was included based on either a systematic review of the evidence or a consensus opinion from the expert panel.

Evidence Synthesis

Late-onset hypogonadism is a clinical condition in the ageing male combining low levels of circulating testosterone and specific symptoms associated with impaired hormone production and/or action. A comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic work-up, along with screening recommendations and contraindications, is provided. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the persistent inability to attain and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual performance. Along with a detailed basic and advanced diagnostic approach, a novel decision-making algorithm for treating ED in order to better tailor therapy to individual patients is provided. The EAU guidelines have adopted the definition of premature ejaculation (PE), which has been developed by the International Society for Sexual Medicine. After the subtype of PE has been defined, patient's expectations should be discussed thoroughly and pharmacotherapy must be considered as the first-line treatment for patients with lifelong PE, whereas treating the underlying cause must be the initial goal for patients with acquired PE. Haemospermia is defined as the appearance of blood in the ejaculate. Several reasons of haemospermia have been acknowledged; the primary goal over the management work-up is to exclude malignant conditions and treat any other underlying cause.

Conclusions

The 2021 guidelines on sexual and reproductive health summarise the most recent findings, and advise in terms of diagnosis and treatment of male hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction for their use in clinical practice. These guidelines reflect the multidisciplinary nature of their management.

Patient Summary

Updated European Association of Urology guidelines on sexual and reproductive health are presented, addressing the diagnosis and treatment of the most prevalent conditions in men. Patients must be fully informed of all relevant diagnostic and therapeutic options and, together with their treating physicians, decide on optimal personalised management strategies.

### Fertility preservation in people with cancer: ASCO guideline update [^1116QJiv]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Patient and clinician communication — Individual risk discussion: Clinicians are advised to explain that some cancer treatments can impair fertility and to note pre-cancer reproductive potential when assessing risk. Specifically, patients should be told that some cancer treatments can cause infertility or POI, or for males, oligospermia or azoospermia, and that the patient's reproductive potential before cancer may also play a role in patient's individual risk.

### A literature review of zika virus [^112mDQmy]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Health officials in French Polynesia have reported an apparent increase in congenital central nervous system (CNS) malformations, coinciding with the outbreak occurring during 2013–2014 (Technical Appendix reference 51). However, this finding should be cautiously interpreted; reports included only 17 cases, and none were laboratory-confirmed Zika virus cases. In addition, the true baseline rate of such malformations before the outbreak is unknown (Technical Appendix reference 51).

A plausible neuropathologic link between Zika virus and CNS anomalies is supported by research showing viral neurotropism in intraperitoneally infected mice (Technical Appendix reference 52) and progression of disease in directly infected mouse brains (Technical Appendix reference 53). One hypothesis for Zika virus's role in CNS malformations pertains to the virus's hijacking of autophagy during viral replication (Technical Appendix reference 54). Some cellular proteins have a dual role in autophagy and centrosome stability; a normal number of centrosomes is important for brain development (Technical Appendix reference 54). An increase in centrosomes in mice has been shown to result in microcephaly (Technical Appendix reference 54). Therefore, Zika virus's interference in autophagy has been hypothesized to lead to an increase in centrosome number and microcephaly; this potential role in malformations merits further investigation.

Severe neurologic sequelae have also been described in adults, including meningitis, meningoencephalitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome (Technical Appendix reference 55). A surge in Guillain-Barre syndrome cases has been observed in Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname, Venezuela, and French Polynesia during outbreaks; however, Zika virus has been laboratory confirmed in only some of these cases (Technical Appendix reference 55).

Nonneurologic sequelae include transient hearing loss, hypotension, and genitourinary symptoms (Technical Appendix references 56,57). Hematospermia was reported in 2 cases. A 44-year-old man in Tahiti in whom hematospermia developed 2 weeks after symptoms of Zika virus infection was found to have replicative cultured Zika virus particles in his semen. In addition, a 36-year-old man from the United States contracted Zika virus infection while in Senegal, and subsequently, his wife was infected in the United States; this case supports sexual transmission. A second sexually acquired case was reported in Texas (Technical Appendix reference 58).

### Transrectal ultrasound-and fluoroscopic-assisted transurethral incision of ejaculatory ducts: a problem-solving approach to nonmalignant hematospermia due to ejaculatory duct obstruction [^1156ratC]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ejaculatory duct obstruction (EJDO) has traditionally been managed with transurethral resection of ejaculatory ducts (TURED). However, wide resection has potential complications and risk of postoperative morbidity. We demonstrate a technique using transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and fluoroscopy to assist with transurethral incision of the ejaculatory duct (TUIED) to treat hematospermia due to obstruction by either a stone or a prostatic cyst.

Materials and Methods

Twenty-five patients with ejaculatory disorders including hematospermia underwent TUIED between 1997 and 2005. Diagnosis, the cause of hematospermia, and the level of EJDO was confirmed by semen analysis, semen culture, and TRUS. All patients were subjected to TRUS-guided seminal vesicle aspiration followed by seminal vesiculography using methylene blue mixed with contrast under biplanar TRUS guidance and fluoroscopic monitoring. After confirming the cause and level of obstruction, the ejaculatory duct was opened using endoscissors until the obstruction was relieved as confirmed by free flow of methylene blue. Stones were removed if any were present. A Foley catheter was kept in place for 24 hours.

Results

Improvement of symptoms was noted in 96% of patients with ejaculatory disorders. All patients with painful ejaculation and hematospermia had complete remission of symptoms at 3 months postoperatively; three patients had transient epididymo-orchitis, and none had retrograde ejaculation or incontinence.

Conclusion

TUIED is a viable and minimally-invasive option for treating EJDO causing ejaculatory disorders including hematospermia with minimal morbidity and early recovery.

### Hydroxyurea [^1171sLTN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Pregnancy Testing

Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating hydroxyurea capsules therapy.

Contraception

Females

Hydroxyurea capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with hydroxyurea capsules for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise females to immediately report pregnancy.

Males

Hydroxyurea capsules may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic abnormalities. Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and after treatment with hydroxyurea capsules for at least 1 year after therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Infertility

Males

Based on findings in animals and humans, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with hydroxyurea capsules. Azoospermia or oligospermia, sometimes reversible, has been observed in men. Inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation before the start of therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of hydroxyurea and may require a lower dose regimen. Hydroxyurea is excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

The exposure to hydroxyurea is higher in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min or in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduce dosage and closely monitor the hematologic parameters when hydroxyurea capsules is to be administered to these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

There are no data that support specific guidance for dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment. Close monitoring of hematologic parameters is advised in these patients.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Pregnancy Testing

SIKLOS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating SIKLOS therapy.

Contraception

Females

Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with SIKLOS for at least 6 months after therapy. Advise females to immediately report pregnancy.

Males

SIKLOS may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic abnormalities. Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and after treatment with SIKLOS for at least 6 months after therapy [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Infertility

Males

Based on findings in animals and humans, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with SIKLOS. Azoospermia or oligospermia, sometimes reversible, has been observed in men. Before the start of therapy, inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of SIKLOS have been established in pediatric patients aged 2–18 years with sickle cell anemia with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises. Use of SIKLOS in these age groups is supported by evidence from a non-interventional cohort study, the European Sickle Cell Disease prospective Cohort study, ESCORT-HU, in which 405 pediatric patients ages 2 to < 18 were enrolled. Among the 405 pediatric patients treated with SIKLOS, 274 were children (2–11) and 108 were adolescents (12–16) [see Clinical Studies (14)].

Continuous follow-up of the growth of treated children is recommended.

Pediatric patients aged 2–16 years had a higher risk of neutropenia than patients more than 16 years old.

The safety and effectiveness of SIKLOS have not been established in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The exposure to SIKLOS is higher in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min. Reduce dosage and closely monitor the hematologic parameters when SIKLOS is to be administered to these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Monitor hematologic parameters more frequently in patients with hepatic impairment receiving SIKLOS.

### COVID-19 and impairment of spermatogenesis: what if fever was the only cause? [^111oRbLe]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Sir,

We would like to congratulate you for the original research recently published in EclinicalMedicine entitled 'Impaired spermatogenesis in COVID-19 patients'. The authors found an increased concentration of CD3+ and CD68+ cells and apoptotic cells in the testicles/epidymes of men who died from Covid-19. In some patients cured of COVID-19, they noted oligozoospermia, leukocytospermia and increased seminal levels of IL-6 and MCP-1. All of these signs would be, for the authors, due to an autoimmune orchitis.

First, the presence of CD3+ and CD68+ cells is physiological in epididymides; they play a role in physiological sperm phagocytosis. Fever is a symptom observed in more than 80% of patients infected with COVID-19. This fever, even of limited duration, can, on its own, induce oligozoospermia and the appearance of apoptotic cells. Thus, COVID-19-induced fever can alter semen parameters even in the absence of testicular immune response. The return to basal state of semen parameters may take up to three months.

In addition, leukocytospermia (also called pyospermia) is defined by the WHO as the presence of > 1×10⁶ granulocytes (not lymphocytes) /ml. This leukocytospermia is traditionally accompanied by an increase in IL-6 and MCP-1. Leukocytospermia can be a sign of a bacterial or viral infection, systemic inflammation or simply an infrequent ejaculation. Leukocytospermia is not evidence of inflammation of the testicles.

In conclusion, the question of SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the testicles remains unresolved. Moreover, the ability of this novel coronavirus to induce an autoimmune orchitis is not proven to date.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^114gUPK9]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

The impact of these current and future advances

In closing, the continued improvement of procedures for the laboratory evaluation and processing of human semen over the past > 40 years has expanded the knowledge of male reproductive function and diagnosis of specific forms of dysfunction and set the stage for large multinational studies of semen parameters and characteristics worldwide. The improved rigor, precision, and accuracy that the current standardized protocols describe will now set the stage for advanced clinical trials aimed at filling the significant evidence gaps in both the diagnosis and treatment of male factor infertility needed to improve clinical care. In addition, the genomic revolution now allows the clinical diagnostic laboratories to realize quantum leaps in improved patient diagnosis in several areas of medicine. In andrology, we are on the forefront of vastly improving our diagnostic abilities to define precise etiologies and comorbidities and eventually (perhaps) develop medically based treatments for men with reproductive failure to improve not only their fertility potential but also their overall health. Translation of the new technologies described earlier (spermatogonial stem cell transplantation and spermatogenesis in vitro) to serve the clinical needs will require additional research. In the future, these methods should move from the laboratory to the clinical arena to provide therapeutic options for men with reproductive health-related conditions. However, because of the complexity of the systems involved and the substantial risks that otherwise healthy individual may be subjected to, there must be a high bar to ensure safety and a positive outcome. Despite these caveats, certainly, the future looks promising for improving the health and fertility of the male with reproductive failure through precision medicine and the application of advanced technologies for advanced diagnosis and treatment.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of DROXIA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of hydroxyurea and may require a lower dose regimen. Hydroxyurea is excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Posterior urethral hemangioma: one of the unknown causes of hematuria and / or hematospermia [^112yNc7d]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Posterior urethral hemangioma used to be considered extremely rare. However, urologists sometimes encounter patients who present with unknown hematospermia and/or postejaculation hematuria or posterection hematuria. We evaluated the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment and reviewed the published data.

Methods

A total of 20 patients were evaluated for symptoms, diagnosis, histologic findings, and treatment. In addition, the published data were reviewed.

Results

The typical symptoms were hematospermia and/or postejaculation hematuria. Of the 20 patients, 6 (30%) had urinary retention with blood clots, as did 6 patients reported in the published studies. Other symptoms included initial hematuria and/or urethral bleeding after erection in 5 patients (25%). The remaining 9 patients (45%) were asymptomatic and posterior urethral hemangioma was discovered by chance at urethroscopy, although the patients had had microscopic hematuria. Typically, cystourethroscopy revealed an approximately 5-mm, solitary sessile lesion that appeared as a varicosities on the membranous urethra between the verumontanum and external sphincter. Endoscopy immediately after ejaculation or erection, together with a reduction in the flow of irrigant, during cystoscopy was helpful in the discovery of the condition. Transrectal power Doppler ultrasonography was also helpful to allow discovery by minimally invasive means. A strong blood flow site in the urethra near the apex of the prostate was observed. The lesion was resected endoscopically, and fulguration was attempted. Histologic examination revealed cavernous hemangioma.

Conclusions

Posterior urethral hemangioma is more common than the published data suggest. Urologists should consider the possibility of urethral hemangioma when encountering a patient with hematospermia and/or postejaculation or posterection hematuria.

### An unusual etiology for hematospermia and treatments that were successful [^114gtnre]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the unusual etiology and effective treatments of intractable hematospermia from posterior urethral hemangioma.

Methods

The ages, disease duration, syndromes, urinary routine, pathologic findings, immunohistochemical staining results, and postoperative complications of 5 patients were recorded. Four patients had a transurethral resection for total removal of lesions, and 1 patient was treated with transurethral fulguration.

Results

The 5 patients involved were middle aged with an average age of 46.2 years and average disease duration of 8.8 years. The clinical features of their hematospermia were as follows: break outs repeatedly after ejaculation in large quantities, no obvious mixing with the seminal plasma, urine after the first ejaculation or second in the morning is hematuria and is even accompanied by blood clots, and urethrorrhagia after sexual excitation, and there is no significant effect of various positive anti-inflammatory treatments. Cystourethroscopy found that the solitary varicosities were located between the distal end of the verumontanum and the external urethral sphincter. The varicose lesion was removed by transurethral resection for posterior urethral lesions, and the surrounding tissue was removed with fulguration. Vessel formation was confirmed by CD31 and CD34 immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the presence of posterior urethral hemangioma was verified in 4 patients by pathologic examination combined with immunohistochemistry, but 1 patient did not have any specimens available.

Conclusion

The possibility of posterior urethral hemangioma should be considered for patients with repeated intractable hematospermia. Cystourethroscopy is recommended for examination throughout patient services, and transurethral resection, fulguration, or laser cutting methods can also be performed.

### Potential sexual transmission of zika virus [^115s1fro]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The ZIKV natural transmission cycle involves mosquitoes, especially Aedes spp. but perinatal transmission and potential risk for transfusion-transmitted ZIKV infections has also been demonstrated. Moreover, ZIKV transmission by sexual intercourse has been suggested by Foy et al. who described a patient who was infected with ZIKV in southeastern Senegal in 2008. After returning to his home in Colorado, United States, he experienced common symptoms of ZIKV infection and symptoms of prostatitis. Four days later, he observed signs of hematospermia, and on the same day, his wife had symptoms of ZIKV infection. Because the wife of the patient had not traveled out of the United States during the previous year and had sexual intercourse with him 1 day after he returned home, transmission by semen was suggested. ZIKV infection of the patient and his wife was confirmed by serologic testing, but the presence of ZIKV in the semen of the patient was not investigated.

Infectious organisms, especially sexually transmitted microorganisms including viruses (human papillomavirus or herpes simplex virus), are known to be etiologic agents of hematospermia. To our knowledge, before the report of Foy et al. and this study, arbovirus infections in humans had not been reported to be associated with hematospermia, and no arboviruses had been isolated from human semen.

We detected a high ZIKV RNA load and replicative ZIKV in semen samples, but ZIKV remained undetectable by rRT-PCR in the blood sample collected at the same time. These results suggest that viral replication may have occurred in the genital tract, but we do not know when this replication started and how long it lasted. The fact that the patient had no common symptoms of ZIKV acute infection concomitantly to hematospermia suggests that the viremic phase occurred upstream, probably during the first or second episode of mild fever, headache, and arthralgia.

### Variations in diagnostic criteria for male hypogonadism: is there a need for standardizing specialist society guidelines? [^1177kKMY]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Male hypogonadism or testosterone deficiency is characterized by impaired testicular function resulting in reduced androgen production and altered spermatogenesis. The prevalence of late-onset hypogonadism is approximately 2.1% among men aged 40–79 years but it can reach 30% in specific populations. Despite its clinical impact and a market projected to reach $5.1 billion by 2030, there are discrepancies among specialist societies regarding nomenclature, diagnostic cutoffs, and classification. This narrative review discusses the guidance from: the European Association of Urology (EAU), American Urological Association (AUA), Endocrine Society (EnS), Society for Endocrinology (SfE), European Academy of Andrology (EAA), British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM), Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine (SIAMS), Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE), and the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM). Societies approach the condition differently in terms of nomenclature (Male Hypogonadism vs Testosterone Deficiency), classification, biochemical criteria, and follow-up protocols. Some organizations, including the EAU, SfE, SIAMS & SIE, favour "male hypogonadism", spotlighting diminished testicular function in both testosterone and sperm production. Others, like the AUA, BSSM, and ISSM, prefer "Testosterone Deficiency", emphasizing symptomatic low Testosterone levels. Classifications often distinguish primary from secondary causes, but several guidelines adopt categories such as functional or compensated hypogonadism. Finally, divergent diagnostic cutoffs for total and free testosterone create "gray zones" and differing follow-up recommendations-particularly around Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) and haematocrit (Hct)-underscore the need for standardization. As these inconsistencies may affect clinical practice and research, consensus-based, collaborative efforts from international expert panels are needed to establish universally accepted guidelines that address the current variability in male hypogonadism.

### Nonsurgical management of oligozoospermia [^114dsxbq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Male infertility secondary to oligozoospermia is surprisingly common. Although a majority of cases are idiopathic, oligozoospermia can be caused by endocrine dysfunction, anatomic abnormalities, medications, or environmental exposures. The work-up includes excluding reversible factors such as hormonal deficiency, medication effects, and retrograde ejaculation and identifying any underlying genetic syndrome and treating reversible medical causes. If no reversible cause is found, appropriate referrals to urology and assisted reproductive technology should be initiated. Lastly, clinicians should be aware of and respond to the psychological and general health ramifications of a diagnosis of oligozoospermia as part of the comprehensive care of men and couples struggling with a diagnosis of infertility.

### Clinical characteristics and endoscopic treatment of hematospermia with postcoital hematuria [^114owqks]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Thirty-nine patients of intractable hematospermia with postcoital hematuria were treated at our hospital from May 2014 to October 2019. The clinical data were collected and retrospectively analyzed, including age, course of disease, principal symptoms, routine urine test results, coagulation function, imaging features, endoscopic findings, causes of bleeding, location and size of lesions, surgical operative skills, postoperative pathologic results, complications, and follow-up results.

All patients received conservative treatment for more than 1 month prior to admission, but no improvement was observed. After admission, all of the patients were excluded from hematuric conditions caused by urinary tumors, urinary calculi, infections, trauma, and abnormal coagulation function by relevant laboratory, or imaging examinations. All the patients were also further diagnosed and treated by urethrocystoscopy. Bladder mucosae, bilateral ureteral openings, posterior urethra, and anterior urethra were observed carefully, and we paid special attention to any suspicious abnormal indications such as bleeding, neoplasms, or abnormal protuberances. We also performed transrectal seminal vesicle massage to observe the color of the seminal vesicle fluid seeping from the bilateral ejaculatory orifices. Most of the patients had obvious hemangioma-like protuberances at the 6:00 position between the verumontanum and the external urethral sphincter in lithotomy position, which was significantly different from the surrounding normal urethral mucosa. A few patients had a circular, abnormal vascular protuberance in this area, and some individuals had localized abnormal hemangioma-like protuberances in the anterior urethral area. Electroresection either alone or along with electrocautery (using an SM10 bipolar plasma system at 100 W of output power for electroresection and 80 W for electrocautery) to the abnormal blood vessels or hemangioma-like protuberances were performed carefully and precisely. The range of resection was slightly more than the edge of the lesion by approximately 2 mm, and the depth was usually 4–5 mm (equivalent to the depth of an electric cutting loop). The bottom was usually fulgurated at the same time to destroy the abnormal blood vessels at the edge of the lesion. Foley urethral catheters were routinely retained for 1 or 2 days after the operation.

We used SPSS 18.0 statistical software for all of the statistical analyses. Measurement data that conformed to a normal distribution are expressed by x ± s, whereas non-normally distributed measurement data are expressed by medians and range.

### Clinical characteristics and endoscopic treatment of hematospermia with postcoital hematuria [^114gyr9X]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patient symptoms were characterized by repeated or stubborn hematospermia accompanied by massive hematuria, and the amount of hemorrhage can be much greater than in simple hematospermia. Blood clots are common in hematuria, and individual patients may also have recurrent urinary retention. At the same time, a few patients may manifest obvious hematuria or urethral bleeding, even if they do not ejaculate after erection or from other sexual stimulation, and this may lead to a fear of sexual intercourse. One patient refused to have sex for as long as 1–2 years for fear of bleeding, which caused stress in this individual's marriage.

We noted that a previous report suggested that transrectal power Doppler ultrasonography was helpful in the diagnosis of hemangioma, as it revealed a strong blood flow site in the urethra near the apex of the prostate. Unfortunately, we did not perform ultrasonographic examination via Doppler of the entire urethral tract in every patient. However, in order to clarify the etiology, patients in this group were carefully examined by urethrocystoscopy, and our observations were focused on the posterior urethral prostatic region, the verumontanum region, and the distal 1–2 cm region of the verumontanum. The possibility of hematospermia originating from the seminal ducts was completely excluded by our MRI examination before the operation and seminal vesicle massage during the operation. Under the pressure of the endoscopy sheath, abnormal blood vessels are sometimes difficult to observe clearly. Cattolica suggested that cystoscopy during penile flaccidity may miss these lesions that enlarge and become more visible during an erection. Saito proposed that endoscopy with reduced irrigation flow immediately after ejaculation will increase the probability of diagnosing these lesions. Our experience is that it is necessary to constantly adjust the angle of the front end of the endoscope, repeatedly moving it forward and backward, and to reduce the flushing pressure to carefully observe the integrity and smoothness of the urethral mucosa in the aforementioned areas. We usually found that there were isolated smooth pink or dark red, vein-like mass protrusions with clear boundaries at the 6:00 position between the distal part of the verumontanum and the external urethral sphincter. A few patients also showed a circular protrusion in this area. In addition to the above typical manifestations, we also had three patients with widespread and abnormal varicose blood vessels around the prostatic urethra, and verumontanum; one patient showed a circular abnormal enlargement of blood vessels on the plane of the external urethral sphincter; and one patient manifested localized hemangioma-like changes in the anterior urethra (bulbar urethra). Because urethral lesions in this type of patients occur in different areas and are of different extent and size, it is necessary to observe the abnormal changes carefully throughout the entire urethra so as to deliver an appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

### Persistent painless hemospermia due to metastatic melanoma of the right seminal vesicle [^116qYEAY]. BMC Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Hemospermia is defined as macroscopic presence of blood in the semen. Most cases are related to iatrogenic, inflammatory, traumatic or infectious pathologies provoking mucosal irritation, hyperemia and edema of the duct/gland, thus causing bleeding. In most of the cases hemospermia is mild and self-limited.

A detailed history eliciting issues of trauma, infection and bleeding disorders can narrow the differential diagnosis and preclude additional investigations in most patients with hemospermia. Physical examination in these patients should include blood pressure measurement, assessment of the penis, palpation of the vasa deferentia and digital rectal examination. Further radiographic workup is indicated only in an uncommon situation of palpable seminal vesicles or if a midline structure is noted on digital rectal examination.

Hemospermia secondary to malignancy most often is related to prostate cancer but even in this circumstance is rare. The incidence rate of hemospemia in male populations undergoing screening for prostate cancer has been reported to be 0,5%.

In cases of suspicious masses of the seminal vesicles, TRUS is the initial diagnostic tool of choice due to excellent visualization of the seminal vesicles and adjacent structures. At the same time it offers the opportunity of performing a TRUS-guided biopsy of the seminal vesicles for histological confirmation. Additional radiological evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) is required to visualize the exact extend of metastases and concomitant pelvic pathology. Further treatment of hemospermia related to metastatic involvement strictly depends on the underlying cause but is compulsory in any case. A multidisciplinary approach focusing in further assessment and treatment options should be sought.

The CUP-Syndrom comprises a heterogenous group of metastatic tumors for which no primary site can be detected. Although most CUP-Syndromes derive from neuroendocrine carcinomas, metastatic melanomas are but sporadically detected by metastasis only.

Conclusions

Having a post-testicular cause, especially a seminal tract anomaly, is a risk factor of severe necrozoospermia. The andrological profile of men suffering from severe necrozoospermia is characterized by normal testicular volumes and a decrease in seminal plasma volume, corresponding to a post-testicular profile with no clear impairment of spermatogenesis.

### Clinical characteristics and endoscopic treatment of hematospermia with postcoital hematuria [^114QNw1w]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrent hematospermia accompanied by postejaculatory hematuria is a very rare phenomenon, has not been well understood in the clinical setting, and usually leads to misdiagnosis and mistreatment. The aim of this study was to summarize the clinical characteristics, etiologic diagnosis, and endoscopic treatment of hematospermia with postcoital hematuria.

Methods

We collected the clinical data from 39 patients of hematospermia with postcoital hematuria, who were admitted to our hospital from May 2014 to October 2019. The etiologic diagnostic process and endoscopic surgery were analyzed retrospectively, and we observed and evaluated the efficacy and any complications during follow-up.

Results

The average age of the 39 patients was 44.1years (range, 18–61years), and the disease history ranged from 1month to 20years, with a median duration of 24months. All of the patients were observed by urethrocystoscopy, which showed 38 cases of posterior urethral hemangioma (PUH) or abnormal varicose vessels, and 1 case of anterior urethral hemangioma. Of these, 18 patients underwent transurethral resection of urethral hemangioma, and 21 patients underwent transurethral electrocauterization. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 1 to 56months, with a median of 16months. The symptoms disappeared in 37 patients and recurred in 2 patients two to 3 months after the operation. The two recurrent patients were treated again by transurethral electrocauterization, and their symptoms then disappeared.

Conclusions

PUH is the most common cause of hematospermia with postejaculatory hematuria. Herein, we demonstrated that transurethral resection or electrocauterization provides a safe, effective, and minimally invasive method for the treatment of PUH.

### Clinical characteristics and endoscopic treatment of hematospermia with postcoital hematuria [^116wJN48]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The age range of the patients was 18–61 years (mean age was 44.1 ± 10.2 years). The duration of symptoms ranged from 1 month to 20 years, and the median symptom duration was 24 months. Of these, 15 cases had a history of less than 1 year, 24 cases of more than 1 year, and 9 cases of more than 5 years. According to the age at onset, there were 5 patients aged less than 30 years, 13 patients aged 30–39 years, 12 patients aged 40–49, and 9 patients aged 50–59 years.

All of the patients showed typical recurrent or persistent hematospermia accompanied by hematuria on the first urination after sexual intercourse or even presented a large amount of fresh blood or blood clots from the urethral orifice after sexual intercourse or masturbation. The amount of blood in the urine was usually significantly more than that in the semen, and the hematuria then disappeared on the second and later urinations after sexual intercourse. The overall characteristic symptoms of the 39 patients are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Symptoms of 39 patients with hematospermia and postcoital hematuria

All of the patients underwent ultrasonography of the urinary system (and CT examination if necessary), and we excluded the lesions caused by tumors, stones, or other common causes of urinary system bleeding. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was usually performed before surgery, and the results showed that the size and shape of the seminal vesicles were normal and without signs of bleeding. Via urethrocystoscopy, we initially excluded hematuria from the bladder and ureters, and then transrectal seminal vesicle massage further confirmed that there was no bleeding in the seminal vesicles. The typical manifestation we found was a 0.5–0.8 cm × 1.0 cm dark red hemangioma-like mass located at 6:00 in lithotomy position between the verumontanum and the external urethral sphincter, approximately 0.5–1 cm from the distal part of the verumontanum, which was significantly different from the surrounding normal urethral mucosa and prone to bleeding (34/39) (Figs. 1, 2). We observed that some patients had obviously active episodes of hemorrhaging. Lesion localization and patterns in the 39 patients are summarized in Table 2.

### Pelvic mass causing hematospermia: splenosis [^112JyNG6]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Splenosis is a common benign lesion, which is usually found incidentally. After splenic rupture or splenectomy, the splenic fragments or splenic cells spread to the abdominal cavity or adjacent organ tissues. These cells or tissues are implanted, and they receive blood supply from adjacent tissues and gradually differentiate into mature splenic tissues. Due to limited blood supply, most implanted spleens are nodular and smaller than 3 cm in diameter, often do not need surgical intervention. However, in a small number of patients, the implanted spleen showed tumor-like growth with a diameter of up to 10 cm. Surgical treatment is usually required when a large implant or a specific implant site causes nonspecific abdominal pain, hydronephrosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or intestinal obstruction. Herein, we report a rare case of a young male patient who presented with hematospermia for a month and recent testicular pain. Both color ultrasonography and pelvic MRI indicated that a large mass in the pelvic cavity was adjacent to the seminal vesicle. The seminal vesicle endoscopy revealed chronic inflammatory changes in the right seminal vesicle without obvious tumor and stones, which ruled out the possibility of the origin of the seminal vesicle tumor. Combined with the patient's history of splenectomy for splenic rupture in childhood, the possibility of pelvic spleen implantation was considered. Laparoscopy revealed multiple nodules in the pelvic cavity and a splenic-like mass of about 9 cm in the pelvic floor. The histological and pathological results of the excised tissue showed splenic tissue, which was consistent with the diagnosis of splenosis.

### Povidone-iodine for transrectal prostate biopsy [^116aicuL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse effects of the intervention

PVP‐I rectal cleansing is assumed to have a very low adverse event profile and is generally reported to be easily applied, safe, and cheap. Adverse events directly associated with PVP‐I application might include allergic reaction and/or anaphylaxis, swelling, pain, warmth, redness, oozing, blistering, crusting, severe irritation, itching, or burning sensation.

We will also analyze infectious (fevers, chills, infection, sepsis, etc.) and non‐infectious (hematuria, hematospermia, hematochezia, acute retention, pain, discomfort, dysuria, etc.) adverse events that are related to the TRUSP biopsy procedure itself as part of our outcomes to reveal any potentiating effect PVP‐I might have.

Why it is important to do this review

Although there is evidence suggesting that PVP‐I decreases postoperative infections, it remains unclear how effective it is in practice. While there are systematic reviews comparing the effectiveness of PVP‐I to placebo/no intervention that confirm a favorable outcome for PVP‐I, none has used a rigorous methodology, such as that used in Cochrane reviews, to report their findings so far. Common shortcomings of these (and most other non‐Cochrane reviews published in the urological literature) include the lack of an a priori protocol, a focus on other than the most people‐important outcomes, a failure to rate the certainty of evidence by outcomes, and interpretation of the results on the basis of statistical significance rather than clinical importance.

Considering the high prevalence of prostate cancer and the large number of people worldwide undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy, efforts to decrease morbidity should be initiated. Using Cochrane methodology, we would like to help assess the existing evidence to guide patients, urologists, and policymakers; and help determine the role of PVP‐I in decreasing TRUSP biopsy‐related morbidity.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

XROMI is not approved in males or females of reproductive potential.

Infertility

Males

Based on findings in animals and humans, male fertility may be compromised by treatment with XROMI. Azoospermia or oligospermia, sometimes reversible, has been observed in men [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of XROMI have been established in pediatric patients aged 6 months to less than 2 years with sickle cell anemia with recurrent moderate to severe painful crises.

Use of XROMI in these age groups is supported by evidence from a pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety study, in which 32 pediatric patients ages 6 months to < 18 years were enrolled.

Among the 32 pediatric patients treated with XROMI, 6 were infants (6 months – 2years). The safety and effectiveness of XROMI have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age.

Continuous follow-up of the growth of treated children is recommended.

8.6 Renal Impairment

The exposure to XROMI is higher in patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min. Reduce dosage and closely monitor the hematologic parameters when XROMI is to be administered to these patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

There are no data that support specific guidance for dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment. Close monitoring of hematologic parameters is advised in these patients.

Study cohort

This study enrolled consecutive patients who had intractable hematospermia and underwent surgery of TUSV between May 2011 and August 2019 in the Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. All patients presented with continuous or episodic hematospermia.

Regarding the diagnosis of hematospermia, we mainly rely on detailed consultation and photos of semen provided after patients' sex life for reference. Then, they would take a series of physical examination, laboratory test (serum PSA, coagulation profile, blood routine, urine routine, liver function test, kidney function test) and imaging examination (TRUS or MRI) to exclude other diseases and confirm the diagnosis (An additional picture file shows this in more detail [see Additional file 1]). In addition, some patients would provide corresponding semen examination reports. These patients who still have obvious symptoms of hematospermia with the naked eye, after taking antibiotics (usually quinolones) regularly for at least 4 weeks, physical therapy and lifestyle improvements for more than 3 months, were diagnosed as continuous or intractable hematospermia. The specific diagnosis and treatment plan was presented in Additional file 2. Finally, patients who asking for further treatment, and then they were admitted to be treated by TUSV after comprehensive doctor–patient communication, who are enrolled in this study.

Approval for this study was granted by the Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China and written informed consent was obtained from all patients before administering treatment. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.

### Pelvic mass causing hematospermia: splenosis [^113snZYM]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Most patients with splenosis have no clinical symptoms and do not need intervention. Hematospermia and testicular pain occurred in this patient, which was considered to be related to the huge pelvic implantation of the spleen, which was relatively rare in clinical practice, so we hereby report this case.

Case Presentation

A 28-year-old male patient with a history of splenectomy was admitted to the Urology Department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University with the chief complaint of "Hematospermia for 1 month and testicular pain for 2 days". Preoperative imaging examination indicated pelvic mass. Combined with the patient's history of splenectomy for splenic rupture in childhood, the possibility of pelvic spleen implantation was considered. Laparoscopic pelvic exploration was performed. During the operation, multiple grayish-brown nodular tissues were observed in the space between the posterior bladder and rectum, and a lobulated grayish-brown mass with a diameter of about 9 cm was observed in the posterior upper part of the prostate gland and seminal vesicle at the pelvic floor. Two nodular tissues were removed intraoperatively and sent for quick frozen pathology, which was reported as spleen tissue. Further resection of the huge mass was performed, and the postoperative pathological results were consistent with the diagnosis of splenosis.

Conclusion

We report a rare case of splenosis presenting with hemospermia and testicular pain.

### Hemangioma of the prostate – an unusual cause of lower urinary tract symptoms: case report [^116gjdpg]. BMC Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hemangioma of the bladder or posterior urethra presenting with hematuria, hematospermia or urethral bleeding have been sporadically reported. Hemangioma arising in prostatic tissue causing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) without hematuria or hematospermia is extremely rare. The diagnosis of prostatic hemangioma is very difficult and in the reported cases, diagnosis has been made postoperatively on the basis of histopathology. Diagnosis of prostatic hemangioma is not possible by conventional radiographic techniques such as standard rectal ultrasonography of prostate gland. More sophisticated techniques such as superselective angiography of inferior vesical artery or Doppler ultrasonography are needed to establish the diagnosis. Preoperative diagnosis is of great advantage in planning the right treatment and avoiding complications. Prostatic hemangioma may be included in the list of differential diagnoses, in patients having LUTS associated with unexplained hematuria, hematospermia or urethral bleeding. We describe a case of prostatic hemangioma in an 84 years old patient presenting with LUTS without macroscopic hematuria, hematospermia or urethral bleeding.

### Society of Interventional Radiology research reporting standards for prostatic artery embolization [^114wXsE4]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Adverse events for prostatic artery embolization should be classified and reported with specified windows and exclusions. All major and minor procedural adverse events should be classified according to SIR criteria; complications and deaths within 30 days of the procedure should be reported as procedure-related, and subsequent events should be adjudicated for relationship to PAE. Common postprocedure events, possibly considered postembolization syndrome, may include dysuria, fever, pelvic pain, hematuria, hematospermia, and rectalgia and should be recorded when present, but routine discharge medications, such as analgesic agents, α-1 blockers, laxatives, corticosteroids, or antipyretic agents, should not be reported as an adverse event. Additional treatments beyond routine discharge medications, prolonged or repeat hospitalization, and secondary interventions can be reported as adverse events; examples of complications include nontarget embolization and postembolization syndrome requiring escalation of care or > 48-hour admission.

Although the blood supply of most implanted spleen is limited, the pelvic mass of this patient was large, which did not rule out the possibility of abundant blood supply. Preoperative blood preparation was actively conducted. The patient had a history of open surgery, but considering that it has been 20 years since the last operation, the intraperitoneal adhesions have been absorbed and the operation was mainly performed on the upper abdomen at that time, and the adhesions in the lower abdominal organs may not be serious. In addition, laparoscopic technique has the advantages of clear surgical field, less bleeding, less trauma to patients, less postoperative complications and quick postoperative recovery, so we choose to perform this operation under laparoscopy. It was under general anesthesia that the operation was performed. Before laparoscopic surgery, transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy was performed to further clarify the relevant situation. Verumontanum was identified using a small-diameter ureteroscope (6/7.5-Fr, Wolf, Germany), and the bilateral ejaculatory ducts were then examined. In addition to chronic inflammatory changes in the right seminal vesicle, microscopic examination demonstrated no tumor and calculi, and bilateral ejaculatory ducts were unobstructed (Fig. 1 c). Laparoscopic pelvic exploration was performed. During the operation, multiple grayish-brown nodular tissues which was about 1.5 cm in diameter were observed in the pelvic cavity (Fig. 2 a), and a lobulated grayish-brown mass with a diameter of about 9 cm was observed in the posterior upper part of the prostate gland and seminal vesicle at the pelvic floor (Fig. 2 b). Two nodular tissues were removed intraoperatively and sent for quick frozen pathology, which was reported as spleen tissue (Fig. 3 a). Further resection of the huge mass was performed (Fig. 2 c), and the postoperative pathological results were consistent with the diagnosis of splenosis (Fig. 3 b).

Case presentation

The 28-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Urology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University on December 24, 2020 due to "hemospermia for 1 month and testicular pain for 2 days". The patient began to ejaculate with occasional bloody semen 1 month before admission. Right testicular pain started two days before admission. The patient underwent open splenectomy due to rupture of the spleen 20 years ago, and no other past medical history was found. Color ultrasonography of prostate, seminal vesicle, spermatic cord, testis and epididymis indicated enlargement of right seminal vesicle and enhanced echo. The left seminal vesicle gland was normal, and the bilateral ejaculatory duct was not significantly dilated. There was a 74 * 53 mm cystic mass with poor echo posterior to the right side of the prostate. The right epididymis was enlarged and the echo was decreased. There was a dense speckled echo in the right epididymis with abundant blood flow. Pelvic MRI plain scan + DWI + enhancement indicated abnormal signal above the posterior to the seminal vesicle, which was closely related to the seminal vesicle, considering the origin of the seminal vesicle and the possibility of neoplastic lesions. The right seminal vesicle gland was slightly enlarged and the T2W1 signal decreased (Fig. 1 a, b).

Results

Preoperative data and treatment outcomes

A total of 199 patients presented to the urology and andrology department for recurrent hematospermia between 2011 and 2019; however, only 144 patients were enrolled in this study. The specific include/exclude process could be seen in (Additional file 4. The characteristics are shown in Table 1. The effect of TUSV was not immediate. Hematospermia disappeared or reduced in 98 (68.06%) and 18 (12.50%), respectively, by no more than 3 months after surgery (most symptoms disappear within a month). Six of 98 patients experienced recurrence by 12 months after surgery. Symptoms persisted and aggravated in 22 (15.28%) and 6 (4.17%) patients, respectively. The treatments for patients who were dissatisfied with the outcome were always antibiotics and lifestyle improvement; nevertheless the effectiveness remained inadequate. The results of MRI all showed that blood clots or stones disappeared in the seminal vesicles and utricle.

### Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy for intractable hematospermia: experience from 144 patients [^111exYUd]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Since the first application of endoscopy for examining the interior of the seminal vesicle ex vivo by Shimada et al. in 1996, this new method for observing SV directly had attracted the attention of the andrologists and urologists. Nowadays, the vesiculoscope has been used in some large hospitals. However, there remain many surgeons beginning to operate this procedure, for whom transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy (TUSV) is an advanced but challenging procedure. The present study reported some tricks and details devoting to how to use TUSV, but it is not sufficient enough. Therefore, we focused on sharing our experience and putting forward some views after at least 10 years' application of TUSV.

Transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy has been recommended as the first-line diagnostic modality in hematospermia patients because of its real-time images and low cost. Besides, TUSV is also helpful for therapy.

Xing et al. concluded that TUSV was superior to TRUS for diagnosis, especially for lesions with stones and obstruction. It can also be used to treat recurrent hematospermia and ejaculatory duct obstruction caused by stones or cysts by facilitating removal of calculi, elimination of obstruction and drainage of infection. Liu et al. reported that the hematospermia symptom in 94.4% patients was completely treated and alleviated. Liu et al. reported that hematospermia was alleviated in 89% patients. During the long history of application, it was confirmed to be an effective procedure for both diagnosis and treatment, without severe complications.

In the current study, the improvement rate of hematospermia was 80.56% and the recurrence rate was 6.12%, comparable to similar studies reported in the literature. The reason why our improvement rate of hematospermia was relatively lower than other studies may be the relatively longer duration of hematospermia in enrolled patients. In the meantime, to our knowledge, our median follow-up period of 3.38 years was the longest. For this reason, we are surprised that there were no long-term complications. Our findings provide more powerful evidence supporting the safety and efficiency of TUSV.

Diagnostic evaluation approach — Subsequent diagnostic evaluation should be conducted in a systematic, expeditious, and cost-effective manner to identify all relevant factors, with an initial emphasis on the least invasive methods for the detection of the most common causes of infertility. The pace and extent of evaluation should take into account the couple's preferences, patient age, the duration of infertility, and the unique features of the medical history and physical examination.

Other outcomes

Only a single trial, the Finnish arm of the ERSPC trialprovided data on quality of life when comparing PSA screening with no screening. This was based on a random sample of participants (n = 1088) from both trial arms excluding men with a subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer. Using the SF-6D instrument and a scale from 0 to 1.0 (with higher values indicating better quality of life), there was no difference between the two arms (mean difference 0.01 (95% CI 0.01 lower to 0.02 higher), low quality evidence; table 2). We downgraded the quality of evidence for risk of bias and indirectness.

Only the PLCO and CAP studies reported complications following biopsy. The PLCO study reported 75 complications from biopsies, including 29 infectious and 48 non-infectious adverse events. The CAP study reported three biopsy related complications (1 attributed to biopsy, 2 post-biopsy). Based on the Prostate Biopsy Effects cohort study, rates of biopsy-related complications ranged from 93% (haematospermia) to 1.4% (hospital readmissions, most commonly for sepsis): this corresponds to 94 men and one more man, respectively, per 1000 men screened. Graded by severity, 64.6% (95% CI 61.6% to 67.8%) experienced minor complications, 31.8% (28.8% to 35.1%) had moderate complications, and 1.4% (0.8% to 2.4%) had major complications. There were no biopsy related deaths. At six years after active monitoring, radical surgery, and local radiation, rates of urinary incontinence were 8%, 17%, and 4%, respectively, and rates of erectile dysfunction were 70%, 83%, and 73%, respectively (table 2). Comparing screened and unscreened men, we estimated there would be three more men per 1000 screened presenting with urinary incontinence and 25 more men per 1000 screened with erectile dysfunction (appendix 4).

Approximately two thirds of men with an elevated PSA level can expect a false positive test result, meaning they will not be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Approximately 15% of men with a PSA level < 4 ng/mL will harbour prostate cancer of any grade consistent with a false negative result. Clinically meaningful disease with a Gleason score ≥ 7 can be expected in 2.3% of men with a PSA level < 4 ng/mL (table 2).

### A coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient with bilateral orchitis [^111T7txM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

During the development of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), a myriad of complications has emerged and although rare, several genitourinary complications have been reported. The bulk of these complications have been secondary to hypercoagulable states, such as priapism. Previous SARS family infections have caused orchitis, though no adult cases of orchitis have been reported. We describe a novel case of SARS-CoV2 bilateral orchitis in a previously healthy 37-year-old male who presented for testicular pain with constitutional symptoms. Additionally, there was no epididymitis associated with the bilateral orchitis. Based on both data in SARS-CoV2 infected males and previous data from prior SARS infections, spermatocyte function may be compromised secondary to this infection. With the various symptoms associated with this virulent pathogen, we characterize the potential complications and importance of fertility follow up.

### Complications after systematic, random, and image-guided prostate biopsy [^112gh63G]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Prostate biopsy (PB) represents the gold standard method to confirm the presence of cancer. In addition to traditional random or systematic approaches, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided technique has been introduced recently.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of complications after transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided, transperineal, and MRI-guided PB.

Evidence Acquisition

We performed a systematic literature search of Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus databases up to October 2015, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Complications and mortality following random, systematic, and image-guided PBs were reviewed. Eighty-five references were included.

Evidence Synthesis

The most frequent complication after PB was minor and self-limiting bleeding (hematuria and hematospermia), regardless of the biopsy approach. Occurrence of rectal bleeding was comparable for traditional TRUS-guided and image-guided PBs. Almost 25% of patients experienced lower urinary tract symptoms, but only a few had urinary retention, with higher rates after a transperineal approach. Temporary erectile dysfunction was not negligible, with a return to baseline after 1–6 mo. The incidence of infective complications is increasing, with higher rates among men with medical comorbidities and older age. Transperineal and in-bore MRI-targeted biopsy may reduce the risk of severe infectious complications. Mortality after PB is uncommon, regardless of biopsy technique.

Conclusions

Complications after PB are frequent but often self-limiting. The incidence of hospitalization due to severe infections is continuously increasing. The patient's general health status, risk factors, and likelihood of antimicrobial resistance should be carefully appraised before scheduling a PB.

Patient Summary

We reviewed the variety and incidence of complications after prostate biopsy. Even if frequent, complications seldom represent a problem for the patient. The most troublesome complications are infections. To minimize this risk, the patient's medical condition should be carefully evaluated before biopsy.

Paradigm shift in the pathway for investigations and diagnosis of male factor infertility

Semen analysis, along with physical examination and history, is the cornerstone in the diagnosis of male factor infertility. Currently, the analysis needs to be performed in a laboratory. However, in the 6th edition, there is a discussion on emerging technologies (Chapter 4.6 of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen), which may widen the availability of semen analysis into the community. One aspect identified was the potential use of home assays for the assessment of sperm motility. With the recent implementation of widespread telemedicine for several types of clinical office visits, it is not surprising that home assays for a variety of clinical diagnostic tests would be created. At-home testing in andrology has a long history, and several new tests that assess sperm motility and/or concentration were recently launched. A number of kits commercially available today have yet to be rigorously evaluated in large-scale trials, including comprehensive comparisons with standardized laboratory methods, so their current clinical value in diagnosis is limited. However, technology is rapidly evolving, and as the assays improve, it is very likely that men assessing their own samples (providing robust and acceptable diagnostic information) will be a reality in the next 5 years. Therefore, patients will have a pivotal role to play in their own health management as witnessed in several other arenas, for example, blood glucose levels for diabetes and retinal imaging. Once the technologies are demonstrated to be accurate and precise, there is a need to determine the role these assays play in the patient diagnostic pathway, for example, are they additional, complementary, or replacement tests, and can they be used to triage patients? The tests may be cheaper and easier to use than traveling to andrology laboratories for semen analysis. They can be used in large-population–based studies of lifestyle changes or potential environmental exposures and may help to identify infertility in men. Certainly, these at-home or mail-in test kits could be particularly important for those living in rural or underdeveloped areas lacking sufficient healthcare, and at the very least, they may provide the patient with some data on their semen parameters pointing to the need for a clinical evaluation and diagnostic semen analysis if abnormalities are present. If positive answers are forthcoming, this will significantly increase effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has indicted that we can do more at-home testing to manage our healthcare than previously recognized.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113SH3fG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone therapy — conditions in which it is not recommended and pre-treatment cautions — We recommend against testosterone therapy in men planning fertility in the near term or in men with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level > 4 ng/mL, a PSA level > 3 ng/mL, combined with a high risk of prostate cancer, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe OSA, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. Men who have a prostate nodule or induration require a urological evaluation, and clinicians should not administer testosterone therapy to men with baseline hematocrit above the upper limit of normal for the laboratory without discussing the potential for an increased risk of erythrocytosis and the need to monitor hematocrit assiduously.

### Transutricular seminal vesiculoscopy in hematospermia: technical considerations and outcomes [^115Ha7ss]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Several methods of endoscopic management of seminal vesicular disease have been reported. We describe our current technique of transutricular seminal vesiculoscopy and review the outcomes in diagnosing and treating disorders of the seminal vesicles.

Methods

From November 1995 to April 2006, 70 patients with hematospermia underwent transutricular seminal vesiculoscopy. All patients underwent either transrectal ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging with an endorectal coil. When definite abnormalities were seen in the imaging studies and did not improve with medication within a period > 3 months, transutricular seminal vesiculoscopy was performed using a 6F or 9F rigid ureteroscope.

Results

In our 70 patients, the mean age was 46.5 years (range 28–68). The mean follow-up period was 12.3 months (range 1–48). Hematospermia subsided in 55 patients (78.6%) who did not respond to medical therapy with endoscopic fenestration alone. However, hematospermia recurred in 7 patients (10%). Hemorrhage was found in the seminal vesicles and in the ejaculatory ducts in 48 (68.6%) and 5 (7.1%) patients, respectively.

Conclusions

Transutricular seminal vesiculoscopy can be performed easily using conventional endoscopic equipment. This technique enables useful diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to disorders of the seminal vesicles.

Diagnostic approaches will be improved: basic semen analysis will be standardized and thus the results comparable throughout the world

A plethora of data, including that from well-established Andrology External Quality Assurance schemes, independent of country of origin, demonstrate that there is considerable variability in the results of the basic semen analysis. There are several reasons for this, for example, lack of adherence to established methods, poor training, and/or the use of a variety of methods to perform the analysis. This variability has significant clinical ramifications because a semen analysis result in 1 laboratory may not be comparable to that in another. Moreover, it can make comparisons between data sets difficult. Although these issues are well documented and have been a continual source of concern, these challenges remain.

A focus of the 6th edition is to provide clear and standardized methods that focus among others on the basic analysis (Chapter 2 of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen). Providing simplified methods obviates a primary difficulty in performing high-quality semen analysis and helps address the reproducibility crisis that has beset semen analysis for a number of years. Moreover, because the basic techniques described are robust and easy to follow, it is anticipated that this will facilitate higher-quality training. However, on their own, simplified methods will not be sufficient. If, in the next 5–10 years, we are to achieve comparable results from semen analysis from different laboratories, complementary tactics need to be actioned.

### Hemangioma of the prostate – an unusual cause of lower urinary tract symptoms: case report [^111UaRG8]. BMC Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Hemangioma of the prostate gland is extremely rare and only a few cases have been reported. There have been several cases of hemangioma of posterior urethra, urinary bladder and periprostatic plexus in the literature, all presenting with hematuria or hematospermia. Diagnosis of prostatic hemangioma is difficult due to its rarity and unspecific symptoms such as hematuria, hematospermia or lower urinary tract symptoms. It cannot be detected by conventional examinations such as cystoscopy or standard rectal ultrasonography.

Case presentation

We present a case of prostatic hemangioma in an 84-year old male presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms. Bleeding has not been a feature in our case and diagnosis was not made until after operation. The patient was treated as a case of bladder neck outflow obstruction with transurethral resection of prostate gland and simultaneous bladder neck incisions. A period of self-catheterization was instituted due to postoperative urinary retention as the result of detrusor insufficiency.

Conclusion

Hemangioma of prostate gland is extremely rare and symptomatic prostatic hemangioma should be treated either by transurethral resection of prostate or laser evaporation.

### Can semen parameters predict pregnancy outcomes? [^116jZr9Z]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Semen analysis is an integral component of the evaluation and management of men with infertility. Although it is important for patient counseling and clinical decision making, a conventional semen analysis cannot reliably predict the chance of pregnancy or differentiate fertile vs. infertile men (except in the most extreme cases). Advanced, nonstandard sperm functional tests may provide additional discriminatory and prognostic power; however, further research is needed to determine how to best incorporate these tests into modern clinical practice. Therefore, the primary applications of a conventional semen analysis should be to judge the severity of infertility, estimate the effects of future therapy, and measure the response to current therapy.
