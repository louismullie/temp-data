## Question

Goal percent time in range for nonpregnant people with T2D using CGM

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended time-in-range (TIR) goal for nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes who are using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and how to apply this information in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact population and whether pregnancy-specific targets apply. Then, I should verify the consensus TIR target range and percentage from major guidelines. Next, I will review the accompanying CGM metrics for time below range (TBR) and time above range (TAR). After that, I should confirm data validity requirements and glycemic variability targets. Finally, I will consider when to individualize goals and how to translate TIR into practical clinical decisions and follow-up cadence.

> Let me first confirm the population and scope so I don't conflate pregnancy targets with nonpregnant adult targets. The question is specifically about nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes using CGM, for whom the standard TIR range is 70–180 mg/dL, not the tighter 63–140 mg/dL range used in pregnancy, and the ADA explicitly distinguishes nonpregnant adult goals from pregnancy-specific targets, so I should keep those separate in my mind [^1118tsmo] [^113iy4jR].

> Now, I should verify the exact TIR goal. The ADA Standards of Care 2025 recommends a TIR of greater than 70% within 70–180 mg/dL for many nonpregnant adults using CGM, and this aligns with the 2019 international consensus on Time in Range, which operationalized TIR as the percentage of time glucose is between 70 and 180 mg/dL and endorsed > 70% as the target for most adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes [^1118tsmo].

> Wait, let me verify the accompanying CGM safety metrics so I don't overemphasize TIR without addressing hypoglycemia. The ADA specifies TBR < 70 mg/dL < 4% and TBR < 54 mg/dL < 1% for most adults, with less stringent TBR targets for older or high-risk adults, and the international consensus and AACE similarly anchor TBR limits at < 4% for < 70 mg/dL and < 1% for < 54 mg/dL, reinforcing hypoglycemia minimization as a co-primary goal alongside TIR maximization [^1118tsmo].

> I need to check the hyperglycemia guardrails too. The ADA table of CGM metrics advises TAR > 180 mg/dL < 25% and TAR > 250 mg/dL < 5% for most adults, with relaxed TAR thresholds for older or high-risk adults, which helps frame how to interpret excursions that erode TIR and guides therapy intensification when TAR is excessive [^1118tsmo].

> Hold on, I should verify data quality requirements because a TIR value is only meaningful if the dataset is adequate. Guidelines recommend at least 14 days of CGM data with at least 70% active wear time to ensure valid pattern assessment, and they suggest using coefficient of variation (CV) as a measure of glycemic variability with a target CV ≤ 36% (and ≤ 33% for additional hypoglycemia protection in insulin or sulfonylurea users), which operationalizes the notion that steadier glucose profiles are safer and more actionable [^1118tsmo].

> Let me consider individualization so I don't apply a one-size-fits-all target. For older adults, those with limited life expectancy, or at high risk of hypoglycemia, less stringent TIR goals (often > 50%) with stricter TBR limits are appropriate, whereas for highly motivated, newly diagnosed, or low-risk individuals, tighter TIR goals (for example, > 80% using 70–160 mg/dL) may be reasonable if achievable without excess hypoglycemia, and AACE emphasizes tailoring A1C and CGM targets to comorbidity, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^1118tsmo] [^116J1x7A].

> I should double-check how to translate TIR into clinical meaning. A 10% increase in TIR corresponds to an approximate 0.5–0.8% reduction in A1C depending on the population, and improvements as small as 5% TIR are considered clinically meaningful, which is helpful when counseling patients on incremental gains and when aligning TIR-based adjustments with traditional A1C goals around 7% for many nonpregnant adults [^111z12ry] [^112tJ87A] [^116uj2d1].

> Next, I should review the monitoring cadence. The ADA recommends assessing glycemic status at least twice yearly if stable and more frequently, about every 3 months, if goals are not met, therapy changes occur, or there is hypo/hyperglycemia, and using CGM metrics alongside A1C supports timely, data-driven adjustments to therapy [^115QjVbY].

> Finally, let me synthesize the answer succinctly while preserving the safety context. For nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes using CGM, the recommended TIR goal is > 70% of time spent in 70–180 mg/dL, interpreted alongside TBR < 70 mg/dL < 4% and TBR < 54 mg/dL < 1%, with TAR > 180 mg/dL < 25% and TAR > 250 mg/dL < 5%, recognizing that goals should be individualized for older or high-risk adults and that adequate data quality and glycemic variability targets underpin safe, actionable interpretation [^114s2vz4] [^1118tsmo].

---

For nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes using CGM, the **goal TIR is > 70%** (70–180 mg/dL) [^114s2vz4], with **TBR < 4% at < 70 mg/dL** and **< 1% at < 54 mg/dL** [^11243yZ1]. These targets align with A1C ~7% and should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk [^111wtfHM] [^114s2vz4]. For older or high-risk adults, a **TIR > 50%** is acceptable, with stricter TBR limits (< 1% at < 70 mg/dL; < 0% at < 54 mg/dL) [^114jAiAv]. CGM use improves TIR and reduces hypoglycemia, supporting these targets in routine care [^112c3VcS] [^117GuHVx].

## Recommended TIR targets for nonpregnant adults with T2D

The ADA and international consensus recommend a **TIR of > 70%** (70–180 mg/dL) for most nonpregnant adults with T2D using CGM [^114s2vz4] [^111z12ry]. This corresponds to an A1C of ~7% and balances glycemic control with hypoglycemia risk [^111wtfHM] [^112ofHH6].

---

## Time below range (TBR) targets

Hypoglycemia mitigation is a key safety goal; **TBR should be < 4% at < 70 mg/dL** and **< 1% at < 54 mg/dL** for most adults [^114s2vz4] [^11243yZ1]. These thresholds help minimize hypoglycemia while pursuing TIR goals [^114s2vz4].

---

## Individualized TIR targets

TIR targets should be **individualized** based on age, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk [^114jAiAv]. For older or high-risk adults, a TIR > 50% is acceptable, with stricter TBR limits (< 1% at < 70 mg/dL; < 0% at < 54 mg/dL) [^1118tsmo] [^114jAiAv].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting TIR targets

CGM use improves TIR and reduces hypoglycemia in T2D, supporting the > 70% TIR target [^112c3VcS] [^111t2kVN]. Higher TIR correlates with better A1C and reduced microvascular complications, reinforcing its clinical relevance [^112ofHH6] [^111wtfHM].

---

## Practical considerations for implementing TIR targets

- **Patient education**: Teach patients to interpret CGM data and act on TIR/TBR trends [^115nNMqm].
- **Clinician training**: Ensure clinicians use standardized CGM reports (e.g. AGP) to guide therapy [^112tJ87A].
- **Individualization**: Adjust targets to patient characteristics and preferences [^114jAiAv].

|-|-|-|-|
| Most adults | > 70% | < 4% | < 1% |

---

The **goal TIR for nonpregnant adults with T2D using CGM is > 70%**, with hypoglycemia limits of < 4% at < 70 mg/dL and < 1% at < 54 mg/dL; targets should be individualized for older or high-risk adults [^114s2vz4] [^1118tsmo].

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114Lnah4]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients (glycemic targets), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain fasting, preprandial, and postprandial blood glucose monitoring in patients with diabetes in pregnancy to achieve optimal glucose levels. Set the following glucose goals: FBG < 95 mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L) and either 1-hour postprandial glucose < 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L) or 2-hour postprandial glucose < 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L).

### Associations between HbA1c and glucose time in range using continuous glucose monitoring in type 1 diabetes: cross-sectional population-based study [^114q4eEc]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The main objectives of treating diabetes mellitus are to optimize glucose levels to prevent hypo- and hyperglycemia, counteract the development of micro- and macrovascular diseases, and strive for a high quality of life. For over 40 years, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has been the established but indirect measure of glucose levels over 2–3 months. However, despite extensive research on its correlation with patient characteristics and health outcomes, there is both inter- and intra-individual variability, and the practical relationship between HbA1c and a person's actual glucose level may seem abstract.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, including real-time CGM (rtCGM) and intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM), allow for the evaluation of new variables in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. In 2019, an international consensus report provided standardized CGM-derived measurements for clinical care, as well as target levels for different patient groups. Key metrics included the percentage of readings and time per day within the target glucose range (TIR, 3.9–10.0 mmol/l, 70–180 mg/dl), time above the target glucose range (TAR), and time below the target glucose range (TBR). TAR can also be divided into TAR level 1 (> 180 mg/dl), and TAR level 2 (> 250 mg/dl), and similarly TBR in level 1 (< 70 mg/dl) and level 2 (< 54 mg/dl). Mean glucose, estimated HbA1c (i.e.g.lucose management indicator, GMI), coefficient of variation (CV), and standard deviation (SD) can also reflect glycemic control. The latest treatment guidelines from the American Diabetes Association also recall that 14-day periods of active CGM use at least 70% of the time should be used to deliver valid data, as well as a target CV equal to or lower than 36%. The same recommendations for nonpregnant adults state that the target levels for HbA1c are < 7% (53 mmol/mol), TIR > 70% with TBR < 4%, but less stringent goals can be applied in individuals with frailty or at high risk of hypoglycemia.

### Time in range and pregnancy outcomes in people with diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring [^114Fnrbf]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The international consensus on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) recommends time in range (TIR) target of > 70% for pregnant people. Our aim was to compare outcomes between pregnant people with TIR ≤ versus > 70%.

Study Design

This study was a retrospective study of all people using CGM during pregnancy from January 2017 to May 2021 at a tertiary care center. All people with pregestational diabetes who used CGM and delivered at our center were included in the analysis. Primary neonatal outcome included any of the following: large for gestational age, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, need for intravenous (IV) glucose, or respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Maternal outcomes included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and delivery outcomes. Logistic regression was used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Results

Of 78 people managed with CGM, 65 (80%) met inclusion criteria. While 33 people (50.1%) had TIR ≤ 70%, 32 (49.2%) had TIR > 70%. People with TIR ≤ 70% were more likely to be younger, have a lower body mass index, and have type 1 diabetes than those with TIR > 70%. After multivariable regression, there was no difference in the composite neonatal outcome between the groups (aOR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.16–1.92). However, neonates of people with TIR ≤ 70% were more likely to be admitted to the NICU (p = 0.035), to receive IV glucose (p = 0.005), to have RDS (p = 0.012), and had a longer hospital stay (p = 0.012) compared with people with TIR > 70%. Furthermore, people with TIR ≤ 70% were more likely to develop hypertensive disorders (p = 0.04) than those with TIR > 70%.

Conclusion

In this cohort, the target of TIR > 70% was reached in about one out of two people with diabetes using CGM, which correlated with a reduction in neonatal and maternal complications.

Key Points

· Among people with diabetes, 50% reached the recommended time in range using CGM. · Time in range > 70% was associated with reducing the rate of some neonatal complications. · Time in range ≤ 70% was associated with increased risk for adverse maternal outcomes.

### Continuous glucose monitoring system in diabetes in pregnancy: a narrative review [^11697Thb]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2025 ADA standards in Diabetes Care recently added a recommendation that CGM metrics may be used in combination with blood glucose monitoring to achieve optimal pre- and postprandial glycemic goals in pregnancy, prior the 2024 standards that CGM metrics did not recommend it as a substitute for BGM metrics. The international consensus on Time in Range (TIR) in 2019 endorses pregnancy glucose goal ranges and goals for TIR for pregnant women with T1D using CGM as reported on the ambulatory glucose profile. Due to the lack of evidence on CGM targets for women with GDM or T2D in pregnancy, percentages of TIR, TBR, and TAR have not been included in that report. Battarbee and colleagues developed a stepwise approach to evaluating CGM data for pregnant with diabetes (Fig. 1). Yet not all CGM devices can currently be adjusted to these pregnancy-specific targets. Therefore, although useful, more evidence is warranted to provide definitive recommendations, and in line with guidelines, we also consider that CGM metrics should be used in combination with blood glucose monitoring to improve glycemic control in pregnancy.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^116Ji3Kd]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Glycemic control — A1C targets for adults and pregnancy state that an A1C level of < 7.0 percent is a reasonable goal for most non-pregnant adults, and a more stringent goal of ≤ 6.5 percent may be considered for some individuals if it can be achieved safely, while a less stringent A1C goal, such as < 8 percent, may be appropriate for those with severe hypoglycemia risk, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, or extensive co-morbid conditions; the American College of Physicians has recommended a glycemic target between 7 percent and 8 percent for most non-pregnant adults with type 2 diabetes, and during pregnancy a consensus statement recommends that women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes maintain an A1C goal of < 6 percent throughout pregnancy if it can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia.

### Continuous glucose monitoring metrics for pregnancies complicated by diabetes: critical appraisal of current evidence [^111wgbJZ]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ascertaining the utility of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pregnancy complicated by diabetes is a rapidly evolving area, as the prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) escalates. The seminal randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating CGM use added to standard care in pregnancy in T1D demonstrated significant improvements in maternal glycemia and neonatal health outcomes. Current clinical guidance recommends targets for percentage time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR), and time below range (TBR) during pregnancy complicated by T1D that are widely used in clinical practice. However, the superiority of CGM over blood glucose monitoring (BGM) is still questioned in both T2D and GDM, and whether glucose targets should be different than in T1D is unknown. Questions requiring additional research include which CGM metrics are superior in predicting clinical outcomes, how should pregnancy-specific CGM targets be defined, whether CGM targets should differ according to gestational age, and if CGM metrics during pregnancy should be similar across all types of diabetes. Limiting the potential for CGM to improve pregnancy outcomes may be our inability to maintain TIR > 70% throughout gestation, a goal achieved in the minority of patients studied. Adverse pregnancy outcomes remain high in women with T1D and T2D in pregnancy despite CGM technology, and this review explores the potential reasons and questions yet to be investigated.

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^112Gv4P3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring targets in pregnancy complicated by PDM — single time in range (TIR) versus traditional targets: There is no RCT comparing a single 24-hour CGM target of 63 to 140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L) with traditional pregnancy glucose targets (fasting 70–95 mg/dL [3.9–5.3 mmol/L], 1-hour postprandial 110–140 mg/dL [6.1–7.8 mmol/L], and 2-hour postprandial 100–120 mg/dL [5.6–6.7 mmol/L]) in pregnancy complicated by PDM. In the absence of comparator studies, the GDP recommended against using a single target of < 140 mg/dL, and the guideline states, we suggest against the routine use of a single target. Ideal glucose targets in PDM are not known.

Table 6.2 — CGM metrics for clinical care in nonpregnant individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes outlines continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) wear requirements and glycemic targets using time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR), time below range (TBR), and coefficient of variation (CV): valid wear is " ≥ 14-day wear for pattern management" with "70% of time active out of 14 days"; CV target is " ≤ 36%"; TAR level 2 hyperglycemia "TAR > 250 mg/dL (> 13.9 mmol/L)" should be " < 5% (most adults); < 10% (older adults)", TAR level 1 "TAR 181–250 mg/dL (10.1–13.9 mmol/L)" should be " < 25% (most adults); < 50% (older adults)"; TIR "TIR 70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L)" should be " > 70% (most adults); > 50% (older adults)"; TBR level 1 "TBR 54–69 mg/dL (3.0–3.8 mmol/L)" should be " < 4% (most adults); < 1% (older adults)", and TBR level 2 "TBR < 54 mg/dL (< 3.0 mmol/L)" should be " < 1%"; a footnote adds that "lower coefficient of variation targets (< 33%) provide additional protection against hypoglycemia for those receiving insulin or sulfonylureas".

### Ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) report in daily care of patients with diabetes: practical tips and recommendations [^112tJ87A]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 1: Standardised Parameters for Glycaemia Assessment

Section 1 of the AGP report presents the 10 CGM metrics that are key to a comprehensive assessment of glycaemic control in people using CGM systems. Their meaning, target values and ranges are presented in Table 1.

Table 1
Standardised assessment of metrics for glucose control in patients using CGM systems

a Ranges and targets for the general population of patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes

b Ranges and targets for older patients and/or those at a high risk of hypoglycaemia

c Ranges and targets for women with type 1 diabetes in pregnancy

The TIR/TAR/TBR ranges for women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy or gestational diabetes are the same as those for women with type 1 diabetes in pregnancy. The specific targets in this patient group have not yet been defined because of limited evidence

Particular weight is given to assessing the percentage of time spent by the patient with glucose readings in the target glycaemic range 70–180 mg/dL. This metric is called time in range (TIR). A recommended target of > 70% time in the 70–180 mg/dL range corresponds approximately to a glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of close to 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), which has been confirmed using data from studies that have reported both %TIR and HbA1c in different patient populations using a variety of CGM devices. Each 10 percentage point increase in %TIR correlates with a reduction in HbA1c percentage of approximately 0.8%. It has been shown that a reduction in %TIR is associated with an increased risk of developing microvascular complications of diabetes. A 10% reduction in TIR is associated with a 64% increase in the risk of retinopathy progression and a 40% increase in the development of albuminuria. In addition, a lower %TIR has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of macrovascular diabetes complications, including cardiovascular mortality. Assessment of changes in %TIR in the AGP report allows for faster and more-accurate adjustments of therapy and treatment recommendations than the evaluation of HbA1c levels. In case of AGP, the analysis can be carried out on an ongoing basis, while HbA1c is usually measured every 3–4 months.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2009 [^113kB1GY]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Recommended glycemic goals for nonpregnant adults are shown in Table 9. The recommendations are based on those for A1C, with listed blood glucose levels that appear to correlate with achievement of an A1C of < 7%. The issue of pre- versus postprandial SMBG targets is complex. Elevated postchallenge (2-h OGTT) glucose values have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of FPG in some epidemiological studies. In diabetic subjects, some surrogate measures of vascular pathology, such as endothelial dysfunction, are negatively affected by postprandial hyperglycemia. It is clear that postprandial hyperglycemia, like preprandial hyperglycemia, contributes to elevated A1C levels, with its relative contribution being higher at A1C levels that are closer to 7%. However, outcome studies have clearly shown A1C to be the primary predictor of complications, and landmark glycemic control trials such as the DCCT and UKPDS relied overwhelmingly on preprandial SMBG. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial presented at the 68th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in June 2008 found no CVD benefit of insulin regimens targeting postprandial glucose compared with those targeting preprandial glucose. A reasonable recommendation for postprandial testing and targets is that for individuals who have premeal glucose values within target but have A1C values above target, monitoring postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) 1–2 h after the start of the meal and treatment aimed at reducing PPG values to < 180 mg/dl may help lower A1C.

As noted above, less stringent treatment goals may be appropriate for adults with limited life expectancies or advanced vascular disease. Glycemic goals for children are provided in Section VII. A.1.a. Severe or frequent hypoglycemia is an absolute indication for the modification of treatment regimens, including setting higher glycemic goals.

Regarding goals for glycemic control for women with GDM, recommendations from the Fifth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus were to target the following maternal capillary glucose concentrations:
preprandial: ≤ 95 mg/dl (5.3 mmol/l) and either 1-h postmeal: ≤ 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) or 2-h postmeal: ≤ 120 mg/dl (6.7 mmol/l)

For women with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes who become pregnant, a recent consensus statement recommended the following as optimal glycemic goals, if they can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia:
premeal, bedtime, and overnight glucose 60–99 mg/dl
peak postprandial glucose 100–129 mg/dl
A1C < 6.0%

### Controlling glycemic variability in people living with type 1 diabetes receiving insulin glargine 300 U / mL (gla-300) [^111z12ry]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

The Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) consensus report on CGM monitoring recommends coefficient of variation (%CV, a mean glucose of 150 mg/dL and an SD of 60 would have a CV of 40%) as the primary measure of glycemic variability, with SD as a secondary measure.CV is prioritized because it is a metric relative to the mean, making it more descriptive of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic excursions than the SD alone. Stable glucose levels are defined as a CV < 36% or, if achievable, < 33%. A glycemic variability above this threshold was associated with an increased risk for hypoglycemia both in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The report also recommends that time in range (TIR), time below range (TBR), time above range (TAR), low blood glucose index (LBGI) and high blood glucose index (HBGI) should be evaluated. The ATTD consensus report on CGM-TIR provides target percentages of time for various levels of TIR, TBR, and TAR. The recommended target for TIR (70–180 mg/dL) is > 70% of readings (> 16 hours 48 min/day). The targets for TBR are < 4% (< 1 hour) at < 70 mg/dL and < 1% (< 15 min) at < 54 mg/dL, while those for TAR are < 25% (< 6 hours) at > 180 mg/dL and < 5% (< 1 hour 12 min) at > 250 mg/dL (online supplemental figure S1). Modified targets are provided for subgroups such as older and high-risk populations and pregnant women.

The ATTD report notes that, even if the recommended targets are not achieved, small improvements, such as a 5% (1.2 hours/day) increase in TIR, can provide a clinically relevant improvement in glycemic control. This recommendation is based on data from several studies that demonstrated a correlation between TIR and HbA1c. An increase in CGM-assessed TIR (70–180 mg/dL) of 10% (2.4 hours/day) corresponded to a reduction in HbA1c of 0.6% in people living with T1D; only limited data are currently available.

### Individualizing time-in-range goals in management of diabetes mellitus and role of insulin: clinical insights from a multinational panel [^114vQMXc]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Insights on TIR Recommendations for Different Complications

CGM should be considered in pregnancy, renal failure, discordance between HbA 1c, and clinical features/SMBG.
TIR is an "additional" measure (along with other glycemic parameters), mainly if more accessible parameters are inconclusive.
There is a need for more longitudinal studies (cross-sectional) to establish TIR as a surrogate marker of complications.
For individuals at high risk of hypoglycemia (renal/hepatic disease): A relaxed target range with a high lower limit is recommended; > 70% TIR in a target blood glucose of 90–180 mg/dL; < 25% TAR and < 5% TBR.
With micro-/macrovascular complications: (i) Microvascular: Same as adults; > 70% TIR in a target blood glucose of 70–180 mg/dL; < 25% TAR and < 5% TBR or > 80% TIR in a target blood glucose of 70–160 mg/dL; < 15% TAR and < 5% TBR. (ii) Macrovascular: Same target as microvascular complications or relaxed as following ≥ 70% TIR in a target blood glucose of 80–180 mg/dL; < 25% TAR and < 5% TBR. While stringent control has shown microvascular benefits, people with macrovascular complications may be at a higher risk of hypoglycemia, and hence relaxed targets are recommended.
With concomitant acute infections: (i) Non-hospitalized: ≥ 75% TIR in a target blood glucose of 80–180 mg/dL; < 20% TAR and < 5% TBR. (ii) Hospitalized: > 80% TIR in a target blood glucose of 140–180 mg/dL; < 15% TAR and < 5% TBR. The cutoffs are kept in this range, assuming that use of antipyretics such as acetaminophen in acute infections can have an effect on CGM readings, giving a false higher value.
Those with fever taking antipyretics and on CGM should undergo cross-check with finger stick method.
In patients with sepsis in ICU: TAR (> 180 mg/dL) should be minimized to < 5% and the lower limit of 70 mg/dL should be pushed to 80 mg/dL to minimize mortality.

### Effect of continuous glucose monitoring on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin: a randomized clinical trial [^112c3VcS]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to be beneficial for adults with type 2 diabetes using intensive insulin therapy, but its use in type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin has not been well studied.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of CGM in adults with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin in primary care practices.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 15 centers in the US (enrollment from July 30, 2018, to October 30, 2019; follow-up completed July 7, 2020) and included adults with type 2 diabetes receiving their diabetes care from a primary care clinician and treated with 1 or 2 daily injections of long- or intermediate-acting basal insulin without prandial insulin, with or without noninsulin glucose-lowering medications.

Interventions

Random assignment 2:1 to CGM (n = 116) or traditional blood glucose meter (BGM) monitoring (n = 59).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at 8 months. Key secondary outcomes were CGM-measured time in target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL, time with glucose level at greater than 250 mg/dL, and mean glucose level at 8 months.

Results

Among 175 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 57 [9] years; 88 women [50%]; 92 racial/ethnic minority individuals [53%]; mean [SD] baseline HbA1c level, 9.1% [0.9%]), 165 (94%) completed the trial. Mean HbA1c level decreased from 9.1% at baseline to 8.0% at 8 months in the CGM group and from 9.0% to 8.4% in the BGM group (adjusted difference, -0.4% [95% CI, -0.8% to -0.1%]; p = 0.02). In the CGM group, compared with the BGM group, the mean percentage of CGM-measured time in the target glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL was 59% vs 43% (adjusted difference, 15% [95% CI, 8% to 23%]; P < .001), the mean percentage of time at greater than 250 mg/dL was 11% vs 27% (adjusted difference, -16% [95% CI, -21% to -11%]; P < .001), and the means of the mean glucose values were 179 mg/dL vs 206 mg/dL (adjusted difference, -26 mg/dL [95% CI, -41 to -12]; P < .001). Severe hypoglycemic events occurred in 1 participant (1%) in the CGM group and in 1 (2%) in the BGM group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin without prandial insulin, continuous glucose monitoring, as compared with blood glucose meter monitoring, resulted in significantly lower HbA1c levels at 8 months.

### Individualizing time-in-range goals in management of diabetes mellitus and role of insulin: clinical insights from a multinational panel [^115CyATW]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

A reliable measurement of GV is provided by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which allows for 24-h real-time measurement of glucose levels, and it can be performed in real time or intermittently. Intermittently viewed monitoring (I-CGM) shows continuous glucose numbers retrospectively. This method of monitoring is an intermediate between a CGM system and a normal blood glucose meter. Unlike I-CGM, real-time CGM (RT-CGM) offers real-time measurement of glucose trends, direction, and the rate of glycemic change. It must be noted that CGM provides results based on measurements of the interstitial fluid and not of blood monitoring; therefore, "real-time" may be a misnomer and delays are a part of this process as well. The development of CGM technology has permitted the creation of new metrics for monitoring glucose, such as GV and the percentage of time spent in target glucose range — called TIR (time-in-range). These metrics provide clinical insights into short-term glycemic control. CGM also provides key inputs to allow algorithm-based insulin delivery.

As a result of the limitations of HbA 1c in monitoring short-term glycemic changes and the emergence of new metrics for monitoring glucose, the term "beyond HbA 1c " has emerged in the field of diabetes research over the past few years. The field of "beyond HbA 1c " includes glucometrics, such as TIR, GV, and the percentage of time in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and person-reported outcomes, i.e. quality-of-life (QoL) assessments. With the increasing accuracy of CGM, blood glucose monitoring in people with diabetes is entering a new era.

Even though there is evidence favoring early initiation of insulin therapy in individuals with poorly controlled diabetes by oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), the optimal use of insulin therapy is delayed by several physician- and person-related barriers. The second-generation basal insulin analogues glargine 300 U/mL (Gla-300) and insulin degludec evidently provide more therapeutic benefits, have lower risk of hypoglycemia, and also possess longer action profiles (> 24 h) compared to first-generation insulin analogues. As compared to first-generation insulin analogues, second-generation analogues offer lower GV and comparable TIR. Further, emerging evidence indicates that these second-generation basal insulin analogues help overcome barriers associated with early insulin use and effectively address parameters involved in moving "beyond HbA 1c ".

### International diabetes federation guideline for management of postmeal glucose: a review of recommendations [^111UJ6ES]. Diabetic Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Question 4: What are the targets for postmeal glycaemic control and how should they be assessed?

A 2-h postmeal goal of < 7.8 mmol/l (< 140 mg/dl) is recommended, in line with targets published in guidelines from other associations. Such guidelines define normal glucose tolerance (NGT) as post-challenge values of < 7.8 mmol/l 2 h after ingestion of a 75-g glucose load, corresponding to postmeal values of healthy individuals after meals. The 2-h time frame for testing is also in agreement with published guidelines and in addition reflects the 2- to 3-h return of postmeal hyperglycaemia to basal levels in individuals with normal glucose tolerance.

The guideline encourages performing glucose monitoring as frequently as needed in order to guide therapy to achieve PMG targets. In particular, the guideline suggests considering self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), as it is the only way to directly assess PMG. However, some degree of controversy surrounds SMBG use, particularly with respect to the frequency of monitoring in non-insulin requiring diabetes. Nevertheless, most professional diabetes organizations continue to advocate its use, generally recommending that self-monitoring is performed at least three times daily in individuals treated with insulin and according to treatment regimen and level of glycaemic control in non-insulin dependent diabetes. What is more, the use of structured SMBG appears to result in a significant reduction in HbA 1c, even in individuals with non-insulin requiring diabetes. These findings support the implementation of SMBG as part of a structured programme that may involve the training of clinicians and patients to accurately interpret results and adjust therapy accordingly in a timely manner.

Glycaemic goals for clinical management of diabetes

HbA 1c < 6.5%
Premeal (fasting) < 5.5 mmol/l (< 100 mg/dl)
Two hours postmeal < 7.8 mmol/l (< 140 mg/dl)

Note: Lower glucose parameters to as near normal as safely possible. Glycaemic targets should be individualized. These goals are not appropriate for children and pregnant women.

Recommendations

Two-hour postmeal plasma glucose should not exceed 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) as long as hypoglycaemia is avoided.
Self-monitoring of blood glucose should be considered because it is currently the most practical method for monitoring postmeal glycaemia.
Efficacy of treatment regimens should be monitored as frequently as needed to guide therapy towards achieving postmeal plasma glucose target.

Continuous glucose monitoring devices — recommendations 7.15–7.21 state: Recommend real-time CGM (rtCGM) or intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) for diabetes management to youth C and adults B with diabetes on any type of insulin therapy, and the choice of CGM device should be made based on the individual's circumstances, preferences, and needs. Consider using rtCGM and isCGM in adults with type 2 diabetes not using insulin to achieve individualized glycemic goals, with the choice of device based on the individual's circumstances, preferences, and needs. In people with diabetes on insulin therapy, rtCGM devices should be used as close to daily as possible for maximal benefit, isCGM devices should be scanned frequently, at minimum once every 8 h, to avoid gaps in data, and people with diabetes should have uninterrupted access to their supplies to minimize gaps in CGM. CGM can help achieve glycemic goals (e.g., time in range and time above range) and may be beneficial for other types of diabetes in pregnancy. In circumstances when consistent use of CGM is not feasible, consider periodic use of personal or professional CGM to adjust medication and/or lifestyle. Skin reactions, either due to irritation or allergy, should be assessed and addressed to aid in successful use of devices, and people who wear CGM devices should be educated on potential interfering substances and other factors that may affect accuracy.

What's new?

The 2GO‐CGM study included a 12‐week randomised controlled phase (rtCGM versus glucometer monitoring), followed by a 12‐week continuation phase in which all participants used rtCGM.
Participants in the study were optimised on new‐generation non‐insulin‐lowering medications (GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i) in line with best practice.
Time in target glucose range was 15 percentage points higher with rtCGM use compared to glucometer use. Older people, current smokers and people living in high areas of deprivation had less improvement in time in target glucose range compared to the overall group.
These findings highlight the benefits of rtCGM on glycaemia in T2D when integrated into specialised care models.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus — glycemic management: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, we suggest using high glycemic variability over time (e.g., fluctuation in HbA1c or fasting blood glucose) as a prognostic indicator for risk of hypoglycemia, morbidity, and mortality. We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus complications, comorbidities, and life expectancy. We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved. In insulin-treated adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not achieving glycemic goals, we suggest real-time continuous glucose monitoring to decrease hypoglycemia and improve HbA1c.

TIR Recommendations for Different Populations and Life Phases

TIR is a useful metric in OAD inadequacy in adults, as OAD inadequacy is usually seen within 5 years in two-thirds of cases.
In T1DM, the lower cutoff may be 80 mg/dL to prevent hypoglycemia.
Adults with T2DM without complications deserve tight control: > 80% in 70–160 mg/dL, as this group is mostly on metformin and the risk of hypoglycemia is low; hence, 70 mg/dL is the acceptable lower limit and TAR < 15%, TBR < 5%.
The definition of TIR needs to be individualized particularly in organ dysfunction, pregnancy, and the elderly.
TIR recommendations based on the four phases of life can be adolescents T1DM/T2DM (10–18 years), adults (> 18 years), pregnancy, and elderly.
For adolescents: A target range of 70–180 mg/dL is acceptable in T1DM and T2DM. Setting the lower limit to a value above 70 mg/dL will suspend insulin too early, which is not recommended. Higher TIR is recommended for T1DM, as they are more prone to GV due to reduced endogenous insulin. (i) In T1DM: > 80% TIR in a target blood glucose of 70–180 mg/dL; < 15% TAR and < 5% TBR (ii) In T2DM: > 70% TIR in a target blood glucose of 70–180 mg/dL; < 25% TAR and < 5% TBR
For adults: As most people with diabetes fall into this category, it is better to strive for tighter control in adults. Hence, two recommendations can be considered for TIR in adults and individualized as needed: (i) Same as ATTD consensus recommendations for T1DM and T2DM: > 70% TIR in a target blood glucose of 70–180 mg/dL; < 25% TAR and < 5% TBR, or (ii) Tighter control: > 80% TIR in a target blood glucose of 70–160 mg/dL; < 15% TAR and < 5% TBR. Tighter control is recommended in people who are highly motivated, newly diagnosed, have a long-life expectancy, and do not have co-morbidities.
For pregnancy: Considering the target range similar to ATTD consensus recommendations, the time spent in the target range should be increased by 10%, as it has the potential to lead to better outcomes: > 80% TIR in a target blood glucose of 63–140 mg/dL; < 15% TAR and < 5% TBR.
For elderly: Targets need to be relaxed with more time spent in the relaxed range, as this group is more susceptible to hypoglycemia; > 80% TIR in a target blood glucose of 90–200 mg/dL; < 15% TAR, < 5% TBR (< 90 mg/dL) < 1% (< 70 mg/dL).
80–90% children aged < 10 years have hypoglycemia unawareness. Thus, the lower limit of TIR should be relaxed.
CGM reading differences with increase in temperature should be taken in account both during physiological (e.g. during summer) and pathological (medication intake such as antipyretic, e.g. acetaminophen) conditions.
The variation between CGM and SMBG is most evident during times when blood glucose levels are rapidly changing.

(Adapted from Battelino et al. 2019)

The Research Society for the Study of Diabetes in India — Endocrine Society of India (RSSDI-ESI) — recommends the use of CGP (including AGP) in association with HbA1c and SMBG in people with T2DM on intensive insulin therapy who fail to achieve glycemic targets. Its use has been recommended in pregnant women with frequent hypoglycemia. For maximum benefits, CGMs are recommended to be used daily. However, diverse patient populations with diabetes have not been aptly covered in the existing guidelines, especially in the Indian context.

Identifying glycemic control targets

The panel decided to adopt the targets established by the International Consensus Report on Time in Range, widely used as a reference for diabetes management with CGM. This consensus recommended glucose targets based on CGM data for different groups, such as people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D), older or high-risk individuals with T1D or T2D, pregnant women with T1D, and women with GD or T2D during pregnancy. Of all the measures, TIR is particularly relevant because it has a high correlation with HbA1c, allows determining the individual metrics for each specific individual, and predicts the risk of complications in people with diabetes. TIR is also helpful in diabetes education because the concept is easier to understand than HbA1c. Glycemic targets for different clinical scenarios are based on the recommendations from the International Consensus on Time in Range.

Regarding high-risk groups for severe hypoglycemia, it is important to highlight that frail older adults — those with diminished physiological reserve and function — are particularly vulnerable to glucose fluctuations. In this population, the primary goal is to minimize hypoglycemia (< 1% of the time < 70 mg/dL) and prevent symptomatic hyperglycemia, prioritizing a TIR ≥ 50% within 70–180 mg/dL while maintaining glycemic variability within safe limits (CV ≤ 36%). Further research is needed to determine whether adjustments to current thresholds are warranted in specific clinical contexts.

The time in tight range (TITR), defined as glucose levels between 70 and 140 mg/dL, is considered a meaningful metric due to its strong correlation with TIR and its inverse association with the development of microvascular complications and cerebrovascular events in people with T1D. The panel considered including TITR, particularly for specific populations such as young children or those using automated insulin delivery. However, due to the limited supporting evidence, regional barriers to advanced CGM technology, and the lack of demonstrated clinical advantage over TIR, it was not included in the glycemic targets at this time.

For pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, the target is to maintain glucose levels between 63–140 mg/dL for at least 70% of the time, as recommended by the international consensus. While some expert opinions suggest a TIR > 90% for pregnant women with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes, supporting evidence remains limited. Observational studies indicate that higher TIR correlates with improved perinatal outcomes. Given the variability in glucose regulation and the potential risk of hypoglycemia, glycemic targets should be individualized based on factors such as glycemic variability, average glucose, and overall maternal risk.

### Expert consensus recommendations on time in range for monitoring glucose levels in people with diabetes: an Indian perspective [^115LahiU]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Several consensus documents and guidelines recommend the incorporation of TIR in routine clinical practice. However, there is a scarcity of consensus recommendations for TIR in different Indian patient profiles. A review of TIR consensus guidelines for the population in India may support HCPs across the country to optimize diabetes management in different patient profiles, potentially improving glycemic control and quality of life for patients. Diabetes management requires varying approaches in different parts of the Western world as it does in India. India is large and diverse and the approach to DM in India needs to suit each unique region.

### Expert recommendations for using time-in-range and other continuous glucose monitoring metrics to achieve patient-centered glycemic control in people with diabetes [^112D5wZm]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2023). Medium credibility.

New metrics for assessing glycemic control beyond HbA1c have recently emerged due to the increasing use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in diabetes clinical practice. Among them, time in range (TIR) has appeared as a simple and intuitive metric that correlates inversely with HbA1c and has also been newly linked to the risk of long-term diabetes complications. The International Consensus on Time in Range established a series of target glucose ranges (TIR, time below range and time above range) and recommendations for time spent within these ranges for different diabetes populations. These parameters should be evaluated together with the ambulatory glucose profile (AGP). Using standardized visual reporting may help people with diabetes and healthcare professionals in the evaluation of glucose control in frequent clinical situations. The objective of the present review is to provide practical insights to quick interpretation of patient-centered metrics based on flash glucose monitoring data, as well as showing some visual examples of common clinical situations and giving practical recommendations for their management.

### Perspectives and behaviors of people with diabetes toward time in range and glucose control in diabetes management: an online survey [^112iHoQR]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

People with diabetes (PwD) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in their care are faced with an increasing number of therapeutic interventions and complex treatment regimens, both pharmaceutical and technological. Recently, we surveyed HCPs about their knowledge of and attitudes to using the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metric of time in range (TIR) to assist in diabetes management. However, understanding PwD, their views on self-management, and their willingness to embrace changes to self-management methods will be critical in determining whether TIR will become widely accepted and used.

For several decades, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c/A1c) has been the key metric of diabetes management for monitoring long-term average glucose control and assessing the risk of diabetes-related complications. However, HbA1c cannot be used to assess day-to-day variability and glucose fluctuations, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Conversely, CGM devices measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid every 1–5 min, providing a more detailed picture of glucose excursions than HbA1c/A1c. A standardized report such as the Ambulatory Glucose Profile provides a visual representation of glucose levels in PwD who use CGM and can aid communication between PwD and HCPs.

Guidelines recommend real-time CGM (rt-CGM) or intermittently scanned CGM (is-CGM) for the management of diabetes in adults with diabetes on multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. TIR, time below range (TBR), and time above range (TAR) are some of the key glucose management metrics available to CGM users. Recommendations from an international consensus on TIR (IC-TIR) set out guidance on target ranges and time spent within target ranges for different diabetes populations. The recommended target range for most people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes is 70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) with a TIR > 70%. However, the consensus also states that targets should be individualized depending on personal needs, patient profile (e.g. elderly, frail, or pregnant), and their circumstances.

Continuous glucose monitoring vs self-monitoring of blood glucose in pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus — recommendation and remarks: In pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we suggest either continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). Frequent glucose monitoring is critical in T2DM in pregnancy to appropriately modify treatment regimens with the increasing insulin resistance of pregnancy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that CGM in pregnancy should be combined with SMBG to achieve optimal pre- and postprandial targets, and if CGM is not used, the standard of care is to continue SMBG 4 times daily. Technical remarks state that both CGM and SMBG are considered reasonable alternatives during pregnancy, there is limited direct evidence of superiority of CGM use in T2DM, CGM may offer a potential advantage over SMBG in certain subgroups of individuals with preexisting T2DM, and ideal glycemic ranges, CGM metrics, and % time in range (TIR) for individuals with T2DM may be different compared to those which have demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in T1DM.

Comments

Because T2DM is a heterogenous disorder of variable insulin resistance and insulin deficiency, certain subgroups may benefit from CGM, including those using pumps, those with more severe insulin deficiency, and those with higher risk for maternal hypoglycemia. Certain individuals, especially those using CGM before pregnancy, may prefer CGM over SMBG given ease of use. Others are likely to value it less due to "sensor fatigue" from alarms, site irritation, and sensor failure. Quality of life and glycemia may improve with continuous rtCGM in some subgroups who use the data to change lifestyle and treatment practices based on real-time data and immediate feedback. Individuals and clinicians should collaborate when deciding if CGM or SMBG will best address the needs of each individual.

A glycemic range between 63–140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L) is currently recommended in pregnancy. The CGM metric for time in range (TIR) in pregnancy is > 70% in T1DM and not defined but possibly > 90% in T2DM. Ideal glycemic range and TIR for pregnancies complicated by all types of diabetes need further study. The recommended TIR by CGM may need to be higher in T2DM than in T1DM, and tighter glycemic targets and a lower mean glucose may need to be achieved earlier in pregnancy in T2DM and in GDM to improve pregnancy outcomes. The risk of hypoglycemia is much lower in T2DM, and other metabolic factors, apart from simply glucose, are likely to contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Continuous glucose monitoring metrics (mean glucose, time above range and time in range) are superior to glycated haemoglobin for assessment of therapeutic efficacy [^116K1uSw]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics for use as alternatives to glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) to evaluate therapeutic efficacy.

Methods

We re-analysed correlations among CGM metrics from studies involving 545 people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 5910 people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 98 people with T1D during pregnancy and the postpartum period.

Results

Three CGM metrics, interstitial fluid Mean Glucose level, proportion of time above range (%TAR) and proportion of time in range (%TIR), were correlated with HbA1c and provided metrics that can be used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. Mean Glucose showed the highest correlation with %TAR (r = 0.98 in T1D, 0.97 in T2D) but weaker correlations with %TIR (r = -0.92 in T1D, -0.83 in T2D) or with HbA1c (r = 0.78 in T1D). %TAR and %TIR were highly correlated (r = -0.96 in T1D, -0.91 in T2D). After 6 months of use of real-time CGM by people with T1D, changes in Mean Glucose level were more highly correlated with changes in %TAR (r = 0.95) than with changes in %TIR (r = -0.85) or with changes in HbA1c level (r = 0.52). These metrics can be combined with metrics of hypoglycaemia and/or glycaemic variability to provide a more comprehensive assessment of overall quality of glycaemic control.

Conclusion

The CGM metrics %TAR and %TIR show much higher correlations with Mean Glucose than with HbA1c and provide sensitive indicators of efficacy. Mean glucose may be the best metric and shows consistently higher correlations with %TAR than with %TIR.

Educate on the Importance of Individualized A1C Targets

It is important that people living with T2D understand the concept of A1C, it is a historical measurement, and the reasons for setting A1C targets. The ADA Standards of Care state that for many non-pregnant adults, an A1C target of < 7% is appropriate; however, they add that this should be adapted based on characteristics such as age, disease duration, and other illness. For example, for healthy older people with T2D (i.e. those with few coexisting chronic illnesses and intact cognitive function and functional status), A1C goals of between 7% and 7.5% are appropriate, while for those with limited life expectancy, or where the harms of treatment are greater than the benefit, less stringent A1C goals (for example, 8%) may be appropriate. The ADA Standards of Care recommend that glycemic status is assessed twice a year for those with stable glycemia, whereas in people who have recently changed therapy and/or who are not meeting glycemic goals, it should be assessed more frequently, for example quarterly, or as needed.

As A1C is an indirect measure of glycemia over time, it is important to differentiate it from other blood glucose tests, such as fasting or postprandial tests, which are used to measure glucose levels at any one time point.

Advise the Use of Home Glucose Monitoring

People who actively manage their blood glucose can gain better control of their T2D compared with those who do not. The use of self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can provide valuable information for many patients. The patient and the HCP should discuss patient preference regarding the frequency of testing and recommendations made thereafter. People with T2D need to be aware that the frequency of blood glucose monitoring varies according to treatment. For example, the usual recommendation for blood glucose monitoring when receiving basal insulin is before breakfast or bedtime, but this is increased for regimens that require multiple injections of insulin. The HCP should explain to the patient how these readings are used to interpret overall glycemic control and to assess for fasting and/or postprandial hyper- or hypoglycemia, and to guide dose adjustments and food choices. Use of SMBG/CGM provides an opportunity to enhance the HCP–patient relationship through information that can be used to support and educate the patient, and inform overall shared decision-making.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to monitoring of glycemic status, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to assess glycemic status by HbA1c
and/or appropriate continuous glucose monitoring metrics, such as time in range, time above range, and time below range. Consider obtaining fructosamine or continuous glucose monitoring for glycemic monitoring when an alternative to HbA1c is required.

### Glucose biosensing: adding time in range to your toolbox… [^112EvxCZ]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

A1C has been recognized as a metric to gauge the long-term complication risk for those living with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Expressing the average glucose level over the previous 2–3 months, A1C has limitations that include the absence of information concerning glycemic variability, short-term complications of hyper- and hypoglycemia, and glycemic excursions. Additionally, A1C values can be invalidated by certain states of health, such as iron deficiency, anemia, pregnancy and hemoglobinopathies, and even by race or ethnicity. 1 Unlike A1C testing, continuous glucose monitoring provides data concerning daily glucose profiles, glucose variability and glycemic excursions. 1 This data can guide short-term and long-term decision-making. Time in range is a high-powered metric and companion to A1C. Individuals living with diabetes can use TIR to have a more comprehensive picture of their glucose that can only be measured using CGM.

TIR identifies the percentage of time glucose levels are within a target range. For most individuals living with diabetes, the target range is between 70 and 180 mg/dL. 1 The daily goal for most people living with T1D and T2D is > 70% TIR. 1 To learn more about TIR, read "Beyond A1C: the importance of time in range" on SIGMA's CGM Resource Guide. Use of standardized TIR metrics can foster shared decision-making and progress towards common goals for those living with diabetes and their family physician. The goal is to optimize TIR without increasing hypoglycemia. Each 5% increase in TIR is considered clinically significant, 1 and for every 10% increase in TIR, there is approximately a 0. 8% reduction in A1C.
2. A1C values can look similar from one patient to the next, but their individualized CGM patterns will drive very different discussions and treatment plans.

These discussions can be strength focused and engage the individual by using CGM to make positive changes for health.

### Defining continuous glucose monitor time in range in a large, community-based cohort without diabetes [^116pyFeK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 152 participants (12.9%) had diabetes, 463 participants (39.4%) had prediabetes, and 560 participants (47.7%) had normoglycemia. Normoglycemic participants had a mean age of 58.8 years, 64.1% were women, and 93.2% were non-Hispanic White (Table 1). Participants in the prediabetes and diabetes groups were older, 88% to 89% non-Hispanic White, and included higher proportions of men.

All CGM metrics increased across glycemic status groups, further evidenced by increasing proportions of time spent in higher glucose ranges (see Table 1). Mean glucose had a similar distribution and was only 8.6 mg/dL higher in prediabetes compared to normoglycemia (123.1 vs 114.5 mg/dL); a majority of participants from both groups had a mean glucose between 100 and 140 mg/dL (Fig. 1). In normoglycemic participants, almost 98% of time was spent in the 70 to 180 mg/dL range, but less than 87% of time was in the 70 to 140 mg/dL range, with 11% of time at 140 to 180 mg/dL and 1.3% of time (> 15 minutes/day) at greater than 180 mg/dL (see Table 1). Hence, normoglycemic participants (without elevated fasting venous glucose or HbA 1c) spent approximately 3 hours/day (12.3% time) with CGM glucose at 140 mg/dL. Most normoglycemic participants had a maximum glucose level greater than 180 mg/dL, but rarely greater than 250 mg/dL (Fig. 2).

### Clinical targets for continuous glucose monitoring data interpretation: recommendations from the international consensus on time in range [^114T5oa3]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Improvements in sensor accuracy, greater convenience and ease of use, and expanding reimbursement have led to growing adoption of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). However, successful utilization of CGM technology in routine clinical practice remains relatively low. This may be due in part to the lack of clear and agreed-upon glycemic targets that both diabetes teams and people with diabetes can work toward. Although unified recommendations for use of key CGM metrics have been established in three separate peer-reviewed articles, formal adoption by diabetes professional organizations and guidance in the practical application of these metrics in clinical practice have been lacking. In February 2019, the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) Congress convened an international panel of physicians, researchers, and individuals with diabetes who are expert in CGM technologies to address this issue. This article summarizes the ATTD consensus recommendations for relevant aspects of CGM data utilization and reporting among the various diabetes populations.

### Time in range clinical targets and treatment modality among youths with diabetes… [^116WXkyL]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In this multinational cohort study including 5219 children, adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes, the proportion of individuals achieving the recommended time in range target was associated with treatment modality. Users of real-time CGM concurrently with an insulin pump were the most likely to achieve the more than 70% time in, less than 25% time above, and less than 4% time below range clinical targets, had the adjusted highest time in range, and were the least likely to experience severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis events. Treatment modality was associated with the proportion of individuals achieving recommended clinical targets. Adjusted for sex, age, diabetes duration, and body mass index standard deviation score, the proportion achieving the recommended greater than 70% time in range target was highest with real-time CGM plus insulin pump use, followed by.

Similar trends were observed for less than 25% time above using intermittently scanned CGM with and 1231 without an insulin pump, and 2252 using real-time CGM with and 886 without an insulin pump. Real-time CGM plus insulin pump use was the modality most likely to achieve recommended greater than 70% time in range clinical target, followed by real-time CGM plus injection use and less than 4% time below range clinical target, where the highest proportions achieving recommended targets were observed (73. 1% for real-time CGM plus insulin pump use.

There is accumulating evidence that youths with type 1 diabetes and parents of younger children with type 1 diabetes may use CGM to focus on avoiding hypoglycemia rather than improving time in range and preventing hyperglycemia. 34 Nevertheless, the proportion of participants who achieved the consensus target of greater than 70% time in.

To avoid hypoglycemia, providing treatment that can control blood glucose levels and at the same time minimize interday and intraday GV is important. Mori et al. conducted a study to assess the actual state of interday GV and identify factors affecting GV in diabetic outpatients on insulin therapy. Interday GV was seen in 93% of outpatients, and 62% of patients showed inconsistent interday GV. Interday variability was associated with the following factors: gender (higher in women compared to men, p = 0.04), diabetes type (higher in people with T1DM compared to those with T2DM, p < 0.001), dose of insulin (mean of the daily differences [MODD] correlated positively with total insulin dose, bolus insulin dose, and basal insulin but not with bolus dose to basal dose ratio; p = 0.001, 0.016, 0.001, and 0.361, respectively), and treatment regimen (MODD value highest in individuals treated with basal and bolus insulin and lowest in those treated with mixed preparations). The study indicated that treatment and instructions based on individuals' characteristics, interday GV, and lifestyle are important for people receiving insulin therapy.

Connecting the Dots: Time-in-Range and Impact on Diabetes Outcomes

Advancements in CGM technology have provided access to alternative indices and new metrics of glucose control. Among these metrics, TIR has emerged as a preferred measure among individuals with diabetes. Also, emerging evidence indicates that TIR can predict long-term complications of diabetes and pregnancy outcomes. However, in the case of physicians who are mostly familiar with HbA 1c and blood glucose measurements, it might be difficult to understand and explain TIR goals to patients, position TIR in comparison to other glucose metrics, and interpret TIR. The Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) international consensus on the use of CGM 2017 standardized the use of CGM to promote therapy adjustments in people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially those with frequent hypoglycemia. Before the 2017 consensus, different studies used different time-in-target ranges, and hence one study could not be compared with another. To overcome such variations and discrepancies, the ATTD consensus categorized hypoglycemia into three levels:

### Episodic real-time CGM use in adults with type 2 diabetes: results of a pilot randomized controlled trial [^114wivab]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Resistance to initiating insulin therapy is common for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using multiple oral agents, resulting in sustained poor glycemic control. We explored a non-pharmacologic option and examined whether adults with T2D and elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) who were using multiple, non-insulin antihyperglycemics could obtain glycemic benefit from limited, episodic use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM).

Methods

A randomized, pilot trial enrolled patients with T2D who were using two or more non-insulin therapies and had HbA1c values of 7.8–10.5%. Following a baseline, 10-day, blinded CGM session, participants were randomized 2:1, rtCGM or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Medication changes were not made during the 12-week study unless required for safety; benefits would result from lifestyle changes. The rtCGM group used unblinded rtCGM for three sessions at weeks 0, 4, and 8, and the control group managed diabetes with SMBG and wore blinded rtCGM at week 8. Glycemic endpoints were assessed.

Results

Seventy participants were enrolled from eight North American sites and data were available from 68 (n = 45 rtCGM; n = 23 SMBG). Median (IQR) baseline HbA1c was 8.4 (0.8)% and 8.3 (1.2)% and median (IQR) change in HbA1c at week 12 was - 0.5 (1.3)% and - 0.2 (1.1)% for the rtCGM and SMBG groups, respectively (between-group difference p = 0.74). More than one-third (34.1%) of the rtCGM group vs 17.4% of the SMBG group reached the HbA1c goal of less than 7.5% at week 12 (between-group difference p = 0.12). Compared to run-in, mean (SD) time in range (TIR 70–180 mg/dL) at week 8 increased for the rtCGM group (56.3 [24.5]% vs 63.1 [25.5]%) while it decreased for the SMBG group (68.4 [21.5]% vs 55.1 [30.3]%). HbA1c reductions were not sustained at month 9.

Conclusion

In this pilot study, limited episodic rtCGM use in people failing multiple non-insulin therapies resulted in modest, short-term glycemic benefits.

Single Continuous Glucose Monitor Glycemic Target vs Standard-of-Care Pregnancy Fasting and Postprandial Targets

Background

Since the CONCEPTT randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated a reduction in rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants and neonatal hypoglycemia with the addition of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pregnancies complicated by type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), CGM is increasingly used in pregnancy. Currently recommended, long-standing glycemic targets in pregnancy are:

Fasting glucose 70–95 mg/dL (3.9–5.3 mmol/L)
1-hour postprandial glucose 110–140 mg/dL (6.1–7.8 mmol/L)
2-hour postprandial glucose 100–120 mg/dL (5.6–6.7 mmol/L)

In 2019, with the advent of CGM, the International Consensus on Time in Range recommended that the time in range (TIR) in pregnancy be defined as 63 to 140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L) using the definition chosen in previous studies in predominantly T1DM in pregnancy, which generally used traditional fasting and postprandial targets for insulin adjustment. The International Consensus in Time in Range further suggested that the TIR metric for T1DM be more than 70% (63–140 mg/dL [3.5–7.8 mmol/L]) based on data from CONCEPTT. The metric was left undefined for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to lack of data, but > 90% (63–140 mg/dL [3.5–7.8 mmol/L]) is often suggested for T2DM.

TIR for Pregnant Women with T1DM/T2DM or GDM

For a woman with T1DM planning to conceive, having ≥ 70% TIR within 70–140 mg/dL should be considered.
For a woman with T2DM, or first-time detected hyperglycemic woman during pregnancy, or for GDM, having a TIR ≥ 90% within the 70–140 mg/dL range should be considered.

TIR for Elderly Population with T1DM or T2DM

In elderly patients, those with a high risk of hypoglycemia, unawareness of hypoglycemia, or established cardiovascular disease (CVD), ≥ 50% TIR is suggested to be the goal, and with < 1% for time below 54 mg/dL.

For Pandemic Situation

Since patients are more dependent on partial self-care in hospitals during the pandemic, the use of TIR is crucial in therapy-related decision-making among hospitalized non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) patients.
In the context of the pandemic, CGM is cost effective. Therefore, it is strongly recommended
The use of TIR needs further validation in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting.
TIR is very useful for at-home patients affected by the pandemic for self-care.

Overall Recommendations

For the management of glucose for patients living with diabetes, the use of TIR provided by CGM with the use of HbA1c can be regarded as the new SOC, other glucose metrics including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial glucose (PPG) can also be considered, and one must be mindful regarding the few limitations of CGM as it is based on interstitial fluid measurements.
Awareness of TIR should be increased both among physicians and patients.
Overall, apart from the ICU setting, in every pandemic situation, including homecare, post hospitalization, quarantine, and in-hospital, the use of TIR is strongly recommended.
There is often discordance between CGM and glucometer readings of glucose levels, which should also be kept in mind. However, with the advent of recent CGM devices, such as the FreeStyle Libre system, such discordance has become less frequent.

Time in Range as a Powerful Metric for Glycemic Control

Time in range (above, below, or within the glucose target) is a powerful metric, which is very effective in capturing dynamic variations in blood glucose levels. Recent studies on TIR have demonstrated its versatility in ensuring glycemic control. The descriptions on TIR and the use of standardized CGM report have been officially included into the American Diabetes Association (ADA) standard of care (SOC) since 2020, and have been recommended for assessment of glycemic control. Furthermore, as per ADA SOC 2022, a single-page standardized CGM report such as ambulatory glucose profile needs to be considered as a standard format for all CGM devices. Also, recommendations regarding frequency and interpretations of CGM data were included. Multiple randomized trials such as DIAMOND and IMPACT have demonstrated the superiority of CGM over SMBG in achieving glycemic control, while the REPLACE study suggested that CGM could safely and effectively replace SMBG.

The current guidelines recommend a range of 70–180 mg/dL (3.9–10 mmol/L) for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM or T2DM). However, for pregnant women with T1DM, T2DM, or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a target range of 63–140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L) is recommended.

Second, we believe this formula can be used by academic or industry clinical trial teams, to help them determine a suitable duration of the study. Furthermore, the value of the standard deviation provided by the formula could also be used in power calculations, for example, to determine the number of participants needed in a trial. This will help with designing better studies, providing more accurate results. To support academic colleagues around the world, we have developed an online calculator that we have made freely available and which facilitates the use of the formulas in performing the tasks mentioned above.

In conclusion, together with standard power calculation tools, this formula allows optimization of the cost‐benefit ratio of a clinical trial: trials with too many subjects monitored for too long expose the subjects to unnecessary risks. Trials with too few subjects monitored for too short a duration do not permit collection of conclusive scientific evidence and thus waste patients' time and risk exposure. Statistical tools for an effective cost‐benefit balance in clinical trials are important for all subjects, but they become essential when recruiting a minority of underprivileged patients.

Future developments include exploring relaxed mathematical assumptions under which the formula is derived, as well as further validation on datasets collected in wider and more heterogeneous populations. We also plan to explore the possibility of optimizing the formula's parameters for specific populations (e.g. type 2 diabetes, pregnant and paediatric) and for different co‐variates (e.g. HbA1c, diabetes duration, body weight, CGM sensor model and insulin therapy).

### Time in range, as measured by continuous glucose monitor, as a predictor of microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review [^111wtfHM]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) is the primary tool for monitoring long-term glycemic control and assessing the risk of diabetes-related complications. However, A1c has several limitations. A1c is affected by factors such as age, race/ethnicity, hemoglobinopathies, hemolytic anemia, recent blood transfusion, chronic kidney disease, and pregnancy, resulting in discrepancies between measured A1c and true glycemic control. Furthermore, A1c fails to provide information about extremes of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, glucose trends, and glycemic variability. Intermittent self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) is not influenced by conditions affecting red blood cell turnover and provides information beyond A1c; however, it is inconvenient and unpopular among patients of all age groups.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices are increasingly popular, affordable, reliable in improving A1c, and overcome many of the limitations with A1c, and SMBG and CGM-derived metrics are now incorporated into the management of patients with diabetes.CGM devices measure interstitial fluid glucose every 1–5 min and provide several metrics. Mean glucose from CGM has also been used to calculate glucose management indicator (GMI), also known as 'estimated A1C'. Time in range (TIR) is another metric, defined as the percentage of time glucose between 70 mg/dL and 180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L). Over the last few years, TIR has become popular as a surrogate marker of glycemic control, which also correlates with A1c. International consensus recommends TIR of 70% to align with A1c of ~7%, with a 0.5% decline in A1c per 10% increase in TIR. Furthermore, a 5% increase in TIR was associated with significant clinical benefits among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

### Preexisting diabetes and pregnancy: an endocrine society and European Society of Endocrinology joint clinical practice guideline [^116ggYtq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In practice, the recommended TIR is being used as a target instead of a metric and thereby targeting higher nocturnal and premeal levels of glycemia, despite the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommendation that CGM metrics should not be used as a substitute for fasting and postprandial glucose targets. The effect of using different targets on pregnancy outcomes is unclear, and this is critical due to evidence that glucose targets are strongly associated with maternal and neonatal outcomes. In fact, the International Consensus on Time in Range noted in their recommendation that "Recent data suggest that even more stringent targets and greater attention to overnight glucose profiles may be required… "

Even mild hyperglycemia in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including LGA and neonatal hypoglycemia. Therefore, establishing ideal glycemic targets is critical.

Question 7. Should a single continuous glucose monitor target < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) be used vs standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting < 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1 hour postprandial < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) in individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus using continuous glucose monitoring?

Recommendation 7

In individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), we suggest against the use of a single 24-hour CGM target < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting < 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remarks
When CGM is used in individuals with preexisting diabetes, providers and patients should use fasting and postprandial glucose targets (whether measured by CGM or SMBG) as the basis for insulin adjustment and not a single glucose target of 63–140 mg/dL.
When using CGM in conjunction with HCL, providers should be aware that not all HCL algorithms can meet these targets.
This recommendation applies to all types of PDM, including T1DM and T2DM.
There are limited data on the appropriate lower limit of the target for fasting or postprandial glucose in pregnancy.

### Management of diabetes in pregnancy: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^113iy4jR]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pregnancy — targets and device selection — notes that real-time CGM in pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes showed a mild improvement in A1C and significant improvements in maternal time in range (TIR) and time above range (TAR), without an increase in hypoglycemia, and reductions in large-for-gestational-age births, length of infant hospital stays, and severe neonatal hypoglycemia; there are insufficient data to support the use of CGM in all people with type 2 diabetes or GDM, and whether to use CGM should be individualized based on treatment, circumstances, preferences, and needs. Asymptomatic hypoglycemia measured by intermittently scanning CGM (isCGM) should therefore not necessarily lead to a reduction of insulin dose and/or increased carbohydrate intake at bedtime unless confirmed by blood glucose meter measurements, and selection of CGM device should be based on an individual's circumstances, preferences, and needs. Goals for sensor glucose ranges in pregnancy are sensor glucose range 63–140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L) with TIR, goal > 70%; TBR (< 63 mg/dL [< 3.5 mmol/L]): level 1 TBR, goal < 4%; TBR (< 54 mg/dL [< 3.0 mmol/L]): level 2 TBR, goal < 1%; and TAR (> 140 mg/dL [> 7.8 mmol/L]): TAR, goal < 25%; goals for time spent in each range are specific for pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes.

"In a multicentre international randomized controlled trial (CONCEPTT) the continuous glucose monitoring in pregnant women with T1DM showed strong correlation of TIR with better outcomes The same group recently used rt-CGM and isCGM in 186 pregnant women to understand to what extent are CGM-derived measure of glucose control associated with large for gestational age infant (LGA) and neonatal outcome. Using either Dexcom G4 or Freestyle Libre CGM device Kristensen et al. calculated TIR, below or above pregnancy glucose target, CV%, SD of mean glucose, mean amplitude of glucose excursion (MAGE). They found no difference in maternal or neonatal outcomes between women using rt-CGM and isCGM and demonstrated that 5–7% lower TIR during the second and third trimesters was associated with increased risk of LGA and neonatal outcome, including macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia. Interestingly, they support the non-inferior use of isCGM as technology ease of use, low cost, safe and accurate in pregnancy. In a commentary of this study, Helen Murphy suggests that for optimal obstetric and neonatal outcomes, women should aim to reach a TIR > 70% and a time above range < 25%, as early as possible during pregnancy. Those who can't achieve this target should be encouraged that any 5% increase in TIR is associated with clinically relevant improvements in neonatal health".

### Applications of continuous glucose monitoring across settings and populations: report from the 23rd Hong Kong diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors-east meets west symposium [^114JzLsm]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is now an integral part of glycaemic management in people with type 1 diabetes and those with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes. Immediate access to information on CGM glucose levels and trends helps to inform food choices, titration and timing of insulin doses and prompts corrective actions in the event of impending hypo- or hyperglycaemia. Although glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) remains an important measure of the average of glucose, CGM metrics including time-in-range (TIR) and other metrics on glycaemic variability and hypoglycaemia are strongly endorsed by people with diabetes as impacting their daily lives. There is growing consensus on definitions and targets of CGM metrics with an increasing number of studies demonstrating correlations between CGM metrics and incident complications of diabetes. Implementation of new technologies needs to take into consideration factors such as cost-effectiveness, accessibility as well as acceptability of the person with diabetes and healthcare professional. The United Kingdom is one of the few countries that have developed clinical pathways for integrating CGM into the routine care of people with type 1 diabetes. Besides type 1 diabetes, special groups such as people with impaired kidney function and women during pregnancy may derive additional benefits from CGM.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an opportunity for diabetes healthcare professionals to use continuous glucose monitoring technology to remotely deliver diabetes services to support people with diabetes. This opportunity can be maximized with improved application and interpretation of continuous glucose monitoring-generated data. Amongst the diverse measures of glycaemic control, time in range is considered to be of high value in routine clinical care because it is actionable and is visibly responsive to changes in diabetes management. Importantly, it is also been linked to the risk of developing complications associated with diabetes and can be understood by people with diabetes and healthcare professionals alike. The 2019 International Consensus on Time in Range has established a series of target glucose ranges and recommendations for time spent within these ranges that is consistent with optimal glycaemic control. The recommendations cover people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with separate targets indicated for elderly people or those at higher risk from hypoglycaemia, as well as for women with type 1 diabetes during pregnancy. The aim of this best practice guide was to clarify the intent and purpose of these international consensus recommendations and to provide practical insights into their implementation in UK diabetes care.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring vs Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose in Individuals With Preexisting Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Background

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is now higher than type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in many obstetric populations, continues to rise rapidly, and has more than tripled in the last 10 years in some populations. Some adverse pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirths, cesarean deliveries, Infants large for gestational age (LGA), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions, are higher in individuals with T2DM than in those with T1DM due to greater prevalence of comorbidities, including obesity, hypertension, renal disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. As a result, improving pregnancy outcomes in T2DM may require optimizing numerous factors in addition to improving the degree of glycemia and may require different targets for glycemia compared with T1DM.

Frequent glucose monitoring is critical in T2DM in pregnancy to appropriately modify treatment regimens with the increasing insulin resistance of pregnancy. Although continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use in T1DM is considered standard of care, the current standard in T2DM is self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (fasting and either 1 or 2 hours postprandial). Ease of use and increasing access to CGM technology means that more individuals with T2DM are interested in using CGM during pregnancy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that CGM in pregnancy should be combined with SMBG to achieve optimal pre- and postprandial targets. If CGM is not used, the standard of care is to continue SMBG 4 times daily.

Question 6. Should a continuous glucose monitor vs no continuous glucose monitor (self-monitoring blood glucose as standard of care) be used in pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus?

Recommendation 6

In pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we suggest either continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remarks
Both CGM and SMBG are considered reasonable alternatives for monitoring glucose during pregnancy, however, in individuals with T2DM, there is limited direct evidence of superiority of CGM use. CGM may offer a potential advantage over SMBG in certain subgroups of individuals with preexisting T2DM.
Ideal glycemic ranges, CGM metrics, and % time in range (TIR) for individuals for T2DM may be different compared to those which have demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in T1DM.

American Association of Clinical Endocrinology 2022 guideline — continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pregnancy notes that CGM may help women achieve glucose goals and reduce hypoglycemia, can accurately identify glycemic patterns in pregnant women with diabetes mellitus (DM), and randomized controlled trial (RCT) data on maternal and fetal outcomes are limited and inconsistent; in the CONCEPTT study, CGM use versus capillary glucose monitoring showed a modest reduction in A1C, increased time in target, reduced hypoglycemia, less glycemic variability, and lower rates of large-for-gestational-age, neonatal intensive care admissions lasting more than 24 hours, and neonatal hypoglycemia, with shorter hospital stay. Although evidence is not strong to support CGM for maternal or neonatal benefits in pregnant women with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and GDM, it may be used in selected persons at risk for hypoglycemia, especially those treated with insulin.

### Real-time continuous glucose monitoring in pregnancies with gestational diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial [^1144J1eM]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM; intervention) with capillary blood glucose (CBG) monitoring (control) alone to achieve greater percent glucose time in range (%TIR) among pregnant individuals diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Research Design and Methods

This was an open-label, single-center, randomized controlled trial of pregnant individuals with GDM and ≥ 20 weeks' gestation. Subjects were randomly assigned (2:1) to use real-time CGM plus adjunctive CBG versus CBG alone for glucose monitoring. The intervention group was instructed on the continuous use of the Dexcom G6 CGM system from enrollment to admission for delivery. The control group used CBG monitoring four times per day underwent blinded CGM approximately every 20 days throughout the study period. The primary outcome was the CGM %TIR defined as 60–140 mg/dL (3.3–7.8 mmol/L) from study enrollment until hospital admission for delivery.

Results

A total of 111 participants were enrolled between February 2021 and June 2023 (n = 74 in intervention group; n = 37 in control group) with no statistical differences in demographic characteristics between the groups. The CGM group had significantly higher %TIR ± SD (93 ± 6 min vs. 88 ± 14 min at 60–140 mg/dL; P = 0.027). Among key secondary CGM metric outcomes, the intervention group had significantly higher daytime TIR with lower 24-h and daytime mean glucose and percent time > 140 mg/dL compared with the control group.

Conclusions

We demonstrated a significantly higher %TIR using real-time CGM compared with CBG glucose monitoring among pregnant people with GDM. Studies are needed to determine if achieving lower CGM glucose levels can improve perinatal and neonatal outcomes.

### Consensus statement on standardizing CGM evaluation metrics in latin America: an expert approach [^111zi1uX]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Formal uptake into professional guidelines has been limited until recently; Chapter 8 of the 2022 ISPAD Clinical Practice Consensus Guidelines, aimed at children, adolescents and young adults — now endorses specific CGM targets (e.g. ≥ 70% time in range 70–180 mg/dL, ≤ 4% < 70 mg/dL).

A key outcome of the consensus panel was the endorsement of "time in ranges" (TIR) as a superior metric for glycemic control compared to HbA1c alone. TIR, is the percentage of time that glucose levels remain within a specified target range, typically between 70 and 180 mg/dL for individuals with diabetes. The panel provided specific TIR targets tailored to different diabetes populations, including type 1, type 2, pregnant women, and older individuals at higher risk. Additionally, the panel recommended using the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) as the standardized visual report for interpreting CGM data. Standardized measures help clinicians and patients discuss glucose trends effectively, enabling timely, informed diabetes management adjustments. The adoption of these recommendations is expected to enhance the clinical utility of CGM data, translating technological progress into tangible improvements in diabetes care.

A fundamental principle emphasized by the panel is that goal-setting must be individualized, taking into account the unique needs and capabilities of each person with diabetes. Studies have demonstrated that setting small, realistic goals not only improves diabetes self-management but also fosters long-term behavioral changes. The use of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) framework was identified as a useful tool for establishing CGM-based targets, reducing the time in hypoglycemia to less than one hour daily, facilitating adherence. This highlights the need for personalized, stepwise interventions and a collaborative approach in diabetes management.

For specific populations, such as children, adolescents, and young adults, the panel recognized that glycemic targets must balance optimal glucose control with considerations of safety, quality of life, and burden of care. For women planning pregnancy or those already pregnant, early attainment of glycemic targets is crucial for both fetal and maternal health.

### Time-in-range and frequency of continuous glucose monitoring: recommendations for south Asia [^112ufUmn]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

The prevalence of diabetes is on its rise and South Asia bears a huge burden. Several factors such as heterogeneity in genetics, socio-economic factors, diet, and sedentary behavior contribute to the heightened risk of developing diabetes, its rapid progression, and the development of complications in this region. Even though there have been considerable advances in glucose monitoring technologies, diabetes treatments and therapeutics, glycemic control in South Asia remains suboptimal. The successful implementation of treatment interventions and metrics for the attainment of glycemic goals depends on appropriate guidelines that accord with the characteristics of the diabetes population.

Method

The data were collected from studies published for more than the last ten years in the electronic databases PubMed and Google Scholar on the various challenges in the assessment and achievement of recommended TIR targets in the SA population using the keywords: Blood glucose, TIR, TAR, TBR, HbA1c, hypoglycemia, CGM, Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and diabetes.

Results

The objective of this recommendation is to discuss the limitations in considering the IC-TIR Expert panel recommendations targets and to propose some modifications in the lower limit of TIR in older/high-risk population, upper limit of TAR, and flexibility in the percentage of time spent in TAR for pregnant women (GDM, T2DM) for the South Asian population.

Conclusion

The review sheds insights into some of the major concerns in implementing the IC-TIR recommendations in South Asian population where the prevalence of diabetes and its complications are significantly higher and modifications to the existing guidelines for use in routine clinical practice.

### Management of individuals with diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1178XRQN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pregnancy and planning pregnancy: In pregnant patients, CGM likely decreases the time below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (MD −1.00%; 95% CI, −1.60 to −0.41) and may increase the percentage of TIR 70 to 180 mg/dL (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) (MD 7.00%; 95% CI, 2.57 to 11.43), with no difference in time below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). In the population planning pregnancy, CGM may reduce time below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (MD 1.00%; 95% CI, 0.20 to 1.80), with no difference in episodes of severe hypoglycemia, time below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), or the percentage of TIR 70 to 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L). The accepted TIR for pregnancy is lower at 63 to 140 mg/dL (3.5 to 7.8 mmol/L).

Recommendation 6

In pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we suggest either continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remarks
Both CGM and SMBG are considered reasonable alternatives for monitoring glucose during pregnancy; however, in individuals with T2DM, there is limited direct evidence of superiority of CGM use. CGM may offer a potential advantage over SMBG in certain subgroups of preexisting T2DM.
Ideal glycemic ranges, CGM metrics, and % time in range for individuals for T2DM may be different compared to those which have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Question 7. Should a single continuous glucose monitoring target of < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) be used vs standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting < 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) in individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus using continuous glucose monitoring?

Recommendation 7

In individuals with preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), we suggest against the use of single 24-hour CGM target < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting < 95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial < 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) (2 | ⊕OOO).

Technical remark
When CGM is used in individuals with PDM, providers and patients should use fasting and postprandial glucose targets (whether measured by CGM or self-monitoring of blood glucose) as the basis for insulin adjustment and not a single glucose target of 63–140 mg/dL.
When using CGM in conjunction with HCL, providers should be aware that not all HCL algorithms can meet these targets.
This recommendation applies to all types of PDM, including type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
There are limited data on the appropriate lower limit of the target for fasting or postprandial glucose in pregnancy.

### Early optimization of T2D management with CGM… [^1165emFF]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite advancements and improved availability of therapeutic options in diabetes management, outcomes defined by hemoglobin A1C have declined over the last two decades. Specifically, NHANES data indicate that the percentage of people with diabetes with A1C values < 7% has decreased from 57. 4% in the 2007–2010 analysis to
50. 5% in the 2015–2018 analysis. 1 Studies show that when glycemic goals are not met, the median time for a person to be prescribed an additional diabetes medication can range from one to seven years. 2, 3 Delaying treatment intensification by just one year when glucose is above target has been associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and composite cardiovascular events.
4. Optimizing glycemic management to an A1C level < 6. 5% within the first year of a type 2 diabetes diagnosis 5 is fundamental to maximizing the protection against micro- and macrovascular complications.

6 Continuous glucose monitoring is proven to significantly improve A1C and time in range among people with T2D regardless of insulin. 7 or non-insulin therapy, 8 with positive outcomes demonstrated within three months. 9 The American Diabetes Association states that diabetes devices, including CGM, __should be__ offered to people with diabetes. 10 While coverage for CGM has greatly expanded in recent years, less than half of PWD taking any kind of insulin are prescribed CGM to help manage their diabetes.

### Use of continuous glucose monitors in publicly insured youth with type 2 diabetes: a 12-month pilot and feasibility study [^1172uzML]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affects youth with public insurance of minority and lower socioeconomic status backgrounds. We aimed to determine feasibility of CGM use in this understudied population.

Methods

We enrolled youth < 20 years old with T2D, provided or prescribed intermittent scanned CGM, and followed established clinic workflows with six data collection visits over 12-months. CGM use was measured by % wear time per two-week period (> 75% wear-time as goal) from downloaded report prior to clinic visit. Exploratory outcomes included: 14-day CGM wear time in range (TIR: % time spent between 70 and 180 mg/dl), HbA1c, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) collected from youth and parents.

Results

We enrolled 30 youth (age 15.1 years [SD 2.48]; HbA1c 10.2%, range: 6.5%-15.5%), 46.7% female, 90% Hispanic. At baseline, 37% previously used CGM and 53% lacked glucometer data. CGM use was 50% at three months and 23% at 12 months. CGM wear time decreased by 6.4 days per two weeks by 12 months. Mean HbA1c was 9.8% at 12 months and median TIR decreased from 71% to 42%. Parents and youth had moderate-to-positive attitudes about diabetes technology. Youth endorsed fair levels of global health; and youth and parents endorsed fair general and diabetes-related health-related quality of life.

Conclusions

Strategies for sustained CGM use in youth with T2D may differ from adults with T2D or youth with type 1 diabetes. Additional studies are needed to evaluate facilitators and barriers of sustained CGM use to optimize CGM use in youth with T2D.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: the use of advanced technology in the management of persons with diabetes mellitus [^112ofHH6]. Endocrine Practice (2021). High credibility.

AACE advanced technology — continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) targets and Recommendation 1.1.2: Two metrics, time in range (%TIR) and time below range (%TBR), "should be used as a starting point for the assessment of quality of glycemic control and as the basis for therapy adjustment", with emphasis on reducing %TBR when CGM values < 54 or < 70 mg/dL are close to or exceed targets (Grade B; Low-Intermediate Strength of Evidence; BEL 1). The guideline states, "The primary goal for effective and safe glucose management is to reduce the %TBR, while increasing the %TIR", and notes that "every 10% increase in %TIR corresponds to a decrease in A1C of approximately 0.5%". For most adults with diabetes, "an appropriate goal is to achieve a %TIR 70 to 180 mg/dL goal of > 70% (> 15 hours, 48 min/d), if this can be achieved without an unacceptable risk of hypoglycemia (%TBR of < 4% at < 70 mg/dL, and < 1% at < 54 mg/dL)". The document also clarifies metric relationships: "%TIR + %TBR + %TAR… are, by definition, equal to 100%".

Continuous Glucose Monitoring: A Direct and Integrated Measure of Glycemic Monitoring

Continuous glucose monitoring is a diabetes monitoring technology that provides more detailed, actionable information, and has distinct advantages over SMBG. It aids critical decision-making regarding the initiation and optimization of therapeutic agents, and is highly suitable for the measurement of TIR.

Saboo et al. highlighted the importance of CGM as an alternative to HbA1C testing, which follows a one-size fits all approach. Moreover, a strong association between TIR and vascular complications was identified and the need to implement this tool in diabetes management was put forward.

Pregnancy glycemic targets and time in range definitions — Currently recommended targets in pregnancy are fasting glucose 70–95 mg/dL (3.9–5.3 mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial glucose 110–140 mg/dL (6.1–7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial glucose 100–120 mg/dL (5.6–6.7 mmol/L). The International Consensus on time in range (TIR) in pregnancy defined TIR as 63 to 140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L), with the TIR metric for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) suggested as more than 70% (63–140 mg/dL, [3.5–7.8 mmol/L]) and for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) > 90% (63–140 mg/dL, [3.5–7.8 mmol/L]).

### Expert consensus recommendations on time in range for monitoring glucose levels in people with diabetes: an Indian perspective [^111jv1q9]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Keeping up with the global scenario, diabetes prevalence is on rise in India. Inadequate glycemic control is a major cause of diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. The conventional standards of care (SOC) in diabetes, including self-monitoring of blood glucose and measurement of glycated hemoglobin, have supported achievement of glycemic control, yet there are a few limitations. With the use of current technologies and metrics, such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and standardized CGM data reporting, the continuous real-time glucose levels can be measured, and importantly, the percentage of time above, below, and within the target glucose range can be calculated, which facilitates patient-centric care, a current goal in diabetes management. International consensus recommendations endorse the incorporation of CGM and CGM data reporting in SOC for diabetes management. The guidelines provide time in range (TIR) thresholds for different patient populations and different types of diabetes. However, extrapolation of these global guidelines does not aptly cover the Indian population, which has diverse diet, culture, and religious practices. In this context, a consensus meeting was held in India in 2021 with experts in the field of diabetes care. The purpose of the meeting was to develop consensus recommendations for TIR thresholds for different patient profiles in India. Those expert recommendations, together with an evidence-based review, are reported here. The aim of this agreement is to aid clinicians across India to routinely use CGM and CGM data reports for optimizing individualized diabetes care, by implementing clinical targets for TIR.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) vs self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) — nonpregnant population: The systematic review included 10 RCTs comparing real-time CGM vs SMBG. In the nonpregnant population, CGM may reduce the proportion of patients with glucose less than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) (odds ratio [OR] 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.41), likely reduces episodes of severe hypoglycemia (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.85), and likely increases the percentage of time in range (TIR) 70 to 180 mg/dL (3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) (mean difference [MD] 5.20; 95% CI, 3.10 to 7.29). Evidence suggests no difference in the incidence of episodes of glucose less than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L), seizures, time below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), or HbA1c level, with the stated certainty ratings.

### Glycemic goals and hypoglycemia: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^117A7Z4Z]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

American Diabetes Association Standards of Care in Diabetes — assessment of glycemic status states that glycemic status is assessed by A1C measurement, blood glucose monitoring (BGM) by capillary finger-stick devices, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) using time in range (TIR) or mean CGM glucose. Glucose monitoring via CGM or BGM is described as useful for diabetes self-management, providing nuanced information on glucose responses to meals, physical activity, and medication changes, and may be particularly useful in individuals taking insulin. CGM is noted to serve an increasingly important role in optimizing the effectiveness and safety of treatment in many people with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or other forms of diabetes, and individuals on a variety of insulin treatment plans can benefit from CGM with improved glucose levels, decreased hypoglycemia, and enhanced self-efficacy.

### Continuous glucose monitoring and time in range: association with adverse outcomes among people with type 2 or gestational diabetes mellitus [^114z52oK]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has become available for women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy. The recommended time in range (TIR, blood glucose 70–140mg/dL) and its correlation with adverse pregnancy outcomes in this group is unknown. Our aim was to compare maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant people with T2DM or GDM with average CGM TIR values > 70 versus ≤ 70%.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all individuals using CGM during pregnancy from January 2017 to June 2022. Individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus, or those missing CGM or delivery data were excluded. Primary composite neonatal outcome included any of the following: large for gestational age, NICU admission, need for intravenous glucose, respiratory support, or neonatal death. Secondary outcomes included other maternal and neonatal outcomes. Regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).

Results

During the study period, 141 individuals with diabetes utilized CGM during pregnancy, with 65 (46%) meeting inclusion criteria. Of the study population, 28 (43%) had TIR ≤ 70% and 37 (57%) had TIR > 70%. Compared with those with TIR > 70%, the primary composite outcome occurred more frequently in neonates of individuals TIR ≤ 70% (71.4 vs. 37.8%, aOR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.6, 15.7). Furthermore, individuals with TIR ≤ 70% were more likely to have hypertensive disorders (42.9 vs. 16.2%, OR: 3.9, 95% CI: 1.3, 13.0), preterm delivery (54 vs. 27%, OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.1, 9.1): and cesarean delivery (96.4 vs. 51.4%, OR: 4.6, 95% CI: 2.2, 15.1) compared with those with TIR > 70%.

Conclusion

Among people with T2DM or GDM who utilized CGM during pregnancy, 4 out 10 individuals had TIR ≤ 70% and, compared with those with TIR > 70%, they had a higher likelihood of adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes.

Key Points

· Time in range can be utilized as a metric for pregnant patients using continuous glucose monitor. · Time in range > 70% is achievable by 6 out of 10 patients. · Time in range below goal is associated with adverse neonatal and maternal outcomes.

Goals and targets of management of type 2 diabetes

The primary objectives of the management of diabetes are to reduce the incidence and burden of complications and to improve quality of life (figure 1). Historically, these objectives were pursued through control of hyperglycaemia. In this glucose centric approach, clinical practice guidelines recommend targeting haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) concentrations at < 7% (53 mmol/mol) or < 6.5% (47.5 mmol/mol) and, more recently, continuous glucose monitoring time in range > 70% for most non-pregnant adults with type 2 diabetes, with lower or higher glycaemic thresholds individualised for each person. These recommendations for levels of HbA 1c come from data from randomised controlled trials showing a reduction in microvascular complications with more intensive glycaemic control, although data for the association between time in range and risk of complications of chronic diabetes are limited but emerging. Implementation of glycaemic targets based on continuous glucose monitoring has also been limited by gaps in insurance coverage and accessibility, although continuous glucose monitoring is increasingly recommended for and used by people with type 2 diabetes.

Randomised controlled trials of older antihyperglycaemic treatments, such as sulfonylureas and insulins, however, have not shown a consistent association between intensive glycaemic control and reduction in macrovascular complications or mortality. Nevertheless, longer term follow-up of intensively treated adults provides some evidence of a lower risk of macrovascular events and cardiovascular death. Conversely, intensive glycaemic control in individuals with frailty, advanced age, and multimorbidity was associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia and death. Therefore, future research is needed to examine the effect of intensive glycaemic control when achieved with newer glucose lowering drugs, which have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia and additional cardio-reno-metabolic benefits. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of individualised glycaemic management and the need to shift the emphasis away from the imperfect surrogate of levels of HbA 1c towards reducing hard outcomes of the adverse health effects of diabetes, while lessening the burden of treatment.

Preexisting diabetes in pregnancy — continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) time in range (TIR) targets and outcomes: Indirect evidence supports using a 24-hour CGM TIR target of 63 to 140 mg/dL (3.5–7.8 mmol/L) in individuals with PDM by demonstrating association with maternal and neonatal outcomes. In the 2017 CONCEPTT randomized controlled trial in 215 pregnancies with T1DM and suboptimal glycemia (HbA1c 6.5%-10.0%), CGM use improved neonatal outcomes, reducing LGA (53% vs 69%; p = 0.020) and neonatal hypoglycemia (15% vs 28%; p = 0.0250). In a 2024 cohort of 177 pregnancies with preexisting T1DM/T2DM, each 5-percentage point increase in TIR reduced odds of a neonatal composite outcome by 28% (odds ratio [OR], 0.72; 95% CI: 0.58–0.89).

Time in range (TIR) is described as 70–180 mg/dL, and AACE recommends 2 metrics, percent TIR (> 70%) and percent time below range (< 70 mg/dL [< 4%] and < 54 mg/dL [< 1%]), to be used as a starting point for assessment and therapy adjustments. CGM has emerged as a standard of care for persons with DM who are treated with intensive insulin therapy.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pregnancy — Continuous glucose monitoring can help to achieve glycemic goals (e.g., time in range, time above range) and A1C goal in type 1 diabetes and pregnancy and may be beneficial for other types of diabetes in pregnancy. Recommend CGM to pregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes. In conjunction with aims to achieve traditional pre- and postprandial glycemic goals, real-time CGM can reduce the risk for large-for-gestational-age infants and neonatal hypoglycemia in pregnancy complicated by type 1 diabetes. CGM metrics may be used in combination with blood glucose monitoring to achieve optimal pre- and postprandial glycemic goals. Commonly used estimated A1C and glucose management indicator calculations should not be used in pregnancy as estimates of A1C.

However, CGM has revealed that glucose concentrations for individuals with HbA1c > 9% are in target range < 40% of the time, against the recommended ≥ 70%. No data exist describing CGM metrics in people with T2D treated with iGlarLixi with very high HbA1c. The Soli‐CGM study was specifically designed to assess the impact of iGlarLixi treatment over 16 weeks in insulin‐naive adults with T2D suboptimally controlled on ≥ 2 OADs ± GLP‐1 RAs using sensor‐derived glucose metrics, as measured by blinded CGM. A post hoc analysis assessed outcomes in those who received concomitant sulphonylurea (SU) therapy versus those who did not.

Finally, the consensus defined the concept of the time spent in the target range, or simply "time in range" and standardizes the use of the primary glucose range between 70 and 180 mg/dL. Occasionally, glucose values between 70 and 140 mg/dL can be used as a secondary range, especially for regulatory issues and comparability studies. Before 2017 consensus, time in target ranges were reported in various ways, and it was impossible to compare one study with the others. The consensus agreement finished a discussion about what would be the best metric to be used. In 2019, the IC-TIR recommended clinical targets for CGM data for T1DM and T2DM, at-risk or "frail" patients with diabetes and established a specific recommendation for pregnancy. Moreover, percentages of time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were also a matter of the IC-TIR consensus (Table 1).

Table 1
Guidance on target for assessment of glycemic control in patients with diabetes

a Gestational DM and T2DM pregnancy: there are no specific recommendations for these conditions given the limited evidence but that it is expected that it would be significantly higher than in type 1 diabetes pregnancy

Evaluation of CGM metrics is essential to motivate, educate and teach patients with diabetes in clinical practice. The aim is to reduce the time spent in hypoglycemia (glucose levels < 70 mg/dL) to less than 1 h/day and time below 54 mg/dL to less than 15 min/day, equivalent to < 4% and < 1%, respectively as the standard goal. Indeed, targets must be individualized and meet personal needs and circumstances.

The article published by ADA/EASD, entitled "Improving the Clinical Value and Utility of CGM Systems: Issues and Recommendations" motivated an editorial by Riddle, Gerstein, and Cefalu highlighting thought-provoking points about CGM. They supported the definition of several terms and ways of reporting a standardized CGM and the classification and report of hypoglycemia. Additionally, they stressed the importance of this standardization for a paradigm shift in regulatory affairs. Another important aspect to be pointed out is that monitoring the time in range can also offers an opportunity for people with diabetes to improve the management of their diabetes.

### Continuous glucose monitoring for prediabetes: what are the best metrics? [^116YkEuP]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has transformed the care of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and there is potential for CGM to also become influential in prediabetes identification and management. However, to date, we do not have any consensus guidelines or high-quality evidence to guide CGM goals and metrics for use in prediabetes.

Methods

We searched PubMed for all English-language articles on CGM use in nonpregnant adults with prediabetes published by November 1, 2023. We excluded any articles that included subjects with type 1 diabetes or who were known to be at risk for type 1 diabetes due to positive islet autoantibodies.

Results

Based on the limited data available, we suggest possible CGM metrics to be used for individuals with prediabetes. We also explore the role that glycemic variability (GV) plays in the transition from normoglycemia to prediabetes.

Conclusions

Glycemic variability indices beyond the standard deviation and coefficient of variation are emerging as prominent identifiers of early dysglycemia. One GV index in particular, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), may play a key future role in CGM metrics for prediabetes and is highlighted in this review.
