## Question

Hydroquinone 6%

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hydroquinone 6%: its regulatory status, mechanism, indications, efficacy, safety, and how to use it clinically compared with alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether 6% is FDA-approved. Then, I should verify the pharmacology and labeled indications. Next, I will examine efficacy data, especially any head-to-head comparisons and combination regimens. After that, I need to assess safety, including risks like ochronosis and irritation, and consider special populations. Finally, I will synthesize practical prescribing guidance and alternatives, and I should double-check any claims that seem overstated before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status, because I need to ensure we are not overextending beyond what is supported. Hydroquinone 6% is not an FDA-approved concentration; the FDA-labeled prescription strength is 4%, and 6% products are typically compounded and marketed as unapproved drugs, as explicitly noted in the DailyMed entry for a 6% emulsion that carries a disclaimer that FDA has not found this drug to be safe and effective and that the labeling is not FDA-approved [^113FesXU] [^112yD8pe].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism and labeled indications so I don't misstate the basics. Hydroquinone produces reversible depigmentation by inhibiting tyrosinase and suppressing melanocyte metabolic processes; exposure to sunlight can reverse effects, which is why sun protection is essential during therapy, and the labeled indication is for gradual bleaching of hyperpigmented conditions such as melasma, chloasma, freckles, and senile lentigines, which applies to the 4% formulation and informs the pharmacologic rationale for 6% as well [^113oE3RW] [^112yD8pe].

> I will now examine efficacy, but I should be cautious because high-quality 6% monotherapy data are sparse. The strongest evidence base exists for 4% hydroquinone and for triple combination therapy with 4% hydroquinone, tretinoin, and a corticosteroid, which consistently outperforms hydroquinone alone in randomized trials and meta-analyses; for example, Tri-Luma achieved higher success rates than dual or monotherapy comparators, and a Cochrane review found triple combination roughly 1.58 times more effective than hydroquinone alone, while azelaic acid 20% outperformed 2% hydroquinone but not 4% hydroquinone in pooled analyses [^112FWEVq] [^1154rvuF] [^116Scsuw] [^115sfMSv]. Hold on, I should verify whether any 6% monotherapy trials are cited; I do not see randomized trials of 6% alone in the provided sources, so any inference about 6% efficacy is extrapolated from 4% data and theoretical potency rather than direct comparative studies.

> Next, I should review safety, because higher concentration may alter the risk profile. Common adverse effects include irritation, burning, erythema, and dryness; importantly, there is a recognized risk of exogenous ochronosis with prolonged use, particularly at higher concentrations and without medical supervision, and this risk is greater in patients with skin of color and with continuous use beyond about 6 months; rare nail discoloration has also been reported, typically resolving after discontinuation [^115i9c3o] [^114E2jMs] [^1126wj6N]. I need to ensure I note regulatory cautions: animal data show mutagenicity and some carcinogenic signals, but human carcinogenicity remains unproven; nonetheless, pregnancy category C and caution in lactation are advised, and pediatric safety under age 12 is not established, so I should emphasize avoidance in those settings unless clearly indicated [^112Hz4Um] [^112kCWep].

> Let me consider special populations and monitoring, and I should double-check the practical guardrails. For patients with darker skin tones, the risk of ochronosis is higher, so I should recommend shorter courses, close follow-up, and consideration of rotational therapy such as 3–6 months on, then off; in pregnancy and lactation, I should avoid hydroquinone if possible given category C and unknown transfer into milk; in pediatrics, safety under 12 is not established, so use should be exceptional and supervised; before starting, a 24-hour patch test is prudent to screen for irritant or allergic reactions, and strict sun protection is mandatory to prevent repigmentation and mitigate adverse effects [^115i9c3o] [^112Hz4Um] [^112kCWep].

> Now, I should translate this into practical prescribing guidance, but I need to be careful not to overgeneralize beyond the evidence. Given the lack of FDA approval for 6% and the absence of robust 6% monotherapy trials, if a 6% product is used, it should be for short, time-limited courses under dermatologic supervision, typically not exceeding 3–6 months, with mandatory broad-spectrum sunscreen and avoidance of sun exposure; I should confirm that patients understand to stop if irritation is excessive or if any blue-gray discoloration appears, and I should schedule follow-up every 8–12 weeks to reassess efficacy and safety [^113FesXU] [^112Hz4Um] [^115i9c3o].

> But wait, what if the goal is maximal efficacy with a safer, evidence-based approach; I should review alternatives and combinations. Triple combination therapy with 4% hydroquinone, tretinoin, and a corticosteroid remains the most effective, well-studied option for melasma and can shorten time to clearance; if avoiding hydroquinone, azelaic acid 20% is a reasonable alternative with anti-inflammatory benefits, and newer agents like thiamidol show promise in early trials; for maintenance or steroid-sparing, non-hydroquinone brighteners and antioxidants can be considered, though data are more limited and formulations vary [^112FWEVq] [^116Scsuw] [^1121Haty] [^1173R4Me].

> Hold on, I should verify a potential pitfall in my earlier thinking. I initially implied that 6% might be "more effective" than 4% based on concentration alone, but that assumes a linear dose-response without more irritation or safety trade-offs; given the lack of head-to-head 6% versus 4% trials and the higher risk of ochronosis and irritation at higher concentrations, I should not assert superiority of 6% over 4% and should instead frame 6% as an off-label, higher-potency option reserved for select cases under close supervision, if at all [^113FesXU] [^115i9c3o].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Hydroquinone 6% is a compounded, non–FDA-approved concentration that may offer more potent depigmentation but carries a higher risk of irritation and exogenous ochronosis; there are no robust 6% monotherapy efficacy data in the provided sources, so its use should be exceptional, time-limited, and supervised, with strict sun protection and periodic monitoring, while 4% hydroquinone and triple combination therapy remain the evidence-based standards for melasma and other hyperpigmentation disorders [^113FesXU] [^112yD8pe] [^112FWEVq] [^116Scsuw].

---

Hydroquinone 6% is a **compounded, prescription-only** topical depigmenting agent used for refractory hyperpigmentation such as melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and solar lentigines. It is **not FDA-approved** and should be reserved for cases unresponsive to standard 4% formulations, with use limited to 3–6 months under close medical supervision to minimize risks of irritation, ochronosis, and systemic absorption. Combination therapy with retinoids and corticosteroids can improve efficacy and tolerability, and strict sun protection is essential during treatment [^113FesXU] [^115i9c3o] [^112Hz4Um].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of action

Hydroquinone exerts its depigmenting effect primarily by **inhibiting tyrosinase**, the enzyme responsible for converting tyrosine to melanin. This inhibition reduces melanin synthesis, leading to gradual lightening of hyperpigmented areas. Additionally, hydroquinone may disrupt melanocyte function and degrade melanosomes, further contributing to its depigmenting action [^113oE3RW] [^111EAm1R].

---

## Clinical indications

Hydroquinone 6% is indicated for the treatment of **refractory hyperpigmentation disorders**, including:

- **Melasma**: A chronic, relapsing hyperpigmentation disorder characterized by symmetric, irregular brown patches on the face, often exacerbated by sun exposure and hormonal fluctuations [^115i9c3o].

- **Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH)**: Darkening of the skin following inflammation or injury, commonly observed in individuals with darker skin tones [^117Rr1u2].

- **Solar lentigines**: Age-related hyperpigmented lesions resulting from chronic sun exposure [^112yD8pe].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hydroquinone in treating hyperpigmentation disorders. However, specific data on the efficacy of hydroquinone 6% are limited, as most studies have focused on lower concentrations (typically 2% or 4%). Nevertheless, higher concentrations are generally associated with increased efficacy, albeit with a higher risk of adverse effects. Triple combination therapy (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and corticosteroid) has been shown to be **significantly more effective** than hydroquinone alone in treating melasma, with faster and more pronounced clinical improvement [^112FWEVq] [^116Scsuw].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Hydroquinone 6% is associated with several potential adverse effects, particularly with prolonged use or improper application:

- **Irritation**: Common side effects include mild irritation, erythema, burning sensation, and dryness at the application site [^1132LaBr].

- **Exogenous ochronosis**: A rare but significant adverse effect characterized by blue-black pigmentation of the skin, particularly with prolonged use or higher concentrations. This condition is more common in individuals with darker skin tones [^114avnAE] [^114E2jMs].

- **Systemic absorption**: Although rare, systemic absorption of hydroquinone can occur, particularly when applied to large areas of the skin or for extended periods. This may lead to potential systemic toxicity, including nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity [^notfound].

- **Hypopigmentation**: Overuse or improper application may result in hypopigmentation of the treated area, causing cosmetic disfigurement [^1117TmMR].

---

## Regulatory status

Hydroquinone 6% is **not approved by the FDA** for topical use. The FDA has raised concerns regarding the safety of hydroquinone, particularly regarding its potential carcinogenicity and systemic toxicity. As a result, hydroquinone concentrations higher than 2% are generally restricted to prescription use, and concentrations higher than 4% are not approved by the FDA. Compounded hydroquinone 6% formulations are available through specialized pharmacies but are considered off-label and should be used with caution under medical supervision [^113FesXU] [^112Hz4Um].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize the following recommendations for hydroquinone 6% use:

- **Limited duration**: Treatment should be limited to a maximum of 3–6 months, followed by a hiatus to minimize the risk of adverse effects such as exogenous ochronosis [^115i9c3o].

- **Combination therapy**: Combining hydroquinone with retinoids and corticosteroids can enhance efficacy and reduce irritation [^112FWEVq].

- **Sun protection**: Strict sun protection measures, including the use of broad-spectrum sunscreen, are essential during treatment to prevent repigmentation and minimize adverse effects [^112Hz4Um].

- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up with a dermatologist is recommended to monitor for adverse effects and adjust treatment as necessary [^112Hz4Um].

---

## Alternative treatments

Given the potential adverse effects and regulatory concerns associated with hydroquinone 6%, several **alternative treatments** have been explored for hyperpigmentation disorders:

- **Azelaic acid**: A naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid that inhibits tyrosinase and has anti-inflammatory properties. It is considered effective and safe for melasma and PIH, particularly in individuals with sensitive skin [^1121Haty].

- **Kojic acid**: A fungal metabolite that inhibits tyrosinase and is commonly used in combination formulations for hyperpigmentation [^117Rr1u2].

- **Retinoids**: Topical retinoids, such as tretinoin, enhance epidermal turnover and can improve hyperpigmentation when used alone or in combination with other agents [^1141mxW7].

- **Non-hydroquinone brightening agents**: Agents such as cysteamine, tranexamic acid, and botanical extracts have shown promise in treating hyperpigmentation with fewer adverse effects than hydroquinone [^114erFCa] [^114ybLjP].

---

Hydroquinone 6% is a **compounded topical depigmenting agent** used for refractory hyperpigmentation disorders. While it offers enhanced efficacy compared to lower concentrations, it also carries a higher risk of adverse effects, including irritation, exogenous ochronosis, and systemic toxicity. Its use should be limited to short-term courses under close medical supervision, with strict adherence to sun protection and regular monitoring. Alternative treatments, such as azelaic acid, kojic acid, and retinoids, should be considered for patients who cannot tolerate hydroquinone or prefer safer long-term options.

### Hydroquinone: myths and reality [^111g3PrY]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hydroquinone has pharmacological uses in disorders of pigmentation because of its ability to competitively inhibit the enzyme tyrosinase. Our contemporary review presents the strongest evidence supporting the use of hydroquinone with the most effective and tolerable formulations combining hydroquinone, retinoid and corticosteroid (modified Kligman formula or 'triple combination cream'). The risk of exogenous ochronosis is low if prescribed concentrations of ≤ 5 for a limited period with regular monitoring. Dermatologists should reassure patients that with controlled use, hydroquinone can be well-tolerated and safe for a range of hyperpigmentary conditions.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Topical application of hydroquinone produces a reversible depigmentation of the skin by inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) (Denton, C. et al., 1952)1and suppression of other melanocyte metabolic processes (Jimbow, K. et al., 1974)2. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light will cause repigmentation of bleached areas (Parrish, J. A. et al., 1978)3.

### Nail discoloration after use of hydroquinone [^111DFEN1]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Hydroquinone is thought to be a safe and effective cream at low concentrations of 4% or less and is the gold standard for depigmenting agents in the United States. It can be found in concentrations up to 2% in over-the-counter products and up to 4% in prescription creams. Higher concentrations are available by compounding pharmacies and over the counter in other countries, but lower concentrations are typically used because of an increased potential for irritation and ochronosis. Although it is the most widely used depigmenting agent in the United States, that is not the case throughout the rest of the world where hydroquinone's safety has come into question. Although the most common side effects are typically self-limited, concerns remain about its potential mutagenicity and carcinogenicity. In vitro and animal models have shown DNA damage with use of hydroquinone. Animal models have also shown increased development of leukemia in some studies. This led some countries in Europe and Asia to ban hydroquinone over concerns about potential malignancy risk. Despite these claims, there are no documented cases of cutaneous or internal malignancy associated with hydroquinone use in humans. Reports of malignancy in animal models involved oral hydroquinone used at very high concentrations, much higher than those used topically. More than 25 cases of ochronosis were reported since hydroquinone's inception over 50 years ago, with none describing neoplastic induction. These studies show that there is no evidence that hydroquinone leads to malignancy when used topically and at low concentrations. Although nail hyperpigmentation is a rare side effect, we show here, similar to previous findings, that it is self-limited. It is important for providers to be aware of this potential complication and to discontinue hydroquinone use in a timely fashion if identified.

PRECAUTIONS

(see WARNINGS)

GENERAL PRECAUTIONS

Test for skin sensitivity before using by applying a small amount to an unbroken patch of skin; check within 24 hours. Minor redness is not a contraindication, but where there is itching or vesicle formation or excessive inflammatory response further treatment is not advised. Close patient supervision is recommended.

Hydroquinone is a skin bleaching agent which may produce unwanted cosmetic effects if not used as directed. The physician should be familiar with the contents of this insert before prescribing or dispensing this medication.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

Sunscreen use is an essential aspect of hydroquinone therapy because even minimal sunlight sustains melanocytic activity. To prevent repigmentation, during treatment and maintenance therapy, sun exposure on treated skin should be avoided by application of a broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 15 or greater) or by use of protective clothing.

Avoid contact with eyes and mucous membranes.

Keep this and all medications out of reach of children. In case of accidental ingestion, call a physician or a poison control center immediately.

DRUG INTERACTIONS

Patients are cautioned on concomitant use of medications that are known to be photosensitizing.

CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY

Studies of hydroquinone in animals have demonstrated some evidence of carcinogenicity. The carcinogenic potential of hydroquinone in humans is unknown.

Published studies have demonstrated that hydroquinone is a mutagen and a clastogen. Treatment with hydroquinone has resulted in positive findings for genetic toxicity in the Ames assay in bacterial strains sensitive to oxidizing mutagens, in in vitro studies in mammalian cells, and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.

PREGNANCY

Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C -

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with topical hydroquinone. It is also not known whether topical hydroquinone can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Topical hydroquinone should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.

NURSING MOTHERS

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when topical hydroquinone is administered to a nursing woman.

PEDIATRIC USE

Safety and effectiveness for pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.

### Split-face comparison of an advanced non-hydroquinone lightening solution to 4% hydroquinone [^112XpyLX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hyperpigmentation is a primary concern for many cosmetic patients because of its high rate of occurrence and significant impact on perceived age. While 4% hydroquinone has been the gold-standard of treatment, there is a growing interest in non-hydroquinone solutions, however, many of these newer solutions fail to deliver equivalent improvement.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized, split-face study compares the effects of a new OTC non-hydroquinone lightening product (JM) to an available 4% hydroquinone lightening solution (OB) on the appearance of hyperpigmentation, texture, and ne lines and wrinkles. Comparisons were determined by both physician assessment and subject self-assessment at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks.

Results

Physician assessment showed statistically equivalent improvement on both sides of the face with the JM side showing equivalent or superior average improvement in all assessed categories. Subject self-assessment showed a significant preference for the JM product over the 4% hydroquinone and a substantially higher perception of overall improvement over 4% hydroquinone (P = 0.058).

Discussion

Physician assessment showed equal or superior average improvement in all measured categories with no statistically significant difference between the two sides. Subject self-assessment, however, showed a significant and growing preference toward the investigated JM product over the course of the study. Overall, the results of this study show the JM product to be equivalent if not superior to 4% hydroquinone for results and patient satisfaction. J Drugs Dermatol. 2016;15(12):1571–1577.

### Hydroquinone (hydroquinone 4%) [^114avnAE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non-asthmatic people. Since this product contains no sunscreen, an effective broad spectrum sun blocking agent should be used and unnecessary solar exposure avoided, or protective clothing should be worn to cover bleached skin in order to prevent repigmentation from occurring. Hydroquinone may produce exogenous ochronosis, a gradual blue-black darkening of the skin. If this condition occurs, discontinue treatment and consult your physician. The majority of patients developing this condition are Black, but it may also occur in Caucasians and Hispanics.

### The safety of hydroquinone: a dermatologist's response to the 2006 federal register [^1127b3kK]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration proposed a ban on over-the-counter hydroquinone mainly on the basis of high absorption, reports of exogenous ochronosis in humans, and murine hepatic adenomas, renal adenomas, and leukemia with large doses over extended time periods. Systemic exposure to hydroquinone from routine topical application is no greater than that from quantities present in common foods. While murine hepatic adenomas increased, murine hepatocellular carcinomas decreased, suggesting a protective effect. Renal tumors are sex, species, and age specific and therefore do not appear relevant to humans after decades of widespread use. Murine leukemia has not been reproducible and would not be expected from small topical doses. Finally, a literature review of exogenous ochronosis and clinical studies employing hydroquinone (involving over 10,000 exposures under careful clinical supervision) reveal an incidence of exogenous ochronosis in the United States of 22 cases in more than 50 years. Therefore, the proposed ban appears to be unnecessarily extreme.

### An update on new and existing treatments for the management of melasma [^115i9c3o]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hydroquinone

Initially a rubber antioxidant in gloves, hydroquinone was discovered as a depigmenting agent in the 1930s, via the inhibition of tyrosine oxidation in the melanin biosynthesis pathway. Hydroquinone is applied as a topical cream in concentrations of 4–5% for melasma. It has been considered as the gold-standard treatment choice for melasma and has been used in many trials as the comparative arm to assess the efficacy and safety of novel agents.

Irritation is the most common adverse reaction to hydroquinone. Paradoxically, hydroquinone has a rare but significant risk of exogenous ochronosis: pigmented non-inflammatory papulonodules caused by melanocyte migration into the papillary dermis and subsequent abnormal production of pigmented fibre bundles. This risk is greater in patients with skin of colour with over 6 months of continual product use, or from hydroquinone use without medical supervision. There is a variability in prescribing practices of hydroquinone, although often it is used in a rotational manner, such as a 6-month on/off cycle to reduce the risk of adverse effects. Many alternatives have been investigated that do not have the risk of exogenous ochronosis.

Combination treatments with hydroquinone have also been developed for melasma, including with sunscreen, retinoids, traditional and novel agents, chemical peels, or as triple combination therapy (TCC), discussed in their respective sections. Importantly, sunscreen with VL protection further augments the depigmenting efficacy of hydroquinone, as described in the aforementioned study by Castanedo-Cazares et al.

1.5 Skin‐Lightening Agents

Skin‐lightening agents, sometimes called "skin‐brightening agents", aim to treat hyperpigmentation in the skin. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a common concern that results from a deposition of melanin in the dermis that occurs after inflammation in the skin, such as from acne or eczema. PIH is more prevalent in people with darker skin tones who have more melanin in their skin at baseline. PIH causes significant distress, with patients and families often reporting more concern regarding the discoloration than for the primary dermatosis. The failure of health care providers to recognize and address this concern may contribute to health care disparities in this population. Likewise, PIH is frequently used as a marketing tool by manufacturers of skin care products whether or not products contain ingredients having activity against hyperpigmentation. Skin‐lightening agents also have the potential to be misused in an attempt to achieve a lighter overall complexion, a topic which will be discussed in greater detail in Part II of this review.

1.5.1 Hydroquinone

Hydroquinone is a phenol that inhibits the conversion of tyrosine to melanin in the skin. Formulations of up to 2% can be found in OTC products. While hydroquinone has been proven to be efficacious in treating hyperpigmentation, even 2% hydroquinone used for a prolonged duration carries the risk of inducing exogenous ochronosis, a condition of excess pigment deposition resulting in unintended additive hyperpigmentation. Although prescription‐strength hydroquinone has been approved for use in patients 12 years and older, it is not recommended that young consumers attempt to treat PIH with hydroquinone without the oversight of a dermatologist.

1.5.2 Kojic Acid

Kojic acid also inhibits the conversion of tyrosine to melanin in the skin. Unlike hydroquinone, kojic acid does not carry additional risks of dyspigmentation from long‐term use. However, kojic acid can cause contact dermatitis, so it should be used cautiously in those with sensitive skin. Studies on the use of kojic acid in the pediatric population are lacking.

1.5.3 Other Agents

Retinoids, topical niacinamide, azelaic acid, and vitamin C all have some degree of skin‐lightening effects that have been observed in clinical studies. The cautions and uncertainties regarding use of these ingredients by the pediatric population are the same as discussed previously and in the following section.

### Skin lightening preparations and the hydroquinone controversy [^1138QRo7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Skin lightening preparations are widely used in dermatology by persons of all Fitzpatrick skin types. Fitzpatrick skin types I-III require local pigment lightening for the treatment of hormonally induced melasma and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation caused by acne and trauma. Fitzpatrick skin types IV and darker have an even greater need for skin lightening for social reasons, as well as pigmentary changes that occur around the eyes, in the intertriginous areas, following dermatitis, or with acne and trauma. The gold standard dermatologic agent for skin lightening was hydroquinone, until regulatory agencies in Japan, Europe, and most recently in the United States questioned the safety of this substance. This has encouraged research into alternative agents to inhibit skin pigmentation such as retinoids, mequinol, azelaic acid, arbutin, kojic acid, aleosin, licorice extract, ascorbic acid, soy proteins, and N-acetyl glucosamine. The efficacy and safety of each of these ingredients is examined as possible topical alternatives to hydroquinone.

### Cost-effectiveness of a fixed combination of hydroquinone / tretinoin / fluocinolone cream compared with hydroquinone alone in the treatment of melasma [^1166Wgnw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A once-daily fixed combination of hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide (Tri-luma) is a newly available treatment for melasma.

Objective

To assess cost-effectiveness of triple combination therapy (TCT) applied once daily and hydroquinone alone applied twice daily in the U.S. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia from a payer's perspective.

Methods

Clinical data and utilization of key health resources (medication only) were assessed within an 8-week clinical trial conducted in Brazil. Total cost per primary success (complete clearing) was used to compare each treatment with not treating and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were used to compare between treatments.

Results and Conclusion

TCT had a 30% better rate of complete clearing than hydroquinone with a lower cost in the U.S. and an incremental cost in other countries. In every country, cost per primary success was lower for TCT than for hydroquinone. Results were robust to varying assumptions of success rates and quantity used.

### Lack of pregnancy warnings on over-the-counter dermatologic products containing potentially harmful hydroquinone [^111jNbP5]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the presence of pregnancy warnings on over-the-counter (OTC) dermatologic products with hydroquinone, a potentially harmful ingredient.

Study Design

Data were obtained from the Food and Drug Administration National Drug Code Directory and Label Repository to identify OTC dermatologic products containing hydroquinone. Products were stratified based on pregnancy or general warning presence (WP) or absence (WA). Product characteristics were compared between groups: hydroquinone concentration, presence of external packaging, indication and warning statements.

Results

Of the 112 products studied, 21 had a pregnancy warning and 3 included a general warning against use: WP (n = 24) and WA (n = 88) group. External packaging was more prevalent in the WP group compared to WA (62.5% vs 29.5%, P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Majority of OTC dermatologic products containing hydroquinone did not have a pregnancy warning. This highlights the need for improved labeling and informs providers caring for pregnant women of OTC labeling limitations.

### Nail discoloration after use of hydroquinone [^115tKs2T]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hydroquinone is the best studied and most widely used topical depigmenting agent, and represents the gold standard for treatment of disorders of pigmentation. Although ochronosis is a known sequela of long-term hydroquinone use, pigmentation of the nails is rarely a reported side effect. We present a case of identical twins who developed hyperpigmentation of identical nails after the use of a compounded cream containing 10% hydroquinone and 0.05% tretinoin to improve facial dyschromia.

### Fluocinolone acetonide, hydroquinone, and tretinoin (Tri-luma) [^112FWEVq]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Subjects were evaluated for melasma severity at Baseline and at Weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 of treatment. Primary efficacy was based on the proportion of subjects who had an investigators' assessment of treatment success, defined as the clearing of melasma at the end of the eight-week treatment period. The majority of subjects enrolled in the two trials were white (approximately 66%) and female (approximately 98%). TRI-LUMA Cream was demonstrated to be significantly more effective than any of the other combinations of the active ingredients.

PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS:

p-value is from Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square statistics controlling for pooled investigator and comparing TRI-LUMA Cream to the other treatment groups.

In the Investigators' assessment of melasma severity at Day 56 of treatment, the following table shows the clinical improvement profile for all subjects treated with TRI-LUMA Cream based on severity of their melasma at the start of treatment.

Assessment Scale: Cleared (melasma lesions approximately equivalent to surrounding normal skin or with minimal residual hyperpigmentation); Mild (slightly darker than the surrounding normal skin); Moderate (moderately darker than the surrounding normal skin); Severe (markedly darker than the surrounding normal skin).

Subjects experienced improvement of their melasma with the use of TRI-LUMA Cream as early as 4 weeks. However, among 7 subjects who had clearing at the end of 4 weeks of treatment with TRI-LUMA Cream, 4 of them did not maintain the remission after an additional 4 weeks of treatment.

After 8 weeks of treatment with the trial drug, subjects entered into an open-label extension period in which TRI-LUMA Cream was given on an as-needed basis for the treatment of melasma. The remission periods appeared to shorten between progressive courses of treatment. Additionally, few subjects maintained complete clearing of melasma (approximately 1 to 2%).

### Hydroquinone-free multimodal topical regimen for facial hyperpigmentation [^115k7UmZ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

To assess the treatment of hyperpigmentation, a series of 5 case studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a novel hydroquinone-free treatment regimen combining a multimodal skin brightener with a cleanser, high strength retinol product and sunscreen SPF 30+. Patients presented with moderate to severe facial hyperpigmentation as determined by a score of 4 to 8 on the Overall Hyperpigmentation scale. Physician-graded Overall Hyperpigmentation, Global Improvement in Hyperpigmentation, and standardized photography were conducted at weeks 3, 6, and 12. At week 12, the majority of patients demonstrated Global Improvements in Hyperpigmentation of at least 50%, with at least a 2-grade reduction in Overall Hyperpigmentation scores, as assessed by the physician. Standardized photographs also support the physician and patient findings. Results from these case studies demonstrate that this unique 12-week treatment regimen can provide an effective and simple option for patients with facial hyperpigmentation.

3.5 Postinflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH)

PIH is a concern for all skin types undergoing FACL procedure. Although skin Fitzpatrick types III–VI are more susceptible, panel members advise all patients to practice PIH prevention methods before FACL treatment.

Prevention: According to all panelists, sun avoidance is key to prevent PIH, but no consensus was reached regarding the pretreatment sun avoidance timeframe: 47% of panelists recommend 2–4 weeks of sun avoidance whereas 41% recommend 1–2 weeks before procedure. There is a consensus of a pretreatment skin regimen consisting of stringent sunscreen use before treatment, beginning no later than 4 weeks before treatment (recommended by 67% of panelists). Furthermore, to prevent PIH, 81% of panelists recommend using a topical treatment starting 4 weeks before treatment and stopping 4–14 days before the procedure. Consensus was reached regarding PIH prevention using hydroquinone alone (according to 52% of panelists), other recommendations that did not reach consensus included: the application of a modified Kligman's formula (tretinoin, hydroquinone, and hydrocortisone in a water‐based cream) (according to 22% of panelists), and application of topical vitamin C of at least 5% concentration (according to 33% of panelists). Fifteen percent of panelists reported using the following steroid regimens for PIH prevention: clobetasol propionate (1–5 days after treatment), betamethasone (up to 7 days after treatment), or desonide (up to 10 days after treatment).

Management: If PIH occurs, it can be addressed by multiple methods. All panelists recommend conservative management including stringent sun avoidance and topical application of sunscreen of several months. Other recommendations that did not reach consensus included: a topical formulation containing Vitamin C, kojic acid, hydroquinone 4%, and mild steroids (recommended by 30% of panelists). In resistant cases, a 532 or 755 nm picosecond laser was recommended by 33% of panelists. Other less commonly reported treatments for PIH were: IPL, PDL, chemical peels, and micro needling.

3.6 Contact Dermatitis

### An update on new and existing treatments for the management of melasma [^1143gd7D]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chemical Peels

Chemical peels are an effective option for refractory melasma, acting via the elimination of pigment through exfoliation. Alpha-hydroxy acids, beta-hydroxy acids, combination peels, and combinations with topicals such as 20% azelaic acid, have been used for enhanced efficacy. The peel is applied over the affected area for 2–10 min and then washed off.

To reduce the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, consensus groups suggest first using a priming agent in the preceding weeks. Studies have found 2% hydroquinone to be superior to either 0.025% tretinoin or no primer in improving chemical peel efficacy and reducing hyperpigmentation. The depth of action of the peel is associated with the severity of adverse effects, with superficial peels used for sensitive skin. Post-procedure care with sunscreen, emollients, and maintenance doses of peel ingredients or other topical treatments are encouraged and used in most studies.

Question 3: What is the most appropriate first step in treatment?
A. Topical calcineurin inhibitor
B. Cessation of immunotherapy
C. High-potency topical corticosteroid
D. Q-switched laser
E. Topical hydroquinone

Answers:
A. Topical calcineurin inhibitor – Correct. LPP is often refractory to treatment; however, topical calcineurin inhibitors are typically the first line therapy given their antiinflammatory effect and potential for longer-term use on sun-exposed skin. Topical corticosteroids are often used in the management of cirAEs; however, this would be less optimal as a first step in treatment given LPP tends to affect the face and neck.
B. Cessation of immunotherapy – Incorrect. While dose reduction or cessation of immunotherapy may be indicated in the setting of severe cutaneous adverse events, mild toxicities can be managed with topical therapies.
C. High-potency topical corticosteroid – Incorrect. Although high-potency topical corticosteroids may be appropriate in some cases of LPP and/or lichenoid cirAEs, they would not be recommended for long-term use on the face and neck given the risk of atrophy and further dyspigmentation.
D. Q-switched laser – Incorrect. Q-switched laser has been shown mild to moderate efficacy in treating LPP but can be costly and time-consuming. Other treatment options should be explored prior to treating with Q-switched laser.
E. Topical hydroquinone – Incorrect. Topical hydroquinone may be used in the treatment of LPP, but it is most appropriate in combination with other treatment options such as a topical calcineurin inhibitor. In addition, hydroquinone when used incorrectly can lead to exogenous ochronosis and paradoxical worsening pigmentation.

### Combination of a 755-nm picosecond laser and hydroquinone 2% cream versus hydroquinone 2% cream alone for the treatment of melasma: a randomized, split-face, and controlled trial [^113zsG8B]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While combined laser and topical treatments are currently a common approach to melasma treatment, data on the efficacy and safety of this combined therapy remain scarce, with studies showing varied results.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of hydroquinone (HQ) cream alone versus HQ cream combined with 755-nm picosecond (PS) laser in the treatment of melasma.

Method

Twenty subjects presenting with mixed-type melasma were enrolled in the study. All patients were instructed to apply 2% HQ cream to both sides of the face for 4 weeks. Randomly assigned hemifaces of all patients thereafter received 5 biweekly PS laser treatments. Objective (measurement of average melanin content and melanin index) and subjective (grading of modified melasma area and severity index [mMASI] score and global percentage of pigment clearance) assessments of melasma clearance, and occurrence of adverse effects were evaluated at 1-, 3-, and 6-months after the final laser treatment.

Results

mMASI scores were significantly improved from baseline for both sides (p = 0.006 HQ alone, p < 0.001 HQ+PS laser), with no statistically significant difference when comparing HQ alone versus HQ+PS laser. Objective assessments (measurements of average melanin content and melanin index) of melasma clearance corresponded to the clinical evaluation using mMASI score. Mild postinflammatory hyperpigmentation was observed in 15% of the patients on the laser-treated side, while no adverse effects were reported on the HQ monotherapy side.

Conclusions

Adjunctive treatment with a 755-nm PS laser does not provide additional benefit to topical HQ in the treatment of melasma. ClinicalTrail.gov PRS. number: NCT04597203.

### A method for maintaining the clinical results of 4% hydroquinone and 0.025% tretinoin with a cosmeceutical formulation [^115P2PoC]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Facial dyspigmentation treatment is an unmet need in dermatology with increasing challenges due to the questionable safety of hydroquinone. This research examined a new OTC formulation containing hydroxyphenoxy propionic acid, ellagic acid, yeast extract, and salicylic acid on subjects who previously completed 12 weeks of treatment with 4% hydroquinone and 0.025% retinoic acid. The goal of this study was to evaluate the skin lightening and tolerability profile of a 20-week maintanence therapy with a cosmeceutical formulation during the summer months. 33 healthy subjects ages 25–60 years with moderate facial dyspigmentation defined as a score of 3 on a 5-point scale were enrolled. There was statistically significant improvement at week 20 in terms of even skin tone (P < 0.001), spot intensity (P < 0.001), spot size (P < 0.05) and overall hyperpigmentation (P ≥ 0.002).

### A comprehensive review of the long-term and short-term treatment of melasma with a triple combination cream [^116drHgM]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Melasma is a common disorder of hyperpigmentation and generally involves areas of the face and neck. Hyperpigmentation is especially prevalent in darker complected patients and is often difficult to treat. Hydroquinone, tretinoin, and topical corticosteroids are well established monotherapeutic agents for treating melasma and hyperpigmentation; however, a stable, once-daily formulation triple combination cream containing 0.05% tretinoin, 4.0% hydroquinone, and 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide (Tri-Luma) represents the only commercially available combination of all three agents. This product is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of facial melasma. A number of publications have described the safety and efficacy of triple combination cream in over 2000 patients with melasma, some of whom were treated for > 12 months. In the initial 8-week study, 29% of patients experienced complete clearing of melasma by week 8, and 77% were clear or almost clear by week 8. Similarly, good results were seen in the two long-term studies, with the clear/mild rate ranging from 78% to 84% of patients at month 6 and from 81% to 94% of patients at month 12. Adverse events were almost always mild in severity and typically occurred only at the application site. The primary concern for most physicians using corticosteroid-containing products on the face is skin atrophy. However, only two cases of skin atrophy were reported across the three published studies. Overall, the results of these extensive studies indicate that triple combination cream is efficacious in treating melasma and exhibits a safe profile with low potential for adverse events.

### Safety and efficacy of a novel multimodality hydroquinone-free skin brightener over six months [^1136h5PP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormal accumulation of melanin is a common aesthetic skin concern. For years, the gold standard for the treatment of hyperpigmentary disorders has been 4% hydroquinone (HQ). Due to regulatory agencies around the world questioning the safety of HQ, there has been interest in developing new HQ-free skin brightening/lightening products. A multimodality product (skin brightening complex) addressing various pathways for melanogenesis was developed as an alternative to HQ.

Objective

The skin brightening complex was studied for efficacy and tolerability in subjects with moderate to severe facial hyperpigmentation.

Methods

Subjects were instructed to apply skin brightening complex to the entire face twice daily and to follow a standard skin care regimen (facial cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen) during the course of the study. The study was conducted over a 12-week period and consisted of evaluation visits at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. At each visit, subjects were evaluated by an investigator for clinical efficacy and tolerability using grading scales. Standardized digital photographs and spectrophotometric assessments were also taken. Self-assessment questionnaires were completed at weeks 4, 8, and 12. To assess longer-term safety and efficacy, 10 subjects elected to continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks (24 weeks total), with evaluations at weeks 18 and 24.

Results

Twenty-six subjects completed the 12-week study, and 8 subjects completed treatment for an additional 12 weeks (24 weeks in total). In the 12-week study, the skin brightening complex was shown to be effective and significantly improved Overall Hyperpigmentation at weeks 4, 8, and 12 compared with baseline. The skin brightening complex also significantly improved the Mottled Pigmentation Area and Severity Index ([MoPASI], a modified Melasma Area and Severity Index [MASI] scale) at weeks 8 and 12 compared with baseline. These efficacy benefits continued at 24 weeks. The product was well tolerated at all evaluation visits. Subject questionnaires showed 80% or more of the subjects reporting pigmentation improvement and satisfaction with the skin brightening complex at all evaluation visits.

Conclusion

This HQ-free skin brightening complex was effective and well tolerated in subjects with facial hyperpigmentation who were treated for as long as 24 weeks.

### Unveiling kratom's dark side: case report implicating the botanical ingredient as a culprit in recalcitrant photo-exposed hyperpigmentation [^112DyxJr]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Our report

We present a 32-year-old male with a 1-year history of recalcitrant gray-to-blue-brown patches with underlying telangiectasias on the face, ears, and lateral and posterior neck. (Fig 1). When the patient first presented to the clinic, erythematotelangiectatic rosacea and melasma were suspected. A broad-spectrum sunscreen was recommended, as well as oxymetazoline 1%/ivermectin 1%/niacinamide 2% cream and hydroquinone 12%/kojic acid 6%/vitamin C 1%/niacinamide 2% cream.

Fig 1
Diffuse, symmetric, deeply grey-to-violaceous hyperpigmented pathces in a photo-exposed distribution on the face.

Three months after his initial visit, the patient reported that hyperpigmentation on his cheeks had improved slightly, but the rest of the affected areas remained the same. The patient was advised to discontinue hydroquinone and to continue using the oxymetazoline cream. Due to the persistence of his hyperpigmentation, melasma was favored as the primary diagnosis, and the patient was prescribed tranexamic acid 325 mg twice a day.

After 4 months, the patient returned without any improvement in his hyperpigmentation. He endorsed the continued use of sunscreen and wearing a hat for sun protection, with a notable lack of involvement in areas by the hat. Further history was obtained, and the patient revealed that he had been employed by a water company for 1 year before the onset of hyperpigmentation. The patient's duties included water delivery, digging soil, reading meters, and working outside. Due to the patient's occupational exposure, Riehl's melanosis was considered a top differential, and a punch biopsy was performed.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of a multimodality skin brightener composition compared with 4% hydroquinone [^111jaNTe]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

There are numerous common skin disorders involving hyperpigmentation, including solar lentigines, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, melasma, freckles, and dyschromia from photoaging. While these conditions are of an aesthetic nature, there is great interest in newer, safer, and more effective treatment modalities. Topical hydroquinone (HQ) has been the gold standard of skin lighteners for many years. However, regulatory authorities around the world are now questioning its safety. A randomized, double-blind, half-face study was conducted in females with moderate to severe facial hyperpigmentation to assess the efficacy and tolerability of 3 new skin brightener formulations containing SMA-432, a prostaglandin E2 inhibitor, compared with 4% HQ. Each subject was assigned 2 of the 4 test materials and was instructed to apply the product on the assigned side of the face twice daily for 12 weeks. Evaluation visits were conducted at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At each visit, subjects were evaluated by a blinded investigator for clinical efficacy and tolerability using grading scales. Standardized digital photography and Chroma Meter assessments were also taken. Self-assessment questionnaires were completed at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Sixty-eight Caucasian subjects (136 half faces) completed the study. All test materials significantly reduced Overall Hyperpigmentation and improved the Investigator's Global Hyperpigmentation Improvement rating at weeks 4, 8, and 12 compared with baseline. SMA-432 exhibited a dose-dependent improvement in hyperpigmentation. There were no major tolerability issues with any of the test materials. Self-assessments were generally favorable for all test materials. At the completion of the trial, subjects rated one of the tested multimodality brightener compositions as the most favorable product and 4% HQ as the least favorable. This study demonstrated that the new non-HQ-containing skin brightener formulations were as effective and equally well tolerated as the gold standard, 4% HQ, in females with facial hyperpigmentation.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

In the controlled clinical trials, adverse events were monitored in the 161 subjects who used TRI-LUMA Cream once daily during an 8-week treatment period. There were 102 (63%) subjects who experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event during these trials. The most frequently reported events were erythema, desquamation, burning, dryness, and pruritus at the site of application. The majority of these events were mild to moderate in severity. Adverse events reported by at least 1% of patients and judged by the investigators to be reasonably related to treatment with TRI-LUMA Cream from the controlled clinical trials are summarized (in decreasing order of frequency) as follows:

In an open-label trial, subjects who had cumulative treatment of melasma with TRI-LUMA Cream for 6 months showed a similar pattern of adverse events as in the 8-week studies.

The following local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings, especially with higher potency corticosteroids. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, skin atrophy, striae, and miliaria.

Most common adverse reactions (incidence > 5%) are erythema, desquamation, burning, dryness, pruritus, and acne. (6)

### Efficacy of hydroquinone (2%) versus tretinoin (0.025%) as adjunct topical agents for chemical peeling in patients of melasma [^1153h5gb]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

In recent years, chemical peels have become increasingly popular in the treatment of melasma. However, postpeel hyperpigmentation is a frequently encountered side effect, especially in dark-skinned individuals. The role of priming agents in preventing this complication has not been adequately evaluated. Hence, we studied the effect of hydroquinone versus tretinoin as priming agents in minimizing the incidence of this side effect in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial of 50 patients with melasma.

Methods

Of a total of 50 patients, 25 patients each with a similar skin phototype, the nature and severity of melasma were assigned to groups I and II. The patients were primed with 2% hydroquinone in group I, and in group II with 0.025% tretinoin once daily (night time) 2 weeks before starting trichloroacetic acid peels. Subsequently, all of them received trichloroacetic acid peels at intervals of 2 weeks for 12 weeks, followed by monthly peels for next 12 weeks during the follow-up period. Patients continued to use a sunscreen with an SPF of greater than 15 and the recommended priming agent during the follow-up. Final assessment was made at 6 months, based on the impression of the patient, clinical examination by the physician, and photographic analysis.

Results

A total of 50 patients (25 in each group) participated in the study. The predominant Fitzpatrick skin type observed among them was type IV (56%), and the type of melasma was mixed (44%). The final results at 12 weeks were comparable in two groups. However, a significant difference was seen in the two groups during the follow-up period, with continued improvement in 24% and worsening in 28% of patients in group I and continued improvement in only 16% and worsening in 40% in group II patients.

Conclusions

Hydroquinone is superior to tretinoin as a priming agent in maintaining the results achieved with peels and in decreasing the incidence of postpeel reactive hyperpigmentation.

### Cosmeceuticals for the attenuation of extrinsic and intrinsic dermal aging [^111wFKj9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Since the term "cosmeceutical" was coined over 2 decades ago, the number of products in this category that claim to combat dermal aging has grown dramatically. Topical retinoids remain the mainstay for treating photoaging given their proven efficacy in both clinical and histologic outcomes. In addition to retinoids, many other cosmeceutical agents are now available. The proliferation of products can cause confusion among consumers, who often ask their dermatologist for advice as to which antiaging products they should choose. Ideally, the antiaging claims of cosmeceutical formulations and their components should be demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. In order to provide appropriate recommendations to their patients, dermatologists must become familiar with the available data on currently marketed products and gain experience with antiaging regimens. This review discusses the efficacy of a number of currently marketed drug products with proven photoaging benefits and cosmeceutical products that claim similar benefits. Among the agents discussed are single-entity and combination products containing hydroquinones, retinoids, topical antioxidants, and minerals.

### Cosmetic color improvement of the nipple-areola complex by optimal use of tretinoin and hydroquinone [^111iarRp]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Background

A successful treatment to improve the color of nipple-areola complex (NAC) has never been reported, although the number of women seeking the more attractively colored NAC is not small.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness of our bleaching protocol for cosmetic improvement of the NAC.

Methods

The protocol was composed of two phases: bleaching phase (4–8 weeks) and healing phase (4–6 weeks). 0.2–0.4% tretinoin aqueous gel was applied concomitantly with 5% hydroquinone, 7% lactic acid ointment for bleaching twice a day. Tretinoin was applied to the NAC with a small cotton applicator, while hydroquinone was widely applied beyond the NAC area. After obtaining sufficient improvement in NAC color, the application of tretinoin was discontinued and hydroquinone alone was continually applied in the healing phase until the reactive erythema was eliminated. Fifteen female patients were involved in this study.

Results

The average treatment period was 16.6 weeks. Improvement of NAC color was obtained in 12 patients (80%) by the physician's estimation, and 11 patients (73%) satisfied with their final results. The treatment was repeated after a 1-month interval of tretinoin application in 4 patients: 2 desired further improvement in color, and 2 had the second course conducted to treat the postinflammatory hyperpigmentation on the surrounding mound induced by the first course.

Conclusion

This approach appeared to be most effective for cosmetic improvement of NAC color among treatments available so far.

### An update on new and existing treatments for the management of melasma [^114erFCa]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cysteamine

Cysteamine is an aminothiol with depigmenting properties, used after the discovery of formulations that reduce its sulphur-like odour. A cysteamine-containing cream is applied to the skin for 15 min to 2 h and then washed off. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, however theories include an inhibition of tyrosinase and peroxidase, reduction in the rate conversion of tyrosine to dopaquinone, and upregulation of intracellular glutathione, which collectively inhibit melanogenesis and shift eumelanin to pheomelanin synthesis.

A randomised placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients demonstrated statistically significant MASI score reductions after 4 months (7.2 ± 5.5 with cysteamine vs. 11.6 ± 7.9 with placebo), and a greater reduction in colourimetry scores: 26.2 ± 16 from 75.2 ± 37 with cysteamine, and 60.7 ± 27.3 from 68.9 ± 31 in the placebo group. Another randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 40 patients found lower MASI scores and reduced skin colourimetry values with cysteamine.

A double-blinded, randomised controlled study divided 20 patients into a 5% cysteamine or 4% hydroquinone group. After 16 weeks, the mean mMASI reduced by 21.3% (5.6 ± 2.7 from 7.1 ± 3.41) following cysteamine use compared with a reduction of 32% (6.3 ± 4.8 from 9.2 ± 5.7) following hydroquinone application. The predominant adverse effect for both treatments was irritation, which was more common with cysteamine. In a quasi-randomised, multicentre, evaluator-blinded comparative trial of 5% cysteamine versus 4% hydroquinone on 40 women, the cysteamine group had an inferior reduction in mMASI (24% vs. 41%) and a smaller decrease in MelasQOL scores, but similar levels of depigmentation with colourimetric assessment. This study included different cysteamine application times, from < 30 min to overnight facial contact time, despite recommendations to use the cream for up to 2 h. Up to 20% of patients in the cysteamine group reported erythema and burning, similar to the hydroquinone group.

### Sun protection strength of a hydroquinone 4% / retinol 0.3% preparation containing sunscreens [^113Eq6pt]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dyschromias are common and significantly impact patients' quality of life. Formulas containing hydroquinone 4% are effective in these conditions. Since exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can worsen disease and complicate treatment, the incorporation of sunscreens can avert this problem.

Methods

We tested the sun protection factor of a hydroquinone formulation (Lustra-Ultra, TaroPharma, Hawthorne, NY) containing avobenzone 3%, and octinoxate 7.5% according to the FDA Sunscreen Monograph on 20 volunteer subjects. We also determined the UVR absorbance spectrum of the preparation.

Results

The mean sun protection factor (SPF) of 21.7 satisfied labeling requirements for SPF 20. The formulation exhibited strongest photoprotection near the wavelengths of peak sun burning effectiveness in the UVB region and maintains significant UVR absorbance through the entire UVA region.

Conclusions

Avobenzone 3% and octinoxate 7.5% provide broad spectrum UV protection. Incorporating these sunscreens into a hydroquinone preparation simplifies the treatment regimen while providing significant photoprotection for patients being treated for dyschromia.

### A randomized controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of a fixed triple combination (fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%, hydroquinone 4%, tretinoin 0.05%) compared with hydroquinone 4% cream in Asian patients with moderate to severe melasma [^112Nvwff]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Melasma is an acquired, chronic hypermelanosis for which therapy remains a challenge.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of a triple combination [TC: fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%, hydroquinone (HQ) 4%, tretinoin 0.05%] vs. HQ 4% after 8 weeks of treatment of moderate to severe facial melasma in Asian patients.

Methods

This was a multicentre, randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, parallel comparison study. East and South-East Asian patients aged 18 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe melasma, were enrolled in this study. Patients were enrolled at baseline and treated daily for 8 weeks with TC cream (one application at bedtime) or HQ cream (twice daily). There were four study visits: at baseline and weeks 2, 4 and 8. The primary efficacy variable was the melasma global severity score (GSS). Other outcome measures included Melasma Area and Severity Index, global improvement and patient satisfaction. Safety was assessed through the reporting of adverse events.

Results

TC had superior efficacy to HQ for the primary variable: 77/120 patients (64.2%) on TC had GSS 'none' or 'mild' at week 8 vs. 48/122 patients (39.4%) on HQ (P < 0.001). The secondary efficacy variables confirmed these results. Patient satisfaction was in favour of TC (90/127, 70.8%, vs. 64/129, 49.6%; P = 0.005). More patients had related adverse events on TC (63/129, 48.8%) than on HQ (18/131, 13.7%) but most were mild and none was severe.

Conclusions

Efficacy in Asians and patient satisfaction were superior with the fixed TC than with HQ 4%.

### Novel approach to the treatment of hyperpigmented photodamaged skin: 4% hydroquinone / 0.3% retinol versus tretinoin 0.05% emollient cream [^112h8HH1]. Dermatologic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Mild to moderately photodamaged skin is characterized by dyspigmentation, fine wrinkles, and tactile roughness. An optimal approach to the topical treatment of photoaging would simultaneously address all appearance issues.

Objective

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of 4% hydroquinone and 0.3% retinol in photoaging.

Materials and Methods

A 16-week study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of a single cream containing prescription topical 4% hydroquinone for dyspigmentation and the cosmeceutical 0.3% retinol for fine wrinkles in an emollient vehicle for tactile roughness. This novel formulation was compared with 0.05% tretinoin emollient cream, the standard against which all other topical photoaging treatments are compared. Investigator assessments, subject assessments, and photography represented the evaluation end points.

Results

The cosmeceutical emollient 4% hydroquinone/0.3% retinol cream more effectively diminished the collective signs of photodamage than 0.05% tretinoin emollient cream in terms of dyspigmentation, fine wrinkles, and tactile roughness in 16 weeks.

Conclusion

Combination therapy of hydroquinone and retinol may improve photoaging-associated hyperpigmentation.

### Effects of topical retinoids on acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in patients with skin of color: a clinical review and implications for practice [^111EAm1R]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Early Treatment and Long-Term Management

Early and effective treatment of acne is key to reducing long-term sequelae such as hyperpigmentation and scarring (including keloids), which can be very challenging to treat in patients with SOC. Topical retinoids have anti-inflammatory as well as comedolytic effects, which make them ideal for treating both acne and hyperpigmentation. They should therefore be considered a first-line therapy for most patients, unless contraindicated or not well tolerated. For patients who experience cutaneous reactions to topical retinoids, trial with a newer formulation may be warranted.

Retinoids are an essential part of treatment, but many patients may require a multimodal approach to address the different disease mechanisms associated with acne and hyperpigmentation. Topical treatments that may be used in conjunction with topical retinoids include the following:
Azelaic acid. This naturally occurring acid has anti-inflammatory, anti-infective, and anti-oxidant properties. It may reduce hyperpigmentation by inhibiting tyrosinase, which is essential for melanin production. Studies with azelaic acid 15% foam have demonstrated improvements in acne; a study with azelaic acid 15% gel showed improvements in hyperpigmentation.
Antibiotics with benzoyl peroxide (BP). Combining topical antibiotics (e.g. clindamycin, erythromycin) with BP reduces the risk for resistance. In addition to their proven effects on acne, these combination therapies may be effective in reducing hyperpigmentation, as demonstrated with clindamycin/BP 1%/5% gel in patients with SOC.
Dapsone. Dapsone has both anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties, which allow for its use in a wide range of dermatologic conditions. Dapsone 7.5% gel is approved for the treatment of acne, and a post-hoc analysis of the phase III trials showed no significant differences in efficacy between patients with SOC (defined as Fitzpatrick skin type IV–VI) and those with lower skin phototype (type I–III). No results for hyperpigmentation were presented, but patterns of investigator-rated tolerability (i.e. stinging/burning, dryness, scaling, erythema) were similar between subgroups.
Hydroquinone. Hydroquinone inhibits melanin production by acting as an alternative substrate for tyrosinase, with possible destruction of melanocytes and degradation of melanosomes. Hydroquinone has been a mainstay for skin lightening, and its effects may be further enhanced by combination with a topical retinoid. The triple combination of fluocinolone acetonide/hydroquinone/tretinoin (0.01%/4%/0.05% cream) is approved for short-term treatment of moderate-to-severe melasma in the face. For acne-induced PIH, patients may need to carefully apply topical hydroquinone to affected areas to avoid unwanted hypopigmentation.

### Systematic review of randomized controlled trials on interventions for melasma: an abridged cochrane review [^115sfMSv]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple treatments exist for melasma; they are often substandard and associated with side effects.

Objectives

We sought to assess the effectiveness of interventions used in the management of all types of melasma.

Methods

We undertook a systematic review using the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration.

Results

We included 20 studies with a total of 2125 participants covering 23 different treatments. A meta-analysis was not possible because of the heterogeneity of treatments. Triple-combination cream (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide) was more effective at lightening melasma than hydroquinone alone (relative risk 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.26–1.97) or any of the agents in a dual-combination cream. Azelaic acid (20%) was significantly more effective than 2% hydroquinone (relative risk 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.06–1.48) at lightening melasma. In 2 studies where tretinoin was compared with placebo, objective measures demonstrated significant reductions in the severity. However, only in 1 study did participants rate a significant improvement (relative risk 13, 95% confidence interval 1.88–89.74).

Limitations

There was poor methodology, a lack of standardized outcome assessments, and short duration of studies.

Conclusions

The current limited evidence supports the efficacy of multiple interventions. Randomized controlled trials on well-defined participants with long-term outcomes are needed.

### Evaluation of a hydroquinone-free skin brightening product using in vitro inhibition of melanogenesis and clinical reduction of ultraviolet-induced hyperpigmentation [^115rLLhG]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Skin lightening preparations are used by people all over the world for a diverse range of dermatologic indications. Hydroquinone (HQ) is the gold standard and remains the only prescription product available in the United States for the treatment of generalized facial hyperpigmentation. Irritation and the risk of exogenous ochronosis are the main adverse effects for concern. Therefore, there has been a constant search for new treatment alternatives. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in pigmentation has resulted in the development of a series of formulations that utilize a multimodal treatment approach. These proprietary formulas combine skin lightening agents that act via different mechanisms of action. The actives included 4-ethoxybenzaldehyde (anti-inflammatory and prostaglandin E2 suppressor), licorice extract (tyrosinase inhibitor), tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate (antioxidant), niacinamide (melanosome transport inhibitor), ethyl linoleate (tyrosinase inhibitor; enhances turnover of epidermis), hexylresorcinol (tyrosinase inhibitor), and retinol (tyrosinase transcription inhibitor; enhances turnover of epidermis).

Methods

Select formulations were tested in several studies using the MelanoDerm™ Skin Model (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) to assess the ability of the product to reduce melanin production and distribution. A single-center, double-blind comparison clinical study of 18 subjects was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the product in reducing ultraviolet-induced hyperpigmentation. Test sites were irradiated with 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 minimal erythema doses. After 5 days, to allow for pigmentation development, the product or 4% HQ cream was applied to the respective test sites, once daily for 4 weeks. Chroma Meter measurements (L* brightness) and standardized digital photographs were taken of the test sites twice a week.

Results

The test product resulted in greater reduction in melanin as measured by melanin content and histological staining compared with the positive control in the MelanoDerm Skin Model. The product also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in pigmentation compared with baseline (all P ≤ .0001) at the end of the clinical study, and produced greater increases in L*, compared with 4% HQ. Results from these studies indicate that a product designed to affect multiple pathways of melanogenesis and melanin distribution may provide an additional treatment option beyond HQ for hyperpigmentation.

### Is topical zinc effective in the treatment of melasma? A double-blind randomized comparative study [^114RcKFm]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Zinc plays a role in skin health, and preliminary data have shown its beneficial effects for melasma. We compared the effect of topical zinc with that of hydroquinone as the standard treatment on severity of melasma.

Patients and Methods

Ninety-three women with melasma were randomized to receive zinc sulfate 10% or hydroquinone 4% solutions once daily for 2 months. They were followed for an additional 3 months while using sunscreen. The severity of melasma was assessed at baseline and at 2 and 5 months using the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI).

Results

Eighty-two patients completed the study. The MASI score fell significantly in both groups, but a greater decrease was seen in those who received hydroquinone (43.5 ± 15.5% vs 18.6 ± 20.8%, p < .001). Postinflammatory pigmentation occurred in 5.2% of the zinc group and irritation in 30.9% of the hydroquinone group.

Conclusion

Topical zinc therapy is not highly effective in reducing the severity of melasma, but further trials are needed to determine whether adding zinc to current topical treatments could improve treatment response.

### An update on new and existing treatments for the management of melasma [^1121Haty]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Azelaic acid inhibits tyrosinase, has anti-inflammatory properties, and selectively targets overactive melanocytes [47.] Some papers suggest it has a similar efficacy to hydroquinone. An open-label comparative trial compared 20% azelaic acid cream twice daily with 4% hydroquinone in 29 patients with mild melasma and found no significant difference in mean MASI scores after 1 month but a significant difference after 2 months, with a decrease of MASI from 7.6 ± 3.5 to 3.8 ± 2.8 with azelaic acid versus 7.2 ± 3.2 to 6.2 ± 3.6 with hydroquinone. The azelaic acid group also noted less erythema and pruritis. Azelaic acid represents a well-tolerated alternative to hydroquinone in mild melasma and has also demonstrated efficacy with oral TXA or chemical peels for more severe cases.

### Fluocinolone acetonide, hydroquinone, and tretinoin (Tri-luma) [^1154rvuF]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Two adequate and well-controlled efficacy and safety trials were conducted in 641 subjects between the ages of 21 to 75 years, having Fitzpatrick Skin types I-IV and moderate to severe melasma of the face. TRI-LUMA Cream was compared with 3 possible combinations of 2 of the 3 active ingredients [(1) hydroquinone 4% (HQ) + tretinoin 0.05% (RA); (2) fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% (FA) + tretinoin 0.05% (RA); (3) fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% (FA) + hydroquinone 4% (HQ)], contained in the same vehicle as TRI-LUMA Cream. Subjects were instructed to apply their study medication each night, after washing their face with a mild soapless cleanser, for 8 weeks. Instructions were given to apply a thin layer of study medication to the hyperpigmented lesion, making sure to cover the entire lesion including the outside borders extending to the normal pigmented skin. Subjects were provided a mild moisturizer for use as needed. A sunscreen with SPF 30 was also provided with instructions for daily use. Protective clothing and avoidance of sunlight exposure to the face was recommended.

### Middle-aged female with blue nails and graying skin [^112i18yn]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the recommended treatment to improve pigmentation?
A. Chelation
B. Topical hydroquinone
C. Laser
D. Dermabrasion
E. No treatment available

Answers:
A. Chelation – Incorrect. Chelation has not provided results as a treatment for argyria.
B. Topical hydroquinone – Incorrect. Hydroquinone has not shown adequate outcomes. Additionally, one risks further compounding the issue with prolonged exposure of hydroquinone causing exogenous ochronosis.
C. Laser – Incorrect. Limited cases have shown pigmentary improvement after cosmetic laser, specifically the low fluence 1064-nm Nd:YAG, but these were temporary with argyria recurring about 1 year after the laser.
D. Dermabrasion – Incorrect. Dermabrasion has not provided adequate results as treatment for argyria.
E. No treatment available – Correct. Recommending discontinuing silver products and good sun protection are the next steps as no treatments for discoloration have been adequate at this point. While argyria is a benign condition, it can cause significant psychological stress due to the lack of treatments and permanent discoloration.

### Blockade of melanin synthesis, activation and distribution pathway by a nonprescription natural regimen is equally effective to a multiple prescription-based therapeutic regimen [^117XX14y]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Disorders characterized by cutaneous hyperpigmentation (HP) are among the most common complaints in dermatologists' offices. These patients are also some of the most difficult to treat since current therapeutic regimens have high irritation rates and mediocre efficacy. Moreover, current regimens have the potential to induce post-inflammatory HP (PIH), a secondary disease that is more difficult to treat.

Objective

To measure the effectiveness of a novel blend of primarily natural ingredients that inhibits all but one of the steps in melanin synthesis, activation and distribution. Three common types of HP were treated and compared with one of the most commonly prescribed available regimens. This comprises two prescription products and two nonprescription products containing known depigmenting lightening ingredients.

Materials and Methods

The initial trial consisted of 56 females of 3 different races were treated in a 3-armed parallel, investigatorblinded prospective controlled clinical trial of 18 weeks duration. The treatment phase was 12 weeks long, followed by a 6 week, nontreatment regression phase. This trial was conducted in the winter at over 6,000 feet above sea level. The natural ingredient (NI) blend consists of two cosmeceutical products together containing 22 ingredients. A second 1-year open trial of 31 panelists of 3 races was instituted to document continual improvement using both NI products without irritation and sensitization.

Results

The novel herbal blend regimens had comparable efficacy in treating HP and preventing rebound of mottled HP, dyschromia and melasma as the commercial regimen containing two prescription products. The 12-month open study demonstrated continued visible improvement of the HP with NI regimens without irritation and sensitization.

Conclusion

The novel primarily natural ingredient product regimens are equally effective in treating three types of cutaneous HP as is a regimen containing prescription hydroquinone 4%, tretinoin 0.05% and two nonprescription leave on products.

### Cutaneous chronic graft-versus-host disease: clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and supportive care [^111G3t8w]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

PIH can be challenging to treat. First, any active ongoing cutaneous GVHD should be addressed with GVHD-directed treatment. Patients should be counseled that pigmentary changes generally gradually resolve over time, though it can take months to years to see improvement. Patients with more heavily pigmented skin and more intense cutaneous inflammation will experience slower improvement in PIH, and expectations surrounding the rate of improvement should be discussed. Patients should be counseled to practice diligent sun protection, as UV exposure will exacerbate PIH and inhibit improvement.

If patients desire to treat PIH, topical treatments such as hydroquinone combined with topical retinoids (such as tretinoin, adapalene, or tazarotene) and topical steroids can be considered. An example of such a formulation includes hydroquinone 4%, tretinoin 0.05%, and fluocinolone 0.01%. Patients should be counseled about the risk of paradoxical ochronosis, in which brown-black discoloration results from chronic topical hydroquinone usage, and use of hydroquinone-containing agents should be limited to a few months' duration with careful monitoring of side effects. Formulations that contain a topical steroid ingredient should also be used with caution on the face given risks of skin atrophy, striae, and telangiectasias with long-term topical steroid use on areas of thinner skin. Topical retinoids may cause dryness and irritation but are likely safe to use. Additional agents that may help with PIH include topical azelaic acid, kojic acid, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), and niacinamide, among others, though studies on efficacy are limited overall and none have specifically been studied in the cutaneous GVHD population.

### An update on new and existing treatments for the management of melasma [^1173R4Me]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

A randomised controlled trial of 50 women with melasma compared the efficacy of 0.2% thiamidol versus 4% hydroquinone over 90 days. All patients received tinted SPF60 sunscreen. There was a mean 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35–50%) reduction in mMASI scores in the 0.2% thiamidol group compared with a 33% (95% CI 23–42%) reduction in the 4% hydroquinone group. Two patients (8%) receiving thiamidol reported allergic contact dermatitis, but no serious adverse effects were noted. Although this study did not find a significant difference in efficacy with thiamidol, it proposes thiamidol as a suitable and well-tolerated alternative to hydroquinone.

Forty-eight women with moderate-to-severe melasma completed a 24-week randomised controlled trial that compared thiamidol with a vehicle. A mean MASI reduction of 4.2 ± 2.4 using thiamidol compared with 2.3 ± 1.7 using the vehicle was obtained. The mean MASI score increased after treatment cessation but remained below baseline at 13- to 20-week follow-up. At 24 weeks, MelasQOL scores decreased by 25.1 ± 16.1 with thiamidol compared with 17.5 ± 13.3 with the vehicle, suggesting a significant quality-of-life improvement (p < 0.001) in patients using thiamidol. Akin to the other trials, thiamidol was very well tolerated.

In late 2023, a randomised controlled trial of 40 patients investigated the efficacy and safety of 0.1% thiamidol + 0.1% retinoic acid + 0.1% dexamethasone acetate compared with a traditional TCC formulation (5% hydroquinone + 0.1% retinoic acid + 0.1% dexamethasone acetate), applied daily for 12 weeks. At week 12, the mean mMASI for the thiamidol combination group improved by 63% compared with 39% in the TCC group, but statistical significance was not achieved. Greater MelasQoL improvement was also noted in the thiamidol combination group. A partial but limited relapse was noted in both groups 12 weeks after treatment cessation; patients were instructed to use sunscreen as maintenance therapy. No major adverse events were reported, however irritation adverse effects were noted in 68.4% and 65% of the thiamidol combination and TCC groups, respectively.

### An update on new and existing treatments for the management of melasma [^1141mxW7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Retinoids

Retinoids target melasma via multiple mechanisms, including tyrosinase inhibition, acceleration of epidermal turnover and hence pigment loss, and interference with keratinocyte pigment granules and pigment transfer. In a randomised vehicle-controlled trial of 38 women, 68% rated their melasma as improved or much improved with 0.1% tretinoin compared with 5% who reported improvement in the vehicle group after 40 weeks of use. The tretinoin group demonstrated a 0.9-unit lightening with colourimetry and 36% reduction in epidermal pigment versus 0.3-unit darkening and 50% increase in epidermal pigment in the vehicle group.

Retinoic acid can be irritating, especially on initial use. Adapalene is a retinoid derivative that is less irritating. In a randomised controlled trial of 30 women, 0.1% adapalene gel was non-inferior in efficacy to 0.05% tretinoin. Adapalene gel demonstrated a comparable reduction of MASI score (41% vs. 37% at 14 weeks), with fewer adverse effects; 8% reported mild erythema or burning and 13% with dryness with adapalene compared with 63% with pruritus, burning, dryness, erythema, and scaling in the tretinoin group. In contrast, a randomised vehicle-controlled trial found that 0.05% isotretinoin gel did not demonstrate a significant improvement in melasma versus vehicle.

Retinoic acid is commonly used with hydroquinone, and like sunscreen, can increase the effectiveness of hydroquinone in treating melasma. Concentrations vary to include 0.025–0.1% retinoic acid with 2–5% hydroquinone. In a prospective, single-arm study of 20 patients, 4% hydroquinone with 0.025% tretinoin cream resulted in a significant (p < 0.001) MASI score reduction after 12 weeks of use.

Trifarotene is a novel retinoid used in acne, with a high selectivity for the retinoic acid receptor gamma. No studies could yet be identified that explore its use in melasma, however anti-pigmenting activity has been demonstrated in mouse models.

### Widespread use of toxic skin lightening compounds: medical and psychosocial aspects [^11336s92]. Dermatologic Clinics (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperpigmentation disorders and skin lightening treatments have a significant impact on the dermatologic, physiologic, psychologic, economic, social, and cultural aspects of life. Skin lightening compounds, such as hydroquinone and topical corticosteroids, are often used to treat hyperpigmentation disorders, such as melasma, or lighten skin for cosmetic purposes. Despite their established effectiveness, a multitude of dermatologic and systemic complications have been associated with these agents. Regulatory agencies have also recognized the adverse effects of skin lighteners and many countries around the world now forbid the production and sale of these compounds, although this prohibition has not significantly curtailed distribution. Dermatologists and users of cosmetic products should be aware of the various components in bleaching compounds, their potential adverse effects, and alternative options for skin lightening.

### In vitro and in vivo efficacy and tolerability of a non-hydroquinone, multi-action skin tone correcting cream [^114r95eJ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Pigmentation disorders are therapeutically challenging to treat, requiring complicated regimens.

Objectives: Alternatives to hydroquinone (HQ) are desired. We evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of a non-HQ multi-action skin tone corrector (ETCS) developed to inhibit melanin production and improve skin quality.

Design and Methods: Twice-daily use of ETCS and ETCS + AHA-Ret, a retinoid-based alpha hydroxy acid cream, was evaluated in subjects with mild to severe dyschromia. Digital images were obtained at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks and included assessment of dyschromia, erythema, fine lines/wrinkles, pores, texture, and global improvement. Melanin Index (MI) measurements were obtained at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Subject self-assessments were obtained over the course of the study. Adverse Events (AEs) were collected throughout the study. An extension study evaluated use over 16-weeks.

Results: Significant mean reductions from baseline occurred in dyschromia for ETCS (n = 42) and ETCS + AHA-Ret (n = 10) over 12 weeks (P < 0.0001, each). Significant mean reductions from baseline in MI were achieved in both groups at every timepoint (ETCS: P < 0.0001; ETCS + AHA-Ret: P < 0.02, 4 weeks; P < 0.0001, 8 and 12 weeks). Substantial improvements were demonstrated in global improvement, fine lines/wrinkles, erythema, pores, and texture at 12 weeks. Reductions from baseline occurred in dyschromia and MI (P < 0.0001, each) at 16 weeks. High levels of subject satisfaction were reported with nearly all subjects reporting reduced appearance of uneven skin tone/discoloration and lightened darker patches, and improvement in overall skin tone. Mild, transient AEs were reported with no discontinuations due to an AE.

Conclusions: Twice daily use of ETCS led to early, significant reductions in dyschromia and melanin index. Combination use with a retinoid-based, AHA cream in the evening demonstrated enhanced reductions. ETCS effectively reduced hyperpigmentation, improved overall skin appearance, and was highly tolerable.

### Utilizing combination therapy to optimize melasma outcomes [^112z5qjs]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Melasma is a chronic and recurrent disorder. It has been underdiagnosed and undertreated due to lack of effective therapies and the perception that it is merely a cosmetic nuisance. Hydroquinone, corticosteroids, licorice extracts and kojic acid have been used as monotherapy to treat melasma. However, the present standard of care in melasma therapy is combination therapy. To date, the most effective treatment is a triple-combination agent that contains hydroquinone 4%, tretinoin 0.05% and fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%. In clinical trials, its use led to complete or near-complete clearing of melasma in 8 weeks. A long-term study demonstrated its continuing efficacy and safety for as long as 360 days. In an examination of quality of life parameters, patients using the triple-combination cream showed significant improvements in self-perception by all 1290 patients. Various combinations of melasma therapy, such as chemical peels, particularly as adjuvants to the triple-combination cream, are discussed.

### Successful treatment of hydroquinone-resistant melasma using topical methimazole [^114Pjx5v]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Melasma is an acquired hyperpigmentation skin disorder in sun-exposed areas. It occurs almost exclusively over the face, and is most commonly seen in women. Several depigmenting agents have been used for the treatment of melasma among which hydroquinone has been the most widely used due to its efficacy and safety in short-term use. However, hydroquinone is recently reported to be a cytotoxic and mutagenic compound in mammalian cells and is thus banned in several countries. Hydroquinone ban has caused investigators to search for alternative depigmenting agents for the treatment of melasma in recent years. Methimazole is an antithyroid agent orally used in humans since several decades and has been shown that when applied topically, it inhibits melanin synthesis and causes skin depigmentation in lab animals as well as human subjects. Herein, we report two hydroquinone-resistant melasma patients who were successfully treated with methimazole cream. Application of 5% methimazole cream once daily resulted in significant improvement of melasma in both patients after 8 weeks. The efficacy of methimazole for melasma treatment as well as its advantages over other known depigmenting compounds (non-mutagenicity, non-cytotoxicity and high tolerability profile) suggests that topical methimazole should be added to the armamentarium of anti-melasma treatment.

### A randomized, double-blind, split-face study of topical silymarin vs 2% hydroquinone cream in melasmas [^116MwSLP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydroquinone is effective in melasma treatment, but side effects may limit its use. Silymarin cream may be a safer alternative.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of 1.4% silymarin with 2% hydroquinone for melasma treatment in Asians.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, split-face study of 25 patients with epidermal or mixed-type melasma, the facial sides were randomized for the application of silymarin cream on one side and hydroquinone on the contralateral side for 3 months. Results were evaluated using a colorimeter, modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI) score, and patient self-assessment.

Results

Twenty-three patients completed the study. Colorimetric measurements calculated as relative lightness index (RL*I) showed no statistical difference between the 2 treatments (P = 0.715). Compared with baseline, both treatments showed statistically significant improvements of RL*I, with 14.56% and 12.82% improvement in silymarin and hydroquinone, respectively. Modified MASI scores decreased after both treatments but were only statistically significant on the hydroquinone side, achieving 17.97% reduction (P = 0.02) vs 7.11% (P = 0.32) on the silymarin side. There was no statistically significant difference of the RL*I and modified MASI between the 2 treatments (P > 0.05). Patients' assessment of hydroquinone treatment showed a 69.6% good-excellent improvement with a visual analog scale (VAS) satisfaction score of 7.82, compared with silymarin showing a 73.9% good-excellent improvement and VAS score of 7.65 (P = 0.50). More adverse effects occurred with the hydroquinone.

Conclusion

Although hydroquinone showed a better response, topical silymarin was effective in the treatment of epidermal and mixed-type melasma with fewer side effects. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(12):1304–1310. doi:10.36849/JDD.6491.

### Comparative evaluation of beneficiary effects of priming agents (2% hydroquinone and 0.025% retinoic acid) in the treatment of melasma with glycolic acid peels [^116tjetr]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Chemical peels have become a popular modality in the treatment of melasma. The most disturbing side effect of this procedure is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. This may be minimized with the help of priming agents. Because there is a paucity of such studies, this study was taken up to evaluate the beneficial effects of hydroquinone versus tretinoin as priming agents in treatment of melasma with glycolic acid peels.

Methods

Sixty patients of melasma were randomly assigned in three groups of 20 patients each in a single-blind study. Group I received only glycolic acid peels while Groups II and III were primed with 0.025% tretinoin and 2% hydroquinone, respectively, for 2 weeks before peeling. The patients received serial glycolic acid peels fortnightly for the first 3 months and then monthly for the next 3 months and were then followed up for the next 3 months when peeling was stopped. Clinical and photographic evaluation was done at 3, 6, and 9 months, and subjective improvement was noted.

Results

There was an overall decrease in MASI from baseline to 6 months in all three groups but it was highly significant between Groups I and III (p < .001) at 6 and 9 months and significant between Groups II and III (p < .01) at 9 months.

Conclusions

Results are better with hydroquinone as priming agent compared to tretinoin in enhancing the results with glycolic acid peels in melasma and in decreasing postpeel postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

### Treatment of melasma [^117X4mPD]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment of melasma involves the use of a range of topical depigmenting agents and physical therapies. Varying degrees of success have been achieved with these therapies. The Pigmentary Disorders Academy (PDA) undertook to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the different treatments of melasma in order to generate a consensus statement on its management. Clinical papers published during the past 20 years were identified through MEDLINE searches and methodology and outcome assessed according to guidelines adapted from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The consensus of the group was that first-line therapy for melasma should consist of effective topical therapies, mainly fixed triple combinations. Where patients have either sensitivity to the ingredients or a triple combination therapy is unavailable, other compounds with dual ingredients (hydroquinone plus glycolic acid) or single agents (4% hydroquinone, 0.1% retinoic acid, or 20% azelaic acid) may be considered as an alternative. In patients who failed to respond to therapy, options for second-line therapy include peels either alone or in combination with topical therapy. Some patients will require therapy to maintain remission status and a combination of topical therapies should be considered. Lasers should rarely be used in the treatment of melasma and, if applied, skin type should be taken into account.

### Nail discoloration after use of hydroquinone [^1126wj6N]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

Sixty-two-year-old identical twin males presented with hyperpigmentation after the use of hydroquinone. Both twins noticed nail dyspigmentation on their distal fourth and fifth fingernails 3 months after starting treatment with hydroquinone. In both patients the hyperpigmentation was asymptomatic, and neither had any underlying onychodystrophy. Over the next 2 months, the brown dyspigmentation continued to extend proximally eventually measuring as much as 7 mm on the first patient's hand and 9 mm on the second patient's hand (Figs 1 and 2). At a follow-up visit 2 months later, the nails for both patients were a dusky brown color. Attempts to scrape off the pigment were unsuccessful. Periodic acid–Schiff stain was negative, and cultures showed no growth. Complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were both within normal limits.

Both patients were using a mixture of 10% hydroquinone and tretinoin 0.05% cream for cosmetic improvement of facial lentigines. The dyschromia for both patients improved significantly after twice-daily use, applied using their fifth digit, for 2 months. Because of the unique temporal association of both individuals using the same compounded cream, it was thought that hydroquinone was the most likely causal agent and was therefore discontinued. The patients were seen again 3 months after stopping the hydroquinone cream, and the nail dyspigmentation on both individuals had resolved. One subject restarted the hydroquinone cream because of the asymptomatic and cosmetic nature of the nail dyspigmentation, and the same nail developed hyperpigmentation within 2 months of daily use.

### A histological examination for skin atrophy after 6 months of treatment with fluocinolone acetonide 0.01%, hydroquinone 4%, and tretinoin 0.05% cream [^1121MZFs]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2009). Low credibility.

Melasma is a common disorder affecting a significant percentage of the population, particularly those with skin of color. Therapy with hydroquinone, a depigmenting agent, as a single agent or in combination with other agents has been used with variable success. A triple-combination (TC) cream combining hydroquinone 4% with tretinoin 0.05% and fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% was developed for the treatment of melasma. We studied the use of TC cream for 24 weeks and had tissue samples for all time points in 62 patients with moderate to severe melasma. The atrophogenic potential of TC cream was evaluated through serial histopathologic examination of skin biopsies. No statistically significant histopathologic signs of atrophy of the epidermis or dermis were noted at any time point throughout the study. There was a marked reduction in epidermal melanin in treated subjects; however, we did not observe any significant difference in baseline and treated samples in the amount of perivascular inflammatory infiltrate, dermal mucin, keratinocyte and melanocyte atypia, or mast cells, consistent with findings of previous studies where topical retinoids were used. An increase in the mean number of blood vessels per square millimeter of tissue was observed in 2 study cohorts between baseline and week 24. These results suggest that the risk of skin atrophy with 24-week use of TC cream for the treatment of melasma is very low.

### Blue-black hyperpigmented patches on the cheeks [^114E2jMs]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 59-year-old, Black female presented with progressive darkening of her cheeks over several months. For several years, she had been self-treating discoloration on her bilateral cheeks with an over-the-counter skin brightening cream with topical 2% hydroquinone as an active ingredient. She then obtained a prescription for hydroquinone 8% cream and saw no lightening of the areas after 2 months of use. A skin examination revealed dark, blue-black, ill-defined patches with overlying scale bilaterally distributed on the upper medial cheeks (Fig 1). Adjacent to the hyperpigmented patches were hypopigmented coalescing macules. A punch biopsy was performed, and representative sections are shown (Figs 2 and 3).

### Comparative efficacy and safety of injectable tranexamic acid combination therapies for melasma: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114ybLjP]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Melasma is a challenging hyperpigmentation disorder affecting predominantly women with darker skin tones. Despite various treatments, achieving consistent and effective results remains difficult. Tranexamic acid (TXA) has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent, particularly via intradermal injections, but its optimal concentration, delivery method, and combination therapies remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of injectable TXA, focusing on its use alone and in combination with other treatments, such as hydroquinone, for melasma. A network meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted, involving 358 participants. Data on melasma subtype, TXA concentration, delivery method, and treatment outcomes (MASI scores) were extracted. Statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model, assessing both direct and indirect comparisons. The combination of TXA and 4% hydroquinone showed the most significant improvement in MASI scores compared to other interventions, demonstrating superior efficacy. Adverse effects were mild and transient, including injection site pain and erythema, underscoring a favorable safety profile. Injectable TXA, especially in combination with hydroquinone, is an effective treatment for melasma. Standardized protocols and long-term studies are needed to optimize its use.

### Natural cosmeceutical ingredients for hyperpigmentation [^113SANhJ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

As Dermatologists caring for patients with hyperpigmentation problems, we are always looking for more alternative therapies. Hydroquinone (HQ) is still the standard of care. However, traditional depigmenting agents such as HQ and corticosteroids, although highly effective, can raise safety concerns including exogenous ochronosis, atrophy, carcinogenesis and local and systemic untoward effects with long term use. Therefore, we need to investigate non-prescription natural alternatives. This manuscript presents many of the natural ingredients found in cosmeceuticals for the treatment of hyperpigmentation and their mechanisms of action. It will also describe the melanocyte activation pathways and how each of these ingredients interferes with it.

### A randomized, investigator-blinded comparison of two topical regimens in fitzpatrick skin types III-VI with moderate to severe facial hyperpigmentation [^116PEEqK]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose: Though hydroquinone (HQ) remains the gold standard for treatment of hyperpigmentation, concerns about its safety have prompted the development of HQ-free topical skin lightening systems.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a new HQ-free system and a popular HQ-based system for the improvement of facial hyperpigmentation and photoaging in darker skin types.

Methods

This investigator-blinded trial randomized 30 subjects of Fitzpatrick skin types III to VI with moderate to severe hyperpigmentation to a new 7-product HQ-free system or a 7-product HQ-based system for 12 weeks. At 4, 8, and 12 week follow-up visits, a blinded investigator assessed efficacy and tolerability using standardized scales. Subjects also performed a self-assessment at each visit.

Summary

Both the HQ-free and HQ-based systems produced significant improvements in Overall Hyperpigmentation that were sustained through week 12 (P = 0.008, 0.0003). The HQ-based system demonstrated better improvement in overall hyperpigmentation at weeks 4, 8, 12 (P = 0.01, 0.001, 0.003, respectively). Mottled Pigmentation Area Severity Index (MoPASI) scores improved with both systems (P = 0.02, 0.01), with no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups. Subject-rated hyperpigmentation was not different between groups. Subjects reported significantly more discomfort with the HQ-free system at week 8 (P = 0.02); otherwise, measures of irritation were the same between groups. All irritation was described as mild to moderate. At week 12, 100% of subjects in the HQ-free group and 92.3% of subjects in the HQ-based group were satisfied with their outcome.

Conclusion

Both a new HQ-free skincare system and a widely-available HQ-based system improved hyperpigmentation in Fitzpatrick skin types III to VI. Though the HQ-based system produced greater improvement in hyperpigmentation when compared to the HQ-free system, there was no difference in MoPASI scores between the treatment groups. Subjects were satisfied with both treatments and reported only mild to moderate irritation using either system. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(11):1127–1132. </em>.

### An update on new and existing treatments for the management of melasma [^115zZGb6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Resveratrol inhibits tyrosinase directly and indirectly, regulates melanocyte function, and carries antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It has been trialled in combination with 4- n -butylresorcinol, a compound related to thiamidol. A prospective, single-arm study of liposome-encapsulated 4- n -butylresorcinol and resveratrol cream produced a significant improvement in melasma in 21 women, with a reduction in melanin index using Mexameter (from 201.08 ± 25.76 at week 0 to 182.83 ± 18.61 at week 4). Two patients reported mild irritation that resolved after 4 weeks.

Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been tested as a novel treatment; platelet release of transforming growth factor-beta from alpha-granules inhibits melanin synthesis. PRP is obtained from centrifugation of the patient's blood, activated with calcium chloride, then administered by intradermal injection. A prospective, single-arm trial of PRP in 23 patients found a significant decrease in MASI from 15.5 ± 8.4 to 9.5 ± 7.2, and an improvement in MELASQOL from 42 ± 14.8 to 16.6 ± 7.2 after three applications over 15-day intervals. A split-face prospective trial found a higher mMASI reduction with 1 mL PRP intradermal injections (53.66 ± 11.27%) versus 4 mg TXA intradermal injections (45.65 ± 8.10%), administered monthly for 3 treatments. The PRP side had less pain (7.5% vs. 62.5%) and erythema (32.5% vs. 55%) than TXA. PRP with 4% hydroquinone has also demonstrated superiority to 4% hydroquinone alone; a reduction of 82% versus 69% in mMASI scores was achieved in 30 patients in a split-face comparative study,

Microneedling has been postulated to lighten recalcitrant melasma lesions via the stimulation of collagen and elastin to diminish the visibility of dermal pigment. A pilot study of 20 patients reported a reduction in mMASI following 4 months of microneedling, and another pilot study of 6 patients reported a reduction in MASI scores following 2 months of microneedling with TCC. A systematic review of eight studies revealed only low-level evidence for use in melasma, with most studies assessing its efficacy alongside other topical therapies that should be considered confounding factors.

### Interventions for melasma [^116Scsuw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Melasma is an acquired symmetrical pigmentary disorder where confluent grey-brown patches typically appear on the face. Available treatments for melasma are unsatisfactory.

Objectives

To assess interventions used in the management of all types of melasma: epidermal, dermal, and mixed.

Search Strategy

In May 2010 we searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Clinical Trials) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and LILACS. Reference lists of articles and ongoing trials registries were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that evaluated topical and systemic interventions for melasma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, data extraction, and analysis was carried out by two authors independently.

Main Results

We included 20 studies with a total of 2125 participants covering 23 different treatments. Statistical pooling of the data was not possible due to the heterogeneity of treatments. Each study involved a different set of interventions. They can be grouped into those including a bleaching agent such as hydroquinone, triple-combination creams (hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide), and combination therapies (hydroquinone cream and glycolic acid peels), as well as less conventional therapies including rucinol, vitamin C iontophoresis, and skin-lightening complexes like Thiospot and Gigawhite. Triple-combination cream was significantly more effective at lightening melasma than hydroquinone alone (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.97) or when compared to the dual combinations of tretinoin and hydroquinone (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.59 to 4.74), tretinoin and fluocinolone acetonide (RR 14.00, 95% CI 4.43 to 44.25), or hydroquinone and fluocinolone acetonide (RR 10.50, 95% CI 3.85 to 28.60). Azelaic acid (20%) was significantly more effective than 2% hydroquinone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.48) at lightening melasma but not when compared to 4% hydroquinone (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.32). In two studies where tretinoin was compared to placebo, participants rated their melasma as significantly improved in one (RR 13, 95% CI 1.88 to 89.74) but not the other. In both studies by other objective measures tretinoin treatment significantly reduced the severity of melasma. Thiospot was more effective than placebo (SMD -2.61, 95% CI -3.76 to -1.47). The adverse events most commonly reported were mild and transient such as skin irritation, itching, burning, and stinging.

Authors' Conclusions

The quality of studies evaluating melasma treatments was generally poor and available treatments inadequate. High-quality randomised controlled trials on well-defined participants with long-term outcomes to determine the duration of response are needed.

### Nail discoloration after use of hydroquinone [^111HAUSJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Fitzpatrick first recognized hydroquinone as a depigmenting agent in the 1960s. Hydroquinone is known to be a strong inhibitor of melanin production, but its mechanism of action is poorly understood. It is proposed that hydroquinone acts as a structural analog of melanin precursors that inhibits the conversion of L-DOPA to melanin by tyrosinase.

Hydroquinone also generates free radicals that further damage melanosomes. The paradoxical hyperpigmentation of fingernails is a rare phenomenon seen with hydroquinone use.

Very few cases reported of hydroquinone leading to hyperpigmentation of nails are reported. In these cases, the hyperpigmentation presented as an asymptomatic darkening of the distal fingernails on a variable number of nails on one or both hands. The pigment has been described as chestnut brown and typically worsened with continued use of hydroquinone. Sun exposure may lead to darkening and expansion of affected areas. Pigment changes typically resolve after cessation of hydroquinone. In our case, hyperpigmentation resolved in 3 months.

### Focal acral hyperkeratosis with response to acitretin [^112ijjzr]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment consisted of: urea 40% cream, consistent moisturization, saltwater soaks, and hydroquinone 4% cream. At a 3-month follow-up, she reported the hydroquinone was helpful for lightening her skin, but the roughness and punctate lesions had worsened. Acitretin 25 mg/d was initiated. At a follow-up 6 months after initiation, there was improvement with softening of the skin which was greatly appreciated by the patient. She continues to follow in our clinic.

### Combination of autologous platelet rich plasma and hydroquinone 4% is more effective than hydroquinone alone in treatment of melasma: a split-face comparative study [^111x7qAU]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Melasma is a common acquired circumscribed hyper-pigmentary disorder involving sun-exposed areas, particularly face. The high frequency of recurrence renders the management more challenging. Autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) has promising potential in the treatment of melasma. This study evaluates the efficacy of combination of autologous PRP and Hydroquinone and compares it with the gold standard molecule 4% Hydroquinone. Thirty patients with melasma were enrolled in this split-face study conducted between 2018 and 2020. All the patients were prescribed Hydroquinone cream 4% to be applied on the affected area at night. Microneedling was performed once a month (total four sessions) on both sides of face, followed by application of autologous platelet rich plasma on right side and normal saline as control on left side of affected area. Modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score, Patient satisfaction score and Physician's Global Assessment score were calculated at baseline and after each session and improvement was assessed. Improvement in mean modified MASI score was significant on both sides of face. Mean percentage improvement in modified MASI score on study side and control side was 82% and 69% respectively. The difference between the two sides was statistically significant in terms of modified MASI, patient satisfaction and physician global assessment scores. Adverse effects were mild and transient. Autologous platelet rich plasma is an effective and safe therapy for treatment of melasma. Combination of autologous PRP and 4% Hydroquinone showed greater improvement than hydroquinone alone.

### Clinical trial of bleaching treatment with 10% all-trans retinol gel [^113UJWh3]. Dermatologic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Although an aggressive use of tretinoin along with hydroquinone enables an efficient treatment of hyperpigmented skin lesions, irritant dermatitis remains to be solved.

Objective

To evaluate the efficiency and adverse effects of 10% all-trans retinol (ROL) gel for improvement of skin hyperpigmentation.

Methods

Ten-percent ROL gel was used instead of 0.1% tretinoin gel in our two-phased bleaching protocol (bleaching and healing phases); 5% hydroquinone and 7% lactic acid ointment were used along with ROL gel in the bleaching phase (2 to 6 weeks). Five-percent hydroquinone and 7% ascorbic acid ointment were used alone during the healing phase (4 to 6 weeks). Twenty-one Japanese patients with hyperpigmented lesions on the face were enrolled in this study, and 18 patients who were followed for more than 10 weeks were analyzed.

Results

Improvement of pigmentation was seen in 16 of 18 patients after an average treatment period of 11.3 weeks, and in 6 patients, pigmentation was almost eliminated after treatment. Erythema and scaling were seen, however, during the bleaching phase as well as the bleaching treatment with tretinoin gel.

Conclusion

ROL can improve skin hyperpigmentation to a similar extent to tretinoin when used at high concentration, whereas it induces irritant dermatitis as well.

### The safety and efficacy of treatment with a 1, 927-nm diode laser with and without topical hydroquinone for facial hyperpigmentation and melasma in darker skin types [^111MB3RJ]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The nonablative, fractional, 1,927-nm diode laser is theoretically a safe and effective treatment for hyperpigmentation and melasma in darker skin and may potentiate topical cosmeceutical delivery.

Objective

To evaluate the use of a nonablative, fractional, 1,927-nm diode laser with and without topical 2% hydroquinone (HQ) cream for moderate-to-severe facial hyperpigmentation in Fitzpatrick skin Types III-V.

Methods

Forty adults underwent 4 laser treatments at 2-week intervals and were randomized to daily application of 2% HQ cream or moisturizer. Follow-ups were conducted 4 and 12 weeks after the final laser treatment.

Results

Hydroquinone and moisturizer groups demonstrated Mottled Pigmentation Area and Severity Index improvements of approximately 50% at post-treatment Weeks 4 and 12. Blinded investigator-assessed hyperpigmentation and photodamage improved significantly for both the groups at post-treatment Weeks 4 and 12. Subject satisfaction improved significantly in both the groups by post-treatment Week 4. Although investigator-rated Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale scores were significantly better in the HQ group at post-treatment Week 12, satisfaction was higher among those using moisturizer. No adverse events were noted.

Conclusion

The nonablative, fractional, 1,927-nm diode laser produced significant improvement in hyperpigmentation in Fitzpatrick skin Types III-V by 4 weeks, with maintenance of results at 12 weeks after treatment even without HQ.
