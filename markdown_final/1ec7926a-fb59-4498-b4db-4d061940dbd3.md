## Question

Which of the following antibiotics are recommended for pelvic inflammatory disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics are recommended for pelvic inflammatory disease and how to choose among them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current guideline-backed first-line regimens and dosing. Then, I should verify the rationale for adding metronidazole and whether it is mandatory or optional. Next, I will review inpatient versus outpatient options and when to hospitalize. After that, I need to check alternatives for severe disease or special situations, including tubo-ovarian abscess and penicillin allergy. Finally, I will consider emerging issues like Mycoplasma genitalium and synthesize a practical, evidence-based recommendation with dosing and duration details.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: PID is polymicrobial, so empiric therapy must cover Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and anaerobes, and treatment should start promptly to reduce the risk of infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain, which means I should anchor on regimens that include a cephalosporin for gonorrhea plus doxycycline for chlamydia, with metronidazole added for anaerobic coverage when indicated [^113wDu1j] [^117BCdzw].

> Wait, let me verify the outpatient first-line regimen and dosing. The 2021 CDC STI Treatment Guidelines recommend ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (use 1 g if body weight is ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, and they explicitly recommend adding metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days to enhance anaerobic coverage and treat bacterial vaginosis when present, which is a change from prior guidance where metronidazole was optional rather than routinely included [^113wDu1j] [^111qrHCg].

> Hold on, I should verify inpatient regimens and the transition to oral therapy. For severe disease or when hospitalization is indicated, CDC recommends ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours plus doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours plus metronidazole 500 mg orally or IV every 12 hours, or alternatively cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours plus doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours, or cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours plus doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours, with transition to oral doxycycline and metronidazole to complete 14 total days once clinically improved, typically within 24–48 hours [^112APtUZ] [^117BCdzw].

> I need to check the rationale for adding metronidazole and whether it truly helps. The 2021 CDC update emphasizes that adding metronidazole more effectively eradicates anaerobes from the upper genital tract and treats BV, which is frequently associated with PID, and a randomized trial showed that adding metronidazole to ceftriaxone and doxycycline reduced endometrial anaerobes, decreased M. genitalium carriage, and reduced pelvic tenderness at 30 days, supporting routine inclusion rather than optional use in acute PID [^111qrHCg] [^112Z5oZM].

> But wait, what if I recall older evidence suggesting no clear benefit from nitroimidazoles. The Cochrane reviews and abridged analyses found no conclusive superiority of regimens with versus without metronidazole for short-term clinical cure, which conflicts with the newer CDC stance; I should reconcile this by noting that the CDC's 2021 update incorporates newer data and prioritizes anaerobic eradication and BV treatment to potentially reduce long-term sequelae, even if short-term cure rates appear similar across regimens in older or heterogeneous trials [^111sp7H5] [^115KTpbf] [^111qrHCg].

> Next, I should review when to hospitalize and when outpatient therapy is acceptable. Hospitalization is recommended for pregnancy, severe illness, inability to tolerate or follow an oral regimen, suspected tubo-ovarian abscess, or failure of outpatient therapy, whereas mild-to-moderate PID in reliable patients can be treated as an outpatient with the IM/oral regimens above, and randomized data show no long-term reproductive outcome differences between inpatient and outpatient management when appropriate regimens are used [^117BCdzw] [^113V6m6w].

> I will now examine alternatives for severe disease or special circumstances. For tubo-ovarian abscess, ampicillin plus gentamicin plus clindamycin is a reasonable parenteral regimen, and cost-effectiveness analyses suggest it may be favorable in some settings; for penicillin allergy, erythromycin-based regimens are listed as alternatives in older labeling, though contemporary practice generally avoids erythromycin for PID due to inferior gonococcal activity and tolerability, so I should caution that such alternatives are suboptimal and should be reserved for compelling allergy scenarios with specialist input [^1142zpLw] [^116NcUfa].

> Let me consider emerging pathogens, especially Mycoplasma genitalium. Standard PID regimens that include doxycycline are often ineffective against M. genitalium, and persistence after cefoxitin/doxycycline is common; if M. genitalium is detected or strongly suspected, moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days is an option, but routine testing for M. genitalium in PID is not currently recommended due to limited outcome data, so I should frame this as a targeted strategy for persistent or recurrent cases after appropriate initial therapy [^114UE1mX] [^113eCa17] [^113JkJGT].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said fluoroquinolone monotherapy could be used broadly for PID; I should double-check that. Although moxifloxacin monotherapy has shown noninferiority to ofloxacin plus metronidazole in some trials, rising fluoroquinolone resistance in N. gonorrhoeae led CDC to remove fluoroquinolones from gonorrhea treatment in the United States, so quinolone monotherapy should not be used as empiric PID therapy in regions with resistance concerns, even though older trials suggested efficacy [^114t4u8q] [^116kTAHb].

> I should confirm duration and practical pearls. Total antibiotic duration is 14 days for most regimens, with IV-to-oral step-down once the patient is clinically improved; doxycycline and metronidazole have similar oral and IV bioavailability, so oral therapy is preferred when feasible to avoid IV-associated pain and logistics, and adherence to twice-daily regimens is challenging, which reinforces the value of simplified regimens and close follow-up within 72 hours to ensure improvement [^112APtUZ] [^116KyZDS].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. For most women with mild-to-moderate PID, the recommended regimen is ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days plus metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, with metronidazole now considered part of routine therapy rather than optional; for severe disease or when hospitalization is indicated, use ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours plus doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours plus metronidazole 500 mg orally or IV every 12 hours, transitioning to oral therapy to complete 14 total days once improved, and consider M. genitalium–directed therapy with moxifloxacin if symptoms persist and testing is available [^113wDu1j] [^111qrHCg] [^114UE1mX].

---

The recommended antibiotics for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are **ceftriaxone plus doxycycline with metronidazole** [^113wDu1j] to cover gonorrhea, chlamydia, and anaerobes [^117BCdzw]. For outpatient care, give **ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once** [^113wDu1j] (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily and metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days [^113wDu1j]. For inpatient care, use **ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours** plus doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours and metronidazole 500 mg IV or orally every 12 hours [^112APtUZ]; transition to oral therapy to complete 14 days once improved [^112APtUZ]. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended because of resistance [^116kTAHb]; if used, add metronidazole and ensure local susceptibility. Treat all sexual partners within the last 60 days [^notfound] and ensure close follow-up [^1136CYG7].

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

### Outpatient regimens (mild to moderate PID)

Outpatient therapy is appropriate for **mild to moderate PID** [^113V6m6w] without severe illness, pregnancy, or suspected tubo-ovarian abscess [^117BCdzw]. The following regimens are recommended:

| **Regimen** | **Dosage and duration** |
|-|-|
| Ceftriaxone | 500 mg IM once (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) [^113wDu1j] |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days [^113wDu1j] |
| Metronidazole | 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days [^113wDu1j] |

---

Alternatively, **cefoxitin 2 g IM once** with probenecid 1 g orally administered concurrently, plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily and metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 14 days [^113wDu1j].

---

### Inpatient regimens (severe PID or specific indications)

Hospitalization is indicated for severe illness, pregnancy, suspected tubo-ovarian abscess, or failure of outpatient therapy [^117BCdzw]. The following **parenteral regimens** are recommended:

| **Regimen** | **Dosage and duration** |
|-|-|
| Ceftriaxone | 1 g IV every 24 hours [^112APtUZ] |
| Doxycycline | 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours [^112APtUZ] |
| Metronidazole | 500 mg IV or orally every 12 hours [^112APtUZ] |

---

Alternatively, **cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours** or cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours, plus doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours [^112APtUZ]. Transition to oral therapy to complete 14 days once the patient improves clinically [^112APtUZ].

---

## Alternative regimens and special considerations

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Previously used, but not recommended due to increasing resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae [^116kTAHb]. If used, add metronidazole and ensure local susceptibility [^notfound].
- **Mycoplasma genitalium**: Consider if symptoms persist after standard therapy. Moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days is effective [^114UE1mX].
- **Penicillin allergy**: Erythromycin or azithromycin may be considered, but efficacy is limited compared to standard regimens [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommended regimens

- **Ceftriaxone plus doxycycline**: Effective against common pathogens (N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis) [^113wDu1j] and associated with high clinical cure rates [^115cKKd8].
- **Addition of metronidazole**: Provides anaerobic coverage, reduces recurrence, and improves clinical outcomes [^112Z5oZM] [^117BCdzw].
- **Outpatient vs inpatient therapy**: Outpatient therapy is as effective as inpatient therapy for mild to moderate PID, with no significant differences in long-term reproductive outcomes [^113V6m6w].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

- **Disease severity**: Mild to moderate cases can be managed outpatient, while severe cases require inpatient parenteral therapy [^117BCdzw].
- **Patient factors**: Pregnancy, severe illness, inability to tolerate oral therapy, or suspected tubo-ovarian abscess necessitate inpatient care [^117BCdzw].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Particularly for N. gonorrhoeae, influence regimen selection and may limit fluoroquinolone use [^116kTAHb].

---

## Importance of partner treatment and follow-up

Partner treatment is essential — treat all sexual partners within the last 60 days to prevent reinfection and transmission [^notfound] — and **follow-up** should occur within 72 hours to ensure clinical improvement and adherence [^112c1uL7].

---

## Potential complications of inadequate treatment

Inadequate or delayed treatment can lead to **significant morbidity**, including:

- **Infertility**: Due to tubal scarring and adhesions [^115CT6N9].
- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Increased risk due to tubal damage [^115CT6N9].
- **Chronic pelvic pain**: Persistent inflammation and adhesions [^1179G1r5].
- **Tubo-ovarian abscess**: May require surgical intervention [^111y7wPP].

---

The recommended antibiotics for PID are **ceftriaxone plus doxycycline with metronidazole** [^113wDu1j], with regimen selection based on severity, patient factors, and local resistance patterns. Adequate treatment, partner management, and follow-up are essential to prevent complications and recurrence [^117BCdzw].

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a substantial cause of reproductive morbidity in young women. A systematic review of the literature related to PID management was performed in preparation for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines. This search was conducted using PubMed and was limited to articles written in English and published between 1 January 2002 and 31 January 2005 that were related to PID treatment. Studies were evaluated for new data on PID with regard to site, route, and timing of antimicrobial administration; regimen adherence; experience in adolescents and women > 35 years of age; coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus; and management of sex partners. Strong evidence suggests that neither site nor route of treatment administration affects the short- or long-term major outcome of women with mild or moderate clinical presentations. Data on these outcomes in women with more severe clinical presentations are inadequate to provide guidance as to the preferred agents or route of administration. Important contributions to the literature that impact the 2006 guidelines are described in this article.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that affects 4% to 12% of young women, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity in this age group. The main intervention for acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and anaerobic bacteria, administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally. In this review, we assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2016, located through electronic searching and handsearching; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid platform (1991 to July 2016); MEDLINE (1946 to July 2016); Embase (1947 to July 2016); LILACS, iAHx interface (1982 to July 2016); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2016); Web of Science (2001 to July 2016); OpenGrey (1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 1997); and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author if necessary. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria, classifying it as high, moderate, low, or very low. We calculated Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR), using either random-effects or fixed-effect models and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome or for an additional harmful outcome, with their 95% confidence interval (CI), to measure the effect of the treatments. We conducted sensitivity analyses limited to studies at low risk of bias, for comparisons where such studies were available.

Main Results

We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. Azithromycin versus doxycyclineThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55, I² = 72%, 2 RCTs, 243 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05, 1 RCT, 309 women, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34, 3 RCTs, 552 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67, 133 women, moderate-quality evidence). Quinolone versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10, 3 RCTs, 459 women, I² = 5%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23, 2 RCTs, 313 women, I² = 7%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72, 5 RCTs, 772 women, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazoleThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference between the nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) group and the group receiving other drugs with activity over anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10, 5 RCTs, 2427 women, I² = 60%, moderate-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01, 11 RCTs, 1383 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.59; participants = 3788; studies = 16; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, findings did not differ substantially from the main analysis (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15, 2 RCTs, 1201 women, I² = 32%, high-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinoloneThere was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13, 1 RCT, 25 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19, 2 studies, 151 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72, 3 RCTs, 163 women, very low-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09, 2 RCTs, 150 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06, 10 RCTs, 959 women, I² = 21%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42, 10 RCTs, 1172 women, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared to use of other drugs with activity over anaerobes. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggested that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. Our review considered only the drugs that are currently used and mentioned by the CDC.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) affects 4% to 12% of women of reproductive age. The main intervention for acute PID is broad-spectrum antibiotics administered intravenously, intramuscularly or orally. We assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens to treat PID.

Search Methods

In January 2020, we searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2020, located through hand and electronic searching; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; four other databases; and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to a comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and conducted GRADE assessments of the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 39 RCTs (6894 women) in this review, adding two new RCTs at this update. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. None of the studies reported quinolones and cephalosporins, or the outcomes laparoscopic evidence of resolution of PID based on physician opinion or fertility outcomes. Length of stay results were insufficiently reported for analysis. Regimens containing azithromycin versus regimens containing doxycycline We are uncertain whether there was a clinically relevant difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55; 2 RCTs, 243 women; I² = 72%; very low-quality evidence). The analyses may result in little or no difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; 1 RCT, 309 women; low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34; 3 RCTs, 552 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin probably improves the rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67; 133 women; moderate-quality evidence), compared to doxycycline. Regimens containing quinolone versus regimens containing cephalosporin The analysis shows there may be little or no clinically relevant difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14; 4 RCTs, 772 women; I² = 15%; low-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 313 women; I² = 7%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there was a difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72; 6 RCTs, 1085 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens with nitroimidazole versus regimens without nitroimidazole There was probably little or no difference between regimens with or without nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 6 RCTs, 2660 women; I² = 50%; moderate-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 11 RCTs, 1383 women; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.61; 17 studies, 4021 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, there was little or no difference for rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; 3 RCTs, 1434 women; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone We are uncertain whether quinolone have little to no effect in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to clindamycin plus aminoglycoside (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; 1 RCT, 25 women; very low-quality evidence). The analysis may result in little or no difference between quinolone vs. clindamycin plus aminoglycoside in severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19; 2 studies, 151 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether quinolone reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72; 3 RCTs, 163 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus regimens containing cephalosporin We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside improves the rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 2 RCTs, 150 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). There was probably little or no difference in rates of cure in severe PID with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 10 RCTs, 959 women; I² = 21%; moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment compared to cephalosporin (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42; 10 RCTs, 1172 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether one treatment was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of mild-moderate or severe PID Based on a single study at a low risk of bias, a macrolide (azithromycin) probably improves the rates of cure of mild-moderate PID, compared to tetracycline (doxycycline).

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^112vpstP]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2013). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease is caused by infection of the upper female genital tract and is often asymptomatic. Pelvic inflammatory disease is the most common gynaecological reason for admission to hospital in the US, and is diagnosed in approximately 1% of women aged 16 to 45 years consulting their GP in England and Wales.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: How do different antimicrobial regimens compare when treating women with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease? What are the effects of routine antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease before intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) insertion? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up to date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, parenteral, different durations, different regimens) and routine antibiotic prophylaxis (before intrauterine device insertion in women at high risk or low risk).

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease is caused by infection of the upper female genital tract and is often asymptomatic. Pelvic inflammatory disease is the most common gynaecological reason for admission to hospital in the United States and is diagnosed in almost 2% of women aged 16–45 years consulting their GP in England and Wales.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical treatment compared with treatment delayed until the results of microbiological investigations are known? How do different antimicrobial regimens compare? What are the effects of routine antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease before intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD)8 insertion? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 9 systematic reviews, RCTs or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, parenteral, empirical treatment, treatment guided by test results, different durations, outpatient, inpatient), and routine antibiotic prophylaxis (before intrauterine device insertion in women at high risk or low risk).

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women is described as an inflammation of the upper genital tract and surrounding structures as a result of ascending infection from the lower genital tract — bacteria spread directly from the cervix to the endometrium and on to the upper genital tract. The signs and symptoms of PID are not specific and may range from asymptomatic to abdominal pain/tenderness, fever, vomiting, dyspareunia and menorrhagia.

The incidence of PID in the UK has been estimated to range between 1.1% and 1.7% among women between 16 and 46 years old. Among women with PID, 10%–20% may become infertile, 40% will develop chronic pelvic pain, and 10% of those who conceive will have an ectopic pregnancy. The cost of pelvic infection has been estimated to exceed US$2.4 billion in the United States, and the mean total cost per episode managed as an outpatient is around US$700. In the UK, the mean cost of an uncomplicated episode of PID is £163, considering an average of two outpatient appointments per woman across all settings.

PID requires effective treatment to reduce the incidence of chronic pelvic pain, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The main intervention for treating acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobic bacteria, but the optimal treatment strategy is unclear. A variety of antibiotic regimens and routes of administration (intravenous, intramuscular or oral) have been used, with marked geographical variation. Current practice generally involves the use of multiple agents to provide broad antimicrobial cover, but the best combination of agents is unknown. Guidelines have been produced in the United States, and in Europe, to guide therapy, but these have not been based on a systematic review. The authors of the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) guidelines state that there is limited evidence for the need to eradicate anaerobes or for the use of alternative regimens, such as azithromycin.

The current review is an abridged version of a Cochrane systematic review and presents the main findings from the primary outcomes and an enhanced discussion section. This review addresses clinical questions raised in the current guidelines on the treatment of PIDregarding the effectiveness and safety of nitroimidazole, the relative benefits of azithromycin versus doxycycline, the use of quinolones, and the relative benefits of cephalosporins compared with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside, to inform future guideline development and clinical practice.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112oEfCo]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We used Cochrane methodology, following our published protocol.

Methods for identification of studies

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily Update, Embase, LILACS and Web of Science up to July 2016. The complete search strategy is available in the Cochrane review. We screened the reference lists of all identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and previous systematic reviews on similar topics for additional relevant articles. Furthermore, we searched trial registers, conference proceeding abstracts and grey literature. We contacted the authors of all RCTs identified by other methods, as well as pharmaceutical companies producing 'antibiotic therapy' for 'pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)'.

Types of studies

We included RCTs, including those which did not describe their method of randomisation (ie, where the authors stated that treatment was randomised without providing further details). Trials were included irrespective of publication status, publication year or language. We excluded quasi-randomised trials because they produce effects estimates indicating more extreme benefits when compared with RCTs. We also excluded cross-over and cluster trials.

Selection of studies

Two review authors (DGF and RVD) performed an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search, and we retrieved the full text of all potentially eligible studies. Two review authors (DGF and RVD) independently examined these studies for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies that met these criteria. Disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author (JR).

Inclusion criteria

RCTs were included in the review if the women participating in the trial were of reproductive age (14 years of age or older) diagnosed as having acute PID (symptoms for less than 6 weeks) based on clinical findings, laparoscopy, endometrial biopsy, or detectable N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis in the upper genital tract. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 CDC guidelines for treatment of PID.

### Concerns regarding the centers for disease control's published guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease [^111U5c65]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The International-Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology-USA (I-IDSOG-USA) has concerns about the most recently published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). I-IDSOG-USA advocates the following changes when the guidelines are revised. We recommend the use of the term "upper genital tract infection" (UGTI), followed by the designation of the etiologic agent, instead of the currently employed term, "pelvic inflammatory disease", or PID. In diagnoses, there should be greater emphasis on signs and symptoms related to subclinical or occult UGTI. Therapeutic recommendation for the treatment of UGTI should be documented for various stages of this diverse disease entity. There should be greater emphasis on hospitalization for infected nulligravida teenagers. This permits monitoring of antibiotic treatment and provides a site for medical educational efforts to teach this medically underserved segment of our society how to protect their future fertility, their health, and their lives.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^112c1uL7]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract occurring predominantly in sexually active young women. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes; however, other cervical, enteric, bacterial vaginosis-associated, and respiratory pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may be involved. PID can be acute, chronic, or subclinical and is often underdiagnosed. Untreated PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and intra-abdominal infections. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion, and empiric treatment is recommended in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections who have unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on examination. Mild to moderate disease can be treated in an outpatient setting with a single intramuscular injection of a recommended cephalosporin followed by oral doxycycline for 14 days. Additionally, metronidazole is recommended for 14 days in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or recent uterine instrumentation. Hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics is recommended in patients who are pregnant or severely ill, in whom outpatient treatment has failed, those with tubo-ovarian abscess, or if surgical emergencies cannot be excluded. Treatment does not change in patients with intrauterine devices or those with HIV. Sex partner treatment is recommended; expedited partner treatment is recommended where legal. Prevention of PID includes screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women younger than 25 years and those who are at risk or pregnant, plus intensive behavioral counseling for all adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: current concepts in pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^112gPvQq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is characterized by infection and inflammation of the upper genital tract in women and can cause significant reproductive health sequelae for women. Although a definitive diagnosis of PID is made by laparoscopic visualization of inflamed, purulent fallopian tubes, PID is generally a clinical diagnosis and thus represents a diagnostic challenge. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment algorithms advise a high index of suspicion for PID in any woman of reproductive age with pelvic or abdominal pain. Antibiotic therapy should be started early, and given for an adequate period of time to reduce the risk of complications. Coverage for anaerobic organisms should be considered in most cases.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: how should it be managed? [^116DUgQF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the published literature on pelvic inflammatory disease over the past year and put into context the major findings.

Recent Findings

remains the commonest identified cause of pelvic inflammatory disease, and yet our understanding of how it causes mucosal damage and the factors explaining why only a subgroup of women develop pelvic inflammatory disease are not known. The increasing evidence for a chlamydial toxin may help to explain how tissue damage occurs and the indolent nature of many chlamydial infections. The evidence for as an important sexually transmitted cause of pelvic inflammatory disease is growing, with implications for treatment regimens and diagnostic testing. Power Doppler ultrasound has been reported to be both sensitive and specific in diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease, although larger studies are needed to confirm these early results. Outpatient treatment with cefoxitin and doxycycline appears to be as effective when given in an outpatient setting compared with inpatient management with the same agents in a large randomized controlled trial with almost 3 years' follow-up.

Summary

There remain many gaps in our knowledge of pelvic inflammatory disease, but the reviewed studies increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of infection, and offer the possibility of better diagnosis and reassurance about the long-term success of antibiotic treatment.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111KPGem]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We found no evidence that one regimen is more effective or safer than any other for the treatment of PID, and there is no clear evidence that the addition of nitroimidazoles is beneficial. Adherence to clinical treatment for PID is an important issue that should be considered when choosing a treatment regimen. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggests that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. There remains a need for high-quality RCTs to assess treatments for women with PID, particularly comparing regimens with or without the addition of nitroimidazoles and comparing azithromycin (eg, 1 g once a week for 2 weeks) with doxycycline. The lack of a consistent outcome measure to assess response to therapy is a major limitation, and there is a clear need for core outcome measures to be developed.

Key messages

There is no clear evidence that any one of the currently recommended treatment regimens for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is superior to another.
There is no evidence of improved efficacy when metronidazole is included within a treatment regimen, although this is currently recommended in some guidelines.
There is a need for better understanding of the role of azithromycin in the treatment of PID, given uncertainty about its efficacy compared with doxycycline and concerns about inducing antimicrobial resistance.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114aVb5N]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were clinical cure according to the criteria defined by the treating physician (eg, resolution or improvement of signs and symptoms related to PID) and antibiotic-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy. For secondary outcomes, please see the full Cochrane systematic review.

Where studies included women with various types of pelvic infection, we considered only women with endometritis, salpingitis, parametritis or oophoritis (not related to labour, delivery, cancer or surgery). Where studies reported multiple time points, we included outcomes at between 14 and 28 days after initiation of treatment.

Data extraction

Data from each study were extracted independently by two of the three review authors (SF, DGF, RVD) using a data extraction form that the review authors designed and pilot-tested. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author (JR or RFS). If a study had more than two intervention arms, we included or combined only those that met the predefined inclusion criteria. Where studies had multiple publications, we used the main trial report as the reference and derived additional details from secondary papers. We corresponded with study investigators for further data as required.

Quality of evidence

For each included trial, three review authors (SF, DGF, RVD) independently assessed the risk of bias using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane guidelines. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving a third review author (JR or RFS).

Two reviewers (SF, RFS) independently assessed and graded the evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving a third review author (JR). The GRADE tables are available in the full Cochrane review.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113XwHzX]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Design

This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane guidelines. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation.

Data Sources

Eight electronic databases were searched from date of inception up to July 2016. Database searches were complemented by screening of reference lists of relevant studies, trial registers, conference proceeding abstracts and grey literature.

Eligibility Criteria

RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment.

Results

We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency and serious imprecision. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the rates of cure for mild-moderate or for severe PID for the comparisons of azithromycin versus doxycycline, quinolone versus cephalosporin, nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazole, clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone, or clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporin. No clear evidence of a difference between regimens in antibiotic-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy was observed.

Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the treatment of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared with the use of other drugs with activity against anaerobes. More evidence is needed to assess treatments for women with PID, particularly comparing regimens with or without the addition of nitroimidazoles and the efficacy of azithromycin compared with doxycycline.

### Current concepts in managing pelvic inflammatory disease [^111pY21f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The management of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has significantly changed during the last two decades. Moreover, some recent bacterial findings have led to recent changes in this management.

Recent Findings

Most cases of PID are mild-to-moderate uncomplicated forms that can be treated as outpatients. Apart from Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, other pathogens such as Mycoplasma genitalium and bacterial vaginosis (BV)-associated bacteria are playing a significant role in PID and thus must be reckoned with. Moreover, gonococci have increasingly become resistant to the majority of antibiotics. This has led to a universal recommendation to treat N. gonorrhoeae infections with ceftriaxone. A few recent clinical trials have shown that quinolones and azithromycin (with metronidazole) are the best therapeutic options to treat uncomplicated PID.

Summary

The management of PID nowadays must take into account the role of pathogens such as M. genitalium, BV-associated bacteria and multiresistant gonococci.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^1165wCU2]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease is a polymicrobial infection of the upper genital tract. It primarily affects young, sexually active women. The diagnosis is made clinically; no single test or study is sensitive or specific enough for a definitive diagnosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be suspected in at-risk patients who present with pelvic or lower abdominal pain with no identified etiology, and who have cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the most commonly implicated microorganisms; however, other microorganisms may be involved. The spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic to life-threatening tubo-ovarian abscess. Patients should be treated empirically, even if they present with few symptoms. Most women can be treated successfully as outpatients with a single dose of a parenteral cephalosporin plus oral doxycycline, with or without oral metronidazole. Delay in treatment may lead to major sequelae, including chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Hospitalization and parenteral treatment are recommended if the patient is pregnant, has human immunodeficiency virus infection, does not respond to oral medication, or is severely ill. Strategies for preventing pelvic inflammatory disease include routine screening for chlamydia and patient education.

Discussion

Thirty-seven trials with 6348 women were included in the review. We found no clear evidence of a difference between any of the regimens studied in terms of effectiveness or safety. Within a sensitivity analysis of cases of mild-moderate PID for the comparison of macrolide (azithromycin) versus tetracycline (doxycycline), we identified a single study at low risk of bias which provided moderate-quality evidence that azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving clinical cure. Some guidelines have recommended the use of nitroimidazoles for PID, but we found no conclusive evidence of a difference in outcomes between the use or not of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) in successfully treating PID. There was also no clear evidence of a difference in rates of adverse effects between the regimens.

The applicability of the evidence to the target population (women of reproductive age diagnosed with PID) was broad because the included trials were conducted in different clinical settings and implemented varying diagnostic approaches. Additionally, the interventions analysed in the review are currently available and represent the most frequently used treatment regimens in current clinical practice. Given these factors, we consider that the evidence identified applies to a wide range of women with PID varying in disease severity, age, geographical location and diagnostic criteria, which provides external validity.

The trials included in this review cover a period of approximately 30 years and several countries, with 7 out of 37 studies being conducted after the year 2000. The searches for this review were last updated in July 2016 and new evidence may now be available. Considering the availability of additional studies, an update of this review is expected to take place in 2020. Little data are available on temporal variation in bacterial causes of PID because few countries systematically collect this information. Wide variations in the bacterial aetiology of PID may occur in different geographical areas and these may affect the choice of treatment, but few trials were carried out in low-income/middle-income countries. Although we consider that the results of this review are generalisable to a wide range of geographical locations, our conclusions may not be generalisable to low-income/middle-income countries.

### Updated French guidelines for diagnosis and management of pelvic inflammatory disease [^113dpQmR]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is commonly encountered in clinical practice.

Objectives

To provide up-to-date guidelines on management of PID.

Search Strategy

An initial search of the Cochrane database, PubMed, and Embase was performed using keywords related to PID to identify reports in any language published between January 1990 and January 2012, with an update in May 2015.

Selection Criteria

All identified reports relevant to the areas of focus were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

A level of evidence based on the quality of the data available was applied for each area of focus and used for the guidelines.

Main Results

PID must be suspected when spontaneous pelvic pain is associated with induced adnexal or uterine pain (grade C). Pelvic ultrasonography is necessary to exclude tubo-ovarian abscess (grade B). Microbiological diagnosis requires vaginal and endocervical sampling for molecular and bacteriological analysis (grade B). First-line treatment for uncomplicated PID combines ofloxacin and metronidazole for 14days (grade B). Treatment of tubo-ovarian abscess is based on drainage if the collection measures more than 3cm (grade B), with combined ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline for 14–21days.

Conclusions

Current management of PID requires easily reproducible investigations and treatment, and thus can be applied worldwide.

The characteristics of the included RCTs are presented in online supplementary material 1. The 37 trials included 6348 women, with a sample size ranging from 25to 1156. Retrieved studies came from a wide range of inpatient and outpatient settings from different continents (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa). The trials recruited women aged 14 years and over with a diagnosis of PID according to the CDC criteria (pelvic or lower abdominal pain and one or more of the following clinical criteria: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness or adnexal tenderness). Studies varied in the degree of disease severity of participants.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112A9vgk]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

Data analyses were performed using Review Manager V.5.3. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was used for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that trials were estimating the same underlying treatment effect (ie, where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials' populations and methods were sufficiently similar). We conducted separate analyses for mild-moderate and severe PID based on the CDC criteria. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected (I 2 = 40% or greater), a random-effects meta-analysis was planned to produce an overall summary if a mean treatment effect across trials was considered to be clinically meaningful. For random-effects analyses, the results are presented as the mean treatment effect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of the tau 2 and I 2 statistics.

For dichotomous data, the number of events in the control and intervention groups was used to calculate the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR). For the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful (NNTH) outcome, the recommendations given by Altman were followed. When we observed a treatment effect, we reported the NNTH or NNTB with 95% CIs. NNTB and NNTH are presented in the GRADE tables in the full Cochrane review. When possible, we performed analysis based on intention to treat (ITT). When information for an ITT analysis was not available, we used the results provided by the authors.

We undertook the following sensitivity analysis to investigate whether our conclusions were robust to methodological decisions made by the review authors:

Risk of bias (restricting analysis to blinded studies at low risk of selection bias).

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^115rqaVe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and adjacent pelvic structures and may spread to the abdomen causing peritonitis, caused by bacterial infection spreading from the vagina and cervix. Occasionally, right-upper quadrant pain suggestive of inflammation and adhesion formation in the liver capsule (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome) can accompany pelvic inflammatory disease.

The sexually transmitted Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are present in many cases; however, microorganisms including the endogenous vaginal and cervical flora may also cause PID. Genital tract mycoplasmas, most importantly Mycoplasma genitalium, have recently also been implicated as a cause of acute PID. The global epidemiologic profile of pelvic inflammatory disease has not been well defined. Due to financial and logistic reasons, pelvic inflammatory disease prevention programs that are based on screening are simply unavailable in most countries, where the burden of pelvic inflammatory disease may be the greatest.

Patients with tubo-ovarian abscess that does not respond to antibiotics should undergo surgical drainage (Recommendation 1C).

Tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA) may be a complication of PID. In women of reproductive age, TOA is one of the most common types of pelvic abscess. TOA are classically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, if antibiotic therapy is not sufficient, surgical drainage should be performed.

### Identification and treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and associated sequelae [^1179G1r5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an ascending polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract. The presentation of PID varies from asymptomatic cases to severe sepsis. The diagnosis of PID is often one of exclusion. Primary treatment for PID includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage against gonorrhea, chlamydia, and common anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. If not clinically improved by antibiotics, percutaneous drain placement can promote efficient source control, as is often the case with large tubo-ovarian abscesses. Ultimately, even with treatment, PID can result in long-term morbidity, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115KTpbf]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Anaerobic bacteria are commonly identified in the fallopian tubes of women with PID, and most treatment guidelines include metronidazole to provide adequate microbiological cover. On meta-analysis we found that the addition of a nitroimidazole (metronidazole) did not improve short-term clinical outcomes of either mild-to-moderate or severe PID, which suggests that the other components of treatment regimens may be adequate. This is potentially important since nitroimidazoles commonly cause gastrointestinal side effects and may limit adherence to therapy. Nevertheless, some studies used antimicrobials with anaerobic cover, such as amoxicillin+clavulanate. The only study, in this systematic review, that did not use any antibiotic with anaerobic coverage found that women who did not receive nitroimidazole were more likely to experience clinical cure than those who received nitroimidazole. Of note, the study conducted by Burchell et al had a small sample size and lacked information to assess risk of bias. We were not able to assess long-term outcomes such as infertility or chronic pelvic pain, and it remains uncertain whether the use of nitroimidazoles affects the risk of these sequelae.

One previous meta-analysis, published in 1993, formed the basis for the CDC guidelines. The authors reported pooled clinical cure rates ranging from 75% to 94%, which is similar to our updated review with overall rate of cure of 81%. The uncertainty in using nitroimidazoles when treating PID is reflected in the current guidelines. The 2015 US CDC PID guidelineadvises that metronidazole be considered to provide additional anaerobic cover but does not mandate its use. The 2017 European IUSTI PID guidelineand the 2018 BASHH PID guidelinerecommend the use of metronidazole but advise that it can be discontinued in those with mild to moderate symptoms if they develop drug-related side effects. Our analysis does not support the routine use of metronidazole in the treatment of women with mild to moderate PID and can be used to inform future guideline revisions.

### The challenge of pelvic inflammatory disease [^1179pU9a]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract in women that can include endometritis, parametritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and peritonitis. The spectrum of disease ranges from subclinical, asymptomatic infection to severe, life-threatening illness; sequelae include chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. PID is diagnosed clinically, with laboratory and imaging studies reserved for patients who have an uncertain diagnosis, are severely ill, or do not respond to initial therapy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria include uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness with no other obvious cause in women at risk of PID. Empiric treatment should be initiated promptly and must cover Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; the possibility of fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae also should be considered. Hospitalization for initial parenteral therapy is necessary for patients with tubo-ovarian abscess and for those who are pregnant, severely ill, unable to follow a prescribed treatment plan, or unable to tolerate oral antibiotics. Patients also should be hospitalized if a surgical emergency cannot be excluded or if no clinical improvement occurs after three days. Routine screening for asymptomatic chlamydial infection can help prevent PID and its sequelae.

Differences between the Cochrane review and the current review

The current review is an abridged version of a Cochrane systematic review and presents the main findings and an enhanced discussion section. The secondary outcomes presented in the Cochrane review were microbiological clearance of C. trachomatis, microbiological clearance of N. gonorrhoeae, laparoscopic evidence of resolution of PID based on physician opinion, length of stay (for inpatient care) and rate of fertility. The results were similar for studies that reported microbiological clearance of C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae, with clearance occurring in over 90% of women irrespective of regimen used. Length of stay varied across the studies, ranging from 3 days to 18 days. No data were found for laparoscopic evidence of resolution of PID and for rate of fertility.

### A randomized controlled trial of ceftriaxone and doxycycline, with or without metronidazole, for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease [^112Z5oZM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anaerobic organisms are important pathogens in acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The currently recommended PID regimen of a single dose of ceftriaxone and doxycycline for 14 days has limited anaerobic activity. The need for broader anaerobic coverage is unknown and concerns have been raised about metronidazole tolerability.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscular single dose and doxycycline for 14 days, with or without 14 days of metronidazole in women with acute PID. The primary outcome was clinical improvement at 3 days following enrollment. Additional outcomes at 30 days following treatment were the presence of anaerobic organisms in the endometrium, clinical cure (absence of fever and reduction in tenderness), adherence, and tolerability.

Results

We enrolled 233 women (116 to metronidazole and 117 to placebo). Clinical improvement at 3 days was similar between the 2 groups. At 30 days following treatment, anaerobic organisms were less frequently recovered from the endometrium in women treated with metronidazole than placebo (8% vs 21%, P < .05) and cervical Mycoplasma genitalium was reduced (4% vs 14%, P < .05). Pelvic tenderness was also less common among women receiving metronidazole (9% vs 20%, P < .05). Adverse events and adherence were similar in each treatment group.

Conclusions

In women treated for acute PID, the addition of metronidazole to ceftriaxone and doxycycline was well tolerated and resulted in reduced endometrial anaerobes, decreased M. genitalium, and reduced pelvic tenderness compared to ceftriaxone and doxycycline. Metronidazole should be routinely added to ceftriaxone and doxycycline for the treatment of women with acute PID.

### Newest approaches to treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease: a review of recent randomized clinical trials [^111MZJs8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) should provide high rates of clinical and microbiological cure for a range of pathogens and should ultimately prevent reproductive morbidity. Between 1992 and 2006, 5 randomized clinical trials of moxifloxacin (1 trial), ofloxacin (1 trial), clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (1 trial), and azithromycin (2 trials) treatment among women with mild to moderate PID were found to have clinical cure rates of 90%-97%. Trials of ofloxacin and clindamycin-ciprofloxacin reported rates of cure of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection of 100%, although microbiological cure data for other pathogens were not presented. One azithromycin trial reported a 98% eradication of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes. Moxifloxacin exhibited high eradication rates for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. hominis, Mycobacterium genitalium, and gram-negative anaerobes. Clinical cure rates from 2 doxycycline-metronidazole trials were low (35% and 55%). Although a handful of studies have shown that monotherapies for PID achieve high rates of clinical cure, the efficacy of these regimens in treating anaerobic PID and in preventing adverse reproductive sequelae is not fully elucidated.

There was no clear evidence of a difference between azithromycin and doxycycline regimens (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55; 243 women, 2 studies; I² = 72%; very low-quality evidence). Sensitivity analysis limited to the study at low risk of bias indicated that azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67; 133 women, 1 study; moderate-quality evidence).

Three studies compared quinolones versus cephalosporins. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10; 459 women, 3 studies; I² = 5%; low-quality evidence).

Clinical cure in mild-moderate PID was evaluated in five studies comparing nitroimidazoles versus no nitroimidazoles. In all the studies the nitroimidazole used was metronidazole. There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in effectiveness between metronidazole versus no use of metronidazole in mild-moderate PID (moderate-quality evidence; figure 2). Sensitivity analysis restricted to the two studies at low risk of bias did not substantially change the main findings (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15; 1201 women, 2 studies; I² = 32%; high-quality evidence).

Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone in mild-moderate PID was evaluated in one study, which showed no difference in effectiveness between the regimens (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; 25 women, 1 study; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence).

Two studies compared clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporin in mild-moderate PID. There was no clear evidence of a difference between these regimens in the rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 150 women, 2 studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence).

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^116Cuuxg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection-caused inflammatory continuum from the cervix to the peritoneal cavity. Most importantly, it is associated with fallopian tube inflammation, which can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The microbial etiology is linked to sexually transmitted microorganisms, including Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrheae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and bacterial vaginosis-associated microorganisms, predominantly anaerobes. Pelvic pain and fever are commonly absent in women with confirmed PID. Clinicians should consider milder symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, postcoital bleeding, and urinary frequency as potential symptoms associated with the disease, particularly in women at risk of sexually transmitted infection. The diagnosis of PID is based on the findings of lower genital tract inflammation associated with pelvic organ tenderness. The outpatient treatment of mild-to-moderate PID should include tolerated antibiotic regimens with activity against the commonly isolated microorganisms associated with PID and usually consists of an extended spectrum cephalosporin in conjunction with either doxycycline or azithromycin. Clinically severe PID should prompt hospitalization and imaging to rule out a tuboovarian abscess. Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with activity against a polymicrobial flora, particularly gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, should be implemented. Screening for and treatment of Chlamydia infection can prevent PID.

Clinical cure in severe PID

One trial compared azithromycin versus doxycycline in severe PID. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the rates of cure between regimens using azithromycin or doxycycline to treat severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; 309 women, 1 study; low-quality evidence).

Two studies compared quinolones versus cephalosporins, with no clear evidence of a difference in the rates of cure between regimens (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23; 313 women, 2 studies; I² = 7%; low-quality evidence).

Eleven studies evaluated nitroimidazole in severe PID, and all studies used metronidazole. The difference in clinical cure rates between women treated with metronidazole and women not treated with it was small and was compatible with no effect (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 1383 women, 11 trials; I² = 3%; moderate-quality evidence; figure 3).

### Failure of cefoxitin and doxycycline to eradicate endometrial Mycoplasma genitalium and the consequence for clinical cure of pelvic inflammatory disease [^115J9wk9]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Recommended PID treatment regimens are based on clinical trial data demonstrating overall high rates of clinical cure. PID is well recognised though as having a polymicrobial aetiology, and not all microbial infections may respond equally well to the same antimicrobial. In our study of women with clinically suspected PID, we found M genitalium to be associated with endometritis and short-term PID treatment failure, as evidenced by persistent endometritis and continued pelvic pain. We conclude that cefoxitin and doxycycline, a Center for Disease Control recommended PID treatment regimen, is ineffective for the treatment of M genitalium upper genital tract infection.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116Kx4QG]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Quality of the evidence

Most of the 37 included studies had unclear or high risk of bias in most domains, and only three were at low risk of bias in most domains. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency and serious imprecision. The only high-quality evidence was for the sensitivity analysis regarding the use (or not) of nitroimidazole. There was moderate-quality evidence in the sensitivity analysis regarding the use of azithromycin in mild-moderate cases of PID, in comparisons between the use or not of nitroimidazole for curing mild-moderate or severe PID, and in comparisons between clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporins for curing severe PID.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^111m47AQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review of the evidence was guided by 2 types of key questions (Table): informational questions outlining data published since the 2015 update to the CDC treatment guidelines and discussion questions outlining how the evidence should inform guidelines. We identified articles published in English since the 2015 treatment guidelines (January 1, 2015–November 30, 2021) by using the search terms mycoplasma AND genitalium OR M. genitalium to search PubMed. One investigator (L.E.M.) reviewed abstracts and manuscripts for inclusion. All authors verified included papers. In this article, we focus on new evidence on disease syndromes and antibiotic therapy and the implications for testing and treatment strategies.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease in a pediatric emergency department: epidemiology and treatment [^112TyVyS]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Most adolescent cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are diagnosed in the emergency department (ED). An important step to prevent PID-related morbidity among this high-risk population is to quantify prevalence and microbial patterns and identify testing and treatment gaps.

Methods

We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional study of all visits by adolescents to an urban children's ED with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis of PID in 2012. We used standard descriptive statistics to quantify PID diagnoses, sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing, and treatment.

Results

Pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed in more than 9% of women with a chief complaint of abdominal/pelvic pain. Most diagnosed cases underwent some STI testing, and 40% tested positive. Seventy percent of cases received antibiotics recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Conclusions

There is a high prevalence of PID among adolescents in the pediatric ED. Rates of STI testing and appropriate treatment reveal gaps in diagnosis and management, representing a lost opportunity for identification and treatment of PID/STIs among high-risk adolescents.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: new diagnostic criteria and treatment [^115xp9ig]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PID is a common infection in reproductive-age women that presents an enormous public health and economic burden. It is responsible for much short- and long-term morbidity that may necessitate interventions subsequent to the original infection. Mild PID seems to be much more common than severe or "classic" PID, and the importance of early recognition and treatment cannot be understated. Current treatment regimens seem to be effective in terms of immediate clinical efficacy. As we learn more about the frequency and importance of subclinical PID, the true burden of upper genital tract infection upon reproductive age women continues to be elucidated.

### Comparing ceftriaxone plus azithromycin or doxycycline for pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized controlled trial [^115cKKd8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the equivalence of ceftriaxone plus doxycycline or azithromycin for cases of mild pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

Patients with PID received an intramuscular injection of 250 mg of ceftriaxone, and were randomly assigned to receive 200 mg/d of doxycycline for 2 weeks, or 1 g of azithromycin per week, for 2 weeks. The degree of pain was assessed on days 2, 7, and 14 and clinical cure was assessed on day 14.

Results

From 133 patients eligible for the study, 13 were excluded for having conditions other than PID, 11 were lost on follow-up, and three had oral intolerance to the antibiotics, yielding 106 for protocol analysis. No significant difference was observed regarding the degree of pain between the doxycycline and azithromycin groups. Clinical cure per protocol was 98.2% (56 of 57; 95% confidence interval, 0.9–0.99) with azithromycin, and 85.7% (42 of 49; 95% CI, 0.72–0.93) with doxycycline (P = 0.02). In a modified intention to treat analysis, clinical cure was 90.3% (56 of 62; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96) with azithromycin, and 72.4% (42 of 58; 95% CI, 0.58–0.82) with doxycycline (P = .01); a relative risk of 0.35, and a number needed to treat of six for benefit with azithromycin.

Conclusion

When combined with ceftriaxone, 1g of azithromycin weekly for 2 weeks is equivalent to ceftriaxone plus a 14-day course of doxycycline for treating mild PID.

### Identification of novel microbes associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility [^114gsH6p]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

Our results must be confirmed in other prospective studies as they highlight the concerning possibility that currently recommended antibiotics do not treat a range of BV-associated organisms associated with PID sequelae. Our findings highlight the need for commercially available and affordable multiplex PCR-based genital tract microorganism tests w4 of BV-associated bacteria for incorporation in screening and treatment programmes to prevent PID. Such tests could also be included in standard work-up of PID to determine microbiological aetiology and allow clinicians to tailor patient treatment. For example, as our study found that A. vaginae persisted post-cefoxitin therapy, other CDC-recommended PID antibiotics active against A. vaginae w5 such as clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam might be used. Recent evidence suggests that the broad spectrum antibiotic nifuratel is effective against C. trachomatis and Mycoplasma spp. w6 as well as G. vaginalis and A. vaginae, without affecting lactobacilli. w7 However, no clinical trials of nifuratel for PID treatment have been conducted to date. The CDC treatment guidelines w8 suggest optional metronidazole inclusion for additional anaerobic coverage. However, as A. vaginae and Sneathia spp. have been shown to be metronidazole resistant in some studies, w5 clinical trials including metronidazole with other antimicrobials for mitigating short-term and long-term PID sequelae are needed.

We previously reported that C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae are associated with endometritis in this cohort. We now demonstrate that fastidious BV-associated bacteria and chlamydia/gonorrhoea in combination elevates endometritis likelihood three-and-a-half-fold. As BV-associated bacteria and chlamydia/gonorrhoea were frequently co-present, and as the relationship between BV-associated bacteria and endometritis was identified primarily among women with chlamydia and/or gonococcal infection, this suggests that chlamydia/gonorrhoea may pave the way for anaerobic bacteria ascension into the upper genital tract where they can persist post-PID treatment and cause recurrent PID and infertility, as demonstrated in our study. Alternatively or in addition, it is possible that persistent anaerobic infection may increase the risk of recurrent chlamydial or gonococcal infection.

### Toward improving the diagnosis and the treatment of adolescent pelvic inflammatory disease in emergency departments: results of a brief, educational intervention [^116Un8ya]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the utility of an abbreviated teaching tool (ATT) in improving emergency medicine pediatricians' knowledge of the diagnosis and the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

An 18-question internet-based survey, which included questions about the diagnosis and the treatment of PID, was administered to members of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Emergency Medicine. Participants were randomized to receive either a weblink to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted disease treatment guidelines (weblink group) or a 1-page ATT that summarized the CDC guidelines (ATT group) to assist with completion of the survey. We compared the accuracy of responses between the 2 groups.

Results

Two hundred thirty-seven subjects responded to the survey (109 from the weblink group and 128 from ATT group). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to sex, geographic location, practice setting, years of experience, or reported frequency of recent PID diagnoses. Ninety-seven percent of the ATT group correctly identified the appropriate antibiotic regimen in compliance with the CDC guidelines compared with 61% of the weblink group (OR, 19.4; 95% confidence interval, 6.6–76.9); the ATT group was also more likely to correctly identify appropriate treatment options overall (OR, 9.6; 95% confidence interval, 4.9–19.3).

Conclusions

Although the overall PID knowledge in our sample was low, the physicians with access to a 1-page teaching tool summarizing the CDC treatment recommendations for PID performed significantly better when asked questions involving PID treatment as compared with providers with access to the CDC Web site. Further studies should investigate whether access to a similar tool can improve patient care.

### Physician specialty influences care of pelvic inflammatory disease [^11454rU6]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Background

CDC guidelines recommend Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and HIV testing, as well as specific antibiotic regimens in the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), although latitude in adhering to these guidelines is common. We hypothesized that adherence to CDC guidelines for antibiotic regimens and laboratory testing, coverage for anaerobic organisms, and the use of diagnostic imaging techniques do not differ significantly between practitioners with emergency medicine (EM) versus obstetrics and gynecology (OB-GYN) training.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective medical chart review on patients (N = 351) discharged with a diagnosis of PID over a 20-month period at two neighboring emergency care facilities-one with EM-trained providers and the other with OB-GYN-trained providers.

Results

Adjusted for demographic predictors and chief complaint, there was no significant difference in adherence to N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis antibiotic coverage guidelines between the two facilities (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.34; 95% CI 0.66–2.74), using the OB-GYN facility in the numerator of the AOR. Anaerobic coverage was significantly more common at the OB-GYN facility (AOR 9.11; 95% CI 5.36–15.48). Both sites had very low rates of adherence to CDC laboratory testing guidelines with overall rates of adherence at 4.0% (95% CI 1.9%-5.9%). Utilization of diagnostic tests differed greatly between facilities: ultrasound utilization was 66.7% (95% CI 58.2%-75.2%) at the OB-GYN facility and 39.7% (95% CI 33.4%-45.9%) at the EM facility.

Conclusions

The diagnostic pathway for PID and adherence to guidelines differ significantly depending on physician specialty and practice environment, suggesting the need for further standardization, perhaps with cross-disciplinary training.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112APtUZ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Parenteral Treatment

Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of parenteral regimens. Clinical experience should guide decisions regarding transition to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated within 24–48 hours of clinical improvement. For women with tubo-ovarian abscesses, > 24 hours of inpatient observation is recommended.

Recommended Parenteral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
plus
Metronidazole 500 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours

Because of the pain associated with IV infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide similar bioavailability. Oral metronidazole is well absorbed and can be considered instead of IV for women without severe illness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible. After clinical improvement with parenteral therapy, transition to oral therapy with doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day and metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day is recommended to complete 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

### Treatment of mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease with a short-course azithromycin-based regimen versus ofloxacin plus metronidazole: results of a multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^115C5E8S]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

A multicentre, randomised non-inferiority trial compared the efficacy and safety of 14days of ofloxacin and metronidazole (standard-of-care (SoC)) versus a single dose of intramuscular ceftriaxone followed by 5days of azithromycin and metronidazole (intervention arm (IA)) in women with mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

Women with a clinical diagnosis of PID presenting at sexual health services were randomised to the SoC or IA arms. Treating clinicians and participants were not blinded to treatment allocation but the clinician performing the assessment of primary outcome was blinded. The primary outcome was clinical cure defined as ≥ 70% reduction in the modified McCormack pain score at day 14–21 after starting treatment. Secondary outcomes included adherence, tolerability and microbiological cure.

Results

Of the randomised population 72/153 (47.1%) reached the primary end point in the SoC arm, compared with 68/160 (42.5%) in the IA (difference in cure 4.6% (95% CI -15.6% to 6.5%). Following exclusion of 86 women who were lost to follow-up, attended outside the day 14–21 follow-up period, or withdrew consent, 72/107 (67.3%) had clinical cure in the SoC arm compared with 68/120 (56.7%) in the IA, giving a difference in cure rate of 10.6% (95% CI -23.2% to 1.9%). We were unable to demonstrate non-inferiority of the IA compared with SoC arm. Women in the IA took more treatment doses compared with the SoC group (113/124 (91%) vs 75/117 (64%), p = 0.0001), but were more likely to experience diarrhoea (61% vs 24%, p < 0.0001). Of 288 samples available for analysis, Mycoplasma genitalium was identified in 10% (28/288), 58% (11/19) of which had baseline antimicrobial resistance-associated mutations.

Conclusion

A short-course azithromycin-based regimen is likely to be less effective than the standard treatment with ofloxacin plus metronidazole. The high rate of baseline antimicrobial resistance supports resistance testing in those with M. genitalium infection to guide appropriate therapy.

### Effectiveness of treatment strategies of some women with pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized trial [^113V6m6w]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Among all women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), prevention of adverse reproductive consequences appears to be similarly achieved by outpatient treatment and inpatient treatment. We assessed whether outpatient is as effective as inpatient treatment in relevant age, race, and clinical subgroups of women with PID.

Methods

Women with clinical signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease (n = 831) were randomized into a multicenter trial of inpatient treatment, initially employing intravenous cefoxitin and doxycycline compared with outpatient treatment consisting of a single intramuscular injection of cefoxitin and oral doxycycline. Comparisons between treatment groups during a mean of 84 months of follow-up were made for pregnancies, live births, time to pregnancy, infertility, PID recurrence, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy.

Results

Outpatient treatment assignment did not adversely impact the proportion of women having one or more pregnancies, live births, or ectopic pregnancies during follow-up; time to pregnancy; infertility; PID recurrence; or chronic pelvic pain among women of various races; with or without previous PID; with or without baseline Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis infection; and with or without high temperature/white blood cell count/pelvic tenderness score. This was true even in teenagers and women without a previous live birth. Ectopic pregnancies were more common in the outpatient than the inpatient treatment group, but because these were so rare, the difference did not reach statistical significance (5 versus 1, odds ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval 0.57–42.25).

Conclusion

Among all women and subgroups of women with mild-to-moderate PID, there were no differences in reproductive outcomes after randomization to inpatient or outpatient treatment.

### Identification of novel microbes associated with pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility [^116LiuUz]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

That infertility was only marginally associated with chlamydial PID and not associated with gonococcal PID suggests that, in contrast to older studies that strongly implicated these bacteria in infertility, women in our study received timely and effective antibiotics for these pathogens. Indeed, approximately 90% of our patients were free of gonorrhoea/chlamydia at the 30-day follow-up. Moreover, the combination of gonorrhoea/chlamydia plus fastidious BV-associated bacteria produced no additional degree of persistent endometritis and long-term PID sequelae beyond the effect from BV-associated bacteria alone.

Currently, the approach for PID treatment is empiric, using broad spectrum antibiotics to target a range of pathogens but largely directed towards eliminating N. gonorrhoeae and/or C. trachomatis. However, approximately 60% of women on our cohort had non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial PID. Fastidious BV-associated bacteria, commonly found in the endometrium at baseline, often persisted after CDC-recommended PID treatment as did endometritis. A sizeable proportion of women receiving timely, standard PID treatment may thus have ongoing upper genital tract inflammation as a result of continued infection with previously unrecognised pathogens. Such treatment failure appears to eventuate recurrent PID and infertility among some women. Replication of our results would dictate that optimal diagnosis and treatment regimens for PID be re-evaluated.

Key messages

Current pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) treatment regimens use broad spectrum antibiotics to target a range of pathogens, but largely directed towards eliminating Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis.
Among women treated with cefoxitin and doxycycline, Sneathia sanguinegens / amnionii, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria 1 and Atopobium vaginae were associated with persistent endometritis, recurrent PID and infertility.
Optimal antibiotic regimens for PID may require coverage for novel bacterial vaginosis-associated microbes.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^116vRh7y]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper part of the female genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, or adjacent pelvic structures causing peritonitis that may spread from the pelvis to the abdomen. The cause is ascending bacterial infection from the vagina in 85% of cases, most commonly from sexually transmitted pathogens (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis). Endogenous vaginal and cervical flora, especially anaerobes, cause PID in most of the remaining cases. Most cases are treated as outpatients with antibiotics alone. Indications for hospitalization include failure of outpatient management, severe illness, and pregnancy (owing to the risk of pregnancy loss). Pelvic (tubo-ovarian) abscess may be an indication for surgery.

Trauma, a major global public health problem, can be associated with high morbidity and mortality depending on mechanism, injury pattern, time to stabilization, and host frailty regardless of socioeconomic status. Both blunt and penetrating mechanisms may result in bowel injury; motor vehicle crashes are the most common of blunt intestinal injury. followed by falls. The small intestine is more likely than colon to be injured by either mechanism. Infection is considered established (as opposed to contamination by enteric contents) after 12 h for colon injury and 24 h for other locations; within those time frames only surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (maximum 24 h; ideally a single dose) is required, even if the colon is lacerated. Blunt hollow viscus injury may have a more insidious presentation in this setting, possibly resulting in delayed diagnosis and intervention and consequent adverse outcomes.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^116widQW]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion — We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion (GRADE 1C). Symptomatic patients with BV should be treated, and abortion should not be delayed while awaiting treatment. BV is common, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in reproductive-age, pregnant-capable persons globally, and is associated with increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.05–2.21). Randomized trials of perioperative metronidazole or clindamycin showed no statistically significant differences in postabortion upper genital tract infection versus placebo when standard prophylactic antibiotics were provided; one study using treatment dosing with metronidazole 500 mg three times daily orally for 10 days starting 7 days before the abortion procedure significantly reduced the risk of developing PID postprocedure, but these patients did not receive universal prophylactic antibiotics before abortion.

### Failure of cefoxitin and doxycycline to eradicate endometrial Mycoplasma genitalium and the consequence for clinical cure of pelvic inflammatory disease [^115iU23H]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives:

As Mycoplasma genitalium is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), we examined the efficacy of a commonly used PID antimicrobial in treating M genitalium upper genital tract infection.

Methods:

In the PID Evaluation and Clinical Health study of inpatient versus outpatient treatment, 682 women treated with cefoxitin and doxycycline for clinically suspected PID had stored cervical and endometrial specimens available for analysis. In the current sub study, we compared baseline endometritis, short term treatment failure (continued endometritis and pelvic pain 30 days following treatment) and sequelae among women with and without M genitalium, identified using PCR.

Results:

Endometrial M genitalium was associated with baseline endometritis (adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 6.1). Among women with a positive baseline M genitalium test, 41% tested positive again 30 days following treatment. Women testing positive compared to those testing negative for M genitalium at baseline had an increased risk of short-term treatment failure (RR 4.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 20.1). Rates of sequelae, including infertility (22%), recurrent PID (31%) and chronic pelvic pain (42%), were high among women testing positive for endometrial M genitalium at baseline. There was a non-significant trend towards increased infertility, chronic pelvic pain and recurrent PID, and decreased pregnancy and live birth following M genitalium infection.

Conclusions:

M genitalium is associated with endometritis and short-term PID treatment failure. Cefoxitin and doxycycline, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended PID treatment regimen, is ineffective for the treatment of M genitalium upper genital tract infection.

Intramuscular or Oral Treatment

IM or oral therapy can be considered for women with mild-to-moderate acute PID because the clinical outcomes among women treated with these regimens are similar to those treated with IV therapy. Women who do not respond to IM or oral therapy within 72 hours should be reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis and be administered therapy IV.

Recommended Intramuscular or Oral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IM in a single dose and probenecid 1 g orally administered concurrently in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
or
Other parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftizoxime or cefotaxime)
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
* For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

These regimens provide coverage against frequent etiologic agents of PID; however, the optimal choice of a cephalosporin is unclear. Cefoxitin, a second-generation cephalosporin, has better anaerobic coverage than ceftriaxone, and, in combination with probenecid and doxycycline, has been effective in short-term clinical response among women with PID. Ceftriaxone has better coverage against N. gonorrhoeae. The addition of metronidazole to these regimens provides extended coverage against anaerobic organisms and will also effectively treat BV, which is frequently associated with PID.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with an intrauterine device (IUD) — removal versus retention evidence: Treatment outcomes do not generally differ between patients with PID who retain the IUD and those who have the IUD removed, and appropriate antibiotic treatment and close clinical follow-up are necessary; a systematic review identified four studies of Cu-IUDs or other nonhormonal IUDs comparing removal versus retention. Findings included one RCT where removal led to longer hospitalizations without differences in PID recurrences or subsequent pregnancies, another RCT with no differences in laboratory findings, a prospective cohort with no differences in clinical or laboratory findings but longer hospitalizations in the removal group, and one RCT where the rate of recovery for most clinical signs and symptoms was higher with removal; no evidence was found regarding women using LNG-IUDs (level of evidence: I to II, fair, direct).

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^1142EzbF]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Intrauterine device (IUD) placement — prophylactic antibiotics: Prophylactic antibiotics are generally not recommended for Cu-IUD or LNG-IUD placement. Evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicates that prophylaxis reduced unscheduled return visits but did not significantly reduce pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or IUD discontinuation, and although the risk for PID was higher within the first 20 days after placement, the overall incidence was low. For infective endocarditis prevention, the American Heart Association indicates prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for genitourinary tract procedures including IUD insertion or removal, and studies have not demonstrated a conclusive link between genitourinary procedures and infective endocarditis or a preventive benefit of prophylactic antibiotics during such procedures.

### Failure of cefoxitin and doxycycline to eradicate endometrial Mycoplasma genitalium and the consequence for clinical cure of pelvic inflammatory disease [^113JkJGT]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, ours is the first study to investigate treatment failure among PID patients with M genitalium identified in the endometrium. Persistence of M genitalium following treatment with a standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended PID treatment regimen was very high: 44% of women with baseline endometrial positive specimens tested positive again 30 days following treatment. In contrast, only 2–4% of women in the PEACH study had persistent or recurrent gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis when retested at 30 days. Women with M genitalium identified in the endometrium at baseline were four times as likely to experience persistent endometritis and approximately 4.5 times as likely to experience treatment failure — defined as the presence of both endometritis and pelvic pain 30 days following treatment for PID.

Several attributes of M genitalium indicate that it is resistant to cefoxitin and doxycycline. First, mycoplasmal bacteria lack a cell wall and are thus resistant to cell wall inhibiting antibiotics. Second, an M genitalium strain with increased tetracycline resistance has been isolatedand M genitalium is associated with persistent non-gonococcal urethritis among men treated with tetracyclines. Most women with PID are treated with antibiotics directed toward N gonorrhoeae and/or C trachomatis, despite the fact that these pathogens account for only a third to a half of PID cases. Indeed, in the PEACH study approximately 60% of women had non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial PID. Over a third of the women had persistent endometritis post treatment, identifying a sizeable portion as having ongoing upper genital tract inflammation and demonstrating that antibiotics used to treat this critically important upper tract syndrome are suboptimal. M genitalium has demonstrated variable resistance to fluoroquinolonesand susceptibility to macrolides, although azithromycin resistant strains have recently been identified. A newer quinolone, moxifloxacin, has recently been shown to exhibit a high degree of activity against M genitalium. Randomised clinical trials assessing these alternative regimens for the treatment of M genitalium and PID are needed.

Profile of patients with newly diagnosed CD and perianal disease

Perianal disease is a distinct phenotype of CD. The reference imaging technique for evaluating perianal CD is pelvic MRI as localization and extent of disease can be demonstrated accurately. The panelists, therefore, agreed (100% agreement) that pelvic MRI is important in order to determine the spectrum, severity and inflammatory activity of perianal CD. Classification of perianal CD as simple (superficial fistula with single tract involvement) or complex (fistulas with high inter-sphincteric, high intra-sphincteric, supra-sphincteric or extra-sphincteric and several openings) was considered important in order to define disease severity and design appropriate treatment. The presence or absence and severity of endoscopic lesions in the rectum are also important in determining appropriate treatment and prognosis. Surgical examination under anesthesia guided by the pelvic MRI results is the sine qua non for the appropriate management of perianal disease (Clinical statement 6).

Clinical statement 6
Determining the severity of perianal disease

Early administration of biologic therapy for perianal disease

Patients with simple perianal disease should start therapy with antibiotics for 2–4 weeks. However, patients who fail conventional antibiotic therapy or patients with complex perianal CD should start biological therapy with or without immunosuppressives as soon as possible. In a study of 35 patients with complex perianal CD, Sciaudone et al showed a better outcome among patients who received a combination of IFX and surgery compared to patients who received either IFX monotherapy or underwent only surgery. The view that biologic therapy along with antibiotics and surgery are important in patients with complex perianal CD was strongly supported (100% agreement) (Clinical statement 7).

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^111aiZAh]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

U.S. MEC 2024 — Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) with intrauterine devices are classified as follows: Current PID has initiation category 4 and continuation category 2 for both Cu-IUD and LNG-IUD, with the continuation clarification to treat the PID using appropriate antibiotics and that the IUD usually does not need to be removed if the person wants to continue; evidence indicates clinical course did not differ whether the IUD was removed or left in place. Past PID with subsequent pregnancy is category 1 for both devices, whereas past PID without subsequent pregnancy is category 2 for both devices. Current purulent cervicitis or chlamydial infection or gonococcal infection has initiation category 4 and continuation category 2 for both devices, with the continuation clarification to treat the STI using appropriate antibiotics and that the IUD usually does not need to be removed if the person wants to continue; evidence notes that the absolute risk for subsequent PID was low among women with STI at placement but greater than among women with no STI at placement.

### Management of gonorrhea in adolescents and adults in the United States [^115iyar3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease in the United States and is associated with serious health sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Treatment for gonorrhea has been complicated by antimicrobial resistance. Neisseria gonorrhoeae has developed resistance to each of the antimicrobials that were previously recommended as first-line treatment regimens, and current treatment options are severely limited. This article summarizes the key questions and data that were discussed at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment Guidelines Expert Consultation meeting in April 2013, and the rationale for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STD treatment guidelines for gonococcal infections in adolescents and adults. Key issues addressed include whether to change the dosage of ceftriaxone and azithromycin used in the recommended dual treatment regimen, whether to continue to list dual treatment with cefixime and azithromycin as an alternative treatment regimen, and management of gonococcal infections in persons with severe cephalosporin allergy or suspected treatment failure.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^114iVLeP]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Chlamydia and gonorrhea — prevalence and infection risk around abortion and early pregnancy loss are quantified, with a hospital-based abortion clinic reporting 9.6% chlamydia and 1.9% gonorrhea positivity and an emergency department EPL cohort reporting 10.5% chlamydia and 2.6% gonorrhea; among patients undergoing first-trimester procedural abortion without prophylactic antibiotics, chlamydia increased salpingitis risk by 30-fold (relative risk [RR] 30, 95% CI 11–85) and endometritis by fourfold (RR 4.1, 95% CI 2.5–6.7), and a randomized trial showed the presence of chlamydia increased the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) by threefold; these studies corroborate that antibiotic prophylaxis is an insufficient treatment for patients with known cervicitis, and patients with known gonorrhea or chlamydia need adequate antibiotic treatment for their infection rather than prophylaxis alone.

### Association between prophylactic antibiotics for endometrial biopsy and the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease: a retrospective cohort study [^115FD91e]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Of 294 331 outpatients identified, 63 320 were assigned to the non‐antibiotic group and 15 830 to the antibiotic group, after 1:4 propensity score matching (Figure 1). Table S3 shows the baseline characteristics of the unmatched and propensity score‐matched cohorts. In the unmatched cohort, several differences were observed between the non‐antibiotic and antibiotic groups. Antibiotics were more commonly used in healthcare facilities with fewer beds, medical clinics, and very low‐volume hospitals than in their counterparts. After propensity score matching, all baseline characteristics were well‐balanced. Table 1 presents the outcomes of the unmatched and propensity score‐matched cohorts. In the matched cohort, numbers of hospitalizations for PID (62 [0.098%] and 12 [0.076%], respectively; P = 0.470) and outpatient visits for PID (329 [0.52%] and 71 [0.45%], P = 0.287) were not significantly different between the groups. The lengths of hospital stay for hospitalized patients were 8 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 3–29 days) in the non‐antibiotic group (n = 62) and nine days (IQR: 5–13 days) in the antibiotic group (n = 12), with no significant difference (P = 0.664).

TABLE 1
Outcomes before and after propensity score matching.

There was no significant association between prophylactic antibiotic administration and subsequent hospitalizations, outpatient visits for PID, or length of hospital stay. These results suggest that prophylactic antibiotic administration may have limited effectiveness in preventing PID or its severity after endometrial biopsy. The main strength of our study was the use of a nationwide claims database. Additionally, our findings align with those of a previous study. The Japanese guidelines for obstetrics and gynecology do not mention the necessity of prophylactic antibiotics during endometrial biopsy. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use can prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance, alleviate the financial burden on healthcare systems, and reduce the side effects associated with antibiotics. Therefore, it may be necessary to address the limited effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics in the Japanese guidelines.

### Interventions in addition to broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of radiologically proven tubo-ovarian abscess [^111y7wPP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

2. The circumstances in which additional interventions should be offered and the short‐ and long‐term outcomes associated with their use, compared to medical treatment alone, are unclear

Determining whether there is benefit from additional interventions (beyond broad‐spectrum antibiotics) for a person with a TOA is important, because there is the potential for clinical deterioration (and therefore risk of harm) if additional interventions are not performed in a timely fashion, yet additional interventions carry risk and should not be used unless there is likely to be a benefit.

Current guidance from international groups suggests there is benefit to the use of additional interventions, but does not indicate for whom, or at which stage in the clinical course of TOA, these additional interventions should be used.

British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidance: "Laparoscopy may help early resolution by dividing adhesions and draining pelvic abscesses, but ultrasound‐guided aspiration of pelvic fluid collections is less invasive".
American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidance: "The role of image‐guided drainage versus surgical therapy depends on the clinical severity and patient's reproductive stage. Computed tomography and ultrasound‐guided aspiration have been used successfully. Women of reproductive age may benefit from tubo‐ovarian abscess drainage".
Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidance: "Surgical treatment should be considered in severe cases or where there is clear evidence of a pelvic abscess". This guideline was recently archived and directs users to the BASHH guideline.

Without clear guidance, the approach to treatment will be clinician‐dependent, leading to potential bias in care, inefficient or ineffective use of health resources, and has the potential to perpetuate socioeconomic, ethnic, and obesity‐related health inequities. We propose that synthesising the available evidence on the use of additional interventions in TOA will be a useful first step in informing clinical guidance, and identifying evidence gaps to be addressed by future research.

3. Inadequate treatment has short‐ and long‐term consequences for women

Inadequately treated TOAs are associated with longer hospital admissions (potentially increasing healthcare costs), increased short‐term morbidity and mortality, and significant long‐term morbidities such as infertility and chronic pelvic pain. Interventions in addition to antibiotics could reduce some of these risks. This may be particularly important for those with larger masses, bilateral masses, or high fever or inflammatory markers, as observational studies have shown these to be predictive of medical treatment failure.

### Comparative clinical and incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for pelvic inflammatory disease in Southern Brazil [^1142zpLw]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This paper evaluates the accuracy of C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocyte count, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for diagnosing tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) and assessing the cost-effectiveness of different treatment regimens for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), with and without TOA.

Method

A retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 1, 2003, and December 30, 2021, including women aged 13–80years diagnosed with PID. The analysis focused on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of different treatment regimens.

Results

C-reactive protein, leukocyte count, and NLR were found to be statistically significant markers for diagnosing TOA. Out of 907 PID cases, 705 achieved clinical cure with initial treatment. The most cost-effective treatment for mild PID without TOA was ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin, which was considered less costly and more effective in the cost-effectiveness analysis. For severe PID with TOA, ampicillin combined with gentamicin and clindamycin was more cost-effective compared to ampicillin with sulbactam plus doxycycline, given a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$213.57 for a 4.2% increase in cure rate.

Conclusion

The study's findings support the use of CRP, leukocyte count, and NLR as diagnostic tools for TOA. Ceftriaxone combined with azithromycin is recommended as the first-line treatment for mild PID at our institution due to its cost-effectiveness. For TOA, ampicillin combined with gentamicin and clindamycin is a cost-effective option if the healthcare system's willingness to pay exceeds US$213.57 for a 4.2% increase in cure rate, contributing valuable insights for PID treatment strategies from a hospital's perspective. The average time of hospital admission for TOA was 3days. After discharge, patients received oral doxycycline until completing 14days of treatment.

### Compliance with the centers for disease control and prevention recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases [^1178Go9m]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Little is known about gaps in quality and the extent to which clinical standards are used in emergency department (ED) practice.

Objectives

To determine whether ED practitioners comply with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for diagnosing and treating sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

Methods

A retrospective chart review of ED visits was conducted at an urban teaching hospital. Using ICD-9 codes, urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), gonorrhea, and chlamydia cases seen from May 1, 2000, to February 28, 2001, were identified. Documentation of components of the history, physical examination, diagnostic testing, prescribed antibiotics, and discharge instructions necessary to comply with the CDC guidelines were abstracted. This set of comprehensive criteria was compared with a less stringent subset of selected criteria.

Results

Two hundred forty-six patient visits were identified, and 203 (83%) were included. Forty-eight men and 155 women were included: 48 (24%) with urethritis, 34 (17%) with cervicitis, and 121 (60%) with PID. For urethritis, cervicitis, and PID, respectively, there was documentation of compliance with indicators related to the following: history 73%, 15%, and 14%; physical examinations 63%, 15%, and 22%; diagnostic testing 79%, 71%, and 71%; antibiotic use 33%, 32%, and 32%; and safe sex instructions 50%, 18%, and 15% of the time. Men were more likely to receive safe sex instructions (p ≤ 0.01). Total (100%) compliance in all five domains occurred 8% of the time for urethritis, 3% for cervicitis, and never for PID. The rates of 100% compliance were not significantly different when a subset of selected criteria was used.

Conclusions

Deficits in adherence to recommended guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of STDs exist in ED practice.

### Update to CDC's sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines, 2006: fluoroquinolones no longer recommended for treatment of gonococcal infections [^116kTAHb]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

In the United States, gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported notifiable disease, with 339,593 cases documented in 2005. Since 1993, fluoroquinolones (i.e., ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, or levofloxacin) have been used frequently in the treatment of gonorrhea because of their high efficacy, ready availability, and convenience as a single-dose, oral therapy. However, prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been increasing and is becoming widespread in the United States, necessitating changes in treatment regimens. Beginning in 2000, fluoroquinolones were no longer recommended for gonorrhea treatment in persons who acquired their infections in Asia or the Pacific Islands (including Hawaii); in 2002, this recommendation was extended to California. In 2004, CDC recommended that fluoroquinolones not be used in the United States to treat gonorrhea in men who have sex with men (MSM). This report, based on data from the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), summarizes data on fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae (QRNG) in heterosexual males and in MSM throughout the United States. This report also updates CDC's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2006 regarding the treatment of infections caused by N. gonorrhoeae. On the basis of the most recent evidence, CDC no longer recommends the use of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of gonococcal infections and associated conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Consequently, only one class of drugs, the cephalosporins, is still recommended and available for the treatment of gonorrhea.

### Adherence to oral therapies in pelvic inflammatory disease [^116KyZDS]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess adherence to oral therapies in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

Medication adherence to oral doxycycline therapy (100 mg) was measured using electronic event monitoring (EEM) among adult women with PID. Subjects (n = 91), who were predominantly black and with a high school or lower educational attainment, were randomly selected from the Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Evaluation and Clinical Health (PEACH) Study, a trial in which subjects were randomized to either (1). initial inpatient then outpatient or (2). fully outpatient treatment with doxycycline and cefoxitin. Summary statistics calculated within treatment groups and in the cohort as a whole included the percentage of administrations taken, percentage of days with correct dosage, percentage of days with no drug taken, time elapsed until the first drug holiday, and percentage of optimal dosing intervals.

Results

Study subjects took an average of 70% of prescribed doses, took the prescribed two daily doses for less than half of their outpatient days, took an unscheduled drug holiday for almost 25% of their outpatient days, and took only 16.9% of their doses within the optimal timing interval. In general, working, not bleeding with sex, and not drinking hard liquor were positively associated with measures of adherence. Adherence estimates were similar among women in the inpatient and outpatient groups after hospital discharge.

Conclusions

The disturbing rates of time interval adherence, even after hospitalization, suggest the need to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic regimens involving shorter courses and longer dosing intervals.

Mycoplasma genitalium (Mgen) — screening and resistance guidance in sexual health care for people with or at risk for HIV is as follows: Persons with recurrent urethritis or cervicitis should be screened with an NAAT (nucleic acid amplification test) for Mycoplasma genitalium, and screening should be considered for those with pelvic inflammatory disease, while screening for Mgen in asymptomatic persons or extragenital sites is not recommended. Evidence indicates Mgen is a cause of nongonococcal/nonchlamydial penile urethritis, has been associated with cervicitis, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease, and may be more common among people with HIV, with resistance to azithromycin widespread, increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, and multidrug resistance identified; there are insufficient data on outcomes of asymptomatic Mgen and antibiotic use could increase resistant organisms, and doxyPEP efficacy and resistance risk are areas of active investigation.

Table 6
Pouchitis Disease Activity Index

Endoscopy is the main tool in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of pouchitis. The most commonly used clinical scores for pouchitis evaluation are the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (based on symptoms, endoscopy and histology (table 6) and the simpler Modified Pouchitis Disease Activity Index (symptoms and endoscopy only). In both, endoscopy is key. Pouchoscopy may be best carried out using a gastroscope in view of the flexibility and smaller calibre of this compared with a colonoscope, and a digital examination adds valuable information. At the time of pouchoscopy it is important to assess the pre-pouch ileum as well as the pouch itself, the rectal cuff and anal transition zone (to look for cuffitis). Morphological changes of oedema, loss of vascular pattern, erythema, haemorrhage, erosions/ulceration should be looked for. Ulcers in the afferent loop may indicate Crohn's disease or use of NSAIDs. Inflammation in one half of the pouch with sharp demarcation along the suture line may suggest ischaemia. Staple-line ulcers with normal pouch mucosa elsewhere are common and do not suggest pouchitis. Other investigations include pelvic MRI to rule out collections, fistulae or anatomical abnormalities; stool cultures and C. difficile toxin and celiac serology.

3.14.2 Treatment of acute pouchitis

Statement 23. We recommend that a 2 week course of ciprofloxacin or metronidazole is the first-line treatment of acute pouchitis (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest that ciprofloxacin is better tolerated and may be more effective than metronidazole (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.2%).

Antibiotic therapy is the standard treatment for acute pouchitis, with observational data demonstrating 96% of patients have a symptomatic response to antibiotics. There is very little evidence comparing different antibiotics. However, one small study of 16 patients demonstrated that ciprofloxacin was superior to metronidazole in the treatment of acute pouchitis. Ciprofloxacin is better tolerated with fewer adverse effects than metronidazole and may therefore be considered first line treatment for acute pouchitis.

### Sexually transmitted infections: updates from the 2021 CDC guidelines [^114eaXtD]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates are increasing for most nationally notifiable disease categories in the United States. The 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines provide several updated, evidence-based testing and treatment recommendations. The recommended treatment for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone monotherapy given intramuscularly, with dosing based on the patient's body weight. For chlamydia, doxycycline is the preferred treatment. A test-of-cure is recommended for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea and for rectal chlamydia if treated with azithromycin. Vaginal trichomoniasis should be treated with a seven-day regimen of metronidazole. Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease routinely includes metronidazole with doxycycline and an increased dosage of ceftriaxone. Syphilis of less than one year's duration should be treated with a single dose of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units. Syphilis of more than one year's or unknown duration should be treated with three consecutive weekly doses of intramuscular penicillin G benzathine, 2.4 million units each. A thorough evaluation for otic, ophthalmic, and neurologic symptoms is essential for anyone with syphilis because these complications can occur at any stage and require 10 to 14 days of treatment with intravenous aqueous crystalline penicillin G. Family physicians can reduce STI rates by taking a thorough sexual history, especially in teens and young adults, ordering screening tests and treatment based on the updated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention STI guidelines, and collaborating with public health departments for disease reporting and partner services.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women — conditional treatment and acute self-treatment: Conditional treatment uses a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug or follow-up without treatment, with antibiotics started only if symptoms progress or do not resolve, and has not been studied in women older than 65 years or with rUTI; in women younger than 65 years, resolution without antibiotics occurred in 20% to 47%, but one study reported pyelonephritis in the placebo group at 2% to 2.6%. In women with rUTI, acute treatment can be initiated by a clinician or patient at symptom onset, and antibiotics are traditional first-line treatment of bacterial cystitis.

### Moxifloxacin versus ofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: results of a multicentre, double blind, randomised trial [^114t4u8q]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This multinational, multicentre, prospective, randomised, double blind, parallel group, non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin monotherapy with ofloxacin plus metronidazole in women with uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease.

Methods

Women from hospitals throughout 13 countries received a 14 day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily (n = 384), or oral ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily (n = 365).

Results

Of the 741 patients in the intent to treat (ITT) population, 564 (74.2%) were valid for the per protocol (PP) analyses; 112 (19.9%) of these were included in the microbiologically valid population (MBV). Clinical resolution rates in the PP population at the test of cure visit (TOC, 5–24 days post-therapy, primary efficacy end point) were 90.2% (248/275) for moxifloxacin and 90.7% (262/289) for ofloxacin plus metronidazole (95% CI: -5.7% to 4.0%). At follow up (28–42 days post-therapy), resolution rates in the PP population were 85.8% (236/275) and 87.9% (254/289) for moxifloxacin and comparator, respectively (95% CI: -8.0% to 3.1%). Bacteriological success rates in the MBV population at TOC were 87.5% (49/56) for moxifloxacin and 82.1% (46/56) for comparator (95% CI: -8.3% to 18.8%). Against Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteriological success rates with moxifloxacin were 88.5% (23/26) and 100% (13/13) and for comparator 85.7% (18/21) and 81.8% (18/22), respectively. Drug related adverse events occurred less frequently with moxifloxacin (22.5% (85/378)) versus the comparator (30.9% (112/363)) (p = 0.01).

Conclusion

In uncomplicated PID, once daily moxifloxacin monotherapy was clinically and bacteriologically as efficacious as twice daily ofloxacin plus metronidazole therapy and was associated with fewer drug related adverse events.

### Randomised controlled trial of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial [^115CT6N9]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the United States and Europe, with over three million new infections diagnosed each year. But most chlamydial infections remain asymptomatic and undiagnosed. Untreated chlamydial infection in women can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, causing scarring of the fallopian tubes, which can result in tubal infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy. The annual cost of chlamydial infection and its sequelae in the United States has been estimated to exceed $2bn.

In many developed countries, screening programmes for chlamydia have been set up to reduce transmission and reproductive tract morbidity. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual screening of all sexually active women aged 25 or less. In England the recommendation applies to women aged 24 or less. But controversy remains about the evidence base. The results of the landmark trial by Scholes et alhave been questioned, and the continuing search for supporting evidence from other randomised controlled trials and epidemiological studies has not been always fruitful. The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended improvements in the quality of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding of assessment of outcome in any future trials of chlamydia screening. A more accurate estimate of the rate of progression of genital chlamydial infection to pelvic inflammatory disease is also urgently needed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of screening programmes. However, neither of the two previous trialstested all the control women. No trials of chlamydia screening have taken place in a British population.

The national chlamydia screening programme was progressively rolled out across England from 2003 to 2008. This left a window of opportunity from 2004 to 2007 to carry out a community based trial in a non-healthcare setting using self taken samples. In the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial we investigated whether screening young sexually active female students for chlamydial infection and treating those found to be infected reduced the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease in the subsequent 12 months. We also carried out an exploratory study to investigate the incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease in women with untreated chlamydial infection.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines, 2021 contain new recommendations for the treatment of gonococcal, chlamydial, and trichomonas infections, as well as pelvic inflammatory disease. Providers are encouraged to broaden their screening practices by considering incorporating rectal and pharyngeal testing when indicated, as well as opt-out testing for adolescent females. The discussion of testing and counseling for genital herpes infections has been expanded.

### Levonorgestrel (skyla) [^115hZd5J]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4 Pelvic Infection

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

Skyla is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or in women with a history of PID unless there has been a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy [see Contraindications (4)]. IUDs have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion. In clinical trials, PID was observed in 0.4% of women overall and occurred more frequently within the first year and most often within the first month after insertion of Skyla.

Promptly examine users with complaints of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, odorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, fever, genital lesions or sores. Remove Skyla in cases of recurrent endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.

Women at increased risk for PID

PID is often associated with a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and Skyla does not protect against STI. The risk of PID is greater for women who have multiple sexual partners, and also for women whose sexual partner(s) have multiple sexual partners. Women who have had PID are at increased risk for a recurrence or re-infection. In particular, ascertain whether the woman is at increased risk of infection (for example, leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], intravenous drug abuse).

Subclinical PID

PID may be asymptomatic but still result in tubal damage and its sequelae.

Treatment of PID

Following a diagnosis of PID, or suspected PID, bacteriologic specimens should be obtained, and antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly. Removal of Skyla after initiation of antibiotic therapy is usually appropriate.

Actinomycosis

Actinomycosis has been associated with IUDs. Remove Skyla from symptomatic women and treat with antibiotics. The significance of actinomyces-like organisms on Pap smear in an asymptomatic IUD user is unknown, and so this finding alone does not always require Skyla removal and treatment. When possible, confirm a Pap smear diagnosis with cultures.

### Peri-implantation pelvic inflammatory disease with normal pregnancy outcome [^1124Sunj]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report on the presentation, diagnostic assessment, treatment, and outcome of a case of peri-implantation pelvic inflammatory disease.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Emergency department and gynecology ward of a tertiary university hospital.

Patient(S)

A 25-year-old multiparous woman in her 1st month of pregnancy.

Intervention(S)

Diagnostic laparoscopy, antibiotic therapy, and pregnancy surveillance.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Surveillance and outcome of pregnancy.

Result(S)

The patient presented with abdominal pain and fever 26 days after her last menstrual period. Examination revealed peritoneal irritation and cervical tenderness, with free fluid in the pelvis. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, with no evidence of ectopic pregnancy. A significant quantity of yellow purulent fluid was drained from the pelvis, which cultured for Escherichia coli. Antibiotic therapy yielded excellent response. The pregnancy continued, with no complications, to healthy term delivery.

Conclusion(S)

This rare diagnosis of peri-implantation pelvic inflammatory disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in early pregnancy. Timely, rational treatment, including early pelvic drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy, may save the pregnancy.

### Prevalence of pelvic inflammatory disease in sexually experienced women of reproductive age-United States, 2013–2014 [^111NRGj4]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

PID can result from untreated bacterial infections, including chlamydia and gonorrhea, both of which are treatable and preventable. Each case of PID results in an estimated average cost of $3,202. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most commonly reported STIs in the United States, with approximately 1.5 million chlamydia and approximately 400,000 gonorrhea infections reported in 2015. Most chlamydia and gonorrhea infections are asymptomatic in women and many go undiagnosed and untreated. Results from randomized controlled trials suggest that chlamydia screening is associated with a decreased incidence of PID. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all sexually active women aged < 25 years and older women at increased risk for infection be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea.

Using nationally representative data, this study found a substantial prevalence of PID in the United States. Lifetime prevalence of PID was highest in women with sexual behaviors and a sexual health history putting them at increased risk for STIs, including having had a prior STI diagnosis, and differed by race/ethnicity in those without a prior STI diagnosis. Given the potential for asymptomatic infections to lead to PID and the costs associated with treatment, it is important for clinicians to adhere to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening in an effort to decrease the PID burden in sexually experienced women of reproductive age nationwide.

### Improvement in the clinical cure rate of outpatient management of pelvic inflammatory disease following a change in therapy [^114QsrsM]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

In the United Kingdom many genitourinary medicine clinics use oral doxycycline and metronidazole to treat pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). A retrospective case note review of PID treatment at our department in 2000 showed that the clinical cure rate (CCR) was only 55% with oral doxycycline and metronidazole for 2 weeks. We therefore added ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly to the doxycycline and metronidazole for treating PID. We have repeated the review and compared the results with those from 2000.

Methods

All patients diagnosed as having PID between 1 July 2002 and 31 December 2002 were identified. These episodes were diagnosed on clinical presentations of pelvic pain, vaginal discharge or bleeding, and cervical motion tenderness on physical examination. The CCR was defined as patients who fully resolved their symptoms and signs during 2 week and 4 week follow up. The results were compared with those from 2000.

Results

Women receiving ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and metronidazole had a CCR of 72%. In 2000 the CCR for women receiving only doxycycline and metronidazole was 55%. There were only 8% non-responders in 2002 compared with 18% in 2000. Comparing CCR and non-response rate, in 2002 there was a significant improvement in cure rate, OR 3.01 (95% CI 1.28 to 7.47) p = 0.009. Using an intent to treat analysis and including the defaulters as treatment failures there was still a significant improvement in cure rate, OR 2.03 (95% CI 1.18 to 3.50) p = 0.009.

Conclusions

The treatment of PID with ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and metronidazole gave a significantly higher CCR than doxycycline and metronidazole. Our experience would suggest that doxycycline and metronidazole alone is not a suitable regimen for treatment of PID in the United Kingdom.

### Efficacy of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention vs standard of care for female adolescents and young adults with pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized clinical trial [^115nrCWH]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Study Procedures

At baseline, participants completed an audio computer-assisted self-interview and were randomized to intervention and standard of care control groups based on a computer-generated block randomization sequence that was generated by the study's data analyst (S.C.) and sealed in an envelope until sequential enrollment. Although PID is a polymicrobial illness, the hallmark of assessment and treatment of patients is based on the effective treatment of N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis as commonly known pathogens. All participants provided self- or practitioner-collected vaginal swabs to test for STIs, including N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infections, and received a full course of medications per the CDC STI treatment guidelines, that were dispensed through their practitioner with routine discharge instructions. All patients received a single intramuscular injection of 250 mg of ceftriaxone per their routine clinical care and received twenty-eight 100-mg doxycycline tablets to take 1 tablet orally twice daily for 14 days. Other medications were available when practitioners requested them (eg, 500 mg of metronidazole twice daily for 14 days) to dispense at discharge with doxycycline. All participants were provided with standard discharge instructions per institutional PID treatment guidelines, and control participants were asked to arrange a 72-hour visit with their primary care practitioner or with the Title X program offered through the institutional adolescent and young adult clinic.

### Emergency department management of sexually transmitted infections in US adolescents: results from the national hospital ambulatory medical care survey [^111jrueb]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Adolescents are at risk for developing a variety of sexually transmitted infections for many reasons. Many of these adolescents present to the emergency department (ED) for their care. We describe the management of adolescent sexually transmitted infections in US EDs.

Methods

Data were obtained from the 1992 to 1998 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. All visits by adolescents aged 12 to 19 years were identified by any International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code related to sexually transmitted infections. Treatment was reviewed and compared with existing guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the independent association of each of the following variables on antibiotic prescribing rates: sex, race and ethnicity, hospital location, age, and insurance.

Results

Eighteen thousand nine hundred ninety-nine records that represented 70,693,603 adolescent visits to US EDs were identified during the 7-year study period, of which 351 records representing 1.2 million visits were for a sexually transmitted infection. Mean age was 17.1 years, and 92% were female patients. Overall, 80% of patients diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection were treated (received antibiotics or were admitted to the hospital); 91% of patients had pelvic inflammatory disease and 71% of patients had other sexually transmitted infections. Eight percent of patients diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease were admitted to the hospital. However, treatment for female patients with pelvic inflammatory disease was fully compliant with CDC recommendations in only 35% of cases (95% confidence interval [CI] 19% to 45%) and partially compliant in another 45%; 20% (95% CI 12% to 31%) of patients received either no treatment or treatment not in accordance with guidelines. Male patients were more likely to be treated for sexually transmitted infection (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 6.3; 95% CI 1.0 to 38.7), and Hispanic patients were less likely (adjusted OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1 to 0.9) to be treated. Age, insurance type, and hospital location were not a factor in receiving antibiotics. For female patients who had a sexually transmitted infection, only 43% had a pregnancy test done, and of all adolescents diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection, only 1 (0.3%) had an HIV test performed.

Conclusion

Significant numbers of adolescents sought care for sexually transmitted infections in US EDs. Evaluation and treatment of these adolescents is not optimal. Male patients are more likely to be treated for a sexually transmitted infection. Hispanic patients are less likely to be treated for a sexually transmitted infection. Pelvic inflammatory disease is not always treated with antibiotics, and few patients with pelvic inflammatory disease are admitted to the hospital. HIV testing was almost never done. Further study is necessary to explain these disparities and optimize care.

Acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Erythromycin lactobionate for injection, USP followed by erythromycin stearate or erythromycin base orally, as an alternative drug in treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrhoeae in female patients with a history of sensitivity to penicillin.

Before treatment of gonorrhea, patients who are suspected of also having syphilis should have a microscopic examination for T. pallidum (by immunofluorescence or darkfield) before receiving erythromycin and monthly serologic tests for a minimum of 4 months thereafter.

Legionnaires' Disease caused by Legionella pneumophila. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, in vitro and limited preliminary clinical data suggest that erythromycin may be effective in treating Legionnaires' Disease.

Prevention of Initial Attacks of Rheumatic Fever

Penicillin is considered by the American Heart Association to be the drug of choice in the prevention of initial attacks of rheumatic fever (treatment of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory tract e.g., tonsillitis, or pharyngitis).1 Erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of penicillin-allergic patients. The therapeutic dose should be administered for ten days.

Prevention of Recurrent Attacks of Rheumatic Fever

Penicillin or sulfonamides are considered by the American Heart Association to be the drugs of choice in the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever. In patients who are allergic to penicillin and sulfonamides, oral erythromycin is recommended by the American Heart Association in the long-term prophylaxis of streptococcal pharyngitis (for the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever).1

### Failure of cefoxitin and doxycycline to eradicate endometrial Mycoplasma genitalium and the consequence for clinical cure of pelvic inflammatory disease [^115QhjTo]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium was first identified in the early 1980s among men with non-gonococcal urethritis. Because this pathogen is extremely difficult to culture, only with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has research into M genitalium pathogenicity progressed. Numerous studies have confirmed the role of M genitalium in drug resistant non-gonococcal urethritis, and some have also linked M genitalium with cervicitisindependent of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Cervicitis is considered a risk factor for progression to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) — the common infection and inflammation of the female upper genital tract, which may lead to major reproductive morbidity including infertility.

Although PID has polymicrobial aetiology, with C trachomatis and/or N gonorrhoeae accounting for approximately a third to a half of cases, up to 70% of PID cases have an unidentified aetiology. Bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms have been associated with PID, and because M genitalium is associated with cervicitisit is reasonable to hypothesise that it also causes PID. Indeed, this organism induces salpingitis in monkeys, causes morphological changes in ciliated fallopian tube cellsand has been detected in fallopian tube tissue in a woman with salpingitis. Whereas studies have associated M genitalium with PID and endometritis, – the efficacy of commonly used PID antimicrobials in treating M genitalium upper genital tract infection is unknown.

### Randomised controlled trial of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial [^112KSmnj]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

†Abdominal pelvic pain with features of PID, which may have responded to antimicrobial therapy, but no record of cervical excitation or uterine or adnexal tenderness; or long standing abdominal pain consistent with endometriosis, but some features of PID — for example, uterine tenderness, and unable to confirm if antimicrobial therapy had a benefit. 1

Rates of pelvic inflammatory disease were examined in the 137 women with chlamydial infection at baseline who were followed up for 12 months. Seven of 74 women in the deferred screening group developed clinical pelvic inflammatory disease (incidence 9.5%, 4.7% to 18.3%). All seven women were tested for C trachomatis at the time pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed and five tested positive. By comparison, only one of 63 (1.6%) screened and treated women positive for chlamydia developed clinical pelvic inflammatory disease (relative risk 0.17, 0.03 to 1.01). Initial treatment for chlamydial infection in this woman was confirmed by telephone but she developed symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease and tested positive for chlamydia 26 weeks after recruitment. On the 12 month questionnaire she reported three sexual partners in the previous year and no use of condoms.

Most cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (79%, 30/38) occurred in women who tested negative for chlamydia at baseline. Chlamydia test results at the time pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed were available for 26 (of 38) women, of whom 16 tested positive for chlamydial infection. Ten of these 16 women were negative for chlamydia at baseline. Seventy per cent (21/30) of women with pelvic inflammatory disease who completed the 12 months' questionnaire reported having had two or more sexual partners during the year. The groups showed a slight imbalance for reported symptoms but similar sexual behaviour during the follow-up period (table 4).

Table 4

Independent testing during follow-up

Overall, 527 (22%) participants reported having been tested independently for chlamydia (figure); 15% (n = 38) of the control women and 10% (n = 27) of the screened women said they tested positive. Those women in the deferred screening group (blind to group allocation and baseline chlamydia status) who were positive for chlamydia at baseline were more likely than those who were negative to report having been tested independently (43%, 29/67 v 24%, 229/968; P < 0.001).

### Chlamydia trachomatis and the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and female infertility: a retrospective cohort study among primary care patients [^115kxiDg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Influence of Repeat Infections

The risk of PID was higher for women with 2 or more positive tests compared with 1 positive test (Table 3). For ectopic pregnancy, risk estimates were in similar directions, although not statistically significant; for female infertility, no such associations were observed (Table 3). However, it should be noted that the number of women who tested CT-negative or CT-positive with ectopic pregnancy (n = 164) or female infertility (n = 114) in these analyses was low.

Table 3.
Associations Between Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, Ectopic Pregnancy, and Infertility and Chlamydia trachomatis Test Status by the Number of Tests

Antibiotic Use

For reasons of power, analyses on antibiotic use were performed only for the outcome PID. For all CT testing status, current antibiotic users had the highest risk of PID (Table 4). In addition, for recent users, the risk of PID increased with a higher number of CT-effective antibiotic prescriptions in the past.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^112bkrrd]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

3.14.1 Assessment of new symptoms after IPAA

Good Practice Recommendation 5. Patients with ongoing symptoms after pouch surgery should have pelvic MRI scan, stool culture and Clostridium difficile assay. Pouchoscopy should be performed to assess the pouch, the pre-pouch ileum and the mucosa at the anal transition zone (Agreement: 100%).

Up to 50% of patients will develop pouchitis at some time after IPAA (as many as 40% in the first year). Typical symptoms of pouchitis include increased bowel frequency, urgency, nocturnal seepage or incontinence, pelvic discomfort and abdominal cramps (table 6). Diagnosis is based on the presence of symptoms in conjunction with endoscopic appearance and histology to rule out other conditions. Patients who develop symptoms may not have pouchitis: post-surgical complications should be considered particularly within the first year after surgery. This can be due to fistula development, pelvic sepsis and anatomical problems related to pouch construction (for instance, long cuffs with flutter valve effects or mechanical causes of poor pouch emptying). A study in 68 patients with antibiotic-dependent or refractory primary idiopathic pouchitis, who had had both pouchoscopy and pelvic MRI, showed that 38% had chronic peri-pouch sepsis. Those with sepsis more often had inflammation in the upper pouch only, and although some had a collection that could be drained radiologically, outcomes were poor with most remaining on long-term antibiotics and nearly a third having a defunctioning stoma or pouch excision. In patients with chronic pouchitis 20%–30% have secondary causes for their symptoms, which include CMV infection, Candida, Clostridium difficile, ischaemia, autoimmune disorder, or damage from radiotherapy, chemotherapy or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A proportion may have Crohn's disease, with reported frequency ranging from 3.6%–13%.

### Clinical predictors of endometritis in women with symptoms and signs of pelvic inflammatory disease [^1125oUuJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Careful detection and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease are essential for the prevention of adverse sequelae. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of clinical criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease.

Study Design

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline characteristics of 651 patients enrolled in a multicenter randomized treatment trial for pelvic inflammatory disease. Clinical and laboratory findings were recorded for all patients, and endometrial sampling was performed. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and performed receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and multivariate logistic regression, using histologic endometritis as the criterion standard.

Results

The minimal criteria for pelvic inflammatory disease, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had a sensitivity of 83%, in comparison with a 95% sensitivity for adnexal tenderness (P = .001). Of the supportive clinical criteria, the finding most highly associated with endometritis was a positive test result for Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adjusted odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.89–6.63). A multivariate logistic regression model indicated that combinations of criteria significantly improve the prediction of endometritis.

Conclusion

Sensitivity can be maximized by using the presence of adnexal tenderness as a minimal criterion for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, and supportive criteria are helpful in estimating the probability of endometritis.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^117BCdzw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment

PID treatment regimens should provide empiric, broad-spectrum coverage of likely pathogens. Multiple parenteral and oral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials with short-term follow-up. However, only a limited number of studies have assessed and compared these regimens with regard to infection elimination in the endometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence of long-term complications (e.g. tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy) after antimicrobial regimens. The optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of early treatment of women with subclinical PID are unknown. All regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does not rule out upper genital tract infection. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the upper genital tract of women who have PID, and data from in vitro studies have revealed that some anaerobes (e.g. Bacteroides fragilis) can cause tubal and epithelial destruction. BV is often present among women who have PID. Addition of metronidazole to IM or oral PID regimens more effectively eradicates anaerobic organisms from the upper genital tract. Until treatment regimens that do not cover anaerobic microbes have been demonstrated to prevent long-term sequelae (e.g. infertility and ectopic pregnancy) as successfully as the regimens that are effective against these microbes, using regimens with anaerobic activity should be considered. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made because prevention of long-term sequelae is dependent on early administration of recommended antimicrobials. For women with PID of mild or moderate clinical severity, parenteral and oral regimens appear to have similar efficacy. The decision of whether hospitalization is necessary should be based on provider judgment and whether the woman meets any of the following criteria:

Surgical emergencies (e.g. appendicitis) cannot be excluded
Tubo-ovarian abscess
Pregnancy
Severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or oral temperature > 38.5°C (101°F)
Unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen
No clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy

No evidence is available to indicate that adolescents have improved outcomes from hospitalization for treatment of PID, and the clinical response to outpatient treatment is similar among younger and older women. The decision to hospitalize adolescents with acute PID should be based on the same criteria used for older women.

### Efficacy of a technology-enhanced community health nursing intervention vs standard of care for female adolescents and young adults with pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized clinical trial [^1136CYG7]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

The use of technology as a part of the TECH-N design to support intervention patients is also in line with the notion of reaching adolescents where they are. National data demonstrate that 95% of adolescents have a smartphone and are online almost constantly. Furthermore, study findings suggest that the digital divide has closed for low-income urban youth owing to smartphone access. Only 3% of intervention participants required a study-provided mobile phone at enrollment. Technology access via a mobile phone is consistent with our prior research demonstrating that more than 95% of sexually active adolescent and young adult women have access to mobile phones with text messaging and internet access. This work provides information for the potential development of interventions that leverage technology for care management and decision support for serious conditions for which confidentiality and personalized support are essential.

Pelvic inflammatory disease is a common condition that can affect the reproductive health trajectory of female adolescents and young adults. There has been a shift in the CDC guidelines over time to deliver care to youth with mild to moderate disease in outpatient settings in response to the outcomes from the PEACH trial. Although patients were captive in the hospital during the PEACH trial, inpatient care did not include individualized risk-reduction counseling for STIs, HIV infection, and pregnancy using evidence-based approaches and it did not account for most care being self-provided in the outpatient setting. To our knowledge, this was the first intervention trial designed to improve key adherence measures and health outcomes for female adolescents and young adults in the outpatient setting.

Treatment of PID requires a complex set of behaviors to ensure not only that the patient and her sexual partner are adequately treated but also that future behavior is appropriately managed, with careful sex partner selection and condom negotiation behaviors. Although this single intervention was not able to adequately address all the required behavioral changes for patients, participation in the TECH-N intervention significantly increased the receipt of the CDC-recommended short-term clinical follow-up care and reduced the rate of acquisition for N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis infection, 2 key organisms associated with PID and its sequelae. Given that the recommendation for follow-up care in the office within 72 hours is standard practice, these data suggest that community health nursing may be a more effective strategy for actual care delivery; less than 20% of the control participants sought the recommended short-term clinical services available at no cost to them.

### Tc-99m infecton scan in possible pelvic inflammatory disease [^115NwSx2]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Tc-99m Infecton imaging was used to examine patients thought to have pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) based on clinical and sonographic findings. Twenty-one patients with PID had Tc-99m Infecton scans. Eleven patients underwent a second radionuclide scan after 1 month of antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis of PID was confirmed by laparoscopy in one patient who was later found to have a tubercular infection. In the remaining patients, the diagnosis was based on uterine tenderness, fever and lower abdominal pain that responded to antibiotics, and ultrasound findings. These patients had infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, the cul-de-sac, or all of these. The Tc-99m Infecton scan appears to be useful in the diagnosis of possible PID and is recommended after a complete course of antibiotics for monitoring treatment response.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114UE1mX]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommended Regimens if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is Available
If macrolide sensitive: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin 1 g orally initial dose, followed by 500 mg orally once daily for 3 additional days (2.5 g total)
If macrolide resistant: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days
Recommended Regimen if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is Not Available
If M. genitalium is detected by an FDA-cleared NAAT: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days

Although the majority of M. genitalium strains are sensitive to moxifloxacin, resistance has been reported, and adverse side effects and cost should be considered with this regimen. In settings without access to resistance testing and when moxifloxacin cannot be used, an alternative regimen can be considered, based on limited data: doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin (1 g orally on day 1 followed by 500 mg once daily for 3 days) and a test of cure 21 days after completion of therapy. Because of the high prevalence of macrolide resistance and high likelihood of treatment failure, this regimen should be used only when a test of cure is possible, and no other alternatives exist. If symptomatic treatment failure or a positive test of cure occurs after this regimen, expert consultation is recommended. Data are limited regarding use of minocycline in instances of treatment failure.

Recommended PID treatment regimens are not effective against M. genitalium. Initial empiric therapy for PID, which includes doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days, should be provided at the time of presentation for care. If M. genitalium is detected, a regimen of moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days has been effective in eradicating the organism. Nevertheless, no data have been published that assess the benefits of testing women with PID for M. genitalium, and the importance of directing treatment against this organism is unknown.

Follow-Up

Test of cure is not recommended for asymptomatic persons who received treatment with a recommended regimen. In settings in which M. genitalium testing is available, persons with persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or PID accompanied by detection of M. genitalium should be treated with moxifloxacin.
