## Question

A 52-year-old woman with a history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) achieved remission one year ago after induction therapy with cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance therapy with azathioprine. She has not received rituximab previously. She now presents with new-onset hematuria, rising creatinine, and pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, consistent with a severe relapse of GPA. Her physician is considering options for reinduction of remission.

According to current guidelines, which immunosuppressive agent should be considered for reinduction of remission in this patient, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which immunosuppressive agent should be used for reinduction of remission in a 52-year-old woman with severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) relapse who is not on rituximab maintenance, and why that choice is supported by guidelines and evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and whether this represents severe, organ-threatening relapse. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (ACR/VF 2021, EULAR 2022/2024, KDIGO 2024) recommend for reinduction in relapsing GPA not on rituximab. Next, I will examine the comparative evidence base, especially RAVE subgroup analyses and RITAZAREM, and weigh rituximab against cyclophosphamide. After that, I need to consider toxicity trade-offs, particularly cumulative cyclophosphamide exposure. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with dosing and monitoring considerations, and confirm any exceptions or caveats that could alter the choice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: new hematuria, rising creatinine, and pulmonary infiltrates in a patient with prior GPA constitute severe, organ-threatening relapse involving kidney and lung, and she is not currently receiving rituximab maintenance, which places her in the guideline subgroup where rituximab is preferred for reinduction [^113LPdyg] [^113bjonc].

> Next, I should review authoritative recommendations. The 2021 ACR/VF guideline conditionally recommends rituximab over cyclophosphamide for reinduction in patients with GPA/MPA relapse with severe manifestations who are not on rituximab maintenance, citing superior efficacy in relapsing disease and concerns about cumulative cyclophosphamide toxicity with repeated exposures [^113LPdyg] [^113bjonc]. EULAR 2022/2024 similarly recommends corticosteroids plus either rituximab or cyclophosphamide for relapsing GPA, with a preference for rituximab when available, aligning with the same safety-efficacy balance [^1134iBwb] [^1134iBwb]. KDIGO 2024 explicitly recommends reinduction with rituximab as first choice in relapsing AAV, again emphasizing avoidance of repeated cyclophosphamide when possible [^117LpdGo] [^113dcTud].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the evidence base supporting rituximab in relapsing disease. Post hoc analyses of RAVE showed higher odds of remission with rituximab in relapsing patients, particularly those with PR3-ANCA, and this advantage persisted at 6, 12, and 18 months in some analyses, which strengthens the case in relapsing GPA where PR3 predominance is common [^111tZUCX]. RITAZAREM demonstrated very high remission rates (> 90% by 4 months) with rituximab reinduction in relapsing GPA/MPA, supporting both efficacy and speed of response in this setting [^111NVtmX] [^113dcTud]. Observational comparative effectiveness data also suggest rituximab achieves remission more frequently than cyclophosphamide in GPA, reinforcing the clinical impression from trials and guidelines [^116XuinV] [^113GH12y].

> I need to check toxicity considerations that could tilt the balance. Repeated cyclophosphamide exposure increases risks of malignancy, infertility, and hemorrhagic cystitis; KDIGO highlights cumulative doses above 36 g as associated with malignancy, and ACR/VF notes rising risks with repeated courses, which is directly relevant if the patient already had cyclophosphamide in the prior induction year [^113dcTud] [^113bjonc]. Rituximab, while not risk-free, avoids alkylator toxicity and is generally favored when re-treatment is needed, particularly in relapsing disease where repeated cyclophosphamide would compound cumulative harm [^113bjonc] [^117LpdGo].

> Let me consider dosing and practical implementation. Standard rituximab induction regimens are either 375 mg/m² weekly for 4 weeks or 1,000 mg on days 1 and 15; both are guideline-accepted and equally reasonable, with the choice often guided by logistics and patient preference, and both should be paired with appropriate glucocorticoid induction and taper [^113Cw4CR] [^1167hc57]. I should confirm that rituximab is given with premedication and that infection risk mitigation is addressed, including vaccination updates and prophylaxis where indicated, given the immunosuppressive context of relapse treatment [^1167hc57].

> But wait, what if there are exceptions? I should double-check scenarios where cyclophosphamide might still be chosen despite the general preference for rituximab. If rituximab is contraindicated or unavailable, or if there is a compelling reason to avoid B-cell depletion, cyclophosphamide remains an acceptable alternative per EULAR and KDIGO, though the threshold to reuse cyclophosphamide should be higher when prior cumulative exposure is substantial [^1134iBwb] [^117Psumh]. Conversely, if the patient were already on rituximab maintenance and relapsed, guidelines would favor switching to cyclophosphamide rather than repeating rituximab, which is not the case here, but I should keep that distinction clear to avoid misapplication [^1129STKd] [^114ZrHbT].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. For a 52-year-old with severe GPA relapse not on rituximab, current high-quality guidelines and supportive evidence converge on rituximab as the preferred reinduction agent to be used with glucocorticoids, given superior efficacy in relapsing disease and a more favorable toxicity profile with repeated use compared with cyclophosphamide, which should be reserved for rituximab contraindications or special circumstances [^113LPdyg] [^1134iBwb] [^117LpdGo] [^113dcTud].

---

For a 52-year-old woman with severe GPA relapse (hematuria, rising creatinine, pulmonary infiltrates) who is not on rituximab maintenance, **rituximab is the preferred reinduction agent** [^113LPdyg] because it achieves higher remission rates than cyclophosphamide in relapsing disease [^111tZUCX] and avoids cumulative cyclophosphamide toxicity [^113bjonc]. Rituximab should be combined with glucocorticoids [^1134iBwb], and cyclophosphamide is reserved for rituximab contraindications or intolerance [^117Psumh].

---

## Evidence supporting rituximab for reinduction

- **Superior efficacy in relapsing disease**: Rituximab is superior to cyclophosphamide for induction in relapsing GPA/MPA, with higher remission rates and sustained B-cell depletion [^111tZUCX] [^113dcTud].

- **RITAZAREM trial**: In 187 relapsing GPA/MPA patients, rituximab reinduction achieved > 90% remission by 4 months, supporting its use in severe relapse [^111NVtmX] [^113dcTud].

- **RAVE subgroup analysis**: Rituximab outperformed cyclophosphamide in PR3-ANCA patients, who have higher relapse risk [^111tZUCX].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Cumulative cyclophosphamide toxicity**: Repeated cyclophosphamide exposure increases malignancy and infertility risks; rituximab avoids these [^113bjonc] [^113dcTud].

- **Infection risk**: Rituximab carries infection risk, but serious infection rates are comparable to cyclophosphamide in trials [^111tZUCX].

- **Hypogammaglobulinemia**: Monitor IgG and consider IVIG if recurrent severe infections occur on rituximab [^113nuUiG].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation for relapse reinduction** |
|-|-|
| ACR/VF 2021 | Rituximab preferred over cyclophosphamide for severe relapse not on rituximab maintenance [^113LPdyg] [^113bjonc] |
| EULAR 2022/2024 | Rituximab or cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids; rituximab preferred when available [^1134iBwb] [^113H7kfB] |
| KDIGO 2024 | Reinduce with rituximab or cyclophosphamide; rituximab preferred [^117LpdGo] [^117Psumh] |

---

## Clinical scenario-specific considerations

In this patient, **severe renal and pulmonary involvement** warrants rapid, effective reinduction; rituximab achieves high remission rates by 4 months in RITAZAREM [^111NVtmX]. She has **no prior rituximab exposure**, so there is no concern for prior B-cell depletion or hypogammaglobulinemia. Given prior cyclophosphamide exposure, **avoiding further alkylator toxicity** is prudent [^113bjonc].

---

## Alternative options and when to consider them

Cyclophosphamide is reserved for **rituximab contraindications** (e.g. hypersensitivity, active infection) or intolerance. Plasma exchange is not routinely recommended for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or severe glomerulonephritis without supportive evidence [^116fyqQQ]. Avacopan may be added to rituximab or cyclophosphamide in severe disease to enable glucocorticoid sparing [^116FhRwA].

---

## Practical implementation and monitoring

- **Rituximab dosing**: 375 mg/m² weekly × 4 or 1,000 mg on days 1 and 15; both regimens are effective [^113Cw4CR].

- **Glucocorticoids**: Combine with high-dose corticosteroids and taper per guideline protocols [^116fyqQQ].

- **Monitoring**: Track renal function, pulmonary status, IgG, and infection surveillance during therapy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Rituximab is the **preferred reinduction agent** for this patient with severe GPA relapse not on rituximab maintenance, given superior efficacy in relapsing disease and a safer long-term toxicity profile than repeated cyclophosphamide. Use rituximab with glucocorticoids and monitor closely for response and adverse effects [^113LPdyg] [^1134iBwb].

When considering cyclophosphamide reuse, cumulative dose should be considered and cumulative doses above 36 g have been associated with the occurrence of malignancies. Comparative data note higher remission rates with rituximab in relapsing patients versus cyclophosphamide, especially for PR3-AAV, and in RITAZAREM induction of 187 patients with relapsing GPA/microscopic polyangiitis there was a high rate of remission, > 90% by 4 months. For non-severe relapses, immunosuppression should be increased while avoiding cyclophosphamide; apart from MMF with RCT data, there is no strong evidence to support other regimens, and if non-severe relapses are treated with MMF there is an increased rate of future relapse with greater glucocorticoid exposure; therefore, in the current guideline, rituximab is preferred.

### NCT02807103 | Rituximab in eosinophilic granulomatosis… [^115wmuc5]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Study Overview Phase III, comparative, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind and superiority research, comparing rituximab-based regimen with conventional therapeutic strategy for the induction of remission in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing EGPA will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to receive: Systemic vasculitides are inflammatory diseases of blood vessels, among which anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody -associated vasculitides are often severe with life-threatening manifestations or complications. AAV include granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Cytotoxic drugs and glucocorticoids have been the standard of care for remission induction for nearly five decades.

This regimen improved the outcome of severe AAV from death to a strong likelihood of disease control and temporary remission. However, a remission is not obtained in all patients with this combination of drugs, and most patients experience disease flares requiring repeated treatment with associated significant morbidity and mortality. In 2 prospective controlled trials, rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was shown to be non inferior to cyclophosphamide to induce remission with an acceptable safety profile in patients with systemic GPA and MPA. However, patients with EGPA were not included in these trials and rituximab has not been evaluated prospectively to induce remission in this disease which pathogenesis is complex and not only restricted to ANCA responsibility.

In patients with EGPA, overall survival is good when treatment is stratified according to prognostic factors but long-term outcome is not so good since relapses occur in more than 40% of patients, leading to high cumulative morbidity and damage. In small retrospective studies, rituximab seems promising as a remission-induction agent in patients with EGPA, independently from the ANCA status. The trial detailed here is the first prospective trial evaluating rituximab as induction-remission treatment for EGPA.

ANCA vasculitis — treatment of relapse states to treat severe relapse according to the same initial-therapy guidelines (1C) and to treat other relapses by reinstituting or increasing non–cyclophosphamide immunosuppression, including instituting or increasing corticosteroids with or without azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (2C). The commentary adds that "rituximab may be more effective than cyclophosphamide for remission induction in patients with relapsing disease", that "another reason to favor rituximab… would be reduction in cyclophosphamide exposure and side effects", that "cyclophosphamide generally should not be used for remission induction in selected patients with nonsevere disease", that "limited data with azathioprine for remission induction… did not support efficacy", that "we recommend use of combined therapy as use of corticosteroids alone have not been effective… for active granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis", and that "methotrexate can also be used for remission induction of nonsevere relapses in patients without contraindications".

### Rituximab vs cyclophosphamide induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^116XuinV]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is rituximab more effective than cyclophosphamide for treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)?

Findings

In this comparativeness effectiveness study based on clinical data from 194 patients with GPA, rituximab as induction therapy was associated with significantly more achievement of remission with a prednisone dose of 10 mg/d or less compared with cyclophosphamide. Rare disease registries and comparative effectiveness studies enable hitherto poorly addressed treatment comparisons for such entities.

Meaning

These findings may inform clinical decision-making regarding the choice of remission-inducing regimen for patients with GPA.

### Mycophenolate mofetil to treat wegener's granulomatosis and… [^114x1xBS]. ClinicalTrials (1999). Low credibility.

Mycophenolate Mofetil to Treat Wegener's Granulomatosis and Related Vascular Inflammatory ConditionsClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of the drug mycophenolate mofetil in treating Wegener's granulomatosis and related inflammatory vessel diseases. Blood vessel inflammation in these patients may involve different parts of the body, including the brain, nerves, eyes, sinuses, lungs, kidneys, intestinal tract, skin, joints, heart, and other sites. The more severe the involvement, the more likely the disease will be life-threatening. Standard treatment consists of combination drug therapy with prednisone and a cytotoxic agent-usually cyclophosphamide or methotrexate. However, some patients in whom this treatment is initially successful have a disease relapse; other patients cannot take the medications because of other health problems or because of severe side effects of the drugs.

MPM is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to prevent kidney transplant rejection. It is chemically similar to another cytotoxic drug called azathioprine, which has been beneficial in maintaining remission in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis who have been treated successfully with cyclophosphamide. Because MPM is more effective than azathioprine in preventing organ rejection, it may also prove beneficial as a second-line treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis. Patients with Wegener's granulomatosis or related inflammatory vessel diseases who have had a relapse following treatment with cyclophosphamide and methotrexate or who cannot take one or both of these drugs may be eligible for this study. Only patients who have been treated at NIH in the methotrexate protocol or the cyclophosphamide switching to methotrexate protocol, or who have received the exact same treatment from their own physician may participate.

Participants will have a complete medical evaluation including laboratory studies. Consultations, X-rays and biopsies of affected organs may also be done if indicated for diagnosis or treatment. Patients with active disease will be given MPM and prednisone, both in tablet form. Patients with inactive disease will receive only prednisone if they are already taking it. In both cases, the prednisone will be reduced gradually and discontinued if the disease improves significantly. MPM therapy will continue for at least 2 years. If after 2 years the disease remains in remission, the MPM dose will be gradually reduced and then stopped. If active disease recurs while on MPM therapy, the treatment plan will likely be changed. The new regimen will be determined by the severity of disease, other medical conditions, and history of side effects to previous medications.

Patients will be followed at the NIH clinic every month for the first 3 months on MPM and then every 3 months for another 18 months. Those whose disease has remained in remission and have stopped all medications will then be followed every 6 months for 4 visits. The follow-up visits will include a physical examination, blood draws, and, if needed, X-rays. Visits may be scheduled more frequently if medically indicated. Drug: Mycophenolate Mofetil

### Long-term maintenance of remission with spacing of rituximab infusions based on the individualised patient risk profile in ANCA-associated vasculitis: a pilot study [^114bHFYc]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

We designed a prospective, risk-adapted, pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and the potential risks/benefits of tailored RTX regimen for patients with AAV beyond the standard 18-month fixed schedule of 6-monthly RTX infusions.

Patients with GPA and MPA who completed 18 months of RTX maintenance (500 mg, four doses, 6 months apart) at Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, were stratified into risk categories for relapse and assigned to tailored continuation regimens. Risk stratification was based on clinical and serological factors potentially associated with relapses, such as a history of previous severe relapses, anti-proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA positivity and GPA phenotype. High-risk patients, defined as those with a history of organ-threatening or life-threatening relapses requiring reinduction with cyclophosphamide or RTX, continued 6-monthly RTX (RTX6m). Intermediate-risk patients, defined as GPA and/or PR3-ANCA-positive cases without prior organ-threatening or life-threatening relapses, received spaced 12-monthly RTX (RTX12m). Low-risk patients, primarily anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive MPA patients without previous organ-threatening or life-threatening relapses, were switched to another immunosuppressant (IS). Patients were prospectively observed for 24 months after treatment allocation. For patients developing new, severe hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG < 300 mg/dL), the decision to continue RTX was made on a case-by-case basis, balancing the risk of relapse against that of severe/recurrent infections. Primary outcome: percentage of patients experiencing disease relapse during follow-up. Relapse was defined as the reappearance/worsening of AAV symptoms requiring therapeutic intensification. Secondary outcome: percentage of patients developing severe infections requiring hospitalisation and/or intravenous antimicrobial treatment, and hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG < 500 mg/dL).

### Relapses and serious adverse events during rituximab maintenance therapy in ANCA-associated vasculitis: a multicentre retrospective study [^111KW2XC]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (ΜPA) are subgroups of ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) characterized by necrotizing inflammation of small to medium vessels in multiple organs with vasculitic and/or granulomatous manifestations. The advancements in therapeutic strategies for GPA and MPA have improved their short-term prognosis, transforming them from acute and life-threatening, to chronic diseases with a remitting–relapsing course.

Despite the successful control of active disease with induction regimens, up to 50% of AAV patients will relapse, even during maintenance therapy. Relapses may require further exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) and prolonged immunosuppressive medication, which in turn contribute to toxicity and infection risk, leading to accruing disease-/treatment-related damage. Evidence from heterogeneous AAV cohorts suggests various predictors of relapse, such as serological (PR3-ANCA positivity or ANCA-levels rise) and clinical (GPA, better kidney function) features. Additionally, the agents used to induce and/or maintain remission and the duration of remission maintenance therapy have been associated with the relapse risk.

Rituximab (RTX) is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes autoreactive B cells, which are crucial mediators in AAV pathogenesis, but not bone marrow B cell precursors and long-lived plasma cells in inflamed tissues, which probably explains the repopulation of the peripheral B cell compartment and the persistent Ig production. RTX has been proven non-inferior to CYC for remission induction in GPA/MPA, and is now recommended as the first choice for remission maintenance. Real-life data assessing the efficacy and safety of RTX maintenance therapy are limited.

Herein, we aimed to estimate the incidence and risk factors for relapses, as well for serious adverse events (SAEs) during RTX maintenance in GPA/MPA patients after complete remission has been achieved.

### Might maintenance therapy be discontinued once clinical remission is achieved in ANCA-associated vasculitis? [^112n6jak]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) encompasses a group of rare, multisystem autoimmune disorders characterised by the occurrence of inflammation and damage to small blood vessels, leading to a wide range of clinical manifestations. They include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Outcomes for patients with MPA and GPA have been transformed over recent years. However, the establishment of effective maintenance therapy aiming to balance the risks of disease relapse with those related to prolonged immunosuppression has become a clinical priority. This review aims to explore two differing perspectives on this unsolved problem. Pros and Cons of the following approaches will be discussed: "Biomarker-guided personalised approach on top of generic maintenance strategy guidelines" or "ANCA specificity-related personalised maintenance treatment after intensive B-cell depletion"?

### Rituximab vs cyclophosphamide induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^113GH12y]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Results of randomized clinical trials have demonstrated rituximab's noninferiority to cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV), with neither treatment having a specific advantage for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). However, post hoc analysis results have suggested that rituximab might be more effective than cyclophosphamide in inducing remission in patients with proteinase 3-positive AAV.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of rituximab and cyclophosphamide in inducing GPA remission in a large population of unselected patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This comparative effectiveness study used multicenter target trial emulation observational data from 32 French hospitals in the French Vasculitis Study Group Registry. Groups were determined according to treatments received, without any intervention from the investigators. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to correct for baseline imbalance between groups. Participants included patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GPA who satisfied American College of Rheumatology classification criteria and/or Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022.

Exposures

At least 1 infusion of rituximab or cyclophosphamide for induction therapy between April 1, 2008, and April 1, 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was remission rate at month 6(± 2 months), with remission defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) of0 and prednisone dose of 10 mg/d or less. The BVAS is a validated tool for small-vessel vasculitis and used to assess the level of disease activity, with a numerical weight attached to each involved organ system. The BVAS has a range of 0 to 63 points; a score of 0 indicates no disease activity. Subgroup analyses included the primary outcome for patients with a new diagnosis, for most recently treated patients, and for patients with myeloperoxidase-ANCA positivity.

Results

Among 194 patients with GPA included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 54 [15] years; 110 men [56.7%]), 165 (85.1%) had a new diagnosis, and 147 of 182 with data available (80.8%) had proteinase 3-ANCA positivity. Sixty-one patients received rituximab and 133 received cyclophosphamide for induction therapy. In the weighted analysis, the primary outcome was reached for 73.1% of patients receiving rituximab vs 40.1% receiving cyclophosphamide (relative risk [RR], 1.82 [95% CI, 1.22–2.73]; risk difference, 33.0% [95% CI, 12.2%-53.8%]; E value for RR, 3.05). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of patients with newly diagnosed GPA and those with a more recent treatment. In the subset of 27 patients with myeloperoxidase-ANCA-positive GPA, 8 of 10 rituximab recipients and 8 of 17 cyclophosphamide recipients met the primary end point (unweighted RR, 1.73 [95% CI, 0.96–3.11]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this comparativeness effectiveness study using clinical data, rituximab induction therapy for GPA was more frequently associated with remission than cyclophosphamide. These results inform clinical decision-making concerning the choice of remission induction therapy for this subset of patients with AAV.

### Update on maintenance therapy for granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^116UZevb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides are a group of rare systemic diseases. The past several years have seen major therapeutic advances in the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). The success rate in induction of remission is high, but reducing the high incidence of relapses remains a therapeutic challenge.

Recent Findings

Studies have shown no improvement in relapse rates in GPA and MPA over the past 2 decades. This has prompted a recent focus on therapeutic strategies to maintain remission in these relapsing diseases. Low-dose rituximab (RTX) at fixed intervals has been shown superior to azathioprine for maintenance of remission. Despite this advance, longer follow-up periods have shown late-stage relapses with withdrawal of therapy suggesting a possible need for longer treatment regimens. Evaluation of prognostic indicators is also helpful in stratifying patients who might be more likely to relapse or to respond to a particular therapy.

Summary

Results from recent research have significantly advanced our approach to prevention of relapses in GPA and MPA. Newer maintenance agents have shown benefit in maintenance of remission and relapse-free survival.

### Rituximab vs cyclophosphamide induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^112kaWGp]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Our small number of patients with relapsing GPA prescribed cyclophosphamide induction treatment post relapse may be attributed to the known lower cyclophosphamide efficacy to induce AAV remission in such patients found in the pivotal trial. The higher remission rate among rituximab recipients was not owing to more of them having relapsing disease. Our analysis confirmed that remission rate remained significantly higher for rituximab recipients than cyclophosphamide recipients when the analysis was restricted to those with newly diagnosed GPA, a finding not yet reported.

Between-group differences in the numbers of patients achieving 6-month BVAS of 0 at any glucocorticoid dose was not observed, which might be attributed to residual vasculitis activity that was undetectable because of glucocorticoid masking. It may be easier to demonstrate treatment efficacy by including the glucocorticoid dose in the definition of the primary end point, as recommended, rather than using the BVAS alone. The absence of differences for patients with MPO-GPA may only reflect the small sample size. Although secondary outcome analysis results also gave the advantage to rituximab over cyclophosphamide, the data are unclear because more recipients of rituximab induction treatment also received rituximab maintenance therapy, known to be more effective. No toxicity signals were observed in either group.

### Rituximab with or without a conventional maintenance agent in the treatment of relapsing granulomatosis with polyangiitis (wegener' s): a retrospective single-center study [^113m88pz]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab (RTX) induction therapy and the duration of remission, when RTX is used with or without a conventional maintenance agent, in a cohort of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) (GPA).

Methods

This was a retrospective, single-center study of patients with relapsing GPA treated with at least 1 course of RTX (4 weekly doses of 375 mg/m² intravenously [IV] or 2 fixed doses of 1,000 mg IV 2 weeks apart). Complete remission was defined as the absence of disease activity measured by a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener's granulomatosis of 0 and not qualified by the prednisone dosage at the time.

Results

Eighty-nine patients achieved remission after their first course of RTX and were not re-treated preemptively with RTX to maintain remission of their disease during followup. Among these patients, relapse-free survival was significantly higher in those who received a conventional maintenance agent (azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil) in conjunction with RTX and glucocorticoids (n = 47) than in those who received no additional immunosuppressive agent (n = 42) (P = 0.04). The hazard ratio of relapse in those receiving a maintenance agent was 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.29–0.97). Serious adverse events did not differ between the 2 groups. Within a subset of 15 patients in the cohort who were relapse free 2 years after 1 course of RTX, remissions endured for 2–6 years in 8 patients.

Conclusion

RTX is an effective remission-inducing agent in GPA. The addition of a conventional maintenance agent to RTX and glucocorticoids decreased the incidence of relapse and did not result in a higher incidence of adverse events.

### Rituximab vs cyclophosphamide induction therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^116BaKxq]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitides (AAVs) are potentially life-threatening and commonly relapsing diseases in which necrotizing vasculitis predominantly affects small-to-medium vessels. Among AAVs, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is characterized by granulomatous inflammation, usually involving the upper and lower respiratory tract, with frequent necrotizing glomerulonephritis, and with ANCA-targeting proteinase 3 (PR3) in most patients with active disease. Remission induction treatment of new-onset organ-threatening or life-threatening AAV usually combines glucocorticoids with cyclophosphamide or rituximab.

The diagnosis of GPA as opposed to microscopic polyangiitis is associated with a lower probability of achieving complete remission — defined as no evidence of clinical disease activity while not receiving glucocorticoid treatment — and a higher risk of relapse. Similarly, PR3-ANCA positivity as opposed to myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA positivity is independently associated with a higher risk of relapse.

Results of randomized clinical trials, showed rituximab's noninferiority to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in severe AAVs, with neither treatment having a specific advantage for GPA in adjusted analyses. However, post hoc analysis of the trial datashowed that rituximab-treated patients with PR3-AAV achieved complete remission at 6 months more frequently than cyclophosphamide-treated patients. Trial limitations included the enrollment of patients with GPA or microscopic polyangiitis, who might need to be studied separately; small sample size owing to the rarity of those AAVs; and highly selected patients with minor comorbidities that precluded generalization. For those reasons, registry data are useful to complement data from randomized clinical trials to investigate the external validity of drugs prescribed in routine practice. Thus, it remains to be established whether rituximab is more effective than cyclophosphamide at specifically achieving GPA remission. The objective of this study was to undertake an emulation target trial using observational data to compare rituximab vs cyclophosphamide efficacies at inducing remission in a large number of unselected patients with GPA.

Discussion

In this large, real-life study of GPA/MPA patients who received RTX maintenance therapy, relapses occurred in about one-quarter of patients, mostly within the first 2 years of treatment. Kidney involvement, prior induction with RTX + CYC combination and earlier complete remission were associated with a decreased relapse risk.

In our cohort, 24% of GPA/MPA patients relapsed (IR: 10.2/100 patient-years), mainly in the first 2 years from RTX maintenance initiation (76%). At year 2, the relapse rate was 20%, which is slightly higher than that in core RTX maintenance trials (10–16%). In the MAINRITSAN and MAINRITSAN2 trials, the relapse rates up to month 28 were 10% and 16%, respectively, whereas in the RITAZAREM trial (relapsed GPA/MPA patients treated with RTX 1000 mg every 4 months) the respective rate was 15%. Similarly, in small observational AAV studies with patients who had received RTX induction followed by RTX maintenance, 12–13% of patients relapsed during RTX maintenance. However, the above studies differ in terms of relapse and remission definitions, and so comparisons should be made cautiously.

Most relapses were major, involving the lungs, followed by the kidney and ENT. In the majority of cases, these were managed with RTX reinduction followed by RTX maintenance, without subsequent relapses. The role of reinduction with RTX has been evaluated in the RITAZAREM trial of 170 relapsing GPA/MPA patients (who had previously achieved remission with various agents, including RTX) who received reinduction therapy with RTX followed by RTX or AZA remission maintenance therapy. RTX was superior to AZA in preventing relapses during the maintenance phase (15% vs 38%, respectively).

Patients who experienced minor relapses (mainly arthritis/arthralgias) were managed either with the addition of GCs/MTX or continued the RTX maintenance scheme. Almost all patients achieved complete remission; however, about two-thirds of them relapsed during RTX maintenance therapy. Miloslavsky et al. in analysing a subgroup of the RAVE trial with 44 GPA/MPA patients, also observed that the treatment of non-severe relapses with an increase in GCs restored remission in most of the cases (80%), but that the majority (70%) experienced a subsequent relapse shortly after, during the following AZA maintenance period. Experimental studies are needed to support the optimal strategy for the management of minor relapses.

Maintenance treatment with rituximab

Several RCTs on the use of RTX for remission maintenance have been published since the 2016 EULAR recommendations for AAV.

In the RITAZAREM trial (table 7), patients with relapsing GPA or MPA received remission induction treatment with RTX and GC. Those achieving disease control by month 4 were randomised to receive maintenance treatment with either 1000 mg RTX at months 4, 8, 12, 16 or AZA (and standardised GC tapering). The SLR identified preliminary data (published as abstract only) but the full publication became recently available. The trial results demonstrate relapse risk to be significantly lower in the RTX compared with the AZA group. This supports the findings of the MAINRITSAN trial comparing RTX for 18 months and AZA for 22 months for remission maintenance treatment after induction treatment with CYC and GC. The MAINRITSAN trial reported RTX to be more efficacious than AZA to prevent relapses at 28 months (HR 6.61; 95% CI 1.56 to 27.96; p = 0.002). Major relapse-free survival remained better in the RTX group (71.9%; 95% CI 61.2% to 84.6%) compared with the AZA group (49.4%; 95% CI 38.0% to 64.3%; p = 0.003) at 60 months of follow-up.

### Rituximab in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis… [^112f2idN]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Study Overview Phase III, comparative, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind and superiority research, comparing rituximab-based regimen with conventional therapeutic strategy for the induction of remission in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing EGPA will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to receive: Systemic vasculitides are inflammatory diseases of blood vessels, among which anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody -associated vasculitides are often severe with life-threatening manifestations or complications. AAV include granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Cytotoxic drugs and glucocorticoids have been the standard of care for remission induction for nearly five decades.

This regimen improved the outcome of severe AAV from death to a strong likelihood of disease control and temporary remission. However, a remission is not obtained in all patients with this combination of drugs, and most patients experience disease flares requiring repeated treatment with associated significant morbidity and mortality. In 2 prospective controlled trials, rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, was shown to be non inferior to cyclophosphamide to induce remission with an acceptable safety profile in patients with systemic GPA and MPA. However, patients with EGPA were not included in these trials and rituximab has not been evaluated prospectively to induce remission in this disease which pathogenesis is complex and not only restricted to ANCA responsibility.

In patients with EGPA, overall survival is good when treatment is stratified according to prognostic factors but long-term outcome is not so good since relapses occur in more than 40% of patients, leading to high cumulative morbidity and damage. In small retrospective studies, rituximab seems promising as a remission-induction agent in patients with EGPA, independently from the ANCA status. The trial detailed here is the first prospective trial evaluating rituximab as induction-remission treatment for EGPA.

Remission induction for active, severe granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) — For patients with active, severe GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission induction. Both rituximab and cyclophosphamide, in combination with glucocorticoids, have been used for remission induction in GPA and MPA, and rituximab has been shown to provide similar benefits to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in a randomized controlled trial. Rituximab is considered less toxic than cyclophosphamide and was preferred by the Patient Panel; a single course of cyclophosphamide can carry substantial risks such as neutropenia, bladder injury, and the small but present potential for infertility, and risks of malignancy and infertility increase when repeated courses are used. For adult rituximab dosing, retrospective studies suggest that 375 mg/m² every week for 4 weeks or 1,000 mg on days 1 and 15 are equally efficacious, and the choice between these regimens should be guided by patient preferences and values.

REMISSION-MAINTENANCE TREATMENT

Remission-maintenance treatment is established to prevent relapse and avoid organ damage progression. The main challenge has been to tailor the remission-maintenance regimen to the patients' needs and determine the optimal duration of therapy.

RTX vs AZA

All the panels agree that remission-maintenance treatment should be given to patients with AAV following remission-induction treatment. RTX is the treatment of choice for patients with severe GPA/MPA (and thus AAV-GN) according to the ACR/VF guidelines and EULAR recommendations. In contrast, in the KDIGO guideline, patients might start remission-maintenance treatment with either RTX (without GC) or AZA in association with low GC dose. Nevertheless, the panel felt that the evidence is weighted towards the use of RTX. In severe GPA/MPA, RTX has the best evidence for the maintenance of remission when compared with AZA. In the MAINRITSAN trial, the authors showed lower relapse rates at 28 months in the RTX arm (500 mg on Days 0 and 14, and Months 6, 12 and 18) when compared with AZA. The RITAZAREM trial showed that RTX was efficient in reinducing and maintaining remission in patients with relapsing GPA/MPA. AZA or methotrexate (MTX) (in patients with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) or MMF are viable alternatives for patients in which RTX cannot be used, or in patients with non-severe GPA/MPA. While KDIGO mention a meta-analysis indicating that a longer course of GC may be associated with fewer relapses, all the panels agree that GC tapering should occur as early as possible, accepting that a small number of patients will remain on a low GC dose longer-term. The best strategy for GC tapering in remission-maintenance is under review in The Assessment of Prednisone in Remission Trial (TAPIR) and MAIPENSAN studies.

Summary

RTX is the first-line therapy for remission-maintenance. AZA or MTX (in patients with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or MMF are alternatives in the appropriate context.

### Long-term rituximab use to maintain remission of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: a randomized trial [^115ZsE3H]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Biannual rituximab infusions over 18 months effectively maintain remission after a "standard" remission induction regimen for patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV).

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of prolonged rituximab therapy in preventing AAV relapses in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) who have achieved complete remission after completing an 18-month maintenance regimen.

Design

Randomized controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02433522).

Setting

39 clinical centers in France.

Patients

68 patients with GPA and 29 with MPA who achieved complete remission after the first phase of maintenance therapy.

Intervention

Rituximab or placebo infusion every 6 months for 18 months (4 infusions).

Measurements

The primary end point was relapse-free survival at month 28. Relapse was defined as new or reappearing symptoms or worsening disease, with a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score greater than 0.

Results

From March 2015 to April 2016, 97 patients (mean age, 63.9 years; 35% women) were randomly assigned, 50 to the rituximab and 47 to the placebo group. Relapse-free survival estimates at month 28 were 96% (95% CI, 91% to 100%) and 74% (CI, 63% to 88%) in the rituximab and placebo groups, respectively, an absolute difference of 22% (CI, 9% to 36%) with a hazard ratio of 7.5 (CI, 1.67 to 33.7) (P = 0.008). Major relapse-free survival estimates at month 28 were 100% (CI, 93% to 100%) versus 87% (CI, 78% to 97%) (P = 0.009), respectively. At least 1 serious adverse event developed in 12 patients (24%) in the rituximab group (with 9 infectious serious adverse events occurring among 6 patients [12%]) versus 14 patients (30%) in the placebo group (with 6 infectious serious adverse events developing among 4 patients [9%]). No deaths occurred in either group.

Limitation

Potential selection bias based on previous rituximab response and tolerance.

Conclusion

Extended therapy with biannual rituximab infusions over 18 months was associated with a lower incidence of AAV relapse compared with standard maintenance therapy.

### Score to assess the probability of relapse in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^114hfQbn]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are the two main antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV).GPA and MPA differ in their pathogenesis, genetics and serotypes, but patients with these two types of vasculitis share many clinical features and currently receive similar treatments. A therapeutic strategy combining glucocorticoids (GC) and cyclophosphamide or rituximab to induce remission has dramatically improved survival of AAV in the past decades.

Despite this improvement, maintaining remission in patients with GPA or MPA remains challenging. Relapse occurs in 13.7%–44% of cases at 18–36 months depending on the duration of follow-up, patient characteristics and maintenance treatment. Maintenance therapy with low-dose preemptive rituximab has significantly decreased the risk of relapse in comparison with azathioprine, but relapses still occur after rituximab discontinuation. Long-term follow-up of the MAINRITSAN 1 trial showed that relapse-free survival was 58% at 60 months in patients treated with rituximab 500 mg every 6 months for 18 months. Increasing the duration of azathioprine maintenance therapy from 24 to 48 months has been shown to decrease the risk of relapse and improve renal outcome.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) — remission maintenance after severe disease favors conventional immunosuppressants over rituximab or mepolizumab and individualizes glucocorticoid (GC) duration. After remission with cyclophosphamide therapy, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil is conditionally recommended over rituximab for maintenance; more generally after remission, these same agents are conditionally recommended over mepolizumab for maintenance; and the duration of GC therapy should be guided by the patient's clinical condition, values, and preferences.

### Long-term safety of rituximab in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and in microscopic polyangiitis [^114cpdC7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are 2 forms of systemic vasculitis that affect small to medium‐sized blood vessels and are characterized by the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). If left untreated, GPA and MPA can result in organ damage or death. Serious infections, cardiovascular disease, and malignancy are important causes of morbidity and death in patients with GPA or MPA.

Significance & Innovations

This study reports long‐term safety data following treatment with rituximab in 97 patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) in a prospective observational manner outside of a controlled clinical trial and in a real‐world setting.
In patients with GPA or MPA, long‐term treatment with the anti‐CD20 antibody rituximab was consistent with that of rituximab administered for shorter durations and with rituximab's known safety profile in other autoimmune diseases for which it is approved.
The findings in this study provide clinicians with long‐term, practice‐level safety data for rituximab in the treatment of GPA or MPA.

Prior to regulatory approvals in 2011 for the use of rituximab in combination with glucocorticoids for the treatment of patients with GPA or MPA, the standard‐of‐care treatment (since the 1970s) for severe disease was cyclophosphamide in combination with glucocorticoids. Rituximab is an anti‐CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets and depletes CD20+ B cells and is approved for the treatment of GPA and MPA. Rituximab, in combination with glucocorticoids, is recommended by both the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology as an alternative to cyclophosphamide for induction of remission of new‐onset, organ‐threatening, or life‐threatening GPA or MPA. Rituximab is also effective for the maintenance of remission in patients with GPA or MPA.

Given the improved survival of patients with GPA or MPA over the past decades and the potential short‐ and long‐term toxicities associated with standard‐of‐care treatments, the Rituximab in ANCA‐Associated Vasculitis registry (RaVeR) was developed to address the need for data on the long‐term outcomes of patients with GPA or MPA treated with rituximab and other immunosuppressive therapies in routine clinical practice. The primary objective of this study was to characterize the long‐term safety of rituximab, including repeated administrations, in the treatment of GPA or MPA in a real‐world setting (observational cohort).

### Long-term maintenance of remission with spacing of rituximab infusions based on the individualised patient risk profile in ANCA-associated vasculitis: a pilot study [^1119iUqs]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

19 patients were enrolled (table 1): 12 were females (63.2%), mean age 58 ± 13 years. 12 (63.2%) had GPA and 10 (52.6%) were PR3-ANCA-positive at diagnosis. Seven patients had a history of organ-threatening or life-threatening relapse (four pulmonary-renal syndrome, two central nervous system, one diffuse alveolar haemorrhage).

Table 1
Characteristics at enrolment and outcomes at 24 months of the 19 patients with AAV undergoing a personalised immunosuppressive therapy following the standard maintenance treatment with RTX

After completing the 18 month maintenance, seven patients (36.8%) continued RTX6m, nine (47.4%) were assigned to RTX12m and three (15.8%) started another IS (azathioprine, n = 2; mycophenolate, n = 1).

Primary outcome: No relapses occurred in the RTX6m group during follow-up. In the RTX12m group, one patient experienced a minor relapse (nasal crusting) requiring transient reintroduction of low-dose glucocorticoids (GCs). No patient in the IS group relapsed.

Secondary outcomes: RTX6m patients exhibited the highest rate of hypogammaglobulinaemia (57.1%) and severe infections (28.6%). One RTX6m patient developed severe hypogammaglobulinaemia. RTX12m patients had no severe infections, although one developed severe hypogammaglobulinaemia. No severe infections occurred in the IS group, with one patient developing hypogammaglobulinaemia. Median daily prednisone-equivalent dose remained comparable between baseline and 2 years in the whole cohort (5 mg/day, Q1–Q3 2.5–5 vs 3.75 mg/day, Q1–Q3 2.5–5, p = 0.2). Daily GC dose at 24 months was slightly higher in RTX6m patients compared with other groups (table 1). Only one patient (from RTX12m group) was able to discontinue GCs. Persistent ANCA positivity at baseline or ANCA seroconversion during follow-up did not appear to influence relapse risk. Damage accrual remained stable over the 2-year follow-up, with no significant differences in Vasculitis Damage Index at 2 years (baseline 3 Q1–Q3 2–4, 2 years 3 Q1–Q3 2–4, p = 0.9). No severe relapses, deaths or progression to end-stage renal disease occurred.

### Rituximab for induction and maintenance therapy of granulomatosis with polyangiitis: a single-centre cohort study on 114 patients [^117HTwv7]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess efficacy and safety of rituximab (RTX) induction and maintenance therapy for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) in a single-centre cohort study.

Methods

All patients with active GPA, not enrolled in trials, who received ⩾1 RTX infusion(s) for induction were included. At remission, protocolized maintenance RTX infusions were given every 6 months for 18 months. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival rates. Univariable analyses identified factors associated with remission failure and relapse, and Cox models retained independent predictors of relapse.

Results

One hundred and fourteen adults with relapsing (65%), refractory/grumbling (22%) or new-onset (13%) GPA received RTX for induction; 100 were given ⩾1 RTX maintenance infusion(s) and 90 received 500 mg every 6 months. Median daily prednisone induction dose was 30 mg; 76% of patients were still receiving a median daily prednisone dose of 5 mg at 2 years. Median follow-up was 3.6 years. Respective 2-year relapse-free survival and RTX retention rates were 85 and 78%. Serious infection and serious adverse event rates were 4.9 and 8.1 per 100 patient-years, respectively. Refractory/grumbling vs new-onset and/or relapsing GPA (P < 0.01 for each individually; P < 0.001 vs the latter two taken together), pachymeningitis (P < 0.05), pure granulomatous disease (P < 0.05) or estimated glomerular filtration rate ⩾60 ml/min (P < 0.01) were associated with remission failure. Multivariate analyses retained refractory/grumbling GPA (P = 0.05), subglottic stenosis (P < 0.005), ENT involvement (P = 0.01) and skin involvement (P < 0.0005) as independent predictors of relapse.

Conclusion

RTX induction and low-dose preemptive maintenance can effectively and safely induce sustained remission in GPA in a real-life setting.

Domain 1: GPA and MPA treatment

These recommendations apply to people with lived experience of GPA and MPA. A flowchart (Fig. 1) outlines the GPA and MPA treatment algorithm for quick reference.

Figure 1.
GPA and MPA treatment algorithm. a A combination of CYC and RTX can be considered in life-threatening or organ-threatening disease. b For patients with active relapsing disease, treatment with RTX is preferred (recommendation 2c). c Creatinine > 300 µmol/l. d PLEX can be considered provided that the risk of adverse events has been weighed against the benefits. e The recommended duration of avacopan use is 12 months as there is no data on its use beyond this (recommendation 6). f The optimum duration of GC tapering is uncertain. A suggested tapering regime is outlined in Table 3 (recommendation 10). g MMF can be considered when there is contraindication or intolerance to RTX, AZA or MTX. h Decision making around the length of treatment should consider patient risk factors for relapse and infection as well as patient preferences. AZA: azathioprine; CYC: cyclophosphamide; GC: glucocorticoids; MMF: mycophenolate mofetil; MTX: methotrexate; PLEX: plasma exchange; RTX: rituximab

Primary induction of remission for GPA and MPA

These recommendations are in broad alignment with the 2014 BSR guideline but have been extended to recommend the use of RTX or CYC in all individuals living with active disease. As RCTs demonstrated equivalent efficacy of CYC and RTX in new onset disease, we do not recommend one agent over the other. This agrees with the 2022 EULAR guideline, but is discordant with the ACR guideline that conditionally recommends RTX over CYC for active severe disease due to a preferable toxicity profile, although this is not supported by the PEXIVAS trial (evidence level 1A). Controversy remains across the published guidelines about the preferred use of RTX in those with severe renal involvement [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mls/min] due to limited inclusion of such patients within trials. However, observational analyses suggest no difference in benefit between CYC and RTX. Both KDIGO and EULAR suggest use of either agent in this setting. Our BSR recommendations do not suggest an eGFR cut-off for use of RTX in patients with severe disease.

### Rituximab maintenance therapy for granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^1161hBqy]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy compared to the relapse risk and tolerance of systematic rituximab (RTX) infusions as maintenance therapy for patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), who entered remission taking conventional immunosuppressants or RTX.

Methods

A retrospective study of the main clinical characteristics, outcomes, and RTX tolerance of patients who had received ≥ 2 RTX maintenance infusions in our center, regardless of induction regimen, between 2003 and 2010.

Results

We identified 28 patients [4 MPA and 24 GPA; median age 55.5 yrs (range 18–78); 17 (60%) males] who received a median of 4 (range 2–10) RTX maintenance infusions, with median followup of 38 months (range 21–97) since diagnosis or last flare. None experienced a RTX infusion-related adverse event; 15 patients (among the 21 with available data) had hypogammaglobulinemia (predominantly IgM) prior to their last RTX maintenance infusion; 3 had infectious events (1 cutaneous abscess, 1 otitis, 1 fatal H1N1 flu). Two patients suffered pulmonary relapses shortly before a planned RTX maintenance infusion (both had increased antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody levels and 1 had CD19+ lymphocyte reconstitution).

Conclusion

Rituximab maintenance therapy was well tolerated but did not completely prevent relapses and persistent "grumbling" disease. These preliminary results remain to be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial currently in progress.

The MAINRITSAN 2 trial (table 7) randomised patients with GPA or MPA that were in remission after induction treatment with CYC, RTX or MTX to receive either biomarker 'tailored' or fixed interval remission maintenance treatment with RTX. The 'tailored' arm received 500 mg RTX at randomisation and afterwards only if CD19-positive B cells or previously negative ANCA (by indirect immunofluorescent test (IFT) or ELISA) reappeared, or if ANCA levels significantly increased (≥ 2 dilution steps in IFT or doubled quantitative ELISA for MPO or PR3-ANCA). These biomarkers were measured in 3 monthly intervals. The treatment phase was 18 months. Patients in the fixed arm received 500 mg RTX on days 0 and 14 and at months 6, 12 and 18. The primary end point was the number of relapses at month 28. The number of relapses was not significantly different but numerically higher in patients receiving tailored RTX compared with the fixed-dose group. Since the number of relapse events was lower than anticipated, the trial is underpowered to exclude non-inferiority of a tailored approach. Two hundred forty-eight RTX infusions compared with 381 RTX infusions were given in the tailored versus fixed-dose group (n = 81 subjects in each group). Of 22 relapsing patients, 7 (31.8%) had negative ANCA throughout the trial, 11 (50%) had always negative circulating B cell counts and 4 (18.2%) had negative ANCA and no detectable circulating B cells.

In the ongoing MAINTANCAVAS trial (table 7), patients with AAV in remission under RTX-induced continuous B cell depletion for 2 years were included and randomised to receive RTX maintenance treatment either at B cell return or at significant rise of ANCA levels. An interim analysis published as abstract reported relapse-free survival to be significantly higher in the B cell-driven compared with the ANCA-driven RTX treatment group.

The MAINRITSAN 3 trial (table 7) re-randomised patients from the MAINRITSAN 2 trial that were in remission at month 28 (including those with a minor relapse during MAINRITSAN 2 that required only increase of GC) to receive RTX 500 mg or placebo at months 0, 6, 12 and 18. Relapse-free survival at month 28 after randomisation was significantly higher in the RTX compared with the placebo group with similar rates of AEs.

Discussion

The results of this target trial emulation based on clinical data of patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GPA showed that those who received rituximab for induction treatment more frequently achieved remission with a prednisone dose of 10 mg/d or less compared with cyclophosphamide-treated patients. This comparative effectiveness analysis using observational data from a prospective rare disease registry allowed treatment comparisons — so far poorly addressed — and confirmed the hypothesis that rituximab could be superior to cyclophosphamide for induction of GPA remission.

Our findings are consistent with those of the pivotal trial on rituximab induction treatment for AAVs. In that study, patients with AAV allocated to receive rituximab experienced proportionally (but not significantly) more frequent remissions with successful completion of prednisone tapering at 6 months (64%), compared with patients allocated to receive cyclophosphamide (53%). Their sensitivity analysis restricted to patients with GPA, in line with our observations, highlighted that more rituximab recipients (63% vs 50% of cyclophosphamide recipients) achieved complete remission with successful completion of prednisone tapering at 6 months, even in the absence of a statistically significant difference. Furthermore, a post hoc analysis of trial data from 131 patients with PR3-AAV (127 of whom were classified as having GPA)showed that patients with PR3-AAV were more than twice as likely to achieve complete remission at 6 months when treated with rituximab rather than with cyclophosphamide (65% vs 48%, respectively; P = 0.04). Differences in key AAV outcomes may not be apparent in clinical trials owing to their own limitations, including the fact that more than 1 disease had often been included to overcome their rarity, and, hence, they were not powered to detect significant differences about a given intervention's efficacy within a single disease entity. Our clinical data from a larger subset of patient with GPA indicated a specific advantage of rituximab over cyclophosphamide induction therapy for patients classified as having GPA, most of whom had PR3-ANCA–positive disease.

Induction Treatment of Adult Patients with Active Disease (GPA/MPA Study 1)

A total of 197 patients with active, severe GPA and MPA (two forms of ANCA‑Associated Vasculitides) were treated in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled multicenter, non-inferiority study, conducted in two phases – a 6-month remission induction phase and a 12-month remission maintenance phase. Patients were 15 years of age or older, diagnosed with GPA (75% of patients) or MPA (24% of patients) according to the Chapel Hill Consensus conference criteria (1% of the patients had unknown vasculitis type). All patients had active disease, with a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (BVAS/GPA) greater than or equal to 3, and their disease was severe, with at least one major item on the BVAS/GPA. Ninety-six (49%) of patients had new disease and 101 (51%) of patients had relapsing disease.

Patients in both arms received 1,000 mg of pulse intravenous methylprednisolone per day for 1 to 3 days within 14 days prior to initial infusion. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rituximab 375 mg/m² once weekly for 4 weeks or oral cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg daily for 3 to 6 months in the remission induction phase. Patients were pre-medicated with antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to rituximab infusion. Following intravenous corticosteroid administration, all patients received oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 mg/day) with pre-specified tapering. Once remission was achieved or at the end of the 6-month remission induction period, the cyclophosphamide group received azathioprine to maintain remission. The rituximab group did not receive additional therapy to maintain remission. The main outcome measure for both GPA and MPA patients was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a BVAS/GPA of 0, and off glucocorticoid therapy. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin was a treatment difference of 20%. As shown in Table 17, the study demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete remission at 6 months.

EULAR comparison for maintenance duration — The EULAR guideline advises maintenance therapy for at least 24–48 months following induction, while this panel advises an interval of 18 months to 4 years following induction of remission, tailored according to an individual's risk of relapse and the drug used for maintenance. Additionally, in MPO-AAV after induction of remission with rituximab, maintenance therapy may sometimes be avoided if the patient can be monitored intensively; however, this point is based on expert opinion with little evidence and no consensus.

Maintenance of remission for GPA and MPA: duration of immunosuppression

The optimum duration of maintenance therapy remains uncertain. The REMAIN trial compared 48 months vs 18–24 months of AZA maintenance treatment with improvement in relapse rate and renal survival but not mortality with longer treatment duration at the expense of increased severe adverse events.

The MAINRITSAN3 trial investigated the efficacy of prolonged RTX maintenance therapy in GPA and MPA. In this small trial, the extension of 6-monthly RTX infusions for an additional 18 months following an initial 18-month maintenance of remission course reduced the risk of relapse at 28 months with no observed increase in toxicity. However, the recently published pooled analysis of the MAINRITSAN maintenance of remission trials has shown that at a longer-term follow-up of 84 months, there was no improvement in overall and major relapse-free survival in the 36-month compared with the 18-month RTX group. The authors of the pooled analysis suggested that 36-month RTX therapy should be reserved for patients at high risk of relapse.

We recommend that maintenance immunosuppressive therapy should be continued for 24–48 months. Decision making around the length of treatment should consider patient risk factors for relapse and infection as well as patient preferences. A longer duration may be considered in frequently relapsing disease, but this should be balanced against the risks of continued immunosuppression. This agrees with recommendations from EULAR 2022 and KDIGO update 2024 which suggest remission-maintenance treatment to continue for at least 18 months and consideration in those at higher risk of relapse to continue for longer. The ACR recommendation is ungraded and suggests duration of maintenance therapy to be guided by the patient's clinical condition, preferences and values. KDIGO also suggests that patients with MPO-AAV who achieve remission after induction may not require maintenance therapy due to low rates of relapse. The WG agreed there was insufficient evidence to endorse this statement and make no differentiation on duration of maintenance immunosuppressive therapy between MPA and GPA or ANCA types.

Retrospective cohort analyses have shown that dialysis-dependent patients have higher rates of infection and lower rates of relapse compared with the same patients pre-dialysis or patients with preserved kidney function. Maintenance of remission may not be required in people with lived experience of renal limited disease who remain, or subsequently become, dialysis-dependent. In individuals with lived experience of dialysis dependency and prior evidence of extra-renal manifestations, consideration of continuation of treatment to prevent relapses should be balanced against the risks of immunosuppression. This agrees with KDIGO expert opinion.

Evidence to refine maintenance treatment strategies for AAV has continued to accumulate. First, the superiority of RTX compared with AZA as maintenance treatment that was established after induction treatment with CYC by the MAINRITSAN trial, has now been expanded to situations when remission is induced with RTX. Prolonged maintenance treatment with both, RTX or AZA over a period of 36–48 months results in lower rates of relapse. Biomarker-driven retreatment of RTX is feasible but may result in a greater relapse risk. The optimal duration, intensity and personalisation of treatment remains to be further defined.

Data guiding the management of refractory disease remain scarce and this complex situation warrants detailed clinical workup and expert consultation.

The strength of our approach includes comprehensive literature search based on PICO questions by a group of expert clinicians and patient research partners, critical review of the literature and formal quality assessment. Some limitations need to be considered: first, our results are limited to the articles in English; moreover, most available studies have at least some remaining RoB: several investigator-initiated RCTs are unblinded (even though end points like ESKD or death are solid even in case of unblinded treatment). Second, the majority of meta-analyses has flaws in two or more critical domains of the AMSTAR 2 quality assessment instrument, lowering the overall confidence in the results. Third, the complexity and heterogeneity of AAV and the applied treatment protocols makes unbiased comparisons in retrospective study designs difficult. However, despite the rarity and complexity of AAV, major progress has been made in the last years by several well-performed landmark trials that provide high-quality evidence that refined and further developed treatment approaches.

The findings of this SLRs provide an up-to-date summary of available studies covering treatment strategies in GPA and MPA and highlight open questions and unmet needs in their management. The provided data supported the development of the 2022 EULAR recommendations for the management of AAV.

Induction Treatment of Adult Patients with Active Disease (GPA/MPA Study 1)

A total of 197 patients with active, severe GPA and MPA (two forms of ANCA Associated Vasculitides) were treated in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled multicenter, non-inferiority study, conducted in two phases – a 6-month remission induction phase and a 12-month remission maintenance phase. Patients were 15 years of age or older, diagnosed with GPA (75% of patients) or MPA (24% of patients) according to the Chapel Hill Consensus conference criteria (1% of the patients had unknown vasculitis type). All patients had active disease, with a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (BVAS/GPA) greater than or equal to 3, and their disease was severe, with at least one major item on the BVAS/GPA. Ninety-six (49%) of patients had new disease and 101 (51%) of patients had relapsing disease.

Patients in both arms received 1,000 mg of pulse intravenous methylprednisolone per day for 1 to 3 days within 14 days prior to initial infusion. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either rituximab 375 mg/m2once weekly for 4 weeks or oral cyclophosphamide 2 mg/kg daily for 3 to 6 months in the remission induction phase. Patients were pre-medicated with antihistamine and acetaminophen prior to rituximab infusion. Following intravenous corticosteroid administration, all patients received oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day, not exceeding 80 mg/day) with pre-specified tapering. Once remission was achieved or at the end of the 6-month remission induction period, the cyclophosphamide group received azathioprine to maintain remission. The rituximab group did not receive additional therapy to maintain remission. The main outcome measure for both GPA and MPA patients was achievement of complete remission at 6 months defined as a BVAS/GPA of 0, and off glucocorticoid therapy. The pre-specified non-inferiority margin was a treatment difference of 20%. As shown in Table 18, the study demonstrated non-inferiority of rituximab to cyclophosphamide for complete remission at 6 months.

### Long-term maintenance rituximab for ANCA-associated vasculitis: relapse and infection prediction models [^116rPSf4]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is an organ and life-threatening multisystem autoimmune disease that often follows a relapsing and remitting course. B cell-derived ANCAs are implicated in the pathogenesis and evidence from randomized trials supports the use of rituximab (RTX), an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that depletes B cells, as both a remission induction and maintenance agent. Fixed-interval repeat-dose RTX infusions over a 2-year period is a commonly used approach to maintain remission and prevent relapses. However, after a maintenance course of RTX, relapses occur on cessation of therapy, and further dosing is considered where the benefits of relapse prevention must be weighed against the risk of RTX-induced immunodeficiency and susceptibility to infections.

Patient-specific and disease-specific characteristics exist that can influence an individual's risk of relapse and risk of infectious complications. For instance, a consistent finding from observational studies and clinical trials is that having circulating ANCAs against proteinase 3 (PR3) rather than myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a significant risk for relapsing disease. The disease phenotype also influences relapse risk as patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) tend to have more relapses than patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), as do those with involvement of the upper and lower airways. In addition, patients who have had previous relapses, tend to relapse again, and some studies have shown increased relapse risk in patients with better renal function, persistent ANCA positivity and nasal colonization of Staphylococcus Aureus. Prior and current immunosuppressive treatments, both in terms of the agent used and the duration of therapy, may also influence relapse risk.

Elderly patients are at increased risk of infectious complications associated with immunosuppressive therapy, as are those with impaired renal function, lung damage and diabetes. An over-suppressed immune system may be indicated by leukopenia and hypogammaglobulinaemia; the former being more commonly associated with CYC use, whereas the latter has been seen in patients with AAV, both prior to and in association with RTX use. Overall immunosuppressive burden including the use of other agents such as prednisolone, CYC and mycophenolate may contribute to hypogammaglobulinaemia. However, there is not a clear association between cumulative RTX exposure, low immunoglobulin levels and infection risk, suggesting complex interplay of many patient, disease and treatment related factors. This heterogeneity between individual patients makes predicting the occurrence and severity of RTX-induced hypogammaglobulinaemia challenging.

### Efficacy and safety of rituximab in the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^114Pfq2y]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare small-vessel vasculitis characterised by eosinophil-rich and necrotising granulomatous inflammation, frequently associated with asthma and eosinophilia. The 2012 International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference includes EGPA in the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) group, although only 40% of the patients test positive for ANCA. Although yet to be fully elucidated, the pathogenesis of EGPA has some distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms from the other AAV disease phenotypes. These include an increased interleukin (IL)-5 production and consequent increased maturation and survival of eosinophils. A predominant Th2 response, as levels of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, are raised in EGPA. Recommendations for EGPA management are often extrapolated from experience in the more common AAV subgroups (granulomatous with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)), and this approach may not be reliable.EGPA has been the subject of few randomised controlled trials. The MIRRA trial of mepolizumab (A Double-blind, Randomised, Placebo-controlled Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of Mepolizumab in the Treatment of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis in Subjects Receiving Standard of Care Therapy), a humanised monoclonal antibody that targets IL-5, has been the only industry sponsored trial in EGPA and a positive result led to an approval for EGPA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In this trial, mepolizumab led to more accrued weeks of remission than placebo (28% vs 3%) and reduction of the mean daily dose of prednisolone at week 52 (9.2 mg in the mepolizumab group vs 13.5 mg in the placebo group). Based on the long-term observational studies, EGPA patients are subgrouped into those with poor prognostic factors (such as serum creatinine > 140 µmol/L; proteinuria > 1 g/day; or central nervous system, gastrointestinal or myocardial involvement), in whom cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids are recommended and those without poor prognostic factors for whom prednisolone with or without an immunosuppressive, such as, azathioprine is recommended. Despite therapy most patients remain glucocorticoid dependent with a relapsing/remitting course as the glucocorticoid dose is weaned and acquire a high cumulative exposure to glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents with their attendant complications. There is a clear need for newer therapies that achieve sustained remission with low or no concomitant glucocorticoids requirement.

Rituximab

A Cochrane Review and meta-analysis reported pooled estimates from two RCTs comparing RTX and CYC induction treatment and showed no differences for achieving remission at 6 months (risk ratio (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32), relapse at 12 months (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.18 to 11.31) nor risk of death at 6 months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.70). There was no difference in serious infections (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.92) and SAEs (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.71) between the treatments.

No new RCTs comparing RTX with another remission induction treatment were identified since the last update. A post hoc analysisof the randomised controlled double-blind RAVE trialthat compared RTX and CYC for remission induction in AAV, identified subgroups of importance regarding the efficacy of RTX. The main results from the RAVE trial reported overall non-inferiority of remission induction treatment with RTX compared with CYC (+AZA). RTX induction was superior in those patients with relapsing disease at baseline, 6 and 12, but not at 18 months of follow-up. Furthermore, higher rates of relapse were reported for patients with proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA (compared with Myeloperoxidase (MPO)), patients with GPA (compared with MPA) and those with relapsing (compared with new-onset) disease. The post hoc analysis grouped patients by ANCA specificity and diagnoses. The odds of being in complete remission at 6 months (but not at 12 or 18 months) were higher in patients with PR3-ANCA (including newly onset and relapsing patients) treated with RTX compared with those treated with CYC/AZA (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.30). When relapsing patients with PR3-ANCA were analysed, the likelihood of being in remission were higher in those treated with RTX compared with CYC/AZA at 6 months (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.43 to 8.93), 12 (OR 4.32, 95% CI 1.53 to 12.15) and 18 months (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.05 to 8.97), even though RTX-treated patients received no additional maintenance treatment in the RAVE trial. No difference for remission rates after RTX or CYC/AZA induction was shown for GPA, MPA, newly diagnosed PR3-AAV or newly diagnosed MPO-AAV. Furthermore, high remission rates (90%) after induction treatment of relapsing AAV with RTX are reported in the induction phase of the RITAZAREM trial (no control group in the induction phase of the trial).

### Score to assess the probability of relapse in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^112qJdzq]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

However, adverse events were more frequent in the group of patients receiving 48 months of maintenance treatment, suggesting that prolonged maintenance therapy is probably not suitable for every GPA or MPA patient. The MAINRITSAN 3 trial recently confirmed that extended therapy with biannual rituximab infusions over 18 months also significantly decreases the frequency of AAV relapse without increasing the number of severe adverse events. Although prolonged treatment with rituximab had a good safety profile during the follow-up period of the pivotal clinical trials, data available since the SARS-Cov2 pandemic have shown that rituximab increases morbidity and mortality in these patients when infected with SARS-Cov2because it increases the risk of severe forms of COVID-19 and because it decreases the quality of the postvaccine humoral immune response to SARS-Cov2.

We do not yet have sufficient knowledge to predict flares or relapses. We also lack reliable indicators that could be used to tailor treatment in order to minimise immunosuppression in those less likely to experience relapse. Such markers could also be used to monitor patients more likely to experience relapse while maintaining higher levels of immunosuppressive therapy. It is therefore essential to better identify the factors associated with the risk of relapse in order to take a further step towards personalised management. To date, studies have mainly identified kidney failure as a protective factor against relapse, whereas anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) antibodies and cardiovascular involvement have been associated with an increased risk of relapse.

The objective of this study was to identify baseline clinical and biological patient characteristics associated with the probability of relapse during follow-up in order to develop a relapse prediction score. This score could help clinicians determine whether patients in remission after induction therapy should receive extended maintenance treatment.

Introduction

Since the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), several high-impact clinical trials have broadened the repertory of available treatments for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and refined management strategies in daily routine care.

Cyclophosphamide (CYC) and glucocorticoids (GC) have been the mainstay of remission induction treatment in AAV. Even though successful strategies to reduce the exposure of CYC and GC, including the use of rituximab (RTX) have been in use for several years now, the toxicity and sequelae caused by these substances remain an unsolved issue in AAV. The optimal management and duration of immunosuppressive treatment balancing risk of relapse and risk of treatment-induced complications is an ongoing challenge during long-term follow-up. Biomarkers guiding the intensity or duration of immunosuppression are not yet established. Since the last update, new information is available on (i) the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for remission induction,(ii) reduced-dose GC schemes,(iii) GC-sparing treatment with avacopan,(iv) the efficacy of plasma exchange (PLEX),(v) dosing and duration of remission maintenance treatment with conventional immunosuppressives and RTXand (vi) pooled evidence from meta-analyses on several areas of the management of AAV.

We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) focused on treatment of GPA and MPA. The results presented here will provide the available evidence to the task force of the 2022 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of AAV. A second complementary article will cover the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis as well as diagnostic procedures and general management of AAV.

A total of 197 patients with active, severe GPA and MPA (two forms of ANCA Associated Vasculitides) were treated in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, non-inferiority study, conducted in two phases – a 6 month remission induction phase and a 12 month remission maintenance phase. Patients were 15 years of age or older, diagnosed with GPA (75% of patients) or MPA (24% of patients) according to the Chapel Hill Consensus conference criteria (1% of the patients had unknown vasculitis type).

Follow up Treatment of Adult Patients with GPA/MPA who have achieved disease control with other Immunosuppressant (GPA/MPA Study 2)

A total of 115 patients (86 with GPA, 24 with MPA, and 5 with renal-limited ANCA-associated vasculitis) in disease remission were randomized to receive azathioprine (58 patients) or non-U.S.-licensed rituximab (57 patients) in this open-label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled study. Eligible patients were 21 years and older and had either newly diagnosed (80%) or relapsing disease (20%). A majority of the patients were ANCA-positive. Remission of active disease was achieved using a combination of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. Within a maximum of 1 month after the last cyclophosphamide dose, eligible patients (based on BVAS of 0), were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either non-U.S.-licensed rituximab or azathioprine.

The non-U.S.-licensed rituximab was administered as two 500 mg intravenous infusions separated by two weeks (on Day 1 and Day 15) followed by a 500 mg intravenous infusion every 6 months for 18 months. Azathioprine was administered orally at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 12 months, then 1.5 mg/kg/day for 6 months, and finally 1 mg/kg/day for 4 months; treatment was discontinued after 22 months. Prednisone treatment was tapered and then kept at a low dose (approximately 5 mg per day) for at least 18 months after randomization. Prednisone dose tapering and the decision to stop prednisone treatment after Month 18 were left at the investigator's discretion.

Planned follow-up was until Month 28 (10 or 6 months, respectively, after the last non-U.S.-licensed rituximab infusion or azathioprine dose). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major relapse (defined by the reappearance of clinical and/or laboratory signs of vasculitis activity that could lead to organ failure or damage, or could be life-threatening) through Month 28.

By Month 28, major relapse occurred in 3 patients (5%) in the non-U.S.-licensed rituximab group and 17 patients (29%) in the azathioprine group.

The observed cumulative incidence rate of first major relapse during the 28 months was lower in patients on non-U.S.-licensed rituximab relative to azathioprine (Figure 3).

### B-cell depleting agents for ANCA vasculitides: a new therapeutic approach [^111FTuqc]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Vasculitides associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) serum positivity affecting small and medium-sized vessels are defined as ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Glomerulonephritis in AAV is characterized by focal necrosis, crescent formation, and few or no immunoglobulin deposits. In vitro and animal evidence suggests that ANCA play a pathogenic role in AAV. Specific gene expression signatures are reported to predict long-term prognosis in AAV, suggesting the possibility of individualizing therapy and identifying new therapeutic targets. Although immunosuppressants and glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of AAV therapy, results from two recent randomized controlled trials have shown the non-inferiority of rituximab, compared with cyclophosphamide, for the induction of remission in patients with severe AAV. In fact, in April 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rituximab, combined with glucocorticoids, as a front-line therapy for adult patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; Wegener's granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis. This new indication for rituximab provided the first ever FDA-approved therapy for these two diseases and the first alternative to cyclophosphamide for the treatment of severe disease in almost 40years. However, issues regarding the use of maintenance therapy after rituximab, the concurrent use of cyclophosphamide and the toxicity of rituximab remain unanswered and should be clarified in ongoing and future randomized controlled trials.

### Sustained remission of granulomatosis with polyangiitis after discontinuation of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressant therapy: data from the French vasculitis study group registry [^112LumCV]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Data on sustained remission of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) after discontinuation of therapy (referred to as GPA with sustained remission off-therapy [SROT]) are scarce. In the present study, SROT among GPA patients from the French Vasculitis Study Group Registry was evaluated to identify factors associated with its occurrence and durability.

Methods

For inclusion of patients in the study, the diagnosis of GPA had to meet the GPA classification criteria defined by the American College of Rheumatology and/or the revised Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature for vasculitis. SROT was defined as achievement of remission (a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score of 0) that was sustained for ≥ 6 consecutive months after having discontinued glucocorticoid (GC) and immunosuppressant treatments. The characteristics of the patients at baseline and treatments received were compared at 3, 5, and 10 years postdiagnosis according to whether or not SROT had been reached and maintained.

Results

Among 795 patients with GPA, 92 GPA patients with SROT at 3 years postdiagnosis were compared to 342 control subjects who had experienced disease relapse and/or were still receiving GCs or immunosuppressants. No baseline differences were found, but patients with SROT at 3 years postdiagnosis had more frequently received intravenous cyclophosphamide as induction therapy compared to control subjects (P = 0.01), with a higher median number of infusions (P = 0.05). At 5 years postdiagnosis, no baseline differences were observed between groups, but patients with SROT at 5 years postdiagnosis had received more cyclophosphamide infusions compared to control subjects (P = 0.03). More patients with SROT had received rituximab as maintenance therapy than control subjects at 3 years and 5 years postdiagnosis (P = 0.09 and P < 0.001, respectively). Of the 74 patients enrolled in the GPA Registry with 10-year follow-up data after having received conventional maintenance therapy, 15 (20%) had reached SROT at 3 years, and 5 (7%) maintained SROT at 10 years postdiagnosis.

Conclusion

After conventional therapies, 7% of GPA patients had reached SROT at 10 years postdiagnosis. No baseline vasculitis characteristics distinguished patients who achieved/maintained SROT from those who experienced disease relapse and/or those who continued to receive GCs or immunosuppressant therapy, but patients with SROT had received more intensive induction therapy and rituximab as maintenance therapy more frequently.

### CanVasc consensus recommendations for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitis: 2020 update [^112294DN]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for microscopic polyangiitis, more specifically with respect to induction of remission, severe, CanVasc 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate corticosteroids plus either cyclophosphamide or rituximab as first-line therapy for induction of remission in patients with severe, newly diagnosed MPA. Prefer rituximab if cyclophosphamide is contraindicated, including in patients at risk for infertility.

GPA/MPA on rituximab with hypogammaglobulinemia — For patients receiving remission maintenance therapy with rituximab who have hypogammaglobulinemia (e.g. IgG < 3 gm/liter) and recurrent severe infections, we conditionally recommend immunoglobulin supplementation; replacement doses such as 400–800 mg/kg/month should be considered, supplementation can also be considered without recurrent infections but with impaired vaccine responses, and decisions should be made in collaboration with an allergist/immunologist.
