## Question

how does emphysema obstruct airways

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how emphysema obstructs airways. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology of emphysema and its mechanical consequences. Then, I should verify the role of small airway disease and whether it precedes emphysema. Next, I will examine the specific mechanisms that translate parenchymal destruction into airway obstruction. After that, I should integrate these mechanisms into a coherent model of airflow limitation. Finally, I will consider clinical implications, including imaging and phenotype, and close with a concise synthesis that answers the question directly.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental pathology of emphysema, because if I get that wrong, everything downstream will be off. Emphysema is defined by abnormal, permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole with destruction of alveolar walls and without obvious fibrosis, which directly reduces lung elastic recoil and interferes with normal airway tethering during expiration [^11167XJX] [^116Sdybi] [^1145tmNf].

> Wait, let me verify the sequence of events regarding small airways, since this affects how obstruction arises. Seminal microCT and histopathology work shows that narrowing and loss of terminal and transitional bronchioles occur before the appearance of emphysematous destruction, indicating that small airway disease is an early, primary site of increased resistance and may be the initial lesion in many smokers who go on to develop emphysema [^114FxEEm] [^111gXt54] [^115LyQpE].

> I will now examine the first major mechanism: loss of alveolar attachments and radial traction. Hold on, I should verify the mechanical logic here. Alveolar walls normally exert radial traction that keeps small airways patent during expiration; when those attachments are destroyed, the airways lose their tethering and are prone to collapse, especially under the compressive pressures of forced expiration, which increases expiratory resistance and causes dynamic airflow limitation [^116Sdybi] [^1145Bzfd] [^11167XJX].

> Next, I should review the second mechanism: decreased elastic recoil. Let me think about the physiology of expiration. Expiratory flow in the effort-independent range is driven by elastic recoil pushing air out; with emphysema, the loss of elastic fibers reduces recoil pressure, slows expiratory flow, and promotes air trapping and hyperinflation, which further worsens mechanical disadvantage for the small airways during expiration [^11167XJX] [^116Sdybi] [^112ugoX1].

> But wait, what if there is also direct small airway pathology contributing to obstruction independent of parenchymal destruction. I need to check that. In COPD, small airways show chronic inflammation, wall thickening from fibrosis and muscle hypertrophy, mucus plugging, and epithelial injury that narrows or occludes the lumen; these changes compound the mechanical collapse driven by loss of attachments and recoil, and they are often present even before overt emphysema on imaging [^116Sdybi] [^111qtKZS] [^115xF5HB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single cause of obstruction; I should integrate these mechanisms into a unified model. Emphysema causes obstruction via a triad: structural loss of alveolar attachments that permits dynamic collapse, loss of elastic recoil that slows expiratory flow, and concurrent small airway disease that intrinsically narrows or obliterates lumens; together they prolong the time constant for lung emptying, reduce FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio, and produce gas trapping and hyperinflation, which further impair mechanics and symptoms [^11167XJX] [^116Sdybi] [^112ugoX1].

> I should double-check the clinical implications, because mechanism informs phenotype and management. Emphysema-predominant COPD often shows more hyperinflation, lower BMI, and worse dyspnea at a given FEV1, and CT can quantify emphysema and air trapping to help phenotype disease; importantly, some patients with CT-defined emphysema may have normal spirometry, underscoring that structural disease can precede or exist without meeting obstruction thresholds, which has implications for early detection and targeted interventions [^112sLGdR] [^114iSDgq] [^112DzFc6] [^111wUrxc].

> Let me reconsider whether emphysema "directly" obstructs large airways; I should clarify that. Emphysema's dominant effect on obstruction is at the small airways and via parenchymal loss of tethering and recoil, not by intrinsic narrowing of large cartilaginous bronchi; however, in advanced disease, dynamic collapse of poorly supported small airways and loss of elastic recoil can manifest as expiratory flow limitation and even detectable airway collapse on flow-volume testing, which functionally behaves like obstruction even if the large airway walls are not the primary site of disease [^116Sdybi] [^11115Gcj] [^112S9fio].

> In summary, emphysema obstructs airways through destruction of alveolar attachments that maintain airway patency, loss of elastic recoil that slows expiratory flow, and synergistic small airway inflammation and remodeling with mucus plugging; these processes converge to create persistent, often progressive airflow limitation with gas trapping and hyperinflation, explaining the characteristic physiology of emphysema-predominant COPD [^11167XJX] [^116Sdybi] [^114FxEEm].

---

Emphysema causes airway obstruction primarily by **loss of elastic recoil** and **alveolar wall destruction**, which together reduce airway patency and increase collapse during expiration [^11167XJX]. This is compounded by **small airway narrowing** from inflammation, fibrosis, and mucus plugging, and by the loss of alveolar attachments that normally tether airways open [^11167XJX] [^1145Bzfd]. The net effect is **expiratory airflow limitation** with air trapping and hyperinflation, which is only partially reversible and worsens over time [^11167XJX] [^112ugoX1].

---

## Structural changes in emphysema contributing to airway obstruction

Emphysema is defined by **permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole**, with destruction of alveolar walls and loss of elastic tissue [^1145Bzfd]. These structural changes directly impair airway patency and function:

- **Loss of elastic recoil**: Destruction of elastic fibers reduces the lung's ability to recoil during expiration, causing airways to collapse and trap air [^11167XJX].

- **Loss of alveolar attachments**: Alveolar walls provide radial traction that keeps small airways open; their destruction removes this tethering, leading to airway collapse during expiration [^1145Bzfd].

- **Airway wall remodeling**: Chronic inflammation causes thickening of airway walls, fibrosis, and mucus hypersecretion, further narrowing the airway lumen [^116Sdybi].

---

## Physiological mechanisms of airway obstruction in emphysema

The structural changes in emphysema translate into **specific physiological mechanisms** that cause airway obstruction:

- **Increased airway resistance**: Narrowing and collapse of small airways during expiration increase resistance, reducing expiratory airflow [^114FxEEm].

- **Air trapping and hyperinflation**: Loss of elastic recoil and airway collapse cause air to be trapped in the lungs, increasing residual volume and leading to hyperinflation [^11167XJX].

- **Dynamic airway collapse**: During forced expiration, the pressure around small airways exceeds the pressure within them, causing collapse and further airflow limitation [^11167XJX].

---

## Role of small airways in emphysema-related obstruction

Small airways (< 2 mm in diameter) are the **primary site of airflow limitation** in emphysema [^notfound]. Studies show that narrowing and loss of terminal bronchioles occur before emphysematous destruction, indicating that small airway disease is an early and critical component of obstruction [^111gXt54]. Small airway obstruction results from:

- **Inflammation and fibrosis**: Chronic inflammation leads to thickening of the airway wall and fibrosis, reducing lumen diameter [^115rCi21].

- **Mucus plugging**: Increased mucus production and impaired clearance cause mucus plugs that occlude small airways [^112aFeTW].

- **Loss of alveolar attachments**: Destruction of alveolar walls removes radial traction, allowing airway collapse during expiration [^1145Bzfd].

---

## Clinical implications of airway obstruction in emphysema

Airway obstruction in emphysema has **significant clinical consequences**:

- **Dyspnea and exercise intolerance**: Reduced expiratory airflow and hyperinflation cause breathlessness and limit physical activity [^115YoUAY].

- **Respiratory failure**: Severe obstruction can lead to chronic respiratory failure, characterized by hypoxemia and hypercapnia [^notfound].

- **Exacerbations**: Airway obstruction increases susceptibility to acute exacerbations, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality [^112ugoX1].

---

## Diagnostic assessment of airway obstruction in emphysema

Accurate assessment of airway obstruction in emphysema requires a **combination of physiological and imaging techniques**:

- **Spirometry**: Measures forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), providing a quantitative assessment of airflow limitation [^11167XJX].

- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Allows visualization and quantification of emphysematous destruction, airway wall thickening, and air trapping, correlating with physiological impairment [^113UWeQb].

- **Impulse oscillometry**: Assesses airway resistance and reactance, providing insights into small airway dysfunction [^112EGWTo].

---

## Therapeutic interventions targeting airway obstruction in emphysema

Management of airway obstruction in emphysema involves **both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions**:

- **Bronchodilators**: Beta-agonists and anticholinergics relax airway smooth muscle, reduce airway resistance, and improve airflow [^112ugoX1].

- **Anti-inflammatory therapies**: Corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory agents reduce airway inflammation and remodeling, although their effectiveness is limited in emphysema-predominant COPD [^112L8XFD].

- **Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS)**: Removes severely emphysematous lung tissue, improving elastic recoil and reducing hyperinflation [^notfound].

- **Bronchoscopic interventions**: Endobronchial valves and coils reduce hyperinflation and improve lung function in selected patients [^notfound].

---

Emphysema causes airway obstruction through **loss of elastic recoil**, **alveolar wall destruction**, and **small airway narrowing**, leading to expiratory airflow limitation, air trapping, and hyperinflation. These changes are only partially reversible and progress over time, significantly impacting patient symptoms, quality of life, and prognosis [^11167XJX].

### Emphysema: the challenge of the remodelled lung [^11344o19]. The Journal of Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Emphysema is recognized as the component of chronic obstructive airways disease that is responsible for airways obstruction. Different patterns of emphysema are, however, recognized, suggesting possible different pathogenetic processes within the lung. This, coupled with the associated idea of susceptibility factors to the development of emphysema, has led to studies of genes that may be involved in the defence of the lung from proteolytic and oxidative damage. These studies have been driven by the goal of finding a treatment for emphysema, but appear to have lost sight of the fundamental remodelling of the lung that has occurred in patients with emphysema and the fact that it is not a single morphological entity.

### Mechanisms of chronic airway obstruction in smokers [^116kfeBE]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Studies over the past few decades have showed a clear association between cigarette smoking and the development of chronic airway obstruction. Yet, only a minority of smokers is affected so that in many, even heavy, smokers, pulmonary function remains within normal limits. While carcinogens have been well characterized, there is only limited information about the constituents of cigarette smoke responsible for inducing chronic airway obstruction. In addition, the associated risks factors for airway obstruction in smokers have not been totally identified. The present paper is a review of the recently accumulated facts concerning the intimate action of cigarette smoke at the level of large and small airways and lung parenchyma. The role of classical inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and alveolar macrophages is reviewed, but emphasis is put on recent evidence indicating the involvement of CD8 + T-lymphocytes and possibly eosinophils in the genesis of the structural changes leading to airways obstruction. The mechanisms by which airway inflammation and remodelling cause airway narrowing and airflow limitation are discussed, along with the associated loss of lung elasticity secondary to destructive emphysema. Other biological, epidemiological, physiopathological, and clinical aspects are analyzed, stressing such fundamental aspects as the defence mechanisms, the morpho-functional correlations, the identification of susceptible smokers, and the early detection of airway obstruction, both in specialized laboratories and in primary care.

### Recent advances in diagnosis and management of chronic bronchitis and emphysema [^112gcj4P]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a progressive inflammatory disease of the airways and lung parenchyma. Expiratory airflow limitation is the hallmark of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide and results in a large consumption of health care resources. Unfortunately, despite efforts to curb this disease, its prevalence is increasing. The diagnosis is usually made when the patient complains of dyspnea on exertion; by this time, irreversible structural damage to the lung has already occurred. Given the nonspecific symptoms of the disease and the inability to effectively treat and reverse the damage, it is essential to diagnose the disease in its early stages and take the necessary preventive measures, thus avoiding disability or death. This review summarizes the latest developments in the diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The first half of the review discusses functional, radiographic, biochemical, and cellular/histopathologic issues in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The second half focuses on the current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic advances in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including the role of respiratory support and surgical treatment. Based on the research on the cellular mechanisms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the review also makes a reference to novel and experimental therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2023 report: GOLD executive summary [^116uRvT4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

New Definition of COPD

The definition of a disease should only include the characteristics that distinguish it from other diseases. Accordingly, GOLD 2023 proposes a new definition of COPD that, at variance with previous documents, focuses exclusively on these characteristics, separately from its epidemiology, causes, risk factors, and diagnostic criteria that are discussed on their own.

GOLD 2023 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.

### Models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116inMHi]. Respiratory Research (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global health problem and is predicted to become the third most common cause of death by 2020. Apart from the important preventive steps of smoking cessation, there are no other specific treatments for COPD that are as effective in reversing the condition, and therefore there is a need to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms that could lead to new therapeutic strategies. The development of experimental models will help to dissect these mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level. COPD is a disease characterized by progressive airflow obstruction of the peripheral airways, associated with lung inflammation, emphysema and mucus hypersecretion. Different approaches to mimic COPD have been developed but are limited in comparison to models of allergic asthma. COPD models usually do not mimic the major features of human COPD and are commonly based on the induction of COPD-like lesions in the lungs and airways using noxious inhalants such as tobacco smoke, nitrogen dioxide, or sulfur dioxide. Depending on the duration and intensity of exposure, these noxious stimuli induce signs of chronic inflammation and airway remodelling. Emphysema can be achieved by combining such exposure with instillation of tissue-degrading enzymes. Other approaches are based on genetically-targeted mice which develop COPD-like lesions with emphysema, and such mice provide deep insights into pathophysiological mechanisms. Future approaches should aim to mimic irreversible airflow obstruction, associated with cough and sputum production, with the possibility of inducing exacerbations.

### Aspects on pathophysiological mechanisms in COPD [^116KJXJC]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a condition which is characterized by irreversible airway obstruction due to narrowing of small airways, bronchiolitis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma, emphysema. It is the fourth most common cause of mortality in the world and is expected to be the third most common cause of death by 2020. The main cause of COPD is smoking but other exposures may be of importance. Exposure leads to airway inflammation in which a variety of cells are involved. Besides neutrophil granulocytes, macrophages and lymphocytes, airway epithelial cells are also of particular importance in the inflammatory process and in the development of emphysema. Cell trafficking orchestrated by chemokines and other chamoattractants, the proteinase-antiproteinase system, oxidative stress and airway remodelling are central processes associated with the development of COPD. Recently systemic effects of COPD have attracted attention and the importance of systemic inflammation has been recognized. This seems to have direct therapeutic implications as treatment with inhaled glucocorticosteroids has been shown to influence mortality. The increasing body of knowledge regarding the inflammatory mechanism in COPD will most likely have implications for future therapy and new drugs, specifically aimed at interaction with the inflammatory processes, are currently being developed.

### Pathophysiology of airflow limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116Sdybi]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

The airflow limitation that defines chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the result of a prolonged time constant for lung emptying, caused by increased resistance of the small conducting airways and increased compliance of the lung as a result of emphysematous destruction. These lesions are associated with a chronic innate and adaptive inflammatory immune response of the host to a lifetime exposure to inhaled toxic gases and particles. Processes contributing to obstruction in the small conducting airways include disruption of the epithelial barrier, interference with mucociliary clearance apparatus that results in accumulation of inflammatory mucous exudates in the small airway lumen, infiltration of the airway walls by inflammatory cells, and deposition of connective tissue in the airway wall. This remodelling and repair thickens the airway walls, reduces lumen calibre, and restricts the normal increase in calibre produced by lung inflation. Emphysematous lung destruction is associated with an infiltration of the same type of inflammatory cells found in the airways. The centrilobular pattern of emphysematous destruction is most closely associated with cigarette smoking, and although it is initially focused on respiratory bronchioles, separate lesions coalesce to destroy large volumes of lung tissue. The panacinar pattern of emphysema is characterised by a more even involvement of the acinus and is associated with alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency. The technology needed to diagnose and quantitate the individual small airway and emphysema phenotypes present in people with COPD is being developed, and should prove helpful in the assessment of therapeutic interventions designed to modify the progress of either phenotype.

### Bridging the gap: small airways, mechanical stress, and the evolution of emphysema [^112L2L5X]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The clinical relationship between airway disease and emphysema has been recognized for quite some time, as the earliest descriptions of what would ultimately be termed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) recognized the presence of both chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Despite this, many questions have surrounded the pathogenesis of emphysema and the relationship between airway pathology and alveolar destruction. On the basis of work from Jim Hogg and others, a prevailing thought has been that small airway disease plays a crucial role as being the primary site of airflow obstruction before the development of emphysema. Histologic studies also led by Hogg have shown that even before air space enlargement, loss of terminal bronchioles can be detected. This concept is also supported by the fact that emphysematous destruction typically emanates from the center of the lobule, where the respiratory bronchioles reside.

Yet at the same time, this clearly is not the entire story. One missing piece of the puzzle has been a solid explanation for why lung function decline and emphysematous destruction continue even after noxious triggers associated with disease development, such as cigarette smoke exposure, are discontinued. The thought has been that this must be due to ongoing smoldering "inflammation", which, once incited, becomes self-propagating.

In this issue of the Journal, Bhatt and colleagues (pp.) present their work "Mechanically Affected Lung and Progression of Emphysema". In this study, they build on their prior work demonstrating that new emphysema arises in at-risk regions of the lung that have high mechanical impact of existing emphysema. The authors hypothesize that mechanical stress caused by the weakening of lung structure introduced by emphysema leads to further perpetuation of emphysema. In other words, emphysema begets emphysema.

### Frontiers in emphysema research [^112QSr8f]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex inflammatory disease with a myriad of pulmonary and nonpulmonary disease manifestations. COPD is a heterogeneous disease consisting of emphysematous destruction, airway inflammation, remodeling, and obstruction. Once conceptualized as a unidimensional disease isolated to the lung, it is now recognized to have significant systemic manifestations, such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and skeletal muscle wasting. As the clinical phenotypic expressions of COPD become more precisely characterized, so does the pathogenesis of this disease. Great strides are now being made in our understanding of genetic susceptibility, airway inflammation, the immune response to cigarette smoke, and inflammatory biomarkers. This review will discuss the most recent progress on selected topics in COPD pathogenesis, inflammation, and genetics. With time, we hope to expand our current understanding to predict who will develop disease and who will not, and why some patients develop particular disease phenotypes. In addition, we hope to clarify the inflammatory mechanisms involved in order to develop novel therapies and identify disease biomarkers that will lead to better tools for monitoring disease activity. Finally, we hope to develop treatments aimed at lung regeneration and repair, to reverse lung damage that has already occurred. We are optimistic that novel therapies like gene therapy and advanced antiinflammatory agents will be in our future. Judging by the progress made in the last decade, these tools may soon become a reality.

### The association and impact of radiographic, pathological emphysema and spirometric airway obstruction on patients with resectable lung adenocarcinoma [^114ib8jQ]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the predominant cause of cancer-related deaths globally, accounting for the highest mortality rates in both men and women. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) increasingly becomes the most prevalent subtype over time. Over the past two decades, advances in identifying targetable oncogenic drivers have transformed the management of LUAD, resulting in marked prognostic heterogeneity. Previous studies, including ours, have shown that computed tomography(CT)-defined emphysema increased all-cause mortality in both smoker-based lung cancer screening studies and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cohorts. However, whether CT-defined emphysema, spirometric airway obstruction and pathological emphysema demonstrates similar effect in LUAD has been not well defined.

CT-defined emphysema is characterised by low attenuation visible in any lung zone on high-resolution CT scans. Airway obstruction is usually identified on spirometry and caused by a mixture of small airway disease and emphysema. Some researchers have tried to explore the role of CT-defined emphysema and airway obstruction in patients with lung cancer. Ishida et al. founded CT-defined emphysema was associated with postoperative complicationsan and poor prognosis in patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC, but without considering airway obstruction. Another study assessed the impact of both CT-defined emphysema and airflow obstruction on prognosis but did not evaluate their effects on surgical complications in early-stage lung cancer. Moreover, as the diagnosis of CT-defined emphysema is solely based on radiologic evaluation previously, the importance of pathological emphysema in lung cancer has been not fully investigated. Therefore, the associations between CT-defined emphysema, airway obstruction, and pathological emphysema and outcomes, including postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and prognosis, need to be elucidated in patients with resectable LUAD.

### Computer quantification of airway collapse on forced expiration to predict the presence of emphysema [^11115Gcj]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases, most often from cigarette smoke. Being 4th leading cause of death, COPD is one of the major health challenges of the next decades, while the World Health Organization predicts that it will become the 3rd leading cause of death by 2030. Prevalence surveys indicate that up to almost one quarter of the adults aged 40 years and older may have mild airflow obstruction. One of the challenges in such pandemic is to identify patients at risk for rapid deterioration and to develop diagnostic tools and specific treatment strategies which are directed to clinically important subgroups or particular phenotypes with poor outcome.

Emphysema may be considered as one of the oldest phenotypes in COPD. It is characterized by the loss of lung tissue leading to breakdown of alveolar walls and subsequent airway collapse during forced expiration. It has been demonstrated that emphysema is associated with lower body mass index and bone mineral density, reduced exercise capacity, impaired quality of life and higher BODE index compared to COPD patients with similar airflow obstruction without emphysema. Emphysema is, independently of COPD, a strong risk factor for lung cancer and CT screening may be most beneficial for this particular subgroup. Additionally, subtypes of emphysema patients may be referred for endoscopic valve placement, bullectomy or even lung volume reduction surgery. As most common variables obtained by spirometry do not accurately reflect emphysema presence, the diagnosis is currently based on CT scan of the chest, which is expensive, not routinely available and therefore not imposed every time a new diagnosis of COPD is made. Decreased variables of diffusing capacity such as D L, CO and K CO are often used as a surrogate marker of emphysema, for instance in the differential diagnosis with asthma, because they basically reflect impaired oxygen uptake by the loss of alveoli typically observed when the parenchyma is destroyed. Again, these measures need more advanced equipment restricting the analysis to respiratory physicians in secondary care. An alternative approach, however, may be found in the correct quantification of collapse during the forced expiratory phase of a flow-volume loop, the so-called 'spirographic kink'. This kink, suddenly diminished expiratory flow, has been linked to emphysema in the past but the association has only been based on visual assessments in limited patient samples. We therefore hypothesized that a standardized quantification of collapse may offer a more precise indication of emphysema presence, which would be of particular interest in primary care.

### Quantitative computed tomography assessment of airway wall dimensions: current status and potential applications for phenotyping chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112L8XFD]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Airway remodeling is extremely important in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Since the site and nature of airflow obstruction was described by Hogg, Thurlbeck, and Macklem, investigators have been looking for methods to noninvasively measure the airway wall dimensions in subjects with and at risk for COPD. The advent and proliferation of computed tomography (CT) initially allowed investigators to quantify changes in lung parenchymal structure in subjects with emphysema, and more recently attention has turned to the measurement of airway wall dimensions. Unfortunately, while the lung density is relatively easy to quantify, reliable airway measurements have proven to be more difficult to obtain. However, recent advances in CT technology and new computer algorithms have changed the way investigators have measured airways using CT, and it is now hoped that many of the early issues surrounding airway measurements can be resolved. The measurement of airway wall dimensions is important because it is well known that chronic airflow limitation can be caused by a combination of airway and parenchymal changes. The phenotypic expression of these different subtypes of COPD is vital because a therapy designed to modulate the inflammation in airways may be contraindicated in subjects with the emphysema phenotype and visa versa. Therefore, these new imaging techniques are very likely to play a front-line role in the study of COPD and will, hopefully, allow clinicians to phenotype individuals, thereby personalizing their treatment.

### The small airways in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: pathology and effects on disease progression and survival [^116DHE2m]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused by a mixture of small airway disease (obstructive bronchitis) and parenchymal lung tissue destruction (emphysema). The relative contributions of these two pathologic states vary from person to person. Having the ability to phenotype patients into predominately small airways disease or emphysema may affect the clinical management.

Recent Findings

Pathologic studies have shown that the progression of COPD from Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stages 0 to 4 is most strongly associated with small airway wall thickening as a result of lung repair or remodeling. The narrowing and loss of small airways occurs prior to emphysematous destruction. There is an increase in the amount of neutrophils and CD8⁺ T lymphocytes (cells that induce apoptosis and necrosis) in the small airways in COPD. Small airways disease can be identified on pulmonary function testing, using multiple nitrogen breath washout testing, indirectly through high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) imaging or MRI, or directly by using microCT of resected lung tissue. There may be increased mortality in advanced COPD and concomitant small airway disease. There are newer methods to deliver respiratory therapies to reach the small airways.

Summary

The current techniques utilized to assess patients for small airway disease need to be improved, so clinicians can more effectively phenotype patients with COPD and small airways disease. This will allow new therapies that target the small airways to be developed and tested, and positively impact on the natural progression of COPD.

### Quantitative CT assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115oBdeD]. Radiographics (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by the presence of airflow limitation that is caused by a combination of small airway remodeling and emphysema-induced loss of elastic recoil. The management of COPD depends on the relative distribution and severity of these two pathologic processes, factors that may vary widely even among patients with a similar degree of airflow limitation. Standard lung function testing with spirometry is unhelpful for distinguishing the specific contribution of each process. Pathologic changes such as emphysema and modification of the small and large airways are better evaluated with quantitative analyses of image data from multidetector computed tomography (CT). CT-based quantitative analyses can help differentiate the COPD phenotype (emphysema-predominant, airway-predominant, or mixed), which is crucial information for determining the appropriate management strategy.

### Contribution of small airway inflammation to the development of COPD [^116sdgFb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide in 2020, which is characterized by progressive and not fully irreversible airway obstruction in lung function. Natural history of COPD pathogenesis is the destruction and loss of the terminal and transitional bronchioles because small airways narrow and disappear inducing emphysema before a decline in the lung function. The destructions of the small airways were visualized on thoracic micro-computed tomography scan when the emphysematous lesions become large enough. Even in the absence of emphysema, the airway wall thickening with lumen narrowing were commonly observed as thickening of lung texture in Chest X-ray of chronic bronchitis. However, little attention has been paid to the pathophysiological changes occurring in the lungs of individuals at risk when they develop to COPD.

COPD progresses over decades until the later development of symptoms or exacerbations. It is important to understand the early pathophysiological changes of COPD that encompass chronic bronchitis and emphysema in order to prevent its progression. Indeed, several large clinical trials targeting severe COPD have failed because the patients already had "irreversible disease" characterized by parenchymal destruction and remodeling of large numbers of central and peripheral airways. Inflammation develops initially on peripheral airways, then gradually to the complete airway, leading to the accelerated loss of lung function in the lungs of almost all smokers. It was reported that chronic inflammation induced by exposure to cigarette smoked is the leading cause for the development of COPD. Chronic inflammation releases inflammatory mediators and destructive enzymes, mainly involve the infiltration of immune cells into the small airways, which might contribute to airway remodeling and obstruction.

### Morphological measurements in computed tomography correlate with airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117W3G83]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The pathogenesis of airflow limitation in COPD is mainly related to emphysema and small airway remodelling. Although airflow obstruction parameters in the pulmonary function test (PFT) by spirometry is essential in COPD diagnosis, these parameters fail to quantify the proportionate impact of emphysema and small airways disease individually. Morphological changes can be characterised and quantified by computed tomography (CT), especially by multi-detector CT. For COPD patients, quantitative chest CTs are important for understanding the pathogenesis and the effect of therapeutic interventions, and can help to identify those most at risk for acute exacerbations. Since the introduction of the 'density mask' in 1988, CT emphysema quantification has had a long history. Multi-detector CT can accurately evaluate emphysema. However, quantification of airway remodelling by CT is challenging because of its spatial resolution. Airway wall quantification started over a decade ago, mainly for large airways, but investigators have measured the peripheral airways down to 0.5-mm-lumen diameter and 2.8 mm outer diameter. Measurement of narrowing of CT-detectable airways may estimate the degree of small airways disease.

The assumption is that emphysema and peripheral airway wall thickness, as detected by CT, are correlated to airflow obstruction in COPD patients. Study results have been variable and sometimes conflicting. However, some individual studies have been small and underpowered. Therefore, we conducted a systemic review and meta-analysis to determine the correlation between emphysema or peripheral airway measurements on inspiratory and expiratory CT, and airflow obstruction in COPD.

### Gold 2023: highlights for primary care [^117CqtNQ]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

New definition

GOLD 2023 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea, cough, expectoration and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 0.7). This definition aims at: (1) recognizing that COPD is heterogeneous; and (2) describing explicitly what are the main structural, functional, and clinical manifestations of the disease.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — definition and distinguishing features: COPD comprises a combination of chronic and slowly progressive respiratory disorders including emphysema, small airway disease, and chronic bronchitis, is described clinically as persistent respiratory symptoms with significant airflow limitation as measured by reduced maximal expiratory flow during forced exhalation, and is characterized by incomplete reversibility of airway obstruction, which may differ from asthma where airway obstruction is commonly reversible with bronchodilators.

### Pathogenesis of emphysema: from the bench to the bedside [^116f1CC2]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized physiologically by expiratory flow limitation and pathologically by alveolar destruction and enlargement and small and large airway inflammation and remodeling. An imbalance between protease and antiprotease activity in the lung is proposed as the major mechanism resulting in emphysema. The imbalance is mostly due to an increase in the numbers of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Emphysema can also develop from increased alveolar wall cell death and/or failure in alveolar wall maintenance. Chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress contribute to increased destruction and/or impaired lung maintenance and repair. Genetic factors may play an important role in disease susceptibility because only a minority of smokers develops emphysema. Recent literature implicates surfactant instability, malnutrition, and alveolar cell apoptosis as possible etiologies. Identification of cellular and molecular mechanisms of COPD pathogenesis is an area of active, ongoing research that may help to determine therapeutic targets for emphysema.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112ugoX1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease with high global morbidity and mortality. COPD is characterized by poorly reversible airway obstruction, which is confirmed by spirometry, and includes obstruction of the small airways (chronic obstructive bronchiolitis) and emphysema, which lead to air trapping and shortness of breath in response to physical exertion. The most common risk factor for the development of COPD is cigarette smoking, but other environmental factors, such as exposure to indoor air pollutants - especially in developing countries - might influence COPD risk. Not all smokers develop COPD and the reasons for disease susceptibility in these individuals have not been fully elucidated. Although the mechanisms underlying COPD remain poorly understood, the disease is associated with chronic inflammation that is usually corticosteroid resistant. In addition, COPD involves accelerated ageing of the lungs and an abnormal repair mechanism that might be driven by oxidative stress. Acute exacerbations, which are mainly triggered by viral or bacterial infections, are important as they are linked to a poor prognosis. The mainstay of the management of stable disease is the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, whereas corticosteroids are beneficial primarily in patients who have coexisting features of asthma, such as eosinophilic inflammation and more reversibility of airway obstruction. Apart from smoking cessation, no treatments reduce disease progression. More research is needed to better understand disease mechanisms and to develop new treatments that reduce disease activity and progression.

### Computer quantification of airway collapse on forced expiration to predict the presence of emphysema [^112S9fio]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

As mild emphysema may also present without airflow limitation and collapse, one may hypothesize that the angle is rather representative of airway obstruction than of emphysema per se. It is obvious that the severity of emphysema is closely related to COPD severity, but the fact that within each former GOLD category patients with emphysema have significantly lower angles compared to their non-emphysematous counterparts, indicates that the angle quantifies flow limitation beyond FEV 1. From a physiological point of view, airway obstruction must present with a curvilinear decrease of flow versus volume, whereas sudden drops in flow for little volume changes are representative of collapse. Although AC is sensitive to collapse and closely relates to emphysema, we do not claim that AC is a unique characteristic of emphysema, as this also not the case for decreased diffusion capacity either. Moreover, future studies with dynamic CT scans are required to differentiate with dynamic collapse of the central airways in case of tracheobronchomalacia, often occurring in severe COPD.

### Distinct morphological types of small airway obstructions in smokers with emphysema and end-stage COPD [^112aFeTW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The precise nature of small airway obstructions in COPD remains poorly understood, especially at early disease stages.

Objectives

This study aimed to characterize small airway obstructions and numbers up to the terminal bronchioles (TB) in smokers with limited emphysema and end-stage COPD. We hypothesized that obstruction subtypes would differ in morphology, nature and number from early to end-stage COPD.

Methods

Whole lungs from seven donors (Control: declined for extrapulmonary reasons), eight donors (history of smoking), of which three had < 5% emphysema (smokers with no emphysema, SNE) and five > 5% emphysema (smokers with emphysema, SE) and eight end-stage COPD patients were inflated and processed. MicroCT of tissue was used to assess number of TB, aerated TB, number and type of obstructions and cross-correlated with histopathology.

Measurements and Main Results

Obstructions were mainly present in SE and COPD resulting in less aerated TB. Based on emphysema extent, more non-aerated TB were present in regions with no emphysema compared to mild emphysema, however, destruction was more prominent in mild emphysema. Multiple types of obstructions comprising occlusions, webs and collapses were identified. In SE, obstructions primarily comprised webs and occlusions, while all obstruction types were present in COPD. On histopathology, obstructions were identified as mucus plugs.

Conclusions

Multiple types of obstruction characterized as mucus plugs were identified in SE and end-stage COPD. Their morphology, nature and number evolved from SE to end-stage COPD. A shift from obstruction-dominant dysfunction to destruction-dominant pathology was found in smokers based on emphysema presence.

### Loss of alveolar attachments as a pathomechanistic link between small airway disease and emphysema [^1145Bzfd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Vasilescu and colleagues are the first to provide confirmation that an imaging biomarker, parametric response mapping (PRM), has the ability to differentiate small airway disease (PRM SAD) from emphysema (PRM Emph) in patients with established chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This is of utmost importance given the urgent clinical and scientific need to noninvasively detect terminal bronchial pathology.

COPD is characterized by the presence of persistent airflow limitation and respiratory symptoms. Airways smaller than 2 mm in internal diameter are the dominant site of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. This obstruction is caused by a mixture of pathogenic events (with)in and around the small airways, namely, loss of airways, thickening of remaining airway walls, luminal obstruction by endobronchial mucus, and loss of bronchiolar–alveolar attachments leading to reduced radial traction.

Emphysema is a key pathological condition in COPD that is defined by an abnormal, permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole, accompanied by destruction of their walls and without obvious fibrosis. Whereas in an editorial addressing the landmark study of McDonough and colleagues, Mitzner questioned whether emphysema formation starts in the small airways or lung parenchyma, accumulating evidence now strongly suggests that small airway disease precedes emphysema formation. It has been demonstrated that a significant proportion of terminal and transitional bronchioles are lost in lung samples from patients with COPD without signs of emphysema, and that the remaining small airways have thickened walls and narrowed lumens. However, it remains to be determined how small airway disease leads to emphysema. Based on Vascilescu and colleagues' study in combination with decades-old research, we propose that loss of bronchiolar–alveolar attachments is the most plausible link between small airway disease and emphysema.

Future research on airway remodeling in COPD should also investigate 1) whether remodeling caused by airway luminal narrowing or airway loss is more responsive to treatment; 2) what processes are responsible for the first 5% reduction in airway volume and whether early intervention can shift this remodeling from one regime to another; 3) the relationship between each of these two phenotypes and a multiomics approach to COPD-related airway remodeling; and 4) sensitivity comparisons to other methods, such as CT PRM, that may be able to offer similar subclassifications.

### Small-airway obstruction and emphysema in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114FxEEm]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The major sites of obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are small airways (< 2 mm in diameter). We wanted to determine whether there was a relationship between small-airway obstruction and emphysematous destruction in COPD.

Methods

We used multidetector computed tomography (CT) to compare the number of airways measuring 2.0 to 2.5 mm in 78 patients who had various stages of COPD, as judged by scoring on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) scale, in isolated lungs removed from patients with COPD who underwent lung transplantation, and in donor (control) lungs. MicroCT was used to measure the extent of emphysema (mean linear intercept), the number of terminal bronchioles per milliliter of lung volume, and the minimum diameters and cross-sectional areas of terminal bronchioles.

Results

On multidetector CT, in samples from patients with COPD, as compared with control samples, the number of airways measuring 2.0 to 2.5 mm in diameter was reduced in patients with GOLD stage 1 disease (P = 0.001), GOLD stage 2 disease (P = 0.02), and GOLD stage 3 or 4 disease (P < 0.001). MicroCT of isolated samples of lungs removed from patients with GOLD stage 4 disease showed a reduction of 81 to 99.7% in the total cross-sectional area of terminal bronchioles and a reduction of 72 to 89% in the number of terminal bronchioles (P < 0.001). A comparison of the number of terminal bronchioles and dimensions at different levels of emphysematous destruction (i.e., an increasing value for the mean linear intercept) showed that the narrowing and loss of terminal bronchioles preceded emphysematous destruction in COPD (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

These results show that narrowing and disappearance of small conducting airways before the onset of emphysematous destruction can explain the increased peripheral airway resistance reported in COPD. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others.).

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^11167XJX]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Pathophysiology — airflow obstruction and gas trapping in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is usually measured by spirometry and reflects both small airways disease and parenchymal destruction, leading to reduced lung elastic recoil, expiratory airway collapse, and diminished forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio that contribute to gas trapping and lung hyperinflation. Airflow obstruction is usually measured by spirometry as this is the most widely available and reproducible test of lung function. In COPD, airflow obstruction is caused by a mixture of small airways disease and emphysematous parenchymal destruction, with chronic inflammation narrowing small airways, producing luminal exudates, destroying alveolar attachments, and decreasing elastic recoil; collectively these changes limit emptying of the lungs during forced expiration, decrease FEV1 and the FEV1/FVC ratio, and contribute to gas trapping and lung hyperinflation.

### The association and impact of radiographic, pathological emphysema and spirometric airway obstruction on patients with resectable lung adenocarcinoma [^114mkebc]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this longitudinal cohort study, we demonstrated that CT-defined emphysema has high consistence with pathological emphysema, while relatively weak association with spirometric airway obstruction. More importantly, CT-defined emphysema remained a strong predictor of PPCs and poor prognosis in patients with resectable LUAD, independently of airway obstruction.

By combining both radiological and pathological features of emphysema, the study provides comprehensive insights into how CT-defined emphysema affects patient outcomes during a 10-year follow-up period. Table 4 summarised studies that assessed prognostic value of CT-defined emphysema in patients with lung cancer. Few studies have primarily focused on radiological diagnosis of emphysema with histopathological evidence. High concordance (86.5%) between CT-defined emphysema and histopathologically matched abnormalities was observed in our study. The use of histopathological evidence to confirm CT findings lends additional robustness to the results, offering a more nuanced understanding of the correlation between radiological and pathological emphysema in LUAD patients. Additionally, the presence of CT-defined emphysema was reported to have an incidence of 18.1% in our study, which is lower than the rate among smokers (ranging from 32.3–58.0%). This is reasonable because the most common cause of emphysema is cigarette smoking.

### Multidetector computed tomographic imaging in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: emphysema and airways assessment [^116jbtCK]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex syndrome encompassing potentially overlapping diseases such as pulmonary emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and small airways disease. The management of COPD relies on distribution and severity of those processes, which clinically can manifest similarly. Relative contribution and severity of each of those pathologic changes can be assessed using qualitative and quantitative analysis of computed tomographic imaging data. Studies are under way to establish potential links among the imaging, clinical, and genetic manifestations of COPD.

### Morphological measurements in computed tomography correlate with airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1146k2jr]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the correlation between CT measurements of emphysema or peripheral airways and airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Methods

PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge were searched from 1976 to 2011. Two reviewers independently screened 1,763 citations to identify articles that correlated CT measurements to airflow obstruction parameters of the pulmonary function test in COPD patients, rated study quality and extracted information. Three CT measurements were accessed: lung attenuation area percentage < -950 Hounsfield units, mean lung density and airway wall area percentage. Two airflow obstruction parameters were accessed: forced expiratory volume in the first second as percentage from predicted (FEV(1) %pred) and FEV(1) divided by the forced volume vital capacity.

Results

Seventy-nine articles (9,559 participants) were included in the systematic review, demonstrating different methodologies, measurements and CT airflow obstruction correlations. There were 15 high-quality articles (2,095 participants) in the meta-analysis. The absolute pooled correlation coefficients ranged from 0.48 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.54) to 0.65 (0.58 to 0.71) for inspiratory CT and 0.64 (0.53 to 0.72) to 0.73 (0.63 to 0.80) for expiratory CT.

Conclusions

CT measurements of emphysema or peripheral airways are significantly related to airflow obstruction in COPD patients. CT provides a morphological method to investigate airway obstruction in COPD.

Key Points

- Computed tomography is widely performed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- CT provides quantitative morphological methods to investigate airflow obstruction in COPD
- CT measurements correlate significantly with the degree of airflow obstruction in COPD
- Expiratory CT measurements correlate more strongly with airflow obstruction than inspiratory CT
- Low-dose CT decreases the radiation dose for diagnosis and quantitative emphysema evaluation.

### Small airway disease in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: insights and implications for the clinician [^112EGWTo]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Small airway disease (SAD) is a common feature in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Chronic exposure to cigarette smoking causes inflammation, damage, tissue remodelling and eventually airway loss. These features lead to airflow limitation and defective alveolar ventilation. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with an up-to-date perspective of SAD in COPD.

Recent Findings

In this review, we will discuss the key pathological features of SAD. We also review state-of-the-art techniques for measuring SAD, including impulse oscillometry and lung imaging methods. We discuss emerging concepts such as SAD in the earlier stages of COPD and the relationship between SAD and emphysema.

Summary

The current review highlights the importance of targeting small airways early in the course of COPD to tackle disease progression.

### Bridging the gap: small airways, mechanical stress, and the evolution of emphysema [^1157CaqM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, the concepts that small airway disease may be precede the earliest kernels of emphysema and that more severe emphysema, once established, fuels further progression are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are highly complementary, as we know that the loss of alveolar attachments caused by stress-mediated structural remodeling is a primary cause of small airway collapse, resulting in increased airflow obstruction. Importantly, this analysis does not directly measure local tissue stress (force being applied). What is does show is that that local strain (how much tissue deforms with force) is actually reduced in areas surrounding emphysema. In other words, the tissue just adjacent to emphysema is less compliant, which may contribute to alveolar breakage and emphysema development. One way to think about this is that tissue characterized as small airway abnormality is a pool of "at risk" tissue from which emphysema may form. Once emphysema becomes established, due at least in part to mechanical forces, more emphysema is likely to develop within that adjacent region.

What is perhaps even more interesting are the potential implications for this body of work on treatment. There is a growing body of evidence that interventions targeting SAD, such as antiinflammatory treatments and bronchodilators, may be most effective in early COPD and may slow emphysema progression. If small airway disease is important very early on in the process, then this is when targeted interventions such as antiinflammatory therapies and bronchodilators might be most useful in potentially halting disease progression. However, once significant emphysema forms, are there other interventions that would reduce mechanical stress on the lung and potentially reduce the further propagation of emphysema?

In summary, this analysis really helps make clear that later stage emphysema predominantly progresses from regions where there was existing emphysema. These regions were determined to be less compliant. From a mechanical perspective, we know that stress accumulates at interfaces between compliant (normal) and noncompliant (stiff) regions, which creates localized high mechanical stress. This could promote further emphysema development through a positive feedback loop. However, these same surrounding regions are also high in fSAD. This study did not examine early-stage disease and does not disprove the hypothesis that early-stage emphysema arises primarily from small airway disease. This distinction is crucial because it properly situates small airway disease as an initiating factor, but it is not the only driver of emphysema once it has already developed.

### Associations of airway tree to lung volume ratio on computed tomography with lung function and symptoms in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116jirQn]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by expiratory airflow obstruction that is caused by a combination of emphysematous destruction of the parenchyma and disease of the small airways. Because obtaining pathological samples of lung tissue is too invasive to perform in clinical practice, chest computed tomography (CT) has been used to obtain separate estimations of these two pathological lesions. Emphysematous changes measured by CT is associated with worsening of lung function and symptoms, frequent exacerbation, and poor prognosis. In addition, loss of elastic recoil due to emphysema causes lung hyper-expansion that can also be quantified as total lung volume in CT. The CT-measured total lung volume has been used for evaluating the effects of pharmacological, bronchoscopic, and surgical lung volume reduction, as well as lung growth.

Although small airways cannot be visualized by CT due to the resolution limitation, measurements of the central airway dimensions are informative because these dimensions reflect the histological features of small airway disease. In particular, a small airway lumen area in COPD is an important CT finding that is closely correlated with airflow obstruction, as assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and gas trapping, as assessed by residual volume (RV), or its ratio to total lung capacity (TLC) [RV/TLC]. Moreover, these smaller lumens of the airways reduce the number of airways visible on CT, and this impaired visibility is currently assessed as total airway count (TAC), which has been shown to be associated with FEV 1, dyspnoea, exercise tolerance and future lung function decline.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^112HQBsk]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, sputum production, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) causing persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction

- COPD results from gene-environment interactions occurring over the lifetime of the individual that can damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging processes

- the main environmental exposures leading to COPD are tobacco smoking and the inhalation of toxic particles and gases from household and outdoor air pollution, but other environmental and host factors (including abnormal lung development and accelerated lung aging) can also contribute

- the most relevant (albeit rare) genetic risk factor for COPD identified to date are mutations in the SERPINA1 gene leading to α-1 antitrypsin deficiency; a number of other genetic variants have also been associated with reduced lung function and risk of COPD, but their individual effect size is small.

### Relationship of CT-quantified emphysema, small airways disease and bronchial wall dimensions with physiological, inflammatory and infective measures in COPD [^111zJEkB]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterised by the progressive development of airflow limitation, leading to functional impairment and associated symptoms. The clinical features and natural history of the condition vary considerably and traditional methods of measuring airflow obstruction do not reflect the complexity of the condition or the underlying pulmonary pathology. This has limited our understanding of COPD and consequently, there have not been the improvements in outcome seen in other chronic diseases and there are no significant disease-modifying medications. Other tools are required to help explain the heterogeneity and provide further insights into approaches to study and manage the condition.

Computed tomography (CT) can image the key pathological changes seen in COPD, including emphysema and remodelling of the large and small airways. These pathologies both contribute to airflow obstruction and therefore CT has the potential to provide vital insights into the exact nature of the underlying pathophysiology. Newly developed automated image assessment techniques enable segmentation of the lung parenchyma and airways from the chest wall and surrounding structures, thus allowing quantitative analysis of emphysema, bronchial wall dimensions and small airways disease to characterise this heterogeneous disease more effectively.

Emphysema can be visualised as low attenuation areas on CT and by applying a density mask to the lung parenchyma, the percentage of voxels below − 950 Hounsfield (%LAA < − 950) can be used to assess the quantity of emphysema. This method shows strong associations with histological measures of emphysema as well as physiological markers of disease. Using CT imaging, three-dimensional reconstructions of the bronchial tree can be generated down to the fifth or sixth generation airway, allowing analysis of airway wall dimensions. Thus far, studies have shown equivocal results, with some demonstrating thicker airway walls in COPD and others demonstrating thinner walls. This may be partly explained by the variation in methods used to describe airway wall dimensions and therefore a standardised parameter called Pi10 has been developed. This predicts the square root of the wall area for a hypothetical airway with an internal perimeter of 10 mm, giving a single value for bronchial wall thickening of the entire bronchial tree and has shown an inverse correlation with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Due to limited resolution, CT cannot image the small airways directly and instead quantification of air trapping can be used as a surrogate marker. A number of CT-derived methods exist to measure air trapping with one of the most widely used being the ratio of the mean lung density (MLD) in expiration to inspiration. In COPD, this measure has been found to correlate with a number of physiological and functional parameters.

### The pathology of small airways disease in COPD: historical aspects and future directions [^111qtKZS]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused by the harmful effects of cigarette smoking, or other noxious particles, resulting in persistent airflow limitation and symptoms including dyspnoea, cough and sputum production. The burning of tobacco cigarettes produces a complex mixture of chemicals and gases capable of reaching the alveoli. The narrow diameter of the peripheral airways means that particles can more easily collide with the surface and cause damage compared to the larger airways. The small airways have been defined as < 2 mm diameter and arise from the 4th – 13th generation of airway branching (taking trachea as 1st generation to alveoli as 23rd), but on average arise by the 8th. It is estimated that 20% of small airways below 2 mm diameter comprise bronchi with elements of cartilage within their walls, while the remainder are bronchioles or alveolar ductal spaces. Small airway disease (SAD) is a key feature of COPD, and has been studied extensively over many decades.

This article provides a comprehensive review of the pathology of SAD in COPD. We give a historical overview of key studies regarding the nature of SAD in COPD, and describe the various pathological features of SAD. We focus on clinically relevant topics, including the relationship between SAD and emphysema, and SAD in the early stages of COPD. We discuss the mechanisms which cause SAD progression, including bacterial colonization and exacerbations.

### Central airway obstruction [^111ZSnJj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Central airway obstruction is a problem facing all medical and surgical subspecialists caring for patients with chest diseases. The incidence of this disorder appears to be rising because of the epidemic of lung cancer; however, benign causes of central airway obstruction are being seen more frequently as well. The morbidity is significant and if left untreated, death from suffocation is a frequent outcome. Management of these patients is difficult, but therapeutic and diagnostic tools are now available that are beneficial to most patients and almost all airway obstruction can be relieved expeditiously. This review examines current approaches in the workup and treatment of patients suffering from airway impairment. Although large, randomized, comparative studies are not available, data show significant improvement in patient outcomes and quality of life with treatment of central airway obstruction. Clearly, more studies assessing the relative utility of specific airway interventions and their impact on morbidity and mortality are needed. Currently, the most comprehensive approach can be offered at centers with expertise in the management of complex airway disorders and availability of all endoscopic and surgical options.

### How common is airflow limitation in patients with emphysema on CT scan of the chest? [^112DzFc6]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

COPD has traditionally been defined by the presence of irreversible airflow limitation on spirometry using either the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) or American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria (lower limit of normal [LLN]). We have observed that some patients with clinical COPD and emphysema on chest CT scan have no obstruction on spirometry. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of obstruction by GOLD and LLN criteria in patients with emphysema on CT scan and determine which radiographic criteria were associated with a clinical diagnosis of COPD.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records and spirometry of all patients who had radiographically defined emphysema on chest CT scans completed at the University of Vermont in 2011. We compared spirometric criteria and CT scan factors with the presence of clinical COPD based on chart review.

Results

We identified 274 patients with CT scan-defined emphysema. GOLD criteria detected obstruction in 228 patients (83%), and LLN detected obstruction in 206 patients (75%). However, GOLD failed to correctly identify 19 patients (6.9%) and LLN failed to identify 38 patients (13.9%) (average 10.4%) who had radiographic emphysema and a clinical diagnosis of COPD. Obese patients had a lower prevalence of obstruction whether classified by LLN or GOLD. Among patients with spirometric obstruction, there were greater degrees of emphysema and more severely increased airway wall thickness. Factors that were independently associated with clinical COPD were lower FVC % predicted, lower FEV1/FVC ratio, and increasing airway wall thickness.

Conclusions

Spirometry missed 10.4% of patients with clinical COPD who have significant emphysema on chest CT scan.

### The association and impact of radiographic, pathological emphysema and spirometric airway obstruction on patients with resectable lung adenocarcinoma [^1141UdXV]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The presence of radiological and pathological emphysema predicts the occurrence of PPCs and long-term poor prognosis in resectable LUAD up to 10-years of follow-up, independently of airway obstruction. The adverse impact of emphysema on outcome of surgical treatment warrants further studies to establish optimal surveillance and treatment strategies for LAUD patients with CT-defined emphysema.

### Cell death, remodeling, and repair in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^115jqZ92]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Apoptotic cells can be detected in the parenchyma and airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in greater numbers than seen in normal lungs or those from smokers without COPD. Implications include more apoptosis and/or decreased clearance of apoptotic cells. Both epithelial and endothelial cells become apoptotic. What role does the apoptosis play in the emphysema or small airway alterations seen in COPD? In simple terms, loss of cells by apoptosis would be expected to accompany, or perhaps initiate, the overall tissue destruction normally believed responsible. Indeed, direct induction of apoptosis in pulmonary endothelial or epithelial cells in rodents is accompanied by emphysematous changes. On the other hand, apoptotic cells are normally removed from tissues rapidly with minimal tissue response, to be followed by cell replacement to maintain homeostasis. The presence of detectable apoptotic cells, therefore, may imply defects in these clearance mechanisms, and, in keeping with this hypothesis, there is increasing evidence for such defects in patients with COPD. Mice with abnormalities in apoptotic cell removal also tend to develop spontaneous "emphysema". A reconciling hypothesis is that recognition of apoptotic cells not only leads to removal but also, normally, to signals for cell replacement. If this latter response is lacking in COPD-susceptible smokers, defects in normal alveolar or small airway repair could significantly contribute to the structural disruption. The concept puts emphasis on defective repair as well as initial injury (i.e., persistent alteration of dynamic tissue homeostasis, as a key contributor to COPD), with, it is hoped, additional approaches for mitigation.

### Morphological measurements in computed tomography correlate with airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ig1qS]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, significant correlations were found between CT measurements of emphysema or peripheral airway and airflow obstruction parameters in PFT in COPD patients, both in inspiratory and expiratory CT. The range of absolute correlation coefficients between included CT measurements and airflow obstruction was 0.48 to 0.65 for inspiratory CT and 0.64 to 0.73 for expiratory CT. These results confirm correlations between morphology and function in COPD patients. The confidence in these findings is strong, as results were based on high methodological quality studies without publication bias. Thus, CT provides a quantitative morphological method to investigate the principle components of airway obstruction in COPD, with similar strength of associations with airflow obstruction for CT measurements of emphysema and peripheral airways. The strongest association was found between CT emphysema measurements and FEV 1 /FVC, especially in expiratory CT. Our systematic review demonstrated differing methodologies for CT quantification and contrasting correlations with airflow obstruction in COPD patients.

CT quantification reflects pathophysiological changes in COPD to some degree. The pathological findings of airway limitation are in airways < 2 mm in internal diameter. Such small airways can hardly be measured directly by CT because of the spatial resolution limit. However, peripheral airway (≥ 5 th generation) wall thickness can be measured as WA%. Destruction of the lung parenchyma (emphysema) can be measured as %LAA-950 or MLD. The morphological contribution from these two pathological processes is difficult to distinguish by spirometry, but is important for COPD research. The morphological information in CT quantification of the relative predominance of peripheral airway wall disease or emphysema may in the future allow more focused treatment of the predominating COPD phenotype.

This systematic review incorporated ten different CT measurements. Although a visual score was common in earlier publications, we did not discuss it, because of its subjective nature. Perc15 seems an effective measurement for emphysema, but Perc15 results could not be pooled because of an insufficient study number. Only three (%LAA-950, MLD and WA%) of the ten measurements were eventually pooled because the study number was sufficient to perform a meta-analysis. We investigated two PFT parameters (FEV 1%pred and FEV 1 /FVC) as they are the two most commonly used functional parameters regarding airway limitation.

### The pathology of small airways disease in COPD: historical aspects and future directions [^115xF5HB]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Small airways disease (SAD) is a cardinal feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) first recognized in the nineteenth century. The diverse histopathological features associated with SAD underpin the heterogeneous nature of COPD. Our understanding of the key molecular mechanisms which drive the pathological changes are not complete. In this article we will provide a historical overview of key histopathological studies which have helped shape our understanding of SAD and discuss the hallmark features of airway remodelling, mucous plugging and inflammation. We focus on the relationship between SAD and emphysema, SAD in the early stages of COPD, and the mechanisms which cause SAD progression, including bacterial colonization and exacerbations. We discuss the need to specifically target SAD to attenuate the progression of COPD.

Precision imaging for new insights into COPD pathology

The major site of airflow obstruction in COPD has been shown, by direct measurements of resistance, to occur in the small conducting airways that are < 2 mm in internal diameter 76, 77, 78. Since then, there has been much debate over the most important contributor to airflow obstruction: structural changes within small airways or loss of elastic recoil due to emphysematous destruction. To date, clinical thoracic CT scans have been validated as a non‐invasive imaging technique to correlate with regional lung function 79 and to quantify emphysema (< −950 Hounsfield Units) 80, 81. However, the spatial resolution of clinical CT scans, 800–1000 μm, does not permit the analysis of the smallest conducting airways, or parenchymal structures 82, 83, 84. The recent application of micro‐CT, with a spatial resolution of up to 1 μm, has provided the ability to resolve alveolar structures and reliably identify terminal bronchioles, with an average lumen diameter of 424 μm 85. McDonough and colleagues 85 used micro‐CT to image tissue samples from explanted lungs from patients with very severe (GOLD4) COPD, and provided the first evidence that terminal bronchioles are destroyed in end‐stage COPD, even in regions of lung with no emphysema measured using mean linear intercept (a measure for airspace enlargement). These data therefore suggested that loss of terminal bronchioles may occur prior to the development of emphysema. To test this hypothesis, Koo and colleagues 86 used a cross‐sectional analysis of smokers with normal lung function and patients with mild, moderate and very severe COPD, and demonstrated that terminal bronchioles are significantly destroyed by 41% in mild (GOLD1), 43% in moderate (GOLD2) and 69% in end‐stage (GOLD4) COPD patients. Using the robust measure of alveolar surface area, which translates to the functional tissue involved in gas exchange, the study also reported that terminal and transitional (first generation of respiratory airways) bronchioles are lost in lung tissue in which no emphysematous destruction is present, indicating that small airways disease is an early pathological feature of mild and moderate COPD.

### The association and impact of radiographic, pathological emphysema and spirometric airway obstruction on patients with resectable lung adenocarcinoma [^117YBiCs]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, up to 15% of lung cancer cases in men and 53% in women occur in never-smokers. Lung cancer in smokers and never-smokers exhibits distinct tumour microenvironment and genomic architecture. Yun et al. showed that smokers with CT-defined emphysema had over three times the frequency of prolonged air leak in patients with normal spirometry who underwent lung cancer lobectomy. The impact of CT-defined emphysema in never-smokers and those without spirometric impairment warrants specific attention.

In this cohort study, CT-defined emphysema at baseline was assessed visually and quantitatively, and was validated with histopathologically matched abnormalities on surgical specimen. Airway obstruction was diagnosed with spirometry parameters. We aimed to evaluate the impact of CT-defined emphysema, airway obstruction, and pathological emphysema on surgical complications and long-term prognosis during a 10-year follow-up period in operable LUAD patients.

### Gene therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: twilight or triumph? [^112p8G4u]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a clinical syndrome presenting as progressive airflow limitation that is poorly reversible as a result of bronchitis and emphysema. The prevalence of COPD is alarming and even more so its current and projected impact on morbidity and mortality. To date, there are no effective treatments for emphysema, nor are there efficient clinical management strategies. Existing and prospective therapies, although promising, have yet to demonstrate their efficacy to slow, halt or reverse the disease. Novel approaches using gene therapy and stem cell technologies may offer new opportunities. However, this will remain almost entirely dependent on a more thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of COPD. This review is not aimed at highlighting the vast effort of studying COPD, but rather describing the state of the field in an abstract fashion to expose the focus of research efforts to date, which has primarily been limited to predisposing factors and inflammation. We would like to draw attention to other elements of the disease, such as the alveolar remodelling that characterises emphysema. Although the main cause may prove to be elusive, carefully designed clinical treatment and management may deliver the required therapeutic outcome.

### Airway wall thickening and emphysema show independent familial aggregation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111FDYWL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Rationale

It is unclear whether airway wall thickening and emphysema make independent contributions to airflow limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and whether these phenotypes cluster within families.

Objectives

To determine whether airway wall thickening and emphysema (1) make independent contributions to the severity of COPD and (2) show independent aggregation in families of individuals with COPD.

Methods

Index cases with COPD and their smoking siblings underwent spirometry and were offered high-resolution computed tomography scans of the thorax to assess the severity of airway wall thickening and emphysema.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 3,096 individuals were recruited to the study, of whom 1,159 (519 probands and 640 siblings) had technically adequate high-resolution computed tomography scans without significant non-COPD-related thoracic disease. Airway wall thickness correlated with pack-years smoked (P ≤ 0.001) and symptoms of chronic bronchitis (P < 0.001). FEV(1) (expressed as % predicted) was independently associated with airway wall thickness at a lumen perimeter of 10 mm (P = 0.0001) and 20 mm (P = 0.0013) and emphysema at -950 Hounsfield units (P < 0.0001). There was independent familial aggregation of both the emphysema (adjusted odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–4.0; P ≤ 0.02) and airway disease phenotypes (P < 0.0001) of COPD.

Conclusions

Airway wall thickening and emphysema make independent contributions to airflow obstruction in COPD. These phenotypes show independent aggregation within families of individuals with COPD, suggesting that different genetic factors influence these disease processes.

### Gender differences in the severity of CT emphysema in COPD [^112nQUDS]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The hallmark of COPD is airflow obstruction, but this can develop on the basis of airway disease, emphysema, or both. There are gender differences in the natural history of COPD, and these may in part be explained by differences in the pathophysiology of airflow obstruction. We aimed to determine if there are gender differences in the severity of CT emphysema among COPD patients.

Methods

Current and former smokers enrolled in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham were recruited at the time of an annual screening CT examination. We recorded demographics and smoking history, and subjects performed spirometry. Subjects were classified into modified (prebronchodilator) Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stages, and their CT scans were analyzed to determine regional and total emphysema (defined as the percentage of low attenuation areas [LAA%]; < - 950 Hounsfield units). Differences between genders were examined, and univariate and multivariate predictors of LAA% were determined.

Results

A total of 396 subjects participated. Men had more regional and total CT emphysema at all stages of COPD than women (stage 0, 3.9% vs 2.4%, p = 0.001; stage I, 7.0% vs 3.7%, p = 0.015; stage II, 7.8% vs 5.5%, p = 0.063; stages III/IV, 15.8% vs 8.7%, p = 0.024). In multivariate regression analysis, only gender (p < 0.001) and FEV(1)/FVC ratio (p < 0.001) predicted total LAA%.

Conclusions

At all stages of COPD severity, men have more CT emphysema than women. This difference in radiologic expression may in part explain gender differences in the presentation and natural history of COPD. The NLST (NCT00047385) is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov; no.NCT00047835.

### The relationship between lung function impairment and quantitative computed tomography in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113Ntbpc]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic airflow limitation, and its severity is graded according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria. The airflow limitation in COPD patients is caused by parenchymal destruction (i.e. emphysema) and small airways disease with airway inflammation and airway remodeling, which leads to expiratory airway obstruction and air trapping. Emphysema has been quantified in vivo by computed tomography (CT) for decades, but in vivo detection of small airways disease has been difficult since these small airways (diameter < 2 mm) can not be visualized directly with current CT techniques. Nakano et al suggested that measurements of large airway wall thickening can be used as an indirect sign of small airways disease. However, quantification of airway wall dimensions remains technically challenging. Alternatively, air trapping on end-expiratory CT may be easier to quantify, and is possibly a more direct measurement of small airways dysfunction. For this, the main challenge is to separate air trapping due to small airways disease from air that remains in emphysematous spaces after expiration.

Separate quantification of air trapping and emphysema is relevant for two reasons. First, COPD is a disease with a wide heterogeneity, and COPD phenotyping may be possible when quantitative CT is combined with clinical and physiological characteristics. Second, quantitative CT of COPD components might gain a role in (early) diagnosis of the disease; a risk estimate for COPD may be calculated from CT data, providing additional information in subjects who undergo CT. This strategy may be especially interesting in lung cancer screening, where large numbers of CT examinations are obtained in heavy smokers. Here, CT may reveal 'hidden' disease in undiagnosed COPD patients, and might reveal disease in patients with lung function still within the normal range.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between lung function impairment and quantitative CT measures of air trapping and emphysema in heavy smokers with and without COPD.

### Computed-tomography findings of emphysema: correlation with spirometric values [^116ZA5o6]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is increasing interest in using multichannel computed-tomography scanning in the characterization of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Three distinct components - emphysema, large-airway inflammation and small-airway abnormality - have been evaluated using qualitative and quantitative approaches. Here we highlight computed-tomography findings of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and correlation with spirometric values.

Recent Findings

A considerable percentage of the subjects with emphysema detected by computed-tomography screening had normal spirometry. Severity of emphysema varies widely, even with same disease stage in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Studies of the relationship between high-resolution computed-tomography lung-attenuation measurements acquired under spirometric control of inspiratory and expiratory lung volume and pulmonary function showed that inspiratory measurements assess the extent of emphysema and that expiratory measurements reflect airflow limitation and air trapping. The evaluation using three-dimensional computed tomography demonstrates that airflow limitation is more closely related to the dimensions of small airways than large airways.

Summary

Volumetric computed-tomography scans allow diagnosis and quantification of the individual small airway and emphysema phenotypes present in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. New computed-tomography scanning techniques should provide new insights into further understanding of the heterogeneity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Relationship between lung function and quantitative computed tomographic parameters of airway remodeling, air trapping, and emphysema in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a single-center study [^112waC3p]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause considerable morbidity and consume substantial health care resources. Both airway diseases are characterized by airflow obstruction, which is typically variable and reversible in asthmatic patients but fixed in patients with COPD. However, there is overlap between the 2 conditions, particularly between patients with severe asthma and those with COPD, because severe asthma can be characterized by persistent airflow obstruction and some patients with COPD have partially reversible airflow obstruction. Similarly, there is emerging evidence of overlap between asthma and COPD in terms of inflammatory profiles, with the former typically associated with eosinophilic and the latter with neutrophilic inflammation, but both patterns were observed in subgroups of each disease.

Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) has become an established technique for airway morphometry and lung densitometry in patients with airway disease. This approach allows for quantification of proximal airway remodeling by means of assessment of airway lumen and wall geometry, air trapping as an indirect measure of small-airway disease, and emphysema determined by means of lung densitometry. QCT has been applied extensively to patients with COPD. Indeed, a systematic review in 2012 found that both markers of emphysema and peripheral airway measurements correlated with airflow obstruction in patients with COPD.QCT in patients with COPD is generally accepted as a robust method, especially for quantifying emphysema.QCT-measured emphysema has been shown to predict mortalityand has been linked to lung function decrease.QCT in asthmatic patients has demonstrated tremendous heterogeneity in airway remodeling, showing that change in lumen dimension is an important aspect of proximal airway remodelingand identifying that changes in airway geometry are associated with histologic features of airway remodeling. Whether the relationships between lung function and QCT parameters are different in asthmatic patients and patients with COPD is uncertain.

### Models of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112vckzy]. Respiratory Research (2004). Low credibility.

Pathophysiology

The presence of airflow obstruction which has a small reversible component, but which is largely irreversible is a major feature of COPD as indicated by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines. It is proposed to be the result of a combination of small airways narrowing, airway wall inflammation and emphysema-related loss of lung elastic recoil. These features differ to a large extent to findings observed in bronchial asthma (Table 1) where airflow obstruction is usually central, while involvement of the small airways occurs in more severe disease. The degree of airflow obstruction in COPD can be variable, but loss of lung function over time is a characteristic feature. Ideally, the development of airflow obstruction which is largely irreversible but has a small reversible component should be a feature of animal models of COPD, but this has not been reproduced so far. One of the important limitations of animal models of COPD is the difficulty in: reproducing small airways pathology particularly when working in small animals, particularly the mouse and rat where there are few levels of airway branching. This is a problem inherent to small laboratory animal models but provides an advantage for developing models in larger animals such as the pig or sheep. Part of the problem of analyzing small airways is also due to the lack of sophistication of lung function measurements, particularly in mice, but there has been recent development in the methodology of lung function measurement. A new ex-vivo method of analyzing the airway periphery is by the technique of precision cut lung slices combined to videomorphometry.

Table 1
Currently known phenotype differences between COPD and asthma

In addition to pulmonary alterations, other organ systems may be affected in COPD. Systemic effects of COPD include weight loss, nutritional abnormalities and musculoskeletal dysfunction. These systemic manifestations will gain further socioeconomic importance with an increasing prevalence of COPD in the next years. Therefore, these systemic effects should be present in animal models of COPD and further analysis of mechanisms underlying these systemic effects in experimental models may help to optimize disease management.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115QZ5HN]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Leveraging incidental lung imaging abnormalities for COPD screening — Airflow obstruction or emphysema are described as markers of an increased risk for lung cancer, and the severity of airflow obstruction and the presence of emphysema are both independent risk factors that may be useful indicators for triaging patients for more careful lung cancer surveillance. In individuals imaged outside of lung cancer screening, CT scans can be used to help identify individuals at increased risk for COPD and prompt consideration for spirometry. Emphysema is a hallmark of COPD and is easily detected on chest imaging by visual inspection by a radiologist or through quantitative lung density, and lung imaging may also reveal air trapping, airway wall thickening and mucus plugging; these abnormalities may not only indicate airflow obstruction but also patients that might have a more rapid decline in lung function and worse quality of life. Because quantitative LDCT analysis is often not available in clinical settings, the presence of emphysema and other airway abnormalities should raise clinical suspicion for COPD and lead to detailed assessment of symptoms and consideration for pulmonary function testing if not previously performed. The use of spirometry in targeted patients undergoing lung cancer screening or when incidental imaging abnormalities consistent with parenchymal or airway manifestations of airways disorders are found is recommended by GOLD.

### Increase attention to computed tomography findings of emphysema without airflow limitation: small airway disease is already there [^11475xtG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pre-COPD was introduced to identify subjects who do not have airflow limitation on baseline spirometry but may develop persistent airflow limitation over time without intervention. The proposed diagnostic criterion for pre-COPD includes chronic respiratory symptoms with or without structural and/or functional abnormalities. As shown in Figure 1, possible causes such as genetic factors, infection, early-life problems, cigarette smoke, and environmental exposure may cause heterogeneous pathological changes, including small airway disease, and eventually induce pre-COPD. CT findings of emphysema, airway abnormalities, and vascular abnormalities have been proposed as structural criteria for pre-COPD. A low D CO, accelerated FEV 1 decline, and preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm) have been proposed as functional criteria for pre-COPD. These criteria are built on clinical studies showing that emphysema found on CT imaging, low D CO, and PRISm in subjects without airflow limitation increase the risk of future development of COPD. However, much remains to be learned about how these pre-COPD criteria reflect pathological changes, particularly small airway disease, as small airways cannot be directly assessed by CT and lung function tests.

Figure 1.
A schema for the possible pathogenesis of pre–chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (pre-COPD) and COPD. Various factors, including genetics; infection, such as tuberculosis; environmental exposure; cigarette smoke; and early-life problems, such as childhood asthma may cause COPD, as proposed by literature. These factors likely induce heterogenous pathological changes in the lungs, airways, and vasculature that would underlie pre-COPD. Loss of alveolar attachments may link the small airway disease to emphysematous destruction in the surrounding parenchyma. The currently proposed pre-COPD is defined as chronic respiratory symptoms in the absence of airflow limitation (FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 0.7) with or without structural features on computed tomography (CT) and with or without lung functional features. PRISm = preserved ratio impaired spirometry; TB = terminal bronchiole; TrB = transitional bronchiole.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^11361sfd]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) — airway abnormalities in COPD: CT can show bronchiectasis, visible in roughly 30% of COPD patients, which is associated with increased exacerbation frequency and mortality. CT can also visualize airway mucus plugs and support a mucus plug score; higher scores are associated with poorer lung function, higher CAT score, more frequent exacerbations, and increased mortality, though scoring is not yet routine clinical practice. Measurements of small airways (< 2 mm diameter) must be inferred by comparing inspiratory and expiratory scans to identify non-emphysematous gas trapping, and small airway abnormality may be present without detectable spirometric obstruction and indicate increased risk for lung function decline.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113UWeQb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Imaging in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indicates that chest radiography is generally performed initially to exclude other diseases and establish concomitant respiratory diseases, is frequently normal in early COPD, shows lung hyperinflation and hyperlucent areas with peripheral trimming of vascular markings when abnormal, and is not performed during routine follow-up of a stable patient; computed tomography (CT) can estimate the degree and distribution of emphysema and identify bronchial wall thickening and gas trapping, correlates with lung function but has substantial interpreter variability, and quantitative techniques have not become routine clinical practice due to analytic complexity, software/algorithm differences, segmentation requirements, and lack of standardized protocols or agreement on complex measurements; CT can also help differentiate structural causes of airflow limitation, identify phenotype-associated abnormalities, and detect pulmonary and nonpulmonary comorbidities including lung cancer, with lung cancer risk increased in COPD but inversely related to the degree of airflow obstruction, and the presence of airflow obstruction should raise awareness of this risk and patients with COPD are considered good candidates to be screened for lung cancer.

### Machine learning slice-wise whole-lung CT emphysema score correlates with airway obstruction [^1149udmW]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We present two major results: First, SWES is a good approximation of the radiologist's assessment, which shows that the algorithm measures what the radiologist identifies as emphysema. Second, SWES is a better predictor of chronic airway obstruction than either the reader's visual score or LAV950. In addition, the correlation with reduced diffusing capacity was stronger compared to LAV950 and equal compared to visual scores. The absence of correlation between LAV950 and DLcoPred% in the random cohort is likely caused by the overlap in LAV950 between participants with and without emphysema and the low number of participants with severe emphysema in the random cohort.

The improved performance in predicting obstruction compatible with COPD may be explained by the greater granularity of SWES and the absence of the inter-observer variations inevitable in visual scoring. While readers estimated the emphysema extent on a 4-point scale in three regions in each lung, SWES is an aggregated continuous score for each 0.6-mm slice of each lung, using 10-point scale training data. The improved performance than that of LAV950 indicates that counting low-attenuation pixels does not gather complete information regarding emphysema in CT images.

Most previous studies using deep learning to detect emphysema in chest CT images have used smoking cohorts with a high frequency of COPD. Given the aim of the study, an important feature was the cross-sectional test cohort with low emphysema frequency. Comparison with a study by Singla et al illustrates the association between airway obstruction and visual emphysema scoring. While Singla et al used PFT results as image labels and showed that the machine learning method also predicted visual emphysema, we took the opposite approach, using visual emphysema labels and showing that we could also predict the physiological airway obstruction.

### Physiologic similarities and differences between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^11668p4T]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the physiologic mechanisms responsible for persistent maximum expiratory airflow limitation in nonsmoking patients with acute and chronic moderate to severe persistent asthma in comparison to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Recent Findings

The phenomenon of acute but reversible loss of lung elastic recoil during acute asthma is reviewed, although no plausible pathophysiologic explanation has been offered. Nonsmoking adults with stable asthma and persistent maximum expiratory airflow limitation, despite optimal polytherapy, were shown to have unsuspected and unexplained marked loss of lung elastic recoil in the absence of lung computed tomography scored emphysema. This condition resulted in up to 50% reduction in maximum expiratory airflow. Furthermore, these patients remain at high risk for adverse clinical events, including near-fatal asthma. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reduction in maximum expiratory airflow is related to variable extent of loss of lung elastic recoil secondary to emphysema and concurrent intrinsic airway obstruction or obliteration of small airways. There is also an unexplained loss of lung elastic recoil in primary intrinsic small airways disease in the absence of emphysema.

Summary

Nonsmoking patients with moderate-severe persistent asthma and patients with smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease share similar physiologic mechanisms of expiratory airflow limitation, but probably caused by different anatomic abnormalities.

### Paraseptal emphysema: from the periphery of the lobule to the center of the stage [^1145tmNf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Emphysema and small airway disease are pathologic hallmarks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), both contributing to airflow obstruction, the defining feature of this disease. Emphysema and small airway disease are both present in varying degrees in patients with COPD. Emphysema is defined as enlargement of airspaces beyond the terminal bronchioles, together with the destruction of alveolar walls. Emphysema was described in autopsies over 300 years ago, but, currently, noninvasive in vivo assessment of this feature is typically performed using imaging tools, such as computed tomography (CT). In subjects with COPD, higher-burden emphysema on CT studies has been linked to increased mortality and disease progression, substantiating its clinical relevance.

Emphysema can be classified into three types (panlobular, centrilobular, and paraseptal), all of which can coexist. The first is defined as low-attenuation regions involving the entire secondary pulmonary lobule. Panlobular emphysema is linked to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, but it is also seen in smokers, together with the centrilobular type. Centrilobular emphysema is located around the respiratory bronchioles with the coalescence of destroyed lobules in severe cases. Brian Heard was one of the first to report the term "paraseptal emphysema". He described that "the periphery of some lobules appears to have been stretched away from the thickened fibrous septa and associated septal veins, leaving thin filaments to bridge the gaps". Paraseptal emphysema is typically upper lobe predominant. CT studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of paraseptal emphysema ranges from 3% in community-dwelling subjects to 15% in smokers with COPD, and men are disproportionately affected compared with women. A large quantitative CT study has shown that paraseptal emphysema, measured as the percentage of the total lung area, increases with increasing COPD severity. A higher burden of paraseptal emphysema was associated with a higher dyspnea score, more exacerbations, reduced lung function, and decreased exercise capacity. Paraseptal emphysema is also a risk factor for pneumothorax.

### Genes related to emphysema are enriched for ubiquitination pathways [^111cpo6M]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The pathology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes 2 main components; chronic obstructive bronchiolitis with fibrosis which causes narrowing and ultimately obliteration of small airways, and emphysema with enlargement of airspaces and destruction of lung parenchyma which causes loss of lung elasticity. Most patients with COPD have both lesions although one may predominate in individual patients. Although the processes differ substantially they both lead to a common phenotype, reduced maximal expiratory flow.

One method to discover the molecular mechanisms leading to disease is to compare gene expression pattern in the organs of affected and non-affected individuals. However since the gene expression patterns that contribute to airway remodeling and to emphysema may be different, correlation of gene expression with the individual lesions, rather than with lung function, may be more revealing. The degree of emphysema can be measured microscopically as the lung surface area to volume ratio (SA/V). In the current study we identified 181 genes whose expression pattern correlated with the severity of emphysema using two samples of lung tissue with different SA/V from 21 smokers with variable degrees of airflow obstruction whose lungs were resected for small peripheral lung lesions (P < 0.05). To validate associations we examined the relationship between expression of these genes and SA/V in a separate set of 22 lung samples. 30 of the 181 genes were significantly associated with SA/V in the replication set. Gene set annotation and pathway analyses showed that genes involved in protein ubiquitination and the proteasome pathway were differentially expressed in emphysematous lung tissue. Protein analysis confirmed the abnormal accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates and the altered expression of genes involved in protein ubiquitination in the lungs of obstructed smokers.

Current research is providing new understanding in the pathophysiology of emphysema, and this knowledge will be translated in finding better modalities of therapy for patients currently affected by COPD. The single best effort that can alter the course of COPD is promoting policies to remove smoking as an available option to young people, before they become addicted and thus prey of tobacco-producing companies. Landmark studies like NETT and the GOLD initiative are providing tool classify emphysema in the context of physiological criteria and possible therapeutic alternatives.

### Airway scaffolds for emphysema-related hyperinflation: six-month results from the BREATHE trial [^115YoUAY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

For patients with severe emphysema, most approaches for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are largely ineffective. These patients and their physicians have been in desperate need of a treatment that is safe, effective, and durable and have considered many types of invasive treatment, such as endobronchial coils and airway bypass. However, only a few besides lung volume reduction surgery are commercially available, including bronchoscopic thermal vapor ablation and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with endobronchial valves. Although the use of endobronchial valves has been included in treatment guidelines, this treatment is dependent on the emphysema distribution and degree of collateral ventilation; thus, only a small proportion of patients are able to benefit.

Hyperinflation is particularly significant for patients with emphysema because it is the main contributor to dyspnea and much of the associated morbidity. Hyperinflation is associated with poor exercise capacity, impaired pulmonary function, and diminished quality of life and can contribute to appetite loss, depression, cardiac issues, and increased mortality. Many COPD treatments fail because they do not address the root cause of hyperinflation: air trapping due to expiratory airway collapse.

The EASE (Exhale Airway Stents for Emphysema) trial, which addressed hyperinflation by the creation of transbronchial passages supported with paclitaxel-eluting stents directly connecting emphysematous lung tissue with central airways, evaluated whether airway bypass could improve pulmonary function and symptoms in patients with homogeneous emphysema and severe hyperinflation. Although this trial did demonstrate proof of principle in that air trapping was reduced and pulmonary function was improved in patients immediately after treatment, it failed to show sustained long-term benefits. The loss of the initial benefits was believed to be caused by the loss of airway bypass patency (obstruction due to mucus and granulation tissue) and stent dislodgment (13% at stents were lost by 6 mo).

To address this, a novel, helix-shaped, self-expanding nitinol airway scaffold was developed. Designed to be bronchoscopically placed with one end positioned in emphysematous lung tissue and the other in more central bronchi, the scaffolds reinforce and expand the collapsible native bronchial tree, allowing trapped air to escape during exhalation. These airway scaffolds are also designed to prevent occlusion and migration, offering a durable, effective solution for releasing trapped air and improving patient symptoms.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116LJxmR]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Interventional and surgical therapies for COPD — selection principles emphasize that lung structural related therapies include airway and emphysematous predominant treatments, and that phenotyping patients with clinical, physiological, and imaging tests is critical to select appropriate candidates and in assessing the benefits, timing, and type of intervention to be performed; multidisciplinary collaboration of pulmonology, thoracic surgery and imaging disciplines are necessary to ensure quality outcomes. Airway predominant treatments are currently the subject of Phase III clinical trials; emphysematous based treatments include bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, bronchoscopic lung reduction and in select cases, lung transplantation. Surgical and interventional treatments for patients with emphysema depends upon the severity of patient symptoms despite optimized medical treatment, the specific structural abnormalities and features of the lung seen on CT imaging, the presence of pulmonary and non-pulmonary comorbid conditions, physiological assessment, and the balance of benefits and risks for the individual patient.

### Small airway determinants of airflow limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115LyQpE]. Thorax (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COPD is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterised by fixed airflow limitation. While airflow limitation in COPD has been attributed to pathology in both conducting airways and alveolar tissue, seminal work by James Hogg's group showed that small airways (< 2 mm in internal diameter) are the primary site for airflow limitation in this disease. Additional studies have shown that a reduction in the number of small airways on microCT scanning occurs prior to the onset of emphysematous destruction, suggesting that small airways may be the site where initial pathological changes develop in COPD.

Understanding the pathological features that lead to functional alterations in COPD is crucial for developing treatments that limit disease progression or restore function. While a number of histopathologic abnormalities in small airways have been reported in COPD, the relative importance of each of these features in determining airflow limitation in COPD remains unclear. To investigate the physiological impact of individual pathological changes in small airways of patients with COPD, we used quantitative histochemistry to examine all components of the airway wall, including inner (epithelial thickness, mucus plugging), mural (wall thickness, collagen and elastin density) and outer (number of alveolar attachments) compartments. We then evaluated the relative importance of each parameter in determining airflow limitation. In addition, we assessed associations between these parameters and: (1) accumulation of immune/inflammatory cells in airway walls and (2) the extent of emphysema on CT scans.

### Characterisation of phenotypes based on severity of emphysema in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112sLGdR]. Thorax (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Airflow limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused by a mixture of small airway disease and emphysema, the relative contributions of which may vary among patients. Phenotypes of COPD classified purely based on severity of emphysema are not well defined and may be different from the classic phenotypes of "pink puffers" and "blue bloaters".

Methods

To characterise clinical phenotypes based on severity of emphysema, 274 subjects with COPD were recruited, excluding those with physician-diagnosed bronchial asthma. For all subjects a detailed interview of disease history and symptoms, quality of life (QOL) measurement, blood sampling, pulmonary function tests before and after inhalation of salbutamol (0.4 mg) and high-resolution CT scanning were performed.

Results

Severity of emphysema visually evaluated varied widely even among subjects with the same stage of disease. No significant differences were noted among three groups of subjects classified by severity of emphysema in age, smoking history, chronic bronchitis symptoms, blood eosinophil count, serum IgE level or bronchodilator response. However, subjects with severe emphysema had significantly lower body mass index (BMI) and poorer QOL scores, evaluated using St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), than those with no/mild emphysema (mean (SD) BMI 21.2 (0.5) vs 23.5 (0.3) kg/m(2), respectively; SGRQ total score 40 (3) vs 28 (2), respectively; p < 0.001 for both). These characteristics held true even if subjects with the same degree of airflow limitation were chosen.

Conclusions

The severity of emphysema varies widely even in patients with the same stage of COPD, and chronic bronchitis symptoms are equally distributed irrespective of emphysema severity. Patients with the phenotype in which emphysema predominates have lower BMI and poorer health-related QOL.

### Expression profiling identifies genes involved in emphysema severity [^111aE9f4]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health burden worldwide. Smoking is the primary cause of COPD, with up to 50% of smokers developing the disease. It is frequently under-diagnosed and under-treated since its early stages are often asymptomatic. COPD patients are classified into mild, moderate and severe based on the degree of airflow limitation, which is a result of damage in the large airways (bronchitis), small airways (bronchiolitis) and or alveoli (emphysema). Emphysema affects 40% of heavy smokers and causes loss of elastic recoil, leading to abnormal gas exchange and breathlessness. Despite smoking cessation, some individuals continue to deteriorate, developing severe emphysema due to persistent inflammation and continued damage. A recent meta-analysis by Godtfredson et al suggests that former smokers with mild to moderate COPD have better morbidity and mortality outcomes. Hence, early identification of susceptible individuals would increase the opportunity for improved intervention, early treatment and prevention of progression. Patho-biological mechanisms in emphysema development include inflammation, protease and antiprotease imbalance and oxidative stress, but many pathways, both within and outside of these mechanisms, remain to be explored. In this study we used microarrays to simultaneously study multiple genes with the aim of identifying markers and/or pathways that would enable greater understanding of the biology of emphysema progression in susceptible smokers, and which could have potential as diagnostic tools or therapeutic targets.

### Understanding early COPD [^116MvcHv]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Whereas COPD is currently defined as the presence of spirometric obstruction, the pathologic changes in individuals at risk including chronic mucus hypersecretion and emphysema have been recognized for centuries. At the same time, we have struggled to define criteria that would help us identify patients at an early stage, prior to the development of pulmonary function abnormality. The concept of GOLD 0 was introduced in the hopes that symptoms would help to identify those at greatest risk for progression. While symptoms are a risk factor, in particular chronic bronchitis, the term was abandoned as the majority of individuals at risk who progress to COPD do not have symptoms. Since then, the related terms pre-COPD and early COPD have been introduced. They are similar in that the term pre-COPD identifies individuals based on symptoms, physiologic, or radiographic abnormality that do not meet criteria for COPD but are clearly at risk. The term early COPD extends that concept further, focusing on individuals who have early physiologic or radiographic abnormality but at the same time are young, thereby excluding those with late mild disease who may be less likely to progress. Whereas individuals with early COPD are now being recruited for observational studies, we are still challenged with determining the best way to identify patients at risk who should undergo additional testing as well as developing specific therapies for patients with early-stage disease.

### Association between functional small airway disease and FEV1 decline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1125GRao]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

The small conducting airways are the major site of airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and may precede emphysema development.

Objectives

We hypothesized a novel computed tomography (CT) biomarker of small airway disease predicts FEV1 decline.

Methods

We analyzed 1,508 current and former smokers from COPDGene with linear regression to assess predictors of change in FEV1 (ml/yr) over 5 years. Separate models for subjects without and with airflow obstruction were generated using baseline clinical and physiologic predictors in addition to two novel CT metrics created by parametric response mapping (PRM), a technique pairing inspiratory and expiratory CT images to define emphysema (PRM(emph)) and functional small airways disease (PRM(fSAD)), a measure of nonemphysematous air trapping.

Measurements and Main Results

Mean (SD) rate of FEV1 decline in ml/yr for GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) 0–4 was as follows: 41.8 (47.7), 53.8 (57.1), 45.6 (61.1), 31.6 (43.6), and 5.1 (35.8), respectively (trend test for grades 1–4; P < 0.001). In multivariable linear regression, for participants without airflow obstruction, PRM(fSAD) but not PRM(emph) was associated with FEV1 decline (P < 0.001). In GOLD 1–4 participants, both PRM(fSAD) and PRM(emph) were associated with FEV1 decline (P < 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Based on the model, the proportional contribution of the two CT metrics to FEV1 decline, relative to each other, was 87% versus 13% and 68% versus 32% for PRM(fSAD) and PRM(emph) in GOLD 1/2 and 3/4, respectively.

Conclusions

CT-assessed functional small airway disease and emphysema are associated with FEV1 decline, but the association with functional small airway disease has greatest importance in mild-to-moderate stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where the rate of FEV1 decline is the greatest.

### Navigating the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113RaxQi]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinically, we recognize that once people manifest a path of disease progression, they generally do not regress to another pathobiologic state. This insight is also embedded in this graphical representation. Between the disease subtype branches are central bridges for those that have not yet differentiated to a clear subtype. Here, too, we appreciate that people do not have limitless degrees of freedom in how their disease will evolve. We see that people in bridge 1 may be more predisposed to future conditions, such as parenchymal abnormalities or bridge 2, whereas those in bridge 2 may progress to severe airway disease or emphysema.

An additional strength of EPGA is the acknowledgment of time or what the developers of the technique refer to as "pseudotime". This is represented by distance along a pathway as one moves away from a node. Those people closer to the tips of the branches are inferred to have been on that pathway for a longer duration than those just emerging from a bridge between branches.

### Small airway disease in pre-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with emphysema: a cross-sectional study [^111naZ46]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Small airway disease is an important pathophysiological feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recently, "pre-COPD" has been put forward as a potential precursor stage of COPD that is defined by abnormal spirometry findings or significant emphysema on computed tomography (CT) in the absence of airflow obstruction. Objective: To determine the degree and nature of (small) airway disease in pre-COPD using microCT in a cohort of explant lobes/lungs. Methods: We collected whole lungs/lung lobes from patients with emphysematous pre-COPD (n = 10); Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage I (n = 6), II (n = 6), and III/IV (n = 7) COPD; and controls (n = 10), which were analyzed using CT and microCT. The degree of emphysema and the number and morphology of small airways were compared between groups, and further correlations were investigated with physiologic measures. Airway and parenchymal pathology was also validated with histopathology. Measurements and Main Results: The numbers of transitional bronchioles and terminal bronchioles per milliliter of lung were significantly lower in pre-COPD and GOLD stages I, II, and III/IV COPD compared with controls. In addition, the number of alveolar attachments of the transitional bronchioles and terminal bronchioles was also lower in pre-COPD and all COPD groups compared with controls. We did not find any differences between the pre-COPD and COPD groups in CT or microCT measures. The percentage of emphysema on CT showed the strongest correlation with the number of small airways in the COPD groups. Histopathology showed an increase in the mean chord length and a decrease in alveolar surface density in pre-COPD and all GOLD COPD stages compared with controls. Conclusions: Lungs of patients with emphysematous pre-COPD already show fewer small airways and airway remodeling even in the absence of physiologic airway obstruction.

### The association and impact of radiographic, pathological emphysema and spirometric airway obstruction on patients with resectable lung adenocarcinoma [^113E7wrm]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Destruction of alveoli structure and lung function are interrelated, however, their correlation and clinical significance have been not well defined in patients with lung cancer. Thus, this study aimed to examine the association among radiographic, pathological emphysema and spirometric airway obstruction in patients with resectable lung cancer as well as explore their impact on postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and long-term prognosis.

Methods

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients who performed chest CT, spirometry, and curative resection were included from a prospective three-institution database. CT-defined emphysema at baseline was assessed visually and quantitatively, pathological emphysema was reviewed on postoperative specimen. Multivariable regression models, propensity score matching, stratified analysis, and subgroup analysis were adopted to reduce selection bias.

Results

Our cohort included 902 patients, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years. CT-defined emphysema was present in 163 patients (18.1%) and most of them (86.5%) were validated with pathological evidence. 169 had spirometric airway obstruction, while only 29.6% patients overlapped with CT-defined emphysema. Multivariable logistic regression models showed CT-defined emphysema, not airway obstruction, was associated with an increased risk of PPCs (adjusted odds ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.40–3.93; P = 0.001). After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking history, tumour stage, vascular invasion, pleural invasion, multivariate cox analysis identified CT-defined emphysema, not airway obstruction, as an independent prognostic factor for OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.44; 95%CI, 1.05–1.97; P = 0.022). Patients with both radiographic and pathological emphysema experienced worse OS (log-rank P < 0.001). In the propensity score-matched cohort, stratified analysis, and never-smokers subgroup analysis, CT-defined emphysema remained a strong and statistically significant factor related to poor survival.

Conclusions

The presence of radiological and pathological emphysema in resectable LUAD was associated with frequent PPCs and decreased survival.

### Further studies of unsuspected emphysema in nonsmoking patients with asthma with persistent expiratory airflow obstruction [^115ixth1]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Previously, we and other investigators have described reversible loss of lung elastic recoil in patients with acute and persistent, moderate-to-severe, chronic, treated asthma who never smoked, and its adverse effect on maximal expiratory airflow. In four consecutive autopsies, we reported the pathophysiologic mechanism(s) has been unsuspected mild, diffuse, middle and upper lobe centrilobular emphysema.

Methods

We performed prospective studies (5 to 22 years) in 25 patients (12 female) with chronic asthma, age 55 ± 15 years, who never smoked, with persistent moderate-to-severe expiratory obstruction. Studies included measuring blood eosinophils, IgE, total exhaled nitric oxide (NO), central airway NO flux, peripheral airway/alveolar NO concentration, impulse oscillometry, heliox curves, lung elastic recoil, and high-resolution thin-section (1 mm) lung CT imaging at full inspiration with voxel quantification.

Results

In 25 patients with stable asthma with varying type 2 phenotype, after 270 μg of aerosolized albuterol sulfate had been administered with a metered dose inhaler with space chamber, FVC was 3.1 ± 1.0 L (83% ± 13% predicted) (mean ± SD), FEV 1 was 1.8 ± 0.6 L (59% ± 11%), the FEV 1 /FVC ratio was 59% ± 10%, and the ratio of single-breath diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide to alveolar volume was 4.8 ± 1.1 mL/min/mm Hg/L (120% ± 26%). All 25 patients with asthma had loss of static lung elastic recoil pressure, which contributed equally to decreased intrinsic airway conductance in limiting expiratory airflow. Lung CT scanning detected none or mild emphysema. In all four autopsied asthmatic lungs previously reported and one unreported explanted lung, microscopy revealed unsuspected mild, diffuse centrilobular emphysema in the upper and middle lung fields, and asthma-related remodeling in airways. In eight cases, during asthma remission, there were increases in measured static lung elastic recoil pressure-calculated intrinsic airway conductance, and measured maximal expiratory airflow at effort-independent lung volumes.

Conclusions

As documented now in five cases, unsuspected microscopic mild centrilobular emphysema is the sentinel cause of loss of lung elastic recoil. This contributes significantly to expiratory airflow obstruction in never-smoking patients with asthma, with normal diffusing capacity and near-normal lung CT scan results.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115rCi21]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Structural changes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — there is compelling evidence for an imbalance between proteases that break down connective tissue components and antiproteases that counterbalance this action; protease-mediated destruction of elastin is an important feature of emphysema though its role in airway changes may be harder to establish; peribronchiolar fibrosis and interstitial opacities have been reported in COPD and asymptomatic smokers; excessive production of growth factors may be present in smokers and COPD; inflammation or repeated airway wall injury may lead to excessive muscle and fibrous tissue production, contributing to small airways obstruction; the lung vasculature can also be altered even in mild disease.

### Limited overlap in significant hits between genome-wide association studies on two airflow obstruction definitions in the same population [^111Kf9rL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world and encompasses emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and small airways disease. The diagnosis of COPD is largely based on the presence of airflow obstruction, measured by the spirometric assessment (post-bronchodilator) of the ratio between forced expiratory volume in one second and forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC). The Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommends to use a fixed cut-off for defining airflow obstruction, namely an FEV 1 /FVC ratio below 70%, whereas the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines recommend to define airflow obstruction as FEV 1 /FVC below the lower limit of normal (LLN). The LLN is a reference value based on sex, age, height and ethnicity and is calculated as the lower fifth percentile of a healthy reference population. There is a considerable controversy about which definition should be used in research and clinical practice, since both may lead to misclassifications. This has important implications, since misclassifications may lead to inappropriate medication and therapies.

### Quantification of lung surface area using computed tomography [^111R2STi]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The major pathological components responsible for the decrease in maximal expiratory flow that characterize Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) include an increase in airway resistance due to small airway remodeling and obliteration, and a decrease in elastic recoil secondary to the parenchymal tissue destruction which characterizes emphysema. Separating the contribution of each of these two components can provide better understanding of the natural history of disease, allow monitoring of disease progression, evaluate the impact of a therapeutic intervention and potentially guide the most appropriate therapeutic target in individual patients. The fact that pulmonary function tests cannot separate these structural changes, and because pathological estimates can only do so in surgical or postmortem specimens, has led to attempts to use chest CT scans to measure these changes in vivo.

A number of quantitative CT lung densitometry measurements have been employed to measure the extent of emphysema including, 1) the relative area of lung with attenuation values lower than various thresholds, 2) a specific percentile point on the frequency-attenuation distribution curve, and 3) median lung inflation. However, measurement of lung density may not be the most efficient way to detect emphysema if tissue destruction is accompanied by "remodeling" of the lung parenchyma, such as fibrosis. Mishima was the first to introduce cluster analysis of low attenuation areas - a method to measure the size distribution of low attenuation regions. Although validation of this parameter against pathologic standards is controversial, we postulated that cluster analysis would supplement lung densitometry in the detection and quantification of emphysema since it is less likely to be affected by tissue deposition.

In the present study, we tested the relationship between the histopathologic reference standard for emphysema - airspace surface area per unit lung volume (SA/V), and two CT measurements: CT lung densitometry (median lung density) and CT cluster analysis. We hypothesized that the combination of the two CT measurements will be superior to the sole use of either in the prediction of SA/V.

### Heterogeneous burden of lung disease in smokers with borderline airflow obstruction [^1141UyvR]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

Our findings support the presence of early/mild disease among individuals in this discordant group and thus provide potential pathophysiologic explanation for previous studies demonstrating increased risk for COPD-related health effects in this group, including increased adjusted risk of death, COPD-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. These studies suggest that the LLN threshold lacks sensitivity, failing to identify a number of individuals with clinically significant disease.

However, because the predicted FEV 1 /FVC may decline with normal age, using a fixed cut-off ratio of FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70 increases diagnosis of obstruction in the elderly, and in very old adults has the potential to classify changes associated with aging as COPD. In a cohort of adults 80 years and older, airflow obstruction defined by FEV 1 /FVC < LLN, but not FEV 1 /FVC between LLN and 0.70, was associated with increased mortality. Similarly, small amounts of emphysema may occur due to aging-related changes rather than as a consequence of early smoking-related disease. In the multiethnic MESA cohort, full-lung CT scans of healthy nonsmokers revealed a small percent of emphysema (median 1.1%) that was increased in men and with age. CT-defined functional small airway abnormality also increases with age. Therefore, the predicted "normal" amount of emphysema and small airways disease increases with aging even in the absence of smoking exposure. An important question is how to distinguish between early/mild COPD and normal aging. In our study we used data from normal individuals to create age-adjusted upper limits of normal for both emphysema and PRM fSAD, suggesting that the CT abnormality we have identified in the discordant group is beyond that associated with normal aging. Our study extends previous findings by including innovative imaging parameters of small airways disease and comparisons with normal lung density.

### The effects of emphysema on airway disease: correlations between multi-detector CT and pulmonary function tests in smokers [^112MKTUP]. European Journal of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow limitation caused by emphysema and small airway narrowing. Quantitative evaluation of airway dimensions by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) has revealed a correlation between airway dimension and airflow limitation. However, the effect of emphysema on this correlation is unclear.

Objective

The goal of this study was to determine whether emphysematous changes alter the relationships between airflow limitation and airway dimensions as measured by inspiratory and expiratory MDCT.

Methods

Ninety-one subjects underwent inspiratory and expiratory MDCT. Images were evaluated for mean airway luminal area (Ai), wall area percentage (WA%) from the third to the fifth generation of three bronchi (B1, B5, B8) in the right lung, and low attenuation volume percent (LAV%). Correlations between each airway index and airflow limitation were determined for each patient and compared between patients with and without evidence of emphysema.

Results

In patients without emphysema, Ai and WA% from both the inspiratory and expiratory scans were significantly correlated with FEV1. No correlation was detected in patients with emphysema. In addition, emphysematous COPD patients with GOLD stage 1 or 2 disease had significantly lower changes in B8 Ai than non-emphysematous patients.

Conclusions

A significant correlation exists between airway parameters and FEV1 in patients without emphysema. Emphysema may influence airway dimensions even in patients with mild to moderate COPD.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: linking outcomes and pathobiology of disease modification [^1122RR6i]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2006). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines define chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation and systemic consequences. Airflow limitation in COPD worsens over years as assessed by the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)). Regardless, while it is likely that cardiovascular and other systemic components also worsen as COPD progresses, there are no accepted or validated outcomes to measure such pathophysiologic changes as they relate to COPD disease progression. It is clear that health status in COPD is more closely related to levels of patients' physical functional capacity than it is to changes in FEV(1). Furthermore, the relative contributions of pathoanatomic changes such as small airways fibrosis and pulmonary emphysema to declining airflow remain unknown. These features may even progress at different rates in the same individuals. Although stopping smoking is the only intervention shown to alter the relentless progression of COPD, the resultant slowing of FEV(1) decline takes several years to evince and requires at least 1,000 subjects to demonstrate annual therapeutic benefits of as little as 20 ml. The FEV(1) cannot distinguish between peribronchiolar fibrosis and emphysema and it is feasible that, as techniques are developed and validated, lung imaging methodologies may become important and sensitive outcomes measures of time- and age-dependent lung structural changes in COPD. The development of biomarkers of lung damage, pulmonary inflammation, and systemic disease will be essential to our further understanding of the natural history of COPD and the discovery of new, effective treatments for its progression.

VA/DoD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) guideline development methodology — key questions and PICOTS: To guide the systematic evidence review, the Work Group drafted 12 key questions (KQs) and the KQs followed the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing, and setting (PICOTS) framework; due to resource constraints, the Work Group selected the 12 highest priority KQs for inclusion. Using GRADE, the Work Group rated each outcome on a 1–9 scale (7–9, critical for decision making; 4–6, important, but not critical, for decision making; and 1–3, of limited importance for decision making), and critical and important outcomes were included in the evidence review; however, only critical outcomes were used to determine the overall quality of evidence. The population of interest for all KQs included adults (≥ 18 years) who have a diagnosis of COPD that includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and chronic airflow limitation/obstruction.

### Genes related to emphysema are enriched for ubiquitination pathways [^1166PM25]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Increased small airway resistance and decreased lung elasticity contribute to the airflow limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The lesion that corresponds to loss of lung elasticity is emphysema; the small airway obstruction is due to inflammatory narrowing and obliteration. Despite their convergence in altered physiology, different mechanisms contribute to these processes. The relationships between gene expression and these specific phenotypes may be more revealing than comparison with lung function.

Methods

We measured the ratio of alveolar surface area to lung volume (SA/V) in lung tissue from 43 smokers. Two samples from 21 subjects, in which SA/V differed by > 49 cm2/mL were profiled to select genes whose expression correlated with SA/V. Significant genes were tested for replication in the 22 remaining subjects.

Results

The level of expression of 181 transcripts was related to SA/V (p < 0.05). When these genes were tested in the 22 remaining subjects as a replication, thirty of the 181 genes remained significantly associated with SA/V (P < 0.05) and the direction of association was the same in 164/181. Pathway and network analysis revealed enrichment of genes involved in protein ubiquitination, and western blotting showed altered expression of genes involved in protein ubiquitination in obstructed individuals.

Conclusion

This study implicates modified protein ubiquitination and degradation as a potentially important pathway in the pathogenesis of emphysema.

### Genetics of COPD and emphysema [^114Sw95G]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

COPD is a highly prevalent disorder that results from the interplay of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures. Over the past 2 decades, significant technological advances have been made in genetic investigations of complex diseases, yet limited progress has been made in the identification of additional COPD susceptibility genes. Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, limited power due to modest study population sizes, and significant modification of genetic effects by environmental factors pose significant challenges in COPD and emphysema genetic studies. More refined characterization of the emphysema and airway components of COPD can now be obtained through the systematic use of CT scans. These improved phenotypes can be applied in genome-wide association studies and will likely lead to the discovery of additional susceptibility loci and therapeutic targets.

### The relationship between airflow obstruction, emphysema extent, and small airways function in COPD [^112adkTD]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The severities of COPD (FEV(1) % predicted) and airflow obstruction (FEV(1)/FVC) are considered to be due to both emphysema and small airways disease. To our knowledge, this has not been previously confirmed by combined measurements of emphysema and of small airway function. We hypothesized that small airways disease and emphysema extent contribute independently to the severity of both COPD and airflow obstruction.

Methods

Twenty-six subjects with COPD underwent measurements with forced oscillation technique (FOT) at 6 Hz and single-breath nitrogen washout. Respiratory system resistance, respiratory system reactance (Xrs), and expiratory flow limitation (EFL) index (measured as mean inspiratory Xrs − expiratory Xrs) were derived from FOT. Closing volume/vital capacity (CV/VC) was derived from the washout. Emphysema extent was measured as low attenuation areas < -910 Hounsfield units, expressed as a percentage of CT scan lung volume from multislice CT scans taken at total lung capacity.

Results

Subjects were aged (mean ± SD) 69.6 ± 8.0 years. Postbronchodilator FEV(1) was 64.8 ± 19.8% predicted, and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide was 50.7 ± 15.8% predicted. Emphysema extent was 22.6% ± 15.0% CT scan volume. CV/VC was 16.9% ± 7.9%; Xrs, -3.72 ± 3.03 cm H(2)O/L/s; and EFL index, 3.88 ± 3.93 cm H(2)O/L/s. In multiple regression analyses, FEV(1)/FVC was predicted by both emphysema and CV/VC (model r(2) = 0.54, P < .0001) whereas FEV(1) % predicted was predicted by emphysema and EFL index (model r(2) = 0.38, P = 0.0014).

Conclusions

The severities of COPD and airflow obstruction are independently predicted by both small airways disease and emphysema extent.

### Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2023 report: GOLD executive summary [^111wUrxc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Pre-COPD

This term has been proposed to identify individuals of any age, with respiratory symptoms and/or other detectable structural (e.g. emphysema) and/or functional abnormalities (e.g. hyperinflation, reduced lung diffusing capacity, rapid FEV 1 decline), in the absence of airflow obstruction on post-bronchodilator spirometry (i.e. FEV 1 /FVC > 0.7). These patients may (or may not) develop persistent airflow obstruction (i.e. COPD) over time. Yet, people with pre-COPD so defined should already be considered "patients" because they suffer symptoms and/or have functional and/or structural abnormalities. Currently, there is no evidence on what the best treatment is for these patients. There urgently is a need for RCTs, both in patients with "pre-COPD" and in young people with COPD. Research in this area would benefit from pediatric-to-adult cohorts and more active case-finding strategies.

PRISm

This term has been proposed to describe individuals with FEV 1 /FVC ≥ 0.7 and FEV 1 < 80% of reference after bronchodilation. Its prevalence ranges from 7.1% to 20.3%, is particularly high in current and former smokers, and is associated with increased all-cause mortality. PRISm can transition to normal, obstructive or restrictive spirometry over time. Despite an increasing body of literature on PRISm, significant knowledge gaps remain in relation to its pathogenesis and treatment.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) phenotyping — A phenotype is the observable properties (i.e., phenotypic traits) of an organism, which are determined by its genotype and modulated by its environment. A clinical COPD phenotype has been defined as "A single or combination of disease attributes that describe differences between individuals with COPD as they relate to clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g., symptoms, exacerbations, response to therapy, rate of disease progression, or death)". Only a few COPD phenotypes have been validated, including α1-antitrypsin deficiency, frequent (two or more per year) exacerbations, chronic bronchitis, and upper lobe emphysema with poor exercise tolerance after rehabilitation in patients with severe airflow limitation.

### CT-quantified emphysema in male heavy smokers: association with lung function decline [^117CoLAy]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Emphysema and small airway disease both contribute to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease characterised by accelerated decline in lung function. The association between the extent of emphysema in male current and former smokers and lung function decline was investigated.

Methods

Current and former heavy smokers participating in a lung cancer screening trial were recruited to the study and all underwent CT. Spirometry was performed at baseline and at 3-year follow-up. The 15th percentile (Perc15) was used to assess the severity of emphysema.

Results

2085 men of mean age 59.8 years participated in the study. Mean (SD) baseline Perc15 was -934.9 (19.5) HU. A lower Perc15 value correlated with a lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at baseline (r = 0.12, p < 0.001). Linear mixed model analysis showed that a lower Perc15 was significantly related to a greater decline in FEV(1) after follow-up (p < 0.001). Participants without baseline airway obstruction who developed it after follow-up had significantly lower mean (SD) Perc15 values at baseline than those who did not develop obstruction (-934.2 (17.1) HU vs -930.2 (19.7) HU, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Greater baseline severity of CT-detected emphysema is related to lower baseline lung function and greater rates of lung function decline, even in those without airway obstruction. CT-detected emphysema aids in identifying non-obstructed male smokers who will develop airflow obstruction.

### The evolving contours of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112Mmywx]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The concept of "pre–chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (pre-COPD)" refers to a heterogeneous group of conditions in which some features of COPD are present, but persistent chronic airflow obstruction, the hallmark defining feature of COPD itself, is lacking. These situations comprise functional abnormalities (impaired spirometry, small airway disease, increased airway resistance, impaired diffusion, hyperinflation, respiratory-related impaired exercise capacity), chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms (cough with or without sputum production, exertional dyspnea, wheezing, recurrent acute respiratory episodes), and imaging features (emphysema, airway wall thickness, air trapping). These characteristics are associated with an increased risk of developing spirometry-confirmed COPD, but many of these subjects will never develop COPD, and some of their pre-COPD features may disappear, especially when exposures to risk factors for COPD are removed.

In this issue of the Journal, Çolak and colleagues (pp.) describe the occurrence of COPD during follow-up in subjects with no airflow obstruction, defined as FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70, but with any of the following conditions, which they refer to as a pre-disease state of COPD: 1) symptoms of chronic bronchitis; 2) preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm; FEV 1 /FVC ⩾ 0.70 and greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal [LLN] but FEV 1 and/or FVC < 80% predicted); 3) "early airflow limitation" (FEV 1 /FVC ⩾ 0.70 but less than the LLN); or 4) asthma. They found that an increased risk of incident COPD during follow-up was independently associated with chronic bronchitis, PRISm, FEV 1 /FVC less than the LLN, active smoking history, and asthma.

### Relationship between peripheral airway dysfunction, airway obstruction, and neutrophilic inflammation in COPD [^114qi7en]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Considerable research has been conducted into the nature of airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but the relationship between proximal airways inflammation and both dynamic collapse of the peripheral airways and HRCT determined emphysema severity remains unknown. A number of research tools have been combined to study smokers with a range of COPD severities classified according to the GOLD criteria.

Methods

Sixty five subjects (11 healthy smokers, 44 smokers with stage 0-IV COPD, and 10 healthy non-smokers) were assessed using lung function testing and HRCT scanning to quantify emphysema and peripheral airway dysfunction and sputum induction to measure airway inflammation.

Results

Expiratory HRCT measurements and the expiratory/inspiratory mean lung density ratio (both indicators of peripheral airway dysfunction) correlated more closely in smokers with the severity of airflow obstruction (r = -0.64, p < 0.001) than did inspiratory HRCT measurements (which reflect emphysema severity; r = -0.45, p < 0.01). Raised sputum neutrophil counts also correlated strongly in smokers with HRCT indicators of peripheral airway dysfunction (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) but did not correlate with HRCT indicators of the severity of emphysema.

Conclusions

This study suggests that peripheral airway dysfunction, assessed by expiratory HRCT measurements, is a determinant of COPD severity. Airway neutrophilia, a central feature of COPD, is closely associated with the severity of peripheral airway dysfunction in COPD but is not related to the overall severity of emphysema as measured by HRCT.

### Effect of emphysema on CT scan measures of airway dimensions in smokers [^113LWjUe]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In CT scans of smokers with COPD, the subsegmental airway wall area percent (WA%) is greater and more strongly correlated with FEV1% predicted than WA% obtained in the segmental airways. Because emphysema is linked to loss of airway tethering and may limit airway expansion, increases in WA% may be related to emphysema and not solely to remodeling. We aimed to first determine whether the stronger association of subsegmental vs segmental WA% with FEV1% predicted is mitigated by emphysema and, second, to assess the relationships among emphysema, WA%, and total bronchial area (TBA).

Methods

We analyzed CT scan segmental and subsegmental WA% (WA% = 100 × wall area/TBA) of six bronchial paths and corresponding lobar emphysema, lung function, and clinical data in 983 smokers with COPD.

Results

Compared with segmental WA%, the subsegmental WA% had a greater effect on FEV1% predicted (-0.8% to -1.7% vs -1.9% to -2.6% per 1-unit increase in WA%, respectively; P < .05 for most bronchial paths). After adjusting for emphysema, the association between subsegmental WA% and FEV1% predicted was weakened in two bronchial paths. Increases in WA% between bronchial segments correlated directly with emphysema in all bronchial paths (P < .05). In multivariate regression models, emphysema was directly related to subsegmental WA% in most bronchial paths and inversely related to subsegmental TBA in all bronchial paths.

Conclusion

The greater effect of subsegmental WA% on airflow obstruction is mitigated by emphysema. Part of the emphysema effect might be due to loss of airway tethering, leading to a reduction in TBA and an increase in WA%.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114iSDgq]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) — emphysema assessment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): CT assists treatment planning for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and endobronchial valve placement, and CT evaluation may be used more routinely in patients with post-bronchodilator FEV1 between 15%-45% and evidence of marked hyperinflation. Quantitative emphysema assessment commonly uses the percentage of lung with low attenuation defined as voxels with density ≤ -950 Hounsfield Units, which correlates with emphysema on pathology, airflow obstruction, and risks including symptoms, exacerbations, lung cancer, disease progression, and death.

### Management of central airway obstruction: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^115Dktxd]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Central airway obstruction background and definition — Central airway obstruction (CAO) is a life-threatening disorder that leads to debilitating dyspnea and is associated with a poor prognosis, especially for proximal obstruction. It is defined as a 50% or greater occlusion of the trachea, mainstem bronchi, bronchus intermedius, or lobar bronchi. Lung cancer, the leading cause of oncologic mortality, is the most common etiology of malignant CAO.

Introduction

COPD is an avoidable illness marked by concurrent partially reversible airflow restriction and an inappropriate inflammatory reaction of the lungs to harmful particles or gases. Many studies have shown that a subset of smokers has a higher rate of decline in maximal forced expiratory flow, as indicated by the forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC (Forced vital capacity) ratio, which are necessary for normal lung functioning. Emphysema, a condition characterised by the loss of lung elasticity and small airway obstruction, a common feature of COPD, contributes to decreased FEV1 and FVC.

The radial traction of the alveolar walls and their external surface is crucial in keeping the airways within the lungs open. However, in emphysema, where there is a lack of elastic recoil, the increase in lung volume leads to enclosure. This enclosure is exacerbated by small airway obstructions, as the surface tension at the air–liquid interface within the alveoli is heightened due to the restricted airway space. Additionally, the reduced shortening of the airway smooth muscles required for airway closure further contributes to this issue. Spirometry is a test that helps in the timely screening of COPD patients suffering from persistent obstruction. However, no or very mild symptoms may be difficult to detect through spirometry before critical deterioration. Hence, understanding the various COPD individuals' lung-function dynamics is vital to avoid the overtreatment of preclinical-COPD or pre-COPD individuals. The current standard care is to treat the consequences of airflow restriction-induced mostly by the symptoms indicated earlier to alleviate the ensuing dyspnea. But presently, no method exists to stop the malady from progressing. Bronchodilators and β-receptor agonists are common treatments, although they have many side effects. The pathophysiology of COPD, the pharmacognosy of anti-COPD medications, and their drawbacks shall be discussed in this article. It focuses on the role and mechanism of Thioredoxin (Trx) in treating COPD.

Central airway obstruction (CAO) imaging and assessment — the imaging of choice for CAO is CT scan of the chest and neck to establish the diagnosis and severity of obstruction and plan therapeutic approaches and follow-up; evaluation should assess the functional limitation of airway obstruction, response to intervention, and long-term monitoring, and special attention should be paid to central airways as radiographic diagnosis of CAO is often missed or delayed.

### Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of obstructive airway… [^117MX45v]. stacks.cdc.gov (2017). Low credibility.

Details Personal Author: Description: The term "obstructive airway disease" includes several different disease entities of which the most important are asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Often included in the group is bronchiectasis. Although obstruction of the airways occurs in this disease, obstruction is certainly not the preeminent feature; bronchiectasis has therefore been omitted from this section. Physiologically these diseases fall into two groups: those with reversible obstruction, viz, asthma, and those with irreversible obstruction, viz, chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Reversible obstruction implies a 20 percent or more improvement in one or more of the several tests used to measure ventilatory capacity, eg, the forced expiratory volume in one second or the maximal voluntary ventilation.

Despite the relative precision which the physiologist brings to the study of respiratory impairment, the differentiation of the various types of obstructive airway disease still depends mainly on the history and, to a lesser extent, the physical examination. Although relatively pure forms of chronic bronchitis and emphysema exist, more often there are features of both diseases in the same person. While the ensuing description deals with each disease in its pure form, only occasionally does one find one without some of the features of the other. Despite this admixture, there is a tendency for the clinical features of either emphysema or bronchitis to predominate. Dornhorst has coined the term "blue bloater" for the person whose symptoms and signs are predominantly those of chronic bronchitis and "pink puffer" for the person whose clinical features are mainly those of emphysema.

Thus, in the past the physiologist maintained that any condition associated with a significant increase in the residual volume denoted emphysema. The internist, on the other hand, felt that the physiologist's definition was too far removed from clinical medicine, since it ignored the patient's airway obstruction and dyspnea. The radiologist diagnosed emphysema on the basis of hypertranslucency of the lung fields.

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease… [^114kyovy]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is one of the most common lung disorders in adults and includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. In COPD, the airway passages become obstructed because of inflammation and excess sputum production. With emphysema, the alveoli are partially destroyed. These problems result in difficulty breathing and decreased amounts of oxygen delivered to the body's tissues. COPD affects between 12 million and 24 million persons and is a leading cause of death in the United States. COPD affects both men and women, and the most common cause is smoking. The September 26, 2012, issue of JAMA includes an article about COPD.

This Patient Page is based on one previously published in the June 16, 2010, issue of JAMA. Symptoms Shortness of breath Cough Sputum production Wheezing Decreased blood oxygen levels and increased carbon dioxide levels Exercise intolerance Diagnosis and testing. Treatment Stop smoking. This is the most important step in treating any lung disease, including COPD. Medications may include bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics. Often, many medications are used in combination. Some persons need oxygen at night, with activity, or all the time. Pulmonary rehabilitation, including exercise, may help improve functional status. Vaccines can help prevent or minimize other diseases, such as influenza or pneumococcal disease. Try to avoid pollution.

### Definition of emphysema-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^1148u64P]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

emphysemaListen to pronunciationA disorder affecting the alveoli of the lungs. The transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place in the walls of the alveoli. In emphysema, the alveoli become abnormally inflated, damaging their walls and making it harder to breathe. People who smoke or have chronic bronchitis have an increased risk of emphysema. Emphysema is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
