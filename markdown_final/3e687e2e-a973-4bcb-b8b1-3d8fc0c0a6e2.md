## Question

For a 40-year-old woman with a stroke 7 months ago, no residual deficits, and controlled hypertension and diabetes, when should clopidogrel (Plavix) be stopped prior to surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when clopidogrel should be stopped prior to surgery for a 40-year-old woman with a stroke 7 months ago, no residual deficits, and controlled hypertension and diabetes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-recommended preoperative interruption interval for clopidogrel. Then, I should verify exceptions related to recent PCI or dual antiplatelet therapy. Next, I should review perioperative aspirin strategy and minor-procedure nuances. After that, I need to check recommendations on postoperative resumption. Finally, I should confirm anesthesia and neuraxial considerations, and whether platelet function testing or bridging is advised [^1127kqfJ].

> Let me first confirm the default guidance on preoperative interruption for clopidogrel. The 2022 ESC noncardiac surgery guidelines recommend stopping clopidogrel 5 days before surgery when interruption is indicated, which aligns with ACCP 2022 recommendations to consider discontinuation 5 days pre-op for elective noncardiac surgery, and the FDA label that specifies 5 days before elective CABG and 24 hours before urgent CABG, reflecting the irreversible platelet inhibition with recovery governed by platelet turnover [^1127kqfJ] [^112kdd5a] [^111TNykz].

> Wait, I need to differentiate among P2Y12 inhibitors so I do not overgeneralize. Ticagrelor is usually held 3–5 days, clopidogrel 5 days, and prasugrel 7 days prior to surgery; I almost said 7 days for clopidogrel — that would be incorrect for clopidogrel and actually applies to prasugrel, so I should correct that and keep the clopidogrel interval at 5 days based on ESC and ACCP guidance and prasugrel's label warnings about perioperative bleeding risk and 7-day discontinuation prior to surgery [^1127kqfJ] [^114VTJJN] [^111nCSsd].

> Next, I should review the concurrent aspirin strategy and minor-procedure exceptions. Hold on, let me verify the nuances: for high bleeding risk surgeries such as intracranial or spinal neurosurgery, even aspirin is typically interrupted for about 7 days, but for many minor dental, dermatologic, or ophthalmologic procedures, antiplatelets can often be continued without interruption; if aspirin must be interrupted for an elective procedure, ACCP suggests stopping within 7 days pre-op, balancing ischemic and bleeding risk on a case-by-case basis [^113mjNP2] [^1125CXGM] [^114YGTzE].

> I will now examine the scenario with recent PCI or patients on dual antiplatelet therapy, because stopping clopidogrel can be hazardous early after stenting. Let me think about this carefully: guidelines advise multidisciplinary discussion among surgery, anesthesia, and cardiology, with consideration to delay elective procedures if DAPT is still needed; for stents placed in the last 6–12 weeks, ACCP suggests either continuing both agents or interrupting just one within 7–10 days of surgery, and if DAPT clearly must be continued, delaying elective surgery should be considered; importantly, routine "bridging" with agents like cangrelor, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, or LMWH is not recommended during temporary P2Y12 interruption [^112ZS4UJ] [^116NB7Qk] [^112tzUr4] [^111vT1xy].

> I need to ensure I address postoperative resumption timing. The ESC recommends restarting antiplatelet therapy as soon as feasible after surgery, ideally within 48 hours once hemostasis is secured, and the ACCP suggests resuming within 24 hours after procedures that required interruption, again contingent on adequate surgical hemostasis and coordinated multidisciplinary assessment [^111FiAh1] [^112eka6M].

> But wait, what about neuraxial anesthesia considerations, where the bleeding consequence is uniquely serious. I should confirm this: neuraxial blockade should be avoided while on clopidogrel due to the risk of spinal hematoma, and if possible clopidogrel should be discontinued 5–7 days before neuraxial techniques; this is particularly emphasized in peripartum contexts but reflects a general anesthesia safety principle for clopidogrel around neuraxial procedures [^114M625o].

> Next, I should review testing and mitigation strategies. Hold on, I should verify whether platelet function testing is advised to individualize the interruption interval; ACCP advises against routine platelet function testing to guide perioperative antiplatelet management, despite some literature suggesting tailored approaches in cardiac surgery contexts, and similarly, routine bridging during P2Y12 interruption is discouraged due to limited benefit and bleeding risk [^117Ccs1H] [^114PxEKA] [^111vT1xy].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the final plan: for most elective noncardiac surgeries, hold clopidogrel for 5 full days preoperatively; for CABG, hold 5 days if elective and at least 24 hours if urgent; then resume antiplatelet therapy postoperatively as soon as safe — ideally within 24–48 hours — once hemostasis is secured; consider continuing aspirin if bleeding risk permits or required for stent protection, avoid neuraxial techniques unless an adequate clopidogrel-free interval has elapsed, and for recent PCI or ongoing DAPT need, use multidisciplinary planning to weigh delaying surgery versus carefully interrupting a single agent without bridging [^112kdd5a] [^111TNykz] [^111FiAh1] [^112eka6M].

Stop **clopidogrel 5 days before elective surgery** [^114hY8Jg] for a 40-year-old woman with a non-cardioembolic stroke 7 months ago, no residual deficits, and controlled hypertension and diabetes, per ACCP and ESC guidelines [^1127kqfJ]. This timing balances bleeding and thrombotic risks because **platelet function recovers by day 5** [^1127kqfJ] [^111TNykz]. For low–bleeding-risk procedures, consider continuing clopidogrel [^1125CXGM]; for high–bleeding-risk surgery, stop it 5 days prior [^1127kqfJ] and resume within 24–48 hours postoperatively once hemostasis is secure [^112eka6M] [^111FiAh1].

---

## Pharmacology and clinical considerations

Clopidogrel **irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation** [^111Ca7gi] for the lifespan of platelets (7–10 days); stopping 5 days before surgery allows platelet function to recover and reduces bleeding risk [^114hY8Jg] [^1127kqfJ].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

ACCP [^114hY8Jg] and ESC [^1127kqfJ] recommend **stopping clopidogrel 5 days before elective noncardiac surgery** to balance bleeding and thrombotic risks.

---

## Patient-specific factors

- **Stroke history**: Stroke 7 months ago; risk of recurrence decreases over time but remains elevated [^1124u7qP].
- **Hypertension and diabetes**: Both increase thrombotic risk, but are controlled, reducing overall risk [^112kBnsM].
- **No residual deficits**: Indicates lower immediate thrombotic risk compared to patients with active neurological deficits.

---

## Surgical procedure considerations

The decision to stop clopidogrel **depends on the type of surgery**:

| **Surgical procedure** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Low bleeding risk (e.g. minor dental, dermatologic, ophthalmologic) | Consider continuing clopidogrel [^1125CXGM] |
| Moderate to high bleeding risk (e.g. major orthopedic, abdominal, neurosurgery) | Stop clopidogrel 5 days before surgery [^114hY8Jg] [^1127kqfJ] |

---

## Risks associated with discontinuation

Stopping clopidogrel increases **thrombotic risk**, including stroke recurrence and myocardial infarction, especially in high-risk patients [^114JBPXY]. However, in this patient the risk is moderate given controlled hypertension and diabetes and the absence of residual deficits.

---

## Risks associated with continuation

Continuing clopidogrel increases **perioperative bleeding risk** [^112kQLKd], potentially leading to complications such as hematoma, transfusion requirements [^113q23HF], and a prolonged hospital stay.

---

## Balancing risks and benefits

Individualize the decision to **stop clopidogrel**, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks [^114pBZSJ]. In this patient, stopping it 5 days before surgery is appropriate given her moderate thrombotic risk and the potential for bleeding complications.

---

## Postoperative management

Resume **clopidogrel within 24–48 hours postoperatively** [^112eka6M] once adequate hemostasis is achieved [^111FiAh1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Stop clopidogrel**: 5 days before elective surgery.
- **Consider continuation**: For low bleeding risk procedures.
- **Resume clopidogrel**: Within 24–48 hours postoperatively once hemostasis is achieved.

---

Stopping **clopidogrel 5 days before elective surgery** is recommended [^112kdd5a] for a 40-year-old woman with a stroke 7 months ago, no residual deficits, and controlled hypertension and diabetes. This approach balances bleeding and thrombotic risks. Clopidogrel should be resumed within 24–48 hours postoperatively once hemostasis is achieved [^111FiAh1].

### Tailored antiplatelet therapy and clinical adverse outcomes [^114n7m8C]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical evidence regarding the influence of a tailored antiplatelet strategy on adverse outcomes has been controversial. The aim of the study was to evaluate the significance of tailored antiplatelet therapy concerning clinical adverse events in antiplatelet-resistant patients.

- **Methods**: Randomized studies assessing the clinical relevance of personalized antiplatelet treatment in antiplatelet-resistant patients were identified through a literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The primary endpoint was the composite of death from any cause and stent thrombosis. All total clinical adverse events and bleeding complications were evaluated.

- **Results**: Data were combined across seven randomized studies comprising 12,048 subjects, of whom 3,738 (31.0%) were found to be antiplatelet-resistant. Antiplatelet-resistant patients provided with tailored antiplatelet therapy showed less risk of death or stent thrombosis than those assigned conventional antiplatelet treatment (0.5% vs. 2.2%; OR (95% CI) 0.25 (0.13 to 0.49), p < 0.0001). A significant benefit in terms of total adverse event risk reduction was observed during follow-up for tailored vs. conventional antiplatelet therapy (5.5% vs. 10.0%; OR (95% CI) 0.40 (0.20 to 0.77), p = 0.006). No statistical difference in bleeding complications was observed between these two groups (p = 0.08).

- **Conclusions**: In the study, personalized antiplatelet treatment for antiplatelet resistance was found to be associated with a lower occurrence of death or stent thrombosis and a reduced risk of total clinical adverse events.

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^114PxEKA]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Platelet function monitoring is crucial due to the interindividual variability in pharmacodynamic response to clopidogrel, which affects the time needed to recover normal platelet reactivity after stopping the medication. This is significant because several studies have demonstrated that the level of platelet reactivity at the time of surgery can predict the risk of CABG-related bleeding. Although bedside platelet function testing has not been successful in guiding antiplatelet therapy during PCI to prevent ischemic events, treatment monitoring using bedside testing has been suggested as an option to guide treatment interruption. This approach may be preferable to an arbitrary delay of a specified period.

The platelet inhibitory response to clopidogrel determines CABG-related bleeding risk, and utilizing a strategy based on preoperative platelet function testing has led to approximately 50% shorter waiting times than those recommended in guidelines. For these reasons, the 2012 Update of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Guideline suggested that even a brief delay of a day or two may be reasonable to reduce bleeding and thrombotic risks in ACS patients. Point-of-care monitoring of platelet aggregation or whole-blood clot properties is associated with reduced perioperative bleeding and ischemic complications, particularly during off-pump CABG surgery. Bedside platelet function testing has been evaluated during clopidogrel exposure and might also be useful in patients treated with prasugrel or ticagrelor, as recent studies have shown for prasugrel.

In the context of medical management for perioperative cardiac risk during noncardiac surgery, particularly concerning the management of antiplatelet therapy, the ACCP 2022 guidelines advise against the routine use of bridging therapy with glycoprotein IIb-IIIa inhibitors, cangrelor, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in patients with coronary stents. This recommendation applies to patients who require temporary interruption of antiplatelet drugs for an elective surgery or procedure.

### Effects of clopidogrel added to aspirin in patients with recent lacunar stroke [^114MrDoE]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The study, known as SPS3 Clopidogrel-ASA, was published by the SPS Investigators and colleagues in 2012 in The New England Journal of Medicine. This study addresses acute ischemic stroke. The primary question posed in the SPS3 Clopidogrel-ASA study was: What is the effect of adding clopidogrel to aspirin in patients with a recent lacunar stroke?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: 3020 patients (1118 female, 1902 male).
- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with recent symptomatic lacunar infarcts identified by MRI.
- **Exclusion criteria**: MRI evidence of a recent or remote cortical infarct, a large subcortical infarct greater than 1.5 cm in diameter, intracerebral hemorrhage, disabling stroke, previous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or cortical ischemic stroke.
- **Interventions**:
	- Clopidogrel group: 1517 patients received 75 mg clopidogrel plus 325 mg aspirin daily.
	- Placebo group: 1503 patients received placebo plus 325 mg aspirin daily.
- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in the incidence of recurrent stroke at a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (2.5% per year vs. 2.7% per year; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.16).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in the incidence of death from any cause (2.1% per year vs. 1.4% per year; HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.04).
	- No significant difference in the incidence of recurrent ischemic stroke (2% per year vs. 2.4% per year; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.09).

### Consensus decision-making for the management of antiplatelet therapy before non-cardiac surgery in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with second-generation drug-eluting stents: A cohort study [^112Z2LNv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We previously demonstrated that discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy (APT) did not impact both ischemic and bleeding outcomes after non-cardiac surgery (NCS) unless it was inappropriately prolonged. POISE‐2 (Perioperative Ischaemic Evaluation‐2) is a randomized controlled study that evaluated the effect of aspirin compared with a placebo in 10,000 patients undergoing NCS. The findings of the main study demonstrated that aspirin increases the risk of major bleeding without a significant effect on lowering ischemic events. However, a subgroup analysis in patients with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) suggested that there is a potential benefit of aspirin in decreasing the risk of death or myocardial infarction by half, without a significant effect on major bleeding. These findings imply that the benefit of APT may be determined by the balance among ischemic‐bleeding risks.

The sub-study of POISE‐2 included more than half of patients treated with bare-metal stents and only 25% of patients treated with drug-eluting stents (DES). Considering the lower risk of stent thrombosis with the second-generation DES compared to bare-metal stents as well as first-generation DES, it is uncertain whether the modest thrombotic risk associated with the second-generation DES would be significantly modified by the unconditional use of an antiplatelet agent. It should also be noted that about 50% of patients with prior PCI in the POISE‐2 study were not receiving any APT within 7 days before NCS. These patients could be at a higher risk of cardiac events because they would discontinue APT for 7 more days even after surgery if they were assigned to take a placebo. In contrast, we recommend…

### Executive summary: Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^116NB7Qk]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, more specifically with respect to management of antiplatelets, ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend considering continuing both antiplatelet agents or interrupting one antiplatelet agent within 7–10 days of surgery in patients on aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor therapy with coronary stents placed within the last 6–12 weeks undergoing elective surgery/procedure.

### To pretreat or not to pretreat (with oral P2Y12 antagonists)? That is the question [^116A694k]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

As explored by Badri et al, when surgical revascularization is the intended strategy, pretreatment with a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor may lead to increased postoperative bleeding complications. Unfortunately, patient presenting features offer little insight into which patients will ultimately require surgical revascularization during their hospitalization. Thus, the early medical management of an NSTEMI requires careful consideration of the benefits and risks of these medications, timing of their use, and potential consequences of these decisions.

As may be expected, the increasing potency of the P2Y12 inhibitors has been accompanied by a higher risk of bleeding, including procedure-related bleeding. Even when clopidogrel, the least potent of the P2Y12 inhibitors, was added to aspirin in the CURE study, the bleeding risk was significantly higher than with aspirin alone. Similarly, with the progressive increase in the potency of P2Y12 inhibitors, bleeding risk has increased — compared with clopidogrel, prasugrel caused increased risk of bleeding, including life-threatening bleeding, and ticagrelor increased the risk of non-CABG-related major bleeding.

Guidelines currently recommend that P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be held for at least 5 days for clopidogrel or ticagrelor and 7 days for prasugrel before surgery (Class I, Levels of Evidence B and C, respectively). However, the guidelines also provide the recommendation that it is reasonable to perform surgery before these time points, and perhaps as early as 3 days from discontinuation.

### Perioperative management of trauma patients admitted on clopidogrel (Plavix): A survey of orthopaedic departments across the United Kingdom [^115Crode]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel (Plavix) is an anti-platelet drug recommended as lifelong treatment by NICE for all patients following stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and peripheral vascular disease. It is also indicated for short-term use following cardiac stent insertion. Clopidogrel irreversibly inhibits platelets for up to 7 days. Recommendations suggest stopping treatment 7 days before elective surgery. Evidence shows that delaying surgery beyond 4 days in patients with hip fractures increases postoperative mortality.

- **Objectives**: To determine the practice of orthopaedic surgeons in their management of patients taking clopidogrel who are admitted following a hip fracture to trauma units in the UK, with respect to its perioperative withdrawal and subsequent timing of surgery. Additionally, to perform a review of the available literature and develop a suggested protocol for the perioperative management of this rapidly increasing cohort of patients.

- **Design**: National postal survey.

- **Participants**: Orthopaedic consultants representing each unit receiving trauma patients in the United Kingdom.

- **Results**: There was a 57% response rate (139 out of 244 UK trauma units). 41% (56 units) stop clopidogrel and operate immediately, 11% (15 units) stop clopidogrel for between 5 and 10 days preoperatively, 10% (14 units) stop clopidogrel for 10 days preoperatively, 19% (26 units) continue clopidogrel and operate immediately, and 19% (26 units) have another protocol. Additionally, 15% (20 units) have written departmental guidelines, and 2% (3 units) quoted published evidence for their practice.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrates a wide variety of practices, largely based on anecdotal evidence.

### Ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack [^1141sytr]. Circulation (2012). High credibility.

Patients with acute coronary syndromes and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have an increased rate of recurrent cardiac events and intracranial hemorrhages.

- **Methods and results**: We evaluated the treatment effects of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome, with and without a history of prior stroke or TIA, in the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial. Of the 18,624 randomized patients, 1,152 (6.2%) had a history of stroke or TIA. Such patients had higher rates of myocardial infarction (11.5% versus 6.0%), death (10.5% versus 4.9%), stroke (3.4% versus 1.2%), and intracranial bleeding (0.8% versus 0.2%) than patients without a prior stroke or TIA. Among patients with a history of stroke or TIA, the reduction of the primary composite outcome and total mortality at 1 year with ticagrelor versus clopidogrel was consistent with the overall trial results: 19.0% versus 20.8% (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.13; interaction P = 0.84) and 7.9% versus 13.0% (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.91). The overall PLATO-defined bleeding rates were similar: 14.6% versus 14.9% (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.71–1.37), and intracranial bleeding occurred infrequently (4 versus 4 cases, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with acute coronary syndrome with a prior history of ischemic stroke or TIA had higher rates of clinical outcomes than patients without prior stroke or TIA. However, the efficacy and bleeding results of ticagrelor in these high-risk patients were consistent with the overall trial findings.

### Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines for management of extracranial cerebrovascular disease [^111TsPtw]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Management of carotid bifurcation stenosis in stroke prevention has been the subject of extensive investigations, including multiple randomized controlled trials. The proper treatment of patients with carotid bifurcation disease is of major interest to vascular surgeons and other vascular specialists. In 2011, the Society for Vascular Surgery published guidelines for the treatment of carotid artery disease. At the time, several randomized trials comparing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) were reported.

Since the 2011 guidelines, several studies and a few systematic reviews comparing CEA and CAS have been reported, and the role of medical management has been reemphasized. In the present publication, we have updated and expanded on the 2011 guidelines with specific emphasis on five areas:

- **Is CEA recommended over maximal medical therapy for low-risk patients**: Evaluation of whether CEA is preferable to maximal medical therapy for these patients is included.
- **Is CEA recommended over transfemoral CAS for low surgical risk patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis of > 50%**: This guideline assesses the preference between CEA and CAS in this patient group.
- **The timing of carotid intervention for patients presenting with acute stroke**: Recommendations are specified for when intervention should occur for these patients.
- **Screening for carotid artery stenosis in asymptomatic patients**: The guideline addresses whether and how to conduct screening in asymptomatic individuals.
- **The optimal sequence of intervention for patients with combined carotid and coronary artery disease**: Considerations for managing these complex cases are detailed.

A separate implementation document will address other important clinical issues in extracranial cerebrovascular disease. Recommendations are made using the GRADE (grades of recommendation assessment, development, and evaluation) approach, as was used for other Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines.

### Prasugrel [^114cBf2E]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warning: Bleeding risk**: Prasugrel can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. It should not be used in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

For patients aged 75 years or older, prasugrel is generally not recommended due to the increased risk of fatal and intracranial bleeding, as well as uncertain benefits. Exceptions include high-risk situations, such as patients with diabetes or a history of prior myocardial infarction (MI), where the benefits might outweigh the risks, and its use may be considered [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Do not initiate prasugrel in patients likely to require urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue prasugrel at least 7 days prior to any surgery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Additional risk factors for bleeding** include: body weight under 60 kg, propensity to bleed, and the concomitant use of medications that heighten bleeding risk (e.g. warfarin, heparin, fibrinolytic therapy, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Consider bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CABG, or other surgical procedures in the presence of prasugrel [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing prasugrel, especially during the first few weeks after acute coronary s…

### Discontinuation of preoperative clopidogrel is unnecessary in peripheral arterial surgery [^116L8A6S]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The optimal management of preoperative clopidogrel remains controversial, as vascular surgeons are increasingly encountering patients treated with clopidogrel as part of dual antiplatelet therapy. Practice differs considerably, from cessation of the medication at least 5 days before surgery to proceeding with surgery without delay. The purpose of this prospective, nonrandomized, comparative study was to determine the effect of preoperative exposure to clopidogrel and aspirin on perioperative bleeding complications in patients undergoing open arterial surgery.

Data were collected prospectively on 647 consecutive major arterial procedures from 2005 through mid-2012. Patients were classified into two groups: the clopidogrel group consisted of 305 procedures performed in 269 patients who were maintained, after obtaining informed consent, on dual clopidogrel and aspirin up to the time of surgery. The no-clopidogrel group consisted of 342 procedures completed in 298 patients who were taking neither medication together or were taking aspirin alone. The primary composite endpoint was reoperation for bleeding and bleeding-related death. Secondary endpoints included blood transfusion requirements, hematoma formation, procedure duration, as well as hospital and intensive care unit length of stay.

The patients taking clopidogrel had a higher cardiovascular risk profile and a higher prevalence of prior peripheral and coronary stents (P < .0001). Clopidogrel use was common across all operation categories: 59% of carotid endarterectomy patients.

### Balancing the risks and benefits of long-term antiplatelet therapies for cardiovascular disease: Clinical, research, and regulatory implications [^113nRWhY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Balancing the risks and benefits with combinations of antiplatelet therapies for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease is an evolving and challenging conundrum. Although treatment regimens with DAPT and those with vorapaxar plus aspirin or vorapaxar plus DAPT have been shown to reduce ischemic events, there has been a consistent increase in major bleeding events with additional and/or intensified antiplatelet agents beyond aspirin as a cornerstone therapy. Major bleeding events are clearly associated with a higher risk of mortality and other ischemic events, but the mechanisms behind this association are complex and likely related to multiple factors, including patient comorbidities that track with bleeding risk (e.g. advanced age, renal insufficiency), adverse consequences of premature discontinuation of antiplatelet agents following a major bleeding event, and residual confounding.

Patients with prior stroke are an especially vulnerable group because they are at a disproportionate increased risk of bleeding, specifically intracranial hemorrhage, if treated with intensified antiplatelet therapy or combinations of antiplatelet agents. The ACC/AHA non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome practice guidelines provide a glimpse into the challenging nature of decision-making for individual patients by designating a class IIaC recommendation for shorter durations of DAPT following stent implantation (< 12 months) if the perceived risks of morbidity associated with bleeding outweigh the potential benefits of the recommended 12 months of DAPT.

### Balancing benefits and risks of long-term antiplatelet therapy in noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or stroke [^111CW7Sa]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Lifelong treatment with antiplatelet drugs is recommended following a transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke. However, bleeding complications may offset the benefit of antiplatelet drugs in patients who have an increased risk of bleeding and a low risk of re-ischemic events. This study aims to investigate the net benefit of antiplatelet treatment according to an individual's bleeding risk.

- **Methods**: We pooled individual patient data from six randomized clinical trials: CAPRIE (Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events), ESPS-2 (European Stroke Prevention Study-2), MATCH (Management of Atherothrombosis with Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients), CHARISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and Avoidance), ESPRIT (European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischemia Trial), and PRoFESS (Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes). The focus was on investigating antiplatelet therapy in the subacute or chronic phase after noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or stroke. Patients were stratified into quintiles based on their predicted risk of major bleeding using the S2TOP-BLEED score. The annual risk of major bleeding and re-ischemic events was assessed per quintile for four scenarios: (1) aspirin monotherapy, (2) aspirin-clopidogrel versus aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy, (3) aspirin-dipyridamole versus clopidogrel, and (4) aspirin versus clopidogrel. Net benefit was calculated for the second, third, and fourth scenarios.

### Is clopidogrel stopped prior to hip fracture surgery — A survey of current practice in the United Kingdom [^1171xgLF]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is an anti-platelet agent which causes an increase in bleeding time. An increasing number of patients presenting with an acute femoral neck fracture take clopidogrel in combination with other anti-platelet agents as regular prescription medication. Such patients may be at higher risk of increased peri-operative bleeding. No guidelines or recommendations currently exist regarding the routine discontinuation of clopidogrel in patients with a fracture of the femoral neck awaiting surgery.

- **Methods**: A telephone questionnaire was undertaken to examine the practice amongst 110 orthopedic departments in the UK regarding the discontinuation of clopidogrel prior to trauma surgery for femoral neck fractures. This was compared to the practice of discontinuing aspirin and warfarin in the same patient groups in these departments.

- **Results**: There appears to be significant variation in practice amongst orthopedic departments, with 43.6% having a policy of discontinuing clopidogrel. This compares to 37.3% of trusts having a policy of stopping aspirin and 97.3% stopping warfarin.

- **Conclusion**: There is wide variation in practice regarding the discontinuation of clopidogrel preoperatively in patients due to undergo surgery for femoral neck fractures. These findings highlight the need to develop guidelines for the preoperative management of these patients.

### Multiple versus fewer antiplatelet agents for preventing early recurrence after ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^115NWiMF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Antiplatelet agents are considered the cornerstone for secondary prevention of stroke; however, the role of using multiple antiplatelet agents early after stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) to improve outcomes has not been established.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of initiating, within 72 hours after an ischaemic stroke or TIA, multiple antiplatelet agents versus fewer antiplatelet agents to prevent stroke recurrence. The analysis explores the evidence for different drug combinations.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 6 July 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 7 of 12, 2020) [last searched 6 July 2020], MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946 to 6 July 2020), Embase (1980 to 6 July 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP. We also searched the reference lists of identified studies and reviews and used the Science Citation Index Cited Reference search for forward tracking of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of multiple versus fewer antiplatelet agents initiated within 72 hours after stroke or TIA.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data from eligible studies for the primary outcomes of stroke recurrence and vascular death, and secondary outcomes of myocardial infarction; composite outcome of stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death; intracranial haemorrhage; extracranial haemorrhage.

### Coronary artery bypass grafting-related bleeding complications in patients treated with ticagrelor or clopidogrel: A nationwide study [^1133EV8r]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The main finding of this nationwide registry study was that discontinuation of the platelet inhibitor 3 days before surgery, as opposed to 5 days, did not increase the incidence of major bleeding complications in ticagrelor-treated patients, but increased the incidence in clopidogrel-treated patients. In addition, a lower incidence of major bleeding complications was observed in ticagrelor-treated patients, except when the platelet inhibitor was discontinued less than 72 hours before surgery.

The timing of discontinuation of the platelet inhibitor is influenced by several factors, including institutional guidelines, the patient's condition, logistical reasons, and the individual surgeon's decision. This is illustrated in the present study, where 45% of the clopidogrel patients and 33% of the ticagrelor patients were operated on following a shorter discontinuation period than the 5 days recommended in the guidelines. This variation was used to compare the incidence of major bleeding complications after different discontinuation times.

The data in the present study were collected during 2012 and 2013. During this period, ticagrelor replaced clopidogrel as the first-choice P2Y12-receptor antagonist for ACS patients in the Swedish guidelines. The introduction of ticagrelor did not occur simultaneously in all parts of Sweden; instead, there was a gradual increase in the use of ticagrelor over time. Consequently, during this period, there were ACS patients with the same characteristics treated with either ticagrelor or clopidogrel.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy up to the time of non-elective coronary artery bypass grafting with prophylactic platelet transfusion: Is it safe [^113XBnUr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Guidelines suggest that patients discontinue clopidogrel at least 5 days prior to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for myocardial infarction (MI) if not treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). We sought to assess pre- and post-operative outcomes of patients maintained on clopidogrel and aspirin up to the time of surgery and compare them with those on aspirin alone.

- **Methods**: From the cardiac surgery database, 240 patients were retrospectively registered between January and May 2017. There were 126 patients with ACS who underwent CABG on DAPT (clopidogrel group [CG]) and 114 patients who underwent elective CABG on aspirin alone (control). The CG received intraoperative prophylactic platelet transfusion (PPT). Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory data were prospectively entered at the time of surgery and were subsequently retrieved for analysis. Per and postoperative findings were identified and compared between both groups.

- **Results**: The cohort consisted of 240 patients (mean age 61 years, 81.3% were male, SD ± 9.58). Patients in the CG were younger (median 57 vs. 63, P-value 0.001), and with male predominance (86% versus 75%, P-value 0.028). In addition, they had less prevalence of diabetes and renal failure compared to the control group (P-values 0.003, and 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences between both groups in the number of vessel grafts, duration of on-pump procedure, and aortic clamp time. Hematologic laboratory data also showed similar baseline values. The CG had a similar bleeding rate.

### Perioperative management of patients on chronic antithrombotic therapy [^114pBZSJ]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy is a situation that occurs frequently and requires consideration of the patient, the procedure, and an expanding array of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents. Preoperative assessment must address each patient's risk for thromboembolic events balanced against the risk for perioperative bleeding.

Procedures can be separated into those with a low bleeding risk, which generally do not require complete reversal of the antithrombotic therapy, and those associated with an intermediate or high bleeding risk. For patients who are receiving warfarin and need interruption of the anticoagulant, consideration must be given to whether simply withholding the anticoagulant is the optimal approach or whether a perioperative "bridge" with an alternative agent, typically a low-molecular-weight heparin, should be used.

The new oral anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have shorter effective half-lives, but they introduce other concerns for perioperative management, including prolonged drug effect in patients with renal insufficiency, limited experience with clinical laboratory testing to confirm lack of residual anticoagulant effect, and lack of a reversal agent.

Antiplatelet agents must also be considered in the perioperative setting, with particular consideration given to the potential risk for thrombotic complications in patients with coronary artery stents who have antiplatelet therapy withheld.

### Antithrombotic dilemmas in stroke medicine: New data, unsolved challenges [^112zLouk]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy is a key element of secondary prevention in patients who have had an ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. However, its use in clinical practice is not always straightforward. This review provides an update on certain difficult scenarios in antithrombotic management, focusing on recent clinical trials and large observational studies.

- **Approach**: We discuss the approach to patients with an indication for antithrombotic treatment who also have clinical or radiological evidence of previous intracranial bleeding.
- **Combined treatment indications**: Patients with indications for both anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment are considered, along with patients in whom antithrombotic treatment fails to prevent stroke.
- **Timing and use**: We also review the timing of anticoagulation initiation after cardioembolic stroke, and the use of antithrombotics in patients with asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease.

Despite a wealth of new evidence, numerous uncertainties remain, and we highlight ongoing trials addressing these challenges.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hHnUc]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Two reviewers independently screened the title, abstract, and full-text levels of potentially eligible studies. A third team member reviewed all final decisions, and the team resolved disagreements through discussion. This process also applied to risk of bias ratings and the extraction of key variables, such as the number of events. When reports omitted data that we considered important, we contacted authors for clarification and additional information.

Two reviewers independently extracted several data points using a predesigned data extraction form: characteristics of the enrolled patient population, a description of the intervention and control, and the description and event rate of patient-important outcomes. To determine the timeframe of any apparent benefit, we reviewed incidence curves presented in the primary studies.

To address the risk of bias, we used a modified version of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials. We assessed the generation for random sequence, concealment for allocation sequence, and blinding of participants, healthcare providers, data collectors, and outcome assessors or adjudicators, or both. We also examined incomplete outcome data, such as missing or lost to follow-up, and judged a low risk of bias if the rate of missing data was lower than 10%. Other potential sources of bias, such as early trial discontinuation, were also considered.

We rated the overall risk of bias for each study as the highest risk of bias for any criterion. We evaluated the risk of bias on an outcome-by-outcome basis and noted any differences across outcomes.

### Superiority of clopidogrel versus aspirin in patients with prior cardiac surgery [^116N23jE]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

After coronary artery bypass surgery, patients experience a high cumulative rate of graft closure and re-ischemic events. We sought to determine whether antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel would be more effective than aspirin, the accepted standard, in these patients.

- **Methods and results**: The event rates for all-cause mortality, vascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and rehospitalization were determined for the 1,480 patients with a history of cardiac surgery randomized to either clopidogrel or aspirin in a trial of 19,185 patients. The event rate per year of vascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or rehospitalization was 22.3% in the 705 patients randomized to aspirin and 15.9% in the 775 patients randomized to clopidogrel (P = 0.001). A risk reduction was also seen in each of the individual endpoints examined, including a 42.8% relative risk reduction in vascular death in patients on clopidogrel versus aspirin (P = 0.030). In a multivariate model incorporating baseline clinical characteristics, clopidogrel therapy was independently associated with a decrease in vascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or rehospitalization in patients with a history of cardiac surgery, with a 31.2% relative risk reduction (95% CI, 15.8 to 43.8; P = 0.0003). Although clopidogrel therapy was efficacious in the entire Clopidogrel Versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events (CAPRIE) population, multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients with previous cardiac surgery derived particular benefit (P = 0.015).

### CYP2C19 metabolizer status and clopidogrel efficacy in the secondary prevention of small subcortical strokes (SPS3) study [^1166JZfk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The SPS3 study is an international multicenter randomized clinical trial evaluating antiplatelet and antihypertensive approaches to prevent stroke recurrence (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00059306). The design of the SPS3 has been described previously. Briefly, 3020 individuals with a recent (within the last six months) symptomatic small subcortical stroke or transient ischemic attack with a corresponding infarct on magnetic resonance imaging were recruited and randomized into the study in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Participants were assigned to antiplatelet treatment with either 325 mg aspirin daily plus placebo or 325 mg aspirin plus 75 mg clopidogrel daily, and to a systolic blood pressure target of higher (130 to 149 mm Hg) or lower (< 130 mm Hg). The antiplatelet treatment arm was double-blinded.

The primary outcome of the study was the time to restroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). Secondary outcomes included the rate of cognitive decline and major vascular events, such as ischemic strokes, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding (major extracranial hemorrhage), which was defined as serious or life-threatening bleeding requiring transfusion of red cells or surgery, or resulting in permanent functional sequelae or death. All primary events, the primary safety outcome, and most secondary outcomes were adjudicated by a blinded events-adjudication committee. The average follow-up time in the antiplatelet arm was 3.4 years (range 0 to 8.2 years).

The SPS3-Genetic Substudy (SPS3-GENES) collected DNA from saliva samples using OG-500.

### Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular events: a population-based cohort study [^114S4K7T]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

We conducted a population-based cohort study involving consecutive patients who were the first during the study period to experience acute transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction. These patients were treated with antiplatelet drugs, either newly initiated or continued, as part of the Oxford Vascular Study (OXVASC) from 2002 to 2012, with follow-up extending to 2013. OXVASC is a comprehensive study examining the incidence and outcomes of all acute vascular events within a population of 92,728 individuals, regardless of age, registered with 100 general practitioners across nine general practices in Oxfordshire, UK. Detailed definitions of vascular events and the exhaustive methods used to ensure nearly complete ascertainment of individuals with transient ischemic attack, stroke, or myocardial infarction are provided in the appendix and have been previously reported.

We excluded patients who initiated or continued oral anticoagulants following an event, but included those who, following a premorbid period on oral anticoagulants, were switched to antiplatelet therapy post-event. Patients commencing anticoagulants during subsequent follow-up were censored at the start of permanent anticoagulation. Exclusions also included patients not administered antithrombotic drugs due to recent bleeding, coagulation disorders, known allergies, other bleeding tendencies, or decisions for palliative care. Informed consent or assent from relatives was obtained from all participants, with OXVASC receiving approval from the local ethics committee.

### Prasugrel [^114Crd2J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **General risk of bleeding**: Thienopyridines, including prasugrel, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on prasugrel than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures, even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.

Do not use prasugrel in patients with active bleeding or prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding include:

- **Age ≥ 75 years**: Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of prasugrel is generally not recommended, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14)].

- **CABG or other surgical procedure**.

- **Body weight**.

### Ticlopidine hydrochloride [^1171S4vY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016). Low credibility.

Ticlopidine should be used with caution in patients who may be at risk of increased bleeding from trauma, surgery, or pathological conditions. If it is desired to eliminate the antiplatelet effects of ticlopidine prior to elective surgery, the drug should be discontinued 10 to 14 days prior to surgery. Several controlled clinical studies have found increased surgical blood loss in patients undergoing surgery during treatment with ticlopidine. In TASS and CATS, it was recommended that patients discontinue ticlopidine prior to elective surgery. Several hundred patients underwent surgery during the trials, and no excessive surgical bleeding was reported.

Prolonged bleeding time is normalized within 2 hours after administration of 20 mg methylprednisolone IV. Platelet transfusions may also be used to reverse the effect of ticlopidine on bleeding. Because platelet transfusions may accelerate thrombosis in patients with TTP on ticlopidine, they should, if possible, be avoided.

- **GI bleeding**: Ticlopidine prolongs template bleeding time. The drug should be used with caution in patients who have lesions with a propensity to bleed, such as ulcers. Drugs that might induce such lesions should also be used with caution in patients on ticlopidine.

- **Use in hepatically impaired patients**: Since ticlopidine is metabolized by the liver, dosing of ticlopidine or other drugs metabolized in the liver may require adjustment upon starting or stopping concomitant therapy. There is limited experience in patients with severe hepatic disease, who may have bleeding issues.

### Perioperative management of patients on chronic antithrombotic therapy [^111Ca7gi]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy frequently arises and requires consideration of the patient, the procedure, and an expanding array of anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents. Preoperative assessment must address each patient's risk for thromboembolic events balanced against the risk for perioperative bleeding.

- **Procedures classification**: Procedures can be separated into those with a low bleeding risk, which generally do not require complete reversal of the antithrombotic therapy, and those associated with an intermediate or high bleeding risk.

- **Warfarin management**: For patients receiving warfarin who need interruption of the anticoagulant, consideration must be given to whether simply withholding the anticoagulant is the optimal approach or whether a perioperative "bridge" with an alternative agent, typically a low-molecular-weight heparin, should be used.

- **New oral anticoagulants**: The new oral anticoagulants dabigatran and rivaroxaban have shorter effective half-lives, but they introduce other concerns for perioperative management. These concerns include prolonged drug effect in patients with renal insufficiency, limited experience with clinical laboratory testing to confirm the lack of residual anticoagulant effect, and lack of a reversal agent.

### Effects of aspirin on risk and severity of early recurrent stroke after transient ischaemic attack and ischaemic stroke: time-course analysis of randomised trials [^114UY3bb]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Aspirin also reduced the severity of recurrent ischaemic stroke during the 6 weeks after randomisation (Figure 3), with a similar effect seen at 12 weeks and when analyses were based only on an mRS score higher than 2 (Figure 3). Consequently, aspirin reduced the 6-week risk of disabling or fatal (mRS score > 2) ischaemic stroke by about 70% (Table 1; p het = 0.91) and the risk of very severe (mRS score 4–6) ischaemic stroke by about 75% (26 of 8452 participants in the active group had an event vs. 92 of 7326 in the control group; HR 0.25, 0.16–0.39, p < 0.0001), but had less effect on non-disabling (mRS ≤ 2) stroke (48 of 8452 participants had an event vs. 65 of 7326; HR 0.64, 0.44–0.93, p = 0.020).

Benefit continued to accrue for the risk of disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke up to 12 weeks follow-up (Table 1, Figure 1, Figure 2), but the greatest reduction was seen within the first 2 weeks, particularly in patients presenting with TIA and minor stroke. In the aspirin group with TIA or minor stroke, two of 6691 participants had a disabling or fatal ischaemic stroke versus 23 of 5726 in the control group (95% CI HR 0.07, 0.02–0.31, p = 0.0004; Figure 1).

Aspirin also reduced the early risks of any recurrent stroke, fatal stroke, and acute myocardial infarction (Table 1). There was no increase in the 12-week risk of intracerebral haemorrhage on low-dose aspirin versus control (three of 4125 participants in the active group had an event vs. five of 4137 in the control group), but there was a trend towards a higher risk for high-dose aspirin compared with control (five of 4297 vs. one of 3159; HR 3.68, 95% CI).

### Management of surgical patients receiving anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents [^113k8yRZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Temporary interruption of long-term anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy during surgical procedures exposes patients to thrombotic risk. Continuation of these agents, however, is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Managing anticoagulation can be a particular challenge in the emergency setting.

- **Methods**: A literature review of published articles sourced using the keywords heparin, warfarin, perioperative, antiplatelet, aspirin, and surgery was undertaken. A management plan for all likely situations was developed.

- **Results and conclusion**: Based on an individual assessment of risk factors for arterial or venous thromboembolism and the risk of perioperative bleeding, it is possible to form an anticoagulant and antiplatelet management plan likely to achieve a low incidence of bleeding and thrombosis. A multidisciplinary approach is desirable.

### Prasugrel [^111nCSsd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warning: Bleeding risk**: Prasugrel can cause significant, sometimes fatal, bleeding. It is crucial to see full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning.

- **Contraindications**: Do not use prasugrel in patients with active pathological bleeding or a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. In patients aged 75 years or older, prasugrel is generally not recommended, except in high-risk patients such as those with diabetes or a prior myocardial infarction (MI), where its use may be considered.

- **Surgical considerations**: Do not start prasugrel in patients who are likely to undergo urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). When possible, discontinue prasugrel at least 7 days prior to any surgery.

- **Additional bleeding risk factors**: These include a body weight of less than 60 kg, a propensity to bleed, and concomitant use of medications that increase the risk of bleeding. Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone invasive or surgical procedures.

- **Management of bleeding**: If possible, manage bleeding without discontinuing prasugrel, as stopping it increases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.

### A meta-analysis of the impact of aspirin, clopidogrel, and dual antiplatelet therapy on bleeding complications in noncardiac surgery [^113q23HF]. Annals of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the bleeding risks associated with single (aspirin) and dual (aspirin + clopidogrel) antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus placebo or no treatment in adults undergoing noncardiac surgery. The impact of antiplatelet therapy on bleeding during noncardiac surgery remains controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to examine the risk associated with single and DAPT.

A systematic review of antiplatelet therapy, noncardiac surgery, and perioperative bleeding was performed. Peer-reviewed sources and meeting abstracts from relevant societies were queried. Studies without a control group or those that only examined patients with coronary stents were excluded. The primary endpoints were transfusion and reintervention for bleeding.

Of 11,592 references, 46 studies met inclusion criteria. In a meta-analysis of over 30,000 patients, the relative risk (RR) of transfusion versus control was 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–1.26, P = 0.009] for aspirin, and 1.33 (1.15–1.55, P = 0.001) for DAPT. Clopidogrel had an elevated risk, but data were too heterogeneous to analyze. The RR of bleeding requiring reintervention was not significantly higher for any agent compared to control [RR 0.96 (0.76–1.22, P = 0.76) for aspirin, 1.84 (0.87–3.87, P = 0.11) for clopidogrel, and 1.51 (0.92–2.49, P = 0.1) for DAPT]. Subanalysis of thoracic and abdominal procedures was similar. There was no difference in RR for myocardial infarction [1.06 (0.79–1.43)], stroke [0.97 (0.71–1.33)], or mortality [0.97 (0.87–1.1)].

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with a coronary stent who need noncardiac surgery: A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^112DCvAD]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

It is unclear how to appropriately manage discontinuation and resumption of antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary stents who need noncardiac surgery. We undertook a systematic review of the literature to identify practice guideline statements regarding antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary stents undergoing noncardiac surgery.

- **Methods**: We used six search strategies to identify practice guideline statements that comment on perioperative antiplatelet management for patients with coronary stents undergoing noncardiac surgery. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility, abstracted data, and completed quality assessment.

- **Results**: We identified 11 practice guidelines that met the eligibility criteria; these were included in the review. These guidelines advised that elective noncardiac surgery be delayed for at least 4 weeks after bare-metal stent implantation and at least 6 months after drug-eluting stent implantation. For elective surgery, all guidelines advised continuing acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy whenever possible. If interruption of antiplatelet therapy was required, four guidelines advised to discontinue ASA/clopidogrel at least 5 days before surgery, while two guidelines advised to discontinue 7 to 10 days before surgery. Five guidelines provided varying guidance for the use of perioperative bridging during antiplatelet therapy interruption.

- **Conclusions**: Most recommendations are based on expert opinion. This review highlights the need for well-designed prospective studies to identify optimal management strategies.

### Balancing the benefit and risk of oral antiplatelet agents in coronary artery bypass surgery [^111j428c]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Concern about possible hemorrhagic complications arising from the use of oral antiplatelet agents in immediate proximity to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery leads many clinicians to avoid or discontinue these agents preoperatively. Recent evidence suggests that aspirin and clopidogrel can be used with relative safety in the preoperative period; dual antiplatelet therapy in the 5 days immediately preceding CABG surgery results in a moderate and variable increase in the risk of procedural bleeding. This modest hemorrhagic risk may be acceptable, given the clinical benefits of sustained antiplatelet therapy in preventing graft occlusion and ischemic complications pre- and post-CABG. Because the bleeding risk with aspirin is dose-dependent, use of a low dose is preferred post-CABG.

### A randomized controlled trial of platelet activity before and after cessation of clopidogrel therapy in patients with stable cardiovascular disease [^1141i2Ge]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

The aim of this randomized placebo-controlled trial was to determine if withdrawing clopidogrel therapy leads to increased platelet activity compared with pre-treatment values in patients with stable coronary artery or peripheral arterial disease.

Reports of increased cardiovascular events after planned cessation of clopidogrel therapy have raised concerns over the possible existence of a rebound in platelet activity. In all, 171 patients receiving established aspirin therapy were randomly assigned to placebo or clopidogrel (75 mg daily) for 28 days. Blood samples were taken at pre-treatment baseline, on treatment just before discontinuation of the study drug, and on days 7, 14, and 28 after discontinuation.

The primary outcome measure was adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated platelet fibrinogen binding. Six secondary outcomes were assessed: ADP-stimulated platelet P-selectin, unstimulated platelet fibrinogen binding, and light transmission aggregometry with ADP 5 and 10 μmol/l recorded at maximum and at 6 min.

The ADP-stimulated platelet fibrinogen binding, P-selectin expression, and platelet aggregation were lower on treatment with clopidogrel compared with baseline (p 0.05). Furthermore, there was no evidence of an interaction between platelet inhibition over time and treatment allocation.

### Continuation versus discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery [^112kQLKd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Antiplatelet agents are recommended for people with myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, transient ischaemic attack or stroke, and for those in whom coronary stents have been inserted. People who take antiplatelet agents are at an increased risk of adverse events when undergoing non-cardiac surgery because of these indications. However, taking antiplatelet therapy also introduces risk to the person undergoing surgery because the likelihood of bleeding is increased. Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy before surgery might reduce this risk, but subsequently it might make thrombotic problems, such as myocardial infarction, more likely.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of continuation versus discontinuation for at least five days of antiplatelet therapy on the occurrence of bleeding and ischaemic events in adults undergoing non-cardiac surgery under general, spinal, or regional anaesthesia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2018), and Embase (1974 to January 2018). We searched clinical trials registers for ongoing studies and conducted backward and forward citation searching of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of adults who were taking single or dual antiplatelet therapy for at least two weeks and were scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. Included participants had at least one cardiac risk factor. We planned to include quasi-randomized studies. We excluded people scheduled for minor surgeries under local anaesthesia.

### SPL drug information for clopidogrel bisulfate [^114M625o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of clopidogrel bisulfate PO (also known as Plavix) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. Monitor for postpartum hemorrhage, as there are risks to the pregnant woman and fetus associated with myocardial infarction and stroke. Do not withhold treatment from pregnant women due to potential concerns about the effects of clopidogrel on the fetus. Clopidogrel use during labor or obstetric delivery will increase the risk of maternal bleeding and hemorrhage. Avoid neuraxial blockade in patients receiving clopidogrel because of the risk of spinal hematoma. If possible, discontinue clopidogrel 5–7 days before labor, delivery, or neuraxial blockade.

The drug clopidogrel bisulfate PO (also known as Plavix) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Age-dependent effect of ticagrelor monotherapy versus ticagrelor with aspirin on major bleeding and cardiovascular events: A post hoc analysis of the TICO randomized trial [^111mtYUy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Although it remains uncertain which single antiplatelet therapy is most effective and safe after short-term DAPT, short-term DAPT followed by aspirin monotherapy has a higher incidence of myocardial infarction. This is driven by a spurt of events just after DAPT cessation, as indicated in the SMART-DATE trial (6- versus 12-month or longer dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute coronary syndrome) among patients with ACS. In the STOPDAPT-2 trial (Short and Optimal Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy After Everolimus-Eluting Cobalt-Chromium Stent), clopidogrel monotherapy after short-term DAPT increased the tendency, although not statistically significant, toward myocardial infarction.

For clopidogrel monotherapy after short-term DAPT, there was a decreased response to clopidogrel attributable to genetic polymorphisms, particularly in patients with ACS. Meanwhile, ticagrelor exhibits superior pharmacodynamic effects over clopidogrel, regardless of genotypic differences. Ticagrelor monotherapy after short-term DAPT improved bleeding outcomes without increasing the risk of ischemic events after DAPT termination in recent trials. Hence, potent P2Y12 inhibitor-based monotherapy after short-term DAPT may be a good option without increasing both bleeding and ischemic risks in patients with ACS and high bleeding risk, such as elderly patients.

### Time elapsed after ischemic stroke and risk of adverse cardiovascular events and mortality following elective noncardiac surgery [^1124u7qP]. JAMA (2014). High credibility.

The timing of surgery in patients with recent ischemic stroke is an important and inadequately addressed issue. This study aimed to assess the safety and importance of the time elapsed between a stroke and surgery in the risk of perioperative cardiovascular events and mortality.

The research utilized a Danish nationwide cohort study from 2005 to 2011, including all patients aged 20 years or older undergoing elective noncardiac surgeries, totaling 481,183 surgeries. The exposure considered was the time elapsed between the stroke and the surgery, categorized and measured continuously.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The study measured risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality up to 30 days after surgery. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated utilizing multivariable logistic regression models.

- **Results**: Crude incidence rates of MACE among patients with prior stroke (n = 7137) and those without (n = 474,046) were 54.4 (95% CI, 49.1–59.9) vs 4.1 (95% CI, 3.9–4.2) per 1000 patients. Compared to patients without stroke, the ORs for MACE were 14.23 (95% CI, 11.61–17.45) for strokes less than 3 months prior to surgery, 4.85 (95% CI, 3.32–7.08) for strokes 3 to less than 6 months prior, 3.04 (95% CI, 2.13–4.34) for strokes 6 to less than 12 months prior, and 2.47 (95% CI, 2.07–2.95) for strokes 12 months or more prior. MACE risks were at least as high for low-risk surgeries (OR, 9.96; 95% CI, 5.49–18.07 for strokes < 3 months) and intermediate-risk surgeries (OR, 17.12; 95% CI, 13.68–21.42 for strokes < 3 months) compared to high-risk surgeries (OR, 2.97).

### Is there a role for preoperative platelet function testing in patients undergoing cardiac surgery during antiplatelet therapy [^115eKWSe]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Up to 11% of patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes undergo coronary artery bypass grafting. Guidelines largely recommend a one-size-fits-all preoperative discontinuation period for P2Y12 receptor blockers to avoid bleeding. These recommendations do not account for highly variable pharmacodynamic responsiveness and for variable recovery of platelet reactivity following discontinuation of P2Y12 receptor blockers. Several observational studies have demonstrated that an objective measurement of platelet function among these patients may reduce the waiting period while mitigating the risk of bleeding. Based on these findings, two recent guidelines included Class IIa and IIb recommendations for platelet function testing in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

The following review article describes the rationale for discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy before cardiac surgery and the limitations with this approach, available platelet function assays to assess pharmacodynamic effects, and the association between platelet inhibition and other clinical factors with surgery-related bleeding. The information will assist the reader in determining which patients undergoing cardiac surgery might benefit from preoperative platelet function monitoring.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: A guideline from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^111hfvGt]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, particularly concerning female patients and menopause, the AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining a history of premature ovarian failure (before 40 years of age) and early menopause (before 45 years of age) to assess the risk of stroke.

### Safety of continued clopidogrel use in the preoperative course of gastrointestinal surgery: A retrospective cohort study [^111GUJzN]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Our study aimed to estimate the postoperative bleeding risk in older adults taking clopidogrel before gastrointestinal (GI) surgery to aid surgeons in decisions regarding clopidogrel cessation.

Balancing the risks of postoperative bleeding associated with continued clopidogrel use and those associated with cessation is difficult for GI surgeons.

Using 100% Texas Medicare Claims Data from 2006 to 2011, we identified patients undergoing emergent GI surgery. We propensity score-matched patients on clopidogrel before surgery to patients not on clopidogrel. Using conditional logistic regression, we compared the risks of bleeding events at 1 month post-discharge between groups, adjusting for bleeding risk factors.

In total, 1,240 patients undergoing emergent GI surgery while treated with clopidogrel were matched to emergency GI surgery patients not treated with clopidogrel. The only significant preoperative differences between groups were a higher percentage of clopidogrel-treated patients with congestive heart failure, cholecystectomy, and a lower percentage of clopidogrel-treated patients with colectomy. The mean age was 76.91 (± 7.06) and 76.70 (± 7.05) years (P = 0.47), and 63.84% and 59.41% of operations were cholecystectomy, in the clopidogrel and non-clopidogrel groups respectively (P = 0.18). In multivariable analyses adjusting for Elixhauser index, hyperlipidemia, confounding drugs, and surgery type, the odds ratio for bleeding within 30 days of discharge in those exposed to clopidogrel compared with those not exposed was 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 1.08–2.3).

### Personalizing antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel [^112WG6cb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel is the accepted standard for the prevention of ischemic complications after percutaneous coronary intervention, and it has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). There is substantial interindividual variability in antiplatelet response to clopidogrel. Various clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with high on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity incur an increased risk for ischemic events.

In recent years, several clinical and demographic variables, as well as multiple genetic factors contributing to the variability in antiplatelet response to clopidogrel, have been identified. We discuss strategies based on platelet function testing or genotyping for the improvement of antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel and, thereby, clinical outcomes.

### Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular events: a population-based cohort study [^1179S6kS]. Lancet (2017). Low credibility.

Lifelong antiplatelet treatment is recommended after ischaemic vascular events, based on trials mainly involving patients younger than 75 years. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious complication but has shown low case fatality in aspirin trials and is not generally considered to cause long-term disability. Consequently, although co-prescription of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduces upper gastrointestinal bleeds by 70–90%, uptake is low and guidelines are conflicting. The purpose of this study was to assess the risk, time course, and outcomes of bleeding on antiplatelet treatment for secondary prevention across all ages.

A prospective population-based cohort study was conducted with patients who experienced their first transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, or myocardial infarction and were treated with antiplatelet drugs (primarily aspirin-based, without routine PPI use) after the event, as part of the Oxford Vascular Study from 2002 to 2012, with follow-up until 2013. The study evaluated the type, severity, outcome (disability or death), and time course of bleeding requiring medical attention over 10 years through face-to-face follow-up. Age-specific numbers needed to treat (NNT) to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding with routine PPI co-prescription were estimated using Kaplan–Meier risk estimates and relative risk reduction estimates from prior trials.

In 3166 patients (1582 [50%] aged ≥ 75 years), there were 405 first bleeding events (218 gastrointestinal, 45 intracranial, and 142 other) during 13,509 patient-years of follow-up. Of the 314 patients (78%) with bleeds admitted…

### The use of clopidogrel in carotid endarterectomy: an audit of current practice [^112G64EA]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Clopidogrel is commonly encountered in patients presenting for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Its use during this time is controversial, as there is no randomized control trial data to determine the best practice. Questionnaires were distributed to all members of the Vascular Society to investigate clopidogrel use at the time of CEA. Among respondents, 52% discontinue clopidogrel preoperatively, with 51% of these using no alternative and 49% replacing it with aspirin. The use of clopidogrel is not related to the number of endarterectomies performed by each surgeon. There is currently no consensus on clopidogrel use during CEA, highlighting the need for quality prospective data on this subject.

### Executive summary: Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: An American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114VTJJN]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, particularly concerning the management of antiplatelets, the ACCP 2022 guidelines recommend considering the interruption of ticagrelor 3–5 days before surgery in patients receiving ticagrelor and undergoing elective noncardiac surgery (NCS).

### Impact of prior use or recent withdrawal of oral antiplatelet agents on acute coronary syndromes [^114JBPXY]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Oral antiplatelet agents (OAAs) can prevent further vascular events in cardiovascular disease. However, how prior use or recent discontinuation of OAAs affects the clinical presentation of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and clinical outcomes, such as death and myocardial infarction (MI), is unclear.

- **Methods and results**: We studied and followed up on a cohort of 1,358 consecutive patients admitted for a suspected ACS for up to 30 days. Of these patients, 930 were nonusers, 355 were prior users of OAAs, and 73 had recently withdrawn from OAAs. Nonusers were at lower risk, more frequently presented with ST-elevation MI on admission, and more frequently had Q-wave MI at discharge than prior users (36.6% versus 17.5%, P < 0.001; and 47.8% versus 28.2%, P < 0.001, respectively). However, there was no difference in the incidence of death or MI at 30 days between nonusers and prior users (10.3% versus 12.4%, P = NS). Additionally, prior users experienced more major bleeds within 30 days compared with nonusers (3.4% versus 1.4%, respectively; P = 0.04). Recent withdrawers were admitted on average 11.9 ± 0.8 days after OAA withdrawal. The interruption was primarily a physician decision for scheduled surgery (n = 47 of 73). Despite a similar cardiovascular risk profile, recent withdrawers had higher 30-day rates of death or MI (21.9% versus 12.4%, P = 0.04) and bleedings (13.7% versus 5.9%, P = 0.03) than prior users. After multivariate analysis, OAA withdrawal was found to be an independent predictor of both mortality and bleedings at 30 days.

- **Conclusions**: Among ACS patients, prior users represent a higher-risk population.

### Risk of massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding in gastric bypass patients taking clopidogrel [^114Pt73D]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The antiplatelet drug clopidogrel (Plavix) is widely used in patients who have undergone coronary artery stenting or had a stroke. Because morbid obesity is associated with atherosclerosis, some of these patients are candidates for weight loss surgery. We chose to determine the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding after gastric bypass in patients taking clopidogrel.

- **Methods**: Patients who took clopidogrel after gastric bypass were identified by specific review of the subset of patients who had upper gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospital admission and transfusion. All who bled underwent emergency endoscopy.

- **Results**: Of 11 patients taking clopidogrel, 4 (36%) presented with significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding 25–234 days after gastric bypass. All stopped bleeding with discontinuation of the drug and treatment with an intravenous proton pump inhibitor.

- **Conclusion**: Gastric bypass patients appear to be at high risk of bleeding complications when taking clopidogrel. On the basis of the available published data from another high-risk group (i.e. those with a history of peptic ulcer disease), co-treatment with omeprazole may be indicated when clopidogrel must be continued.
