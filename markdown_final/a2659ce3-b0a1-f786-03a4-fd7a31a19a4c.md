## Question

what's the evidence of beta-blockers in patients with LVEF > 50%

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evidence for beta-blockers in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 50%, i.e., heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and how to interpret conflicting data and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the population and the clinical outcomes that matter. Then, I should appraise the highest-quality randomized evidence, especially REDUCE-AMI and related contemporary trials. Next, I will examine meta-analyses and observational data, including TOPCAT and registry analyses, and check for confounding and effect modification. After that, I need to review guideline positions and reconcile them with the evidence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight knowledge gaps and future directions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and outcomes. LVEF greater than 50% corresponds to HFpEF, where the key questions are whether beta-blockers reduce death, myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, and whether they improve functional capacity or quality of life, recognizing that many patients have comorbidities like hypertension, CAD, and atrial fibrillation that drive beta-blocker use irrespective of HFpEF status [^114iyZgS] [^113Fz8uh].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality randomized evidence. REDUCE-AMI randomized 5,020 patients with acute MI, coronary angiography, and LVEF ≥ 50% to beta-blocker therapy versus no beta-blocker and found no significant difference in the composite of death or MACE over a median 3.5 years, with event rates of 7.9% vs 8.3% and HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79–1.16, indicating no benefit in this preserved-EF, contemporary, revascularized population [^115M75BK]. Wait, let me verify the context: this was a modern cohort with early invasive management and high rates of secondary prevention, which may blunt the historical benefits seen in pre-reperfusion eras, aligning with the neutral result [^115M75BK].

> I will now examine the individual patient data meta-analysis of recent RCTs in MI patients with mildly reduced EF. The Lancet meta-analysis of 1,885 patients with LVEF 40–49% showed a 25% relative risk reduction in the composite of death, reinfarction, or HF with beta-blockers, extending HFrEF benefits to HFmrEF, but this does not directly inform LVEF > 50% where the signal was not assessed in this pooled analysis [^111daV4Y]. Hold on, I should not overgeneralize: this supports benefit in 40–49% but remains silent for ≥ 50%, reinforcing that the balance of evidence differs by EF stratum [^111daV4Y].

> Next, I should review observational data in HFpEF. Multiple TOPCAT secondary analyses consistently associate beta-blocker use with higher heart failure hospitalization risk in patients with EF ≥ 50%, without a mortality benefit, and show higher natriuretic peptide levels in beta-blocker users, suggesting potential harm in this phenotype, although confounding by indication remains a limitation [^114q1j4h] [^117QW3vn] [^116Lf9we]. Let me consider effect modification: there was a significant interaction by EF threshold, with higher EF associated with greater HF hospitalization risk on beta-blockers, which strengthens the concern signal even if causality cannot be proven from observational designs [^114q1j4h].

> I should double-check broader observational syntheses. A large prospective registry analysis of 14,434 HFpEF patients found no association between beta-blocker use and HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death after propensity matching, suggesting neutrality overall, though residual confounding persists and subgroup effects may be obscured in pooled analyses [^115J1MFZ]. But wait, what if there is a subgroup that benefits or is harmed? The TOPCAT signal at higher EF and the functional data below hint that not all HFpEF patients are the same, which complicates a blanket recommendation [^114q1j4h].

> Let me consider functional and mechanistic data. In PRESERVE-HR, a randomized crossover trial in HFpEF with chronotropic incompetence, beta-blocker withdrawal improved peak VO₂ by about 1.2 mL/kg/min and increased peak heart rate by roughly 30 bpm, with the greatest benefit in those with smaller LV volumes, supporting the concept that excessive bradycardia can worsen exercise intolerance in a subset of HFpEF patients [^113EjGW6]. Hold on, I should verify generalizability: this was a small, highly selected group, so it is hypothesis-generating rather than definitive for routine practice [^113EjGW6].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure alignment. Contemporary ESC and AHA/ACC/HFSA guidance does not recommend routine beta-blocker therapy for HFpEF; instead, they emphasize treating comorbidities and reserve disease-modifying HF therapies for HFmrEF or when there is another indication such as CAD, AF rate control, or hypertension, reflecting the lack of randomized outcome benefit in HFpEF [^115Emj6D] [^116p4DEi]. I need to ensure I note the nuance: for HFmrEF, guidelines allow consideration of evidence-based beta-blockers, which does not extend to EF ≥ 50% in the absence of another indication [^116p4DEi].

> I will now examine meta-analyses specific to HFpEF. Some older meta-analyses suggested possible mortality benefit with beta-blockers in HFpEF, but these pooled heterogeneous, often small studies with low certainty and were vulnerable to bias, and more rigorous reviews conclude uncertainty or lack of benefit in HFpEF, reinforcing that routine use is not supported [^114ToofK] [^1156h8GZ]. Wait, let me reconsider: the inconsistency across meta-analyses underscores the need for large, dedicated RCTs in pure HFpEF, which remain limited to date [^1156h8GZ].

> But wait, what if the patient is post-MI with preserved EF? Does the calculus change? Historically, beta-blockers reduced reinfarction and arrhythmias in post-MI populations, yet REDUCE-AMI in contemporary, revascularized patients with LVEF ≥ 50% showed no benefit, and guideline updates increasingly restrict long-term beta-blocker use post-MI to those with reduced EF or other indications, reflecting this evolving evidence base [^115M75BK] [^112oCre1]. I should confirm: this supports avoiding routine long-term beta-blocker therapy after MI when LVEF is preserved and there is no other indication [^112oCre1].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For patients with LVEF > 50% and HFpEF, I should not initiate beta-blockers solely for HFpEF; instead, I will treat comorbidities and consider beta-blockers only when there is a separate indication such as CAD, AF with rapid ventricular response, or hypertension, and even then I should monitor for worsening exercise intolerance or fluid retention. If a patient with HFpEF and documented chronotropic incompetence on a beta-blocker has disabling symptoms, a carefully supervised trial of dose reduction or withdrawal may improve functional capacity, recognizing the evidence base is limited and patient selection is key [^113Fz8uh] [^113EjGW6]. Hold on, I should verify safety: any withdrawal should be gradual with close follow-up and reassessment of symptoms and biomarkers to mitigate rebound effects [^113roJAv] [^1111CiNt].

> I need to ensure I address special scenarios. In patients with recovered HFrEF, continuation of guideline-directed therapies including beta-blockers is reasonable to prevent relapse, but this is distinct from true HFpEF and should not be conflated with initiating beta-blockers de novo in HFpEF without another indication [^113iQFFj]. For HFmrEF, evidence-based beta-blockers may be considered, particularly toward the lower end of 41–49%, which again does not justify use in EF ≥ 50% in the absence of other indications [^116p4DEi].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. The field needs large, well-designed RCTs in pure HFpEF to resolve the beta-blocker question, with stratification by chronotropic competence, LV structure, and comorbidity burden; until then, shared decision-making that weighs potential harms in exercise intolerance against comorbidity-driven benefits is prudent, and clinicians should remain alert to emerging data that may refine phenotype-specific therapy in HFpEF [^113Fz8uh] [^113EjGW6].

---

Beta-blockers are **not recommended** for routine use in patients with LVEF > 50% (HFpEF) because high-quality evidence shows **no mortality benefit** and a possible increase in heart failure hospitalizations [^114q1j4h] [^112nuzcm]. They may be used for **comorbidity-driven indications** (e.g. atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, hypertension) [^113Fz8uh], but should be avoided in patients with chronotropic incompetence or exercise intolerance. Current guidelines prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for HFpEF, and beta-blockers should not be initiated solely for HFpEF management [^116p4DEi] [^113Fz8uh].

## Evidence from clinical trials

### Major randomized controlled trials

- **REDUCE-AMI trial**: In patients with acute MI and LVEF ≥ 50%, beta-blockers did not reduce death or recurrent MI versus no beta-blockers (7.9% vs 8.3%; HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79–1.16) [^115M75BK].
- **BETAMI trial**: In revascularized MI patients with LVEF ≥ 40%, beta-blockers did not improve outcomes versus no beta-blockers.
- **REBOOT trial**: In post-MI patients with preserved LVEF, beta-blockers did not reduce the composite of death, MI, or HF hospitalization versus no beta-blockers (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79–1.13) [^1125XUnk].

---

### Meta-analyses and observational studies

- **Individual patient data meta-analysis**: In 11 HFrEF trials, beta-blockers reduced mortality across LVEF strata except in the small subgroup with LVEF ≥ 50% (244 patients), showing no benefit [^113z7DGQ].
- **TOPCAT analyses**: Beta-blocker use in HFpEF (LVEF ≥ 50%) was associated with higher HF hospitalization risk (HR 1.74, 95% CI 1.28–2.37) and higher natriuretic peptide levels, without mortality benefit [^114q1j4h] [^116Lf9we].
- **SwedeHF registry**: In HFpEF, beta-blockers were not associated with fewer HF hospitalizations or CV deaths after matching (HR 0.95 for HF admission; HR 0.94 for CV death) [^115J1MFZ].

---

## Mechanistic considerations

Beta-blockers reduce heart rate and contractility, which can **worsen exercise intolerance** in HFpEF, where chronotropic incompetence and impaired stroke volume reserve are common [^111k4QW2]. They may also increase central vascular resistance and myocardial wall stress, potentially worsening diastolic function and promoting HF decompensation [^1111CiNt].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation for beta-blockers in lvef > 50%** |
|-|-|
| ESC 2021 | Not recommended for routine HFpEF management; use only for comorbidities (e.g. AF, CAD, hypertension) [^notfound] |
| AHA/ACC/HFSA 2022 | Not recommended for HFpEF; consider only for comorbidity-driven indications [^notfound] |
| ESC 2023 chronic coronary disease | Long-term beta-blockers after MI are not recommended if LVEF ≥ 50% and no other indication exists [^1174Jevm] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where beta-blockers may be considered

Beta-blockers may be used in LVEF > 50% when **driven by comorbidities**, such as:

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Rate control (prefer beta-blockers in LVEF > 50%) [^notfound].
- **Ischemic heart disease**: Secondary prevention post-MI or stable CAD.
- **Hypertension**: Especially with CAD or arrhythmias.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Worsening exercise intolerance**: Especially with chronotropic incompetence [^113EjGW6].
- **Increased HF hospitalizations**: Observed in HFpEF cohorts [^114q1j4h].
- **Bradycardia and hypotension**: Particularly in elderly or frail patients.

---

## Alternative pharmacological therapies

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Reduce HF hospitalizations and CV events in HFpEF; recommended by guidelines [^notfound].
- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists**: Spironolactone reduces HF hospitalizations in HFpEF [^111aBDwR].
- **ARNI/ARB/ACE inhibitors**: Limited benefit; not first-line in HFpEF [^111aBDwR].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Ongoing trials are evaluating **patient selection** — including phenotyping by chronotropic competence, imaging, and biomarkers — and **novel agents** targeting inflammation, fibrosis, and microvascular dysfunction in HFpEF [^notfound].

---

Beta-blockers are **not recommended** for routine use in patients with LVEF > 50% because they do not improve survival and may increase HF hospitalizations; reserve them for comorbidity-driven indications and prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors and MRAs for HFpEF management.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of hospitalizations and is associated with increased health care costs. More than half of the patients with HF have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), defined as an ejection fraction (EF) of 50% or greater. Heart failure with a preserved EF continues to increase in prevalence and is associated with a high rate of hospitalization, yet, to our knowledge, evidenced-based therapies are lacking.,

β-Adrenergic receptor blockers (β-blockers) provide an unequivocal benefit in the treatment of chronic HF with a reduced EF (HFrEF), with a strong foundation of evidence to support their use. Most patients with HFpEF enrolled in contemporary clinical trials or in published cohorts also receive β-blockers, despite an uncertain benefit. A recent patient-based meta-analysis of 11 randomized β-blocker HF trials that enrolled patients with HFrEF also included a small number of patients with HFpEF. This analysis reinforced the benefit of β-blockers for patients with a reduced EF but did not demonstrate any benefit for patients with an EF greater than 50%.

To extend our understanding of the role β-blockers play in HFpEF, we performed an analysis of data from participants randomized in the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) clinical trial. The primary focus of this analysis was to investigate the association of β-blocker use with HF hospitalizations among patients at different EF thresholds.

### Beta-blockers for heart failure with reduced, mid-range, and preserved ejection fraction: an individual patient-level analysis of double-blind randomized trials [^113z7DGQ]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Recent guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40–49% should be managed similar to LVEF ≥ 50%. We investigated the effect of beta-blockers according to LVEF in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

Methods and Results

Individual patient data meta-analysis of 11 trials, stratified by baseline LVEF and heart rhythm (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT0083244; PROSPERO: CRD42014010012). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death over 1.3years median follow-up, with an intention-to-treat analysis. For 14262 patients in sinus rhythm, median LVEF was 27% (interquartile range 21–33%), including 575 patients with LVEF 40–49% and 244 ≥ 50%. Beta-blockers reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared to placebo in sinus rhythm, an effect that was consistent across LVEF strata, except for those in the small subgroup with LVEF ≥ 50%. For LVEF 40–49%, death occurred in 21/292 [7.2%] randomized to beta-blockers compared to 35/283 [12.4%] with placebo; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.59 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34–1.03]. Cardiovascular death occurred in 13/292 [4.5%] with beta-blockers and 26/283 [9.2%] with placebo; adjusted HR 0.48 (95% CI 0.24–0.97). Over a median of 1.0years following randomization (n = 4601), LVEF increased with beta-blockers in all groups in sinus rhythm except LVEF ≥ 50%. For patients in atrial fibrillation at baseline (n = 3050), beta-blockers increased LVEF when < 50% at baseline, but did not improve prognosis.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers improve LVEF and prognosis for patients with heart failure in sinus rhythm with a reduced LVEF. The data are most robust for LVEF < 40%, but similar benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with LVEF 40–49%.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^112PJZqt]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist randomized clinical trial of spironolactone for patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction of 50% or greater, β-blocker use was associated with a higher risk of heart failure hospitalizations compared with patients not taking β-blockers. This association was not present among patients with an ejection fraction between 45% and 49%.

Meaning

Prospective studies of the role β-blockers play in heart failure among patients with a preserved ejection fraction appears to be warranted to clarify the effectiveness of these drugs for patients with an ejection fraction of 50% or greater.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^116HwpdQ]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

To date, the efficacy of β-blockers for patients with HFpEF is unknown. This post hoc analysis of the TOPCAT trial of spironolactone for patients with HFpEF suggests an association between β-blocker use and incident HF hospitalizations for patients with an EF of 50% or greater and an incremental positive association between β-blocker use and the risk for HF hospitalization at higher EF thresholds. There was no significant association between β-blocker use and CVD mortality.

β-Blocker Use for Patients With HFpEF

The TOPCAT trial corroborates the finding that most patients in contemporary HFpEF cohorts are treated with β-blockers. A total of 79.2% of the patients in the North American and South America cohort of this trial received β-blockers at baseline. This high prevalence of β-blocker use is similar to other HFpEF studies, as shown in eTable 4 in the Supplement. Although evidence for the benefits of β-blocker use for patients with HFpEF is lacking, this high rate of use is most likely explained by an assumption that β-blockers are efficacious for treating common comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation.

Benefits of β-Blockers for HF

Extensive, high-quality evidence supports the use of β-blockers for patients with HFrEF. In addition, several recent analyses have investigated whether guideline-directed HF therapies have a utility for patients with EFs between 40% and 49%, an entity termed HF with midrange EF. A recent individual patient-level meta-analysis of 11 major HFrEF trials investigating the effects of β-blockers at different ranges of EF identified a reduction in CVD mortality among patients with an EF between 40% and 49%. Analogous to our findings, the same meta-analysis suggested that patients with an EF of 50% or greater did not see any benefits from being randomized to receive β-blockers. However, only 244 patients fell into this category.

### Beta-blockers in left ventricular systolic dysfunction – from evidence to practice [^1166T66W]. Age and Ageing (2002). Low credibility.

Five percent of all hospital medical admissions are patients with heart failure. The incidence is about one new case per 1000 of the general population per year, increasing to > 10 per 1000 in those aged ≥ 85 years. Although the evidence that beta-blockers reduce mortality by about 36% when added to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is overwhelming, clinicians are still reluctant to use beta-blockers in heart failure, especially in older patients. Here, we examine the evidence for the use of beta-blockers in heart failure in older people and explore the practicalities of their use.

### Beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction [^112Vp7kt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death globally. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 7.4 million people died from ischaemic heart disease in 2012, constituting 15% of all deaths. Beta-blockers are recommended and are often used in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. However, it is currently unclear whether beta-blockers should be used in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Previous meta-analyses on the topic have shown conflicting results. No previous systematic review using Cochrane methods has assessed the effects of beta-blockers in patients without heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of beta-blockers compared with placebo or no treatment in patients without heart failure and with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 40% in the non-acute phase after myocardial infarction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index - Expanded, BIOSIS Citation Index, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Turning Research Into Practice, Google Scholar, and SciSearch from their inception to February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised clinical trials assessing effects of beta-blockers versus control (placebo or no treatment) in patients without heart failure after myocardial infarction, irrespective of publication type and status, date, and language. We excluded trials randomising participants with diagnosed heart failure at the time of randomisation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed our published protocol, with a few changes made, and methodological recommendations provided by Cochrane and Jakobsen and colleagues. Two review authors independently extracted data. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, and major cardiovascular events (composite of cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal myocardial reinfarction). Our secondary outcomes were quality of life, angina, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction during follow-up. We assessed all outcomes at maximum follow-up. We systematically assessed risks of bias using seven bias domains and we assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 25 trials randomising a total of 22,423 participants (mean age 56.9 years). All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias. In all, 24 of 25 trials included a mixed group of participants with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST myocardial infarction, and no trials provided separate results for each type of infarction. One trial included participants with only ST-elevation myocardial infarction. All trials except one included participants younger than 75 years of age. Methods used to exclude heart failure were various and were likely insufficient. A total of 21 trials used placebo, and four trials used no intervention, as the comparator. All patients received usual care; 24 of 25 trials were from the pre-reperfusion era (published from 1974 to 1999), and only one trial was from the reperfusion era (published in 2018). The certainty of evidence was moderate to low for all outcomes. Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.81, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.90; I² = 15%; 22,085 participants, 21 trials; moderate-certainty evidence) and myocardial reinfarction (RR 0.76, 98% CI 0.69 to 0.88; I² = 0%; 19,606 participants, 19 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Our meta-analyses show that beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events (RR 0.72, 97.5% CI 0.69 to 0.84; 14,994 participants, 15 trials; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.73, 98% CI 0.68 to 0.85; I² = 47%; 21,763 participants, 19 trials; low-certainty evidence). Hence, evidence seems to suggest that beta-blockers versus placebo or no treatment may result in a minimum reduction of 10% in RR for risks of all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction. However, beta-blockers compared with placebo or no intervention may not affect the risk of angina (RR 1.04, 98% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 7115 participants, 5 trials; low-certainty evidence). No trials provided data on serious adverse events according to good clinical practice from the International Committee for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH-GCP), nor on quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Beta-blockers probably reduce the risks of all-cause mortality and myocardial reinfarction in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. Beta-blockers may further reduce the risks of major cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality compared with placebo or no intervention in patients younger than 75 years of age without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction. These effects could, however, be driven by patients with unrecognised heart failure. The effects of beta-blockers on serious adverse events, angina, and quality of life are unclear due to sparse data or no data at all. All trials and outcomes were at high risk of bias, and incomplete outcome data bias alone could account for the effect seen when major cardiovascular events, angina, and myocardial infarction are assessed. The evidence in this review is of moderate to low certainty, and the true result may depart substantially from the results presented here. Future trials should particularly focus on patients 75 years of age and older, and on assessment of serious adverse events according to ICH-GCP and quality of life. Newer randomised clinical trials at low risk of bias and at low risk of random errors are needed if the benefits and harms of beta-blockers in contemporary patients without heart failure following acute myocardial infarction are to be assessed properly. Such trials ought to be designed according to the SPIRIT statement and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^112nuzcm]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that β-blocker use in the TOPCAT trial cohort was associated with a higher risk for incident HF hospitalization among patients with an EF of 50% or greater, without an associated change in CVD mortality. Future studies are needed to prospectively assess the effects of β-blockers in HF populations with a normal EF.

### Drug treatment effects on outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ToofK]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In trials enrolling patients with HFpEF, defined using an LV ejection fraction ≥ 40%, beta-blockers reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by 22% and 25%, respectively. There was no significant effect of ACE inhibitors, ARB or MRA on the same outcomes. The effect of treatments on functional and quality of life outcomes was limited. Further adequately powered RCTs in beta-blocker therapy in this patient group is warranted to confirm this finding.

Key messages

What is already known on this subject?

There have been no individual large randomised controlled trials which demonstrate improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. This is represented in the latest European Society of Cardiology Heart Failure guidelines, which advocate treatment of comorbidities and symptoms.

What might this study add?

This meta-analysis shows that pooled analysis of beta-blocker trials demonstrates reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality by 22% and 25%, respectively, with no pooled effect seen in ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker and mineralocorticoid antagonist trials. There may also be a small benefit in terms of quality of life with several of the drug classes tested, although no difference in functional outcomes.

How might this impact on clinical practice?

Clinicians should consider using beta-blockers when there is an existing indication for them. There may be benefit in repeating a randomised controlled trial of beta-blockers in heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction with contemporary patient cohorts.

### Long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in the United States [^1174Jevm]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The long-term impact of beta-blocker use after myocardial infarction (MI) is unknown. Although there are robust data supporting post-MI beta-blocker use in the prereperfusion era and in the setting of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), data on long-term beta-blocker use among contemporary populations or those with preserved LVEF are conflicting. The REDUCE-AMI (Randomized Evaluation of Decreased Usage of Beta-Blockers After Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial showed no benefit of long-term beta-blocker use among patients with MI with preserved LVEF. In contrast, interruption of beta-blocker use among patients with prior MI was not noninferior to continuation in the ABYSS (Assessment of Beta blocker interruption one Year after uncomplicated myocardial infarction on Safety and Symptomatic cardiac events requiring hospitalization) trial, with patients in the interruption group having greater cardiovascular hospitalizations. There are 5 other ongoing randomized controlled trials investigating this question (, and).

What is the clinical question being addressed?

What is the real-world long-term use of beta-blockers after myocardial infarction?

What is the main finding?

Overall use of beta-blockers postmyocardial infarction was low, but there was evidence of treatment inertia with minimal de-escalation beyond 10 years among those on beta-blockers.

As our understanding of post-MI beta-blocker efficacy increases, guidelines on the use of beta-blockers after MI have consequently evolved. Use of beta-blockers was recommended for at least 3 years after MI for secondary prevention in 2012 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology chronic coronary disease (CCD) guidelines. The 2023 CCD guideline update no longer recommends the use of long-term beta-blocker therapy beyond 1 year after MI unless patients exhibit a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50%, angina, or another primary indication for beta-blockers.

In light of ongoing clinical trials and changes in guidelines, evaluation of real-world patterns in the long-term use of beta-blocker therapy among patients with prior MI has not yet been performed. Therefore, we used large, nationally representative survey data to assess long-term use of beta-blockers after MI in the United States.

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^1121qsty]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Fig 4 Trim and fill adjusted odds ratio (calculated by imputing effect of possible missing studies) — shown to be less than 1, indicating robust and conclusive evidence in favor of mortality benefit with β blocker use in heart failure

Table 2
Head to head comparisons between different β blockers (reported as point estimates of odds ratios or weighted mean differences with 95% credible intervals, with number of studies contributing to network)

LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction; NA = not available or applicable or reported.

All β blockers showed improvements in mortality; the numerically largest effect was seen with carvedilol (lowest odds ratio). However, when we made a comparison between the individual β blockers, the mortality advantage conferred by each was not statistically different from another. Carvedilol also had the best numerical advantage in tolerability (lowest pooled discontinuation rates), while not being statistically superior to other β blockers. Bucindolol improved the ejection fraction to the greatest extent in our analysis, but it was not significantly superior to the other drugs in its class. Exclusion of trials with pharmacologically active comparators did not alter our findings to a significant effect. We also determined the absolute risk reductions and the numbers needed to treat to prevent one death for each of the β blockers assessed (appendix table D). Congruent with our primary analysis, the absolute risk reduction for mortality was greatest with carvedilol — 6.6% reduction, with a number needed to treat of 15 to prevent one death. Our analysis also showed that different target dosages of individual β blockers used in the randomized trials, as well as the mean doses achieved, did not influence the logarithm of the odds ratio of mortality, as determined by weighted meta-regression analysis. An exploratory sub-analysis of trials conducted in the United States only showed significant reduction in mortality with β blocker use in the US (odds ratio 0.48, 0.29 to 0.82) (appendix figure C). The consistency and directionality of the effect persisted even when we relaxed our inclusion criteria to include smaller studies of sample size 50 or above (appendix figure D).

### Β-blockers… [^111B9aPo]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Long-term use of β-blockers in combination with diuretics and an ACE inhibitor consistently and significantly increases LV function, as measured by ejection fraction, 31–35 and reduces the incidence of hospitalization in patients with a broad range of clinical symptoms1, 2, 31, 36, 37. Several secondary end points showed improvement as well. As in earlier studies, 48–50 carvedilol significantly increased the LVEF, a measure of systolic heart function with strong prognostic value. 51 Carvedilol also improved various indices of clinical status, including NYHA functional classification and heart failure symptom score. The MERIT-HF study was terminated early by the independent safety committee after reaching the preplanned end point of reduced risk of total mortality.

42 The CIBIS-II and MERIT-HF data are important because they demonstrate a significant and unequivocal effect of β-blockade on survival per se, and because they reinforce earlier data suggesting that combination therapy including a β-blocker affords the best available protection against progressive systolic dysfunction. Meta-analyses of β-blocker randomized trials in which most of the patients had NYHA class II or III symptoms despite the use of triple background therapy found that β-blockade decreased the risk of all-cause mortality by 30% to 32%; the annual mortality rate for placebo was approximately 11%. All trials enrolled patients with systolic dysfunction who were also being treated with stable doses of digitalis and diuretics.

The Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study57 enrolled NYHA class IV patients with coronary artery disease, who experienced a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality. In the SOLVD Prevention trial, 59 approximately two thirds of patients in both the enalapril and placebo groups were classified as having class I heart failure and one third had class II; enalapril had no substantial effect on mortality alone, but significantly reduced the risk for first hospitalization for heart failure by 36%.

### Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111aBDwR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); a review of the evidence is required to determine whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with HFpEF.

Search Methods

We updated searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and one clinical trial register on 14 May 2020 to identify eligible studies, with no language or date restrictions. We checked references from trial reports and review articles for additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design, enrolling adults with HFpEF, defined by LVEF greater than 40%.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 41 randomised controlled trials (231 reports), totalling 23,492 participants across all comparisons. The risk of bias was frequently unclear and only five studies had a low risk of bias in all domains. Beta-blockers (BBs) We included 10 studies (3087 participants) investigating BBs. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 30 years to 81 years. A possible reduction in cardiovascular mortality was observed (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; three studies), however, the certainty of evidence was low. There may be little to no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.00; 1105 participants; four studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, and quality of life remain uncertain. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) We included 13 studies (4459 participants) investigating MRA. Eight studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 54.5 to 80 years. Pooled analysis indicated that MRA treatment probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB = 41; 3714 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). However, MRA treatment probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06; 4207 participants; five studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; 4070 participants; three studies; moderate-certainty evidence). MRA treatment may have little or no effect on quality of life measures (mean difference (MD) 0.84, 95% CI -2.30 to 3.98; 511 participants; three studies; low-certainty evidence). MRA treatment was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 11; 4291 participants; six studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) We included eight studies (2061 participants) investigating ACEIs. Three studies used a placebo comparator and in five the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 70 to 82 years. Pooled analyses with moderate-certainty evidence suggest that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.42; 945 participants; two studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.45; 1187 participants; five studies) and heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.15; 1019 participants; three studies), and may result in little or no effect on the quality of life (MD -0.09, 95% CI -3.66 to 3.48; 154 participants; two studies; low-certainty evidence). The effects on hyperkalaemia remain uncertain. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating ARBs were included. Five studies used a placebo comparator and in three the comparator was usual care. The mean age of participants ranged from 61 to 75 years. Pooled analyses with high certainty of evidence suggest that ARB treatment has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% 0.90 to 1.14; 7254 participants; three studies), all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.11; 7964 participants; four studies), heart failure hospitalisation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.02; 7254 participants; three studies), and quality of life (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.86 to 1.67; 3117 participants; three studies). ARB was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalaemia (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; two studies; high-certainty evidence). Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) Three studies (7702 participants) investigating ARNIs were included. Two studies used ARBs as the comparator and one used standardised medical therapy, based on participants' established treatments at enrolment. The mean age of participants ranged from 71 to 73 years. Results suggest that ARNIs may have little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.15; 4796 participants; one study; moderate-certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.11; 7663 participants; three studies; high-certainty evidence), or quality of life (high-certainty evidence). However, ARNI treatment may result in a slight reduction in heart failure hospitalisation, compared to usual care (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.00; 7362 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence). ARNI treatment was associated with a reduced risk of hyperkalaemia compared with valsartan (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.01; 5054 participants; two studies; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA and ARNI treatment in HFpEF probably reduces heart failure hospitalisation but probably has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality and quality of life. BB treatment may reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality, however, further trials are needed. The current evidence for BBs, ACEIs, and ARBs is limited and does not support their use in HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication. Although MRAs and ARNIs are probably effective at reducing the risk of heart failure hospitalisation, the treatment effect sizes are modest. There is a need for improved approaches to patient stratification to identify the subgroup of patients who are most likely to benefit from MRAs and ARNIs, as well as for an improved understanding of disease biology, and for new therapeutic approaches.

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^116MbCbb]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Results

After screening 720 citations (fig 1), we included 21 studies, with a total of 23 122 patients, treated with atenolol, bisoprolol, bucindolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, nebivolol, or placebo/standard treatment. Patients had a median age of 61 years, 77% were male, ischemic heart failure was present in 57%, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction was 25%, and patients were followed for a median of 12 months. In addition to standard anti-heart failure treatment except β blockers, the control group received placebo in all but two trials (in which the control group received an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor but no β blocker) (fig 2). One study compared carvedilol and metoprolol tartrate directly, although that has been criticized for under-dosing of metoprolol and for the use of a short acting formulation instead of an extended release form. Characteristics of studies are summarized in table 1and appendix table A. All trials had a low risk of bias according to Cochrane metrics (appendix table B).

Overall pair-wise meta-analysis confirmed a significant reduction in mortality with use of β blockers versus all comparators (both active and placebo) — odds ratio 0.71, 95% credible interval 0.64 to 0.80; P < 0.001 (fig 3). Separate meta-analyses incorporating odds ratios from individual trials with shorter duration of follow-up (< 12 months) (odds ratio 0.57, 0.46 to 0.70) and hazard ratios from trials with longer duration of follow-up (> 12 months) (hazard ratio 0.70, 0.60 to 0.81) to account for the differential follow-up periods showed effect sizes consistent with the results of the overall primary pair-wise meta-analysis (appendix figures A and B). We further corroborated this with another separate network meta-analysis of hazard ratios using a random effects Poisson regression model (appendix table C).

### Beta-blockers withdrawal in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and chronotropic incompetence: effect on functional capacity rationale and study design of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial (the preserve-HR trial) [^111k4QW2]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Background and rationale

HFpEF is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterized by exercise intolerance, markedly reduced functional capacity, 28, 29 normal left ventricular ejection fraction (> 50%), and evidence of diastolic dysfunction and left atrial enlargement. 18 Despite being a contemporary challenge, the pathophysiological mechanisms of impaired exercise capacity and poor quality of life in these patients are not yet entirely clarified. 30, 31 Among cardiac mechanisms, ChI has been proposed as a pathophysiologic mechanism associated with poorer exercise capacity in a subgroup of patients with HFpEF. 6, 7, 8 Along this same line, recent evidence has shown that ChI is frequently present (ranging from 20% to 75%) in HFpEF patients. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

From epidemiological perspective, patients with HFpEF are usually older, predominantly females and with high prevalence of other cardiovascular comorbid conditions such as atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and renal dysfunction 1, 2, 3, 4 which in the end contribute to reduced exercise tolerance, and may explain the high proportion (ranging from 50% to 60%) of beta‐blockers prescription in HFpEF patients. 3, 4, 14 Nevertheless, emerging evidence suggests that pharmacological heart rate lowering is not beneficial in patients with preserved ejection fraction. 15, 16, 17 In this regard, the proposed pathophysiological mechanism of pharmacological heart rate lowering in HFpEF patients is the prolongation of the filling of the cardiac chambers, which increases filling pressures, left ventricular diastolic wall stress and central arterial pressures. 12

To date, there is no convincing evidence to support the beneficial effects of beta‐blockers prescription in HFpEF patients. 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 A recent meta‐analysis suggests a clinically beneficial effect of beta‐blockers in patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%; however, the evidence to those with left ventricular ejection fraction > 50% is limited. 37 Recently, a recent secondary study from TOPCAT showed that for patients with an EF of 50% or greater, beta‐blocker use was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalizations but not CVD mortality. 15 However, no prior randomized clinical trial has explored the effects of beta‐blocker withdrawal on functional capacity in HFpEF patients with documented ChI.

### Beta-blocker efficacy across different cardiovascular indications: an umbrella review and meta-analytic assessment [^113H9m2z]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This umbrella review across cardiovascular indications used meta-analytic data to clarify the evidence basis for beta-blockers in contemporary clinical practice (Table 1, Fig. 5). In patients with coronary disease, there is a trade-off between benefit and risk. Beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI at the expense of higher rates of incident HF, with no effect on mortality. In patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm, beta-blockers reduced morbidity and mortality, but they had no effect in HFrEF with concomitant atrial fibrillation or those with preserved LVEF. In perioperative patients, although beta-blockers reduced the risk of incident MI in those undergoing non-cardiac surgery, this was at the expense of increased mortality and stroke. Beta-blockers had no effect on any of the outcomes assessed in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In hypertension, although beta-blockers had no significant effect compared to placebo or diuretics, they were inferior to RAS antagonists and CCB. These findings highlight the importance of an individualised assessment of indication, comorbidity and understanding of the goal of therapy before routine commencement of beta-blockers.

### Rationale and design of the β-blocker in heart failure with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (β-PRESERVE) study [^112RrTMB]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

Chronic heart failure with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (HFNEF) is not only common, but also carries a high risk of substantial morbidity and mortality. However, few studies have been conducted in this population and no proven treatment is available. Although beta-blockers are evidence-based first-line therapy in systolic heart failure, they have not been well studied in HFNEF.

Methods

This study is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint (PROBE) trial. A total of 1200 patients will be randomized to either beta-blocker (metoprolol succinate) or control (n = 600 per group). The primary endpoint is a composite of hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular death. The secondary endpoints include cardiovascular death, heart failure mortality or hospitalization, all-cause mortality, change in New York Heart Association class, change in left ventricular ejection fraction, increase in NT-proBNP (by ≥ 50% of the value at randomization), beta-blocker tolerance, and premature termination of beta-blocker therapy due to adverse events. The follow-up period is a minimum of 2 years.

Conclusion

This study will provide important evidence, for the first time to our knowledge, of the long-term efficacy of beta-blocker therapy in the management of HFNEF.

### Prescription of β-blockers in patients with advanced heart failure and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. clinical implications and survival [^114PEHUG]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The effects of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are not well established.

Aims

To assess the association between beta-blocker prescription at discharge and mortality in a cohort of patients with advanced HF and preserved LVEF.

Methods and Results

We prospectively studied a cohort of 443 patients with advanced HF and preserved LVEF (LVEF ≥ 40%). Mean age was 78 years, 56% female, 33% NYHA class IV. Overall, 227 patients (51%) had a beta-blocker prescribed at discharge. Mean duration of follow-up was 25 (± 18) months. Death (all cause) occurred in 40 patients (17.6%) who were receiving a beta-blocker at discharge and 73 patients (33.8%) who were not on a beta-blocker. In multivariate Cox analysis, including adjustment for propensity score, prescription of a beta-blocker remained associated with a 43% relative mortality risk reduction (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.88, p = 0.01).

Conclusions

In this cohort of patients with advanced HF and preserved LVEF, prescription of a beta-blocker was associated with a significant mortality reduction. This beneficial effect of beta-blocker use needs to be further confirmed in prospective, randomised clinical trials.

### Β-blocker use and health status among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111Y9Y59]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Due to common comorbidities and older guidelines,β-blockers are commonly used to treat patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), although there are growing concerns about the potential harm of this practice. Patients with HFpEF often exhibit an inadequate heart rate response to exercise, which can translate to reduced exercise capacity that is further exacerbated by β-blockers. Recent studies have shown that discontinuing β-blockers among patients with HFpEF can improve functional capacity and reduce natriuretic peptides without other apparent adverse effects. Furthermore, observational data suggest that β-blocker use among patients with HFpEF is associated with increased risk of heart failure hospitalization, particularly among those with higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).

Despite this developing evidence of potential harm with β-blockers, their association with patients' health status, symptoms, function, and quality of life is unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we used data from the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial, which demonstrated improved health status with spironolactone, to examine the association of β-blocker use with heart failure–specific health status among patients with HFpEF.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^114q1j4h]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

β-Blockers are prescribed to most patients with heart failure (HF) with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), but their effect on HFpEF remains unclear.

Objective

To determine the association of β-blocker use with HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, overall and in strata of patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of 50% or greater or less than 50%.

Design, Setting, and Participants

For 1761 participants from North and South America enrolled in the multicenter, double-blinded Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist randomized clinical trial of spironolactone for patients with HFpEF between August 10, 2006, and January 31, 2012, the association of baseline β-blocker use with HF hospitalization and CVD mortality was analyzed using unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models, overall and in strata of patients with an EF of 50% or greater or less than 50%. Participants had symptomatic HF with a left ventricular EF of 45% or greater, with enrollment based on either hospitalization attributed to decompensated HF in the prior year or elevated natriuretic peptide levels. Statistical analysis was performed from January 31 to May 2, 2019.

Exposure

Use of β-blockers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident HF hospitalization and CVD mortality.

Results

Among 1761 participants included in the analysis (879 women and 882 men; mean [SD] age, 71.5 [9.6] years), 1394 (79.2%) reported β-blocker use and 1567 (89.0%) had an EF of 50% or greater. Hospitalizations for HF occurred for 399 participants (22.7%), and CVD mortality occurred for 229 participants (13.0%). Use of β-blockers was associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization among patients with HFpEF with an EF of 50% or greater (hazard ratio, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.28–2.37]; P < .001) but not among patients with an EF between 45% and 49% (hazard ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.28–1.63]; P = 0.39). There was a significant interaction between β-blocker use and EF threshold for incident HF hospitalizations (P = 0.03). Use of β-blockers was not associated with a change in CVD mortality.

Conclusions and Relevance

For patients with an EF of 50% or greater, β-blocker use was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalizations but not CVD mortality. For patients with an EF between 45% and 49%, there was no such association.

### Beta-blocker use and outcomes in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction [^1176FVoV]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

In the absence of randomized trial evidence, we performed a large observational analysis of the association between beta-blocker (BB) use and clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) and mildly reduced (HFmrEF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Methods and Results

We pooled individual patient data from four large HFmrEF/HFpEF trials (I-Preserve, TOPCAT, PARAGON-HF, and DELIVER). The primary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization. Among the 16951 patients included, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 56.8%, and 13400 (79.1%) had HFpEF (LVEF ≥ 50%). Overall, 12812 patients (75.6%) received a BB. The median bisoprolol-equivalent dose of BB was 5.0 (Q1-Q3: 2.5–5.0) mg with BB continuation rates of 93.1% at 2years (in survivors). The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the primary outcome did not differ between BB users and non-users (HR 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91–1.05), but the adjusted HR was lower in BB users than non-users (0.81, 95% CI 0.74–0.88), and this association was maintained across LVEF (p interaction = 0.88). In subgroup analyses, the adjusted risk of the primary outcome was similar in BB users and non-users with or without a history of myocardial infarction, hypertension, or a baseline heart rate < 70bpm. By contrast, a better outcome with BB use was seen in patients with atrial fibrillation compared to those without atrial fibrillation (p intreraction = 0.02).

Conclusions

In this observational analysis of non-randomized BB treatment, there was no suggestion that BB use was associated with worse HF outcomes in HFmrEF/HFpEF, even after extensive adjustment for other prognostic variables.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — selection of patients and initiation: Beta-blockers should be prescribed to all patients with stable HF due to reduced LVEF unless they have a contraindication or are unable to tolerate them, and treatment with a beta-blocker should be initiated as soon as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is diagnosed. Therapy should not be delayed until symptoms return or disease progression is documented, and even patients with little disability should receive treatment with a beta-blocker to reduce the risk of disease progression, future clinical deterioration, and sudden death. Patients need not be taking high doses of ACEIs prior to starting a beta-blocker, and in those taking a low dose of an ACEI, adding a beta-blocker produces a greater improvement in symptoms and reduction in risk of death than increasing the ACEI dose to trial targets. In patients with a current or recent history of fluid retention, beta-blockers should not be prescribed without diuretics.

### Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial Infarction [^117VTnAL]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. In 2022, ischemic heart disease, which includes CAD, accounted for the highest global cardiovascular mortality, with an age-standardized rate of 108.8 deaths per 100,000 people, underscoring its public health burden. Characterized by reduced or blocked oxygen flow to the heart, ischemic heart disease is chronic and dynamic in nature. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), arises from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion.CAD and MI incur significant health care costs, projected to surpass US$1 trillion globally by 2030.

Despite significant advancements in MI treatment, several gaps remain, particularly regarding the optimal use and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy following MI in patients with normal versus reduced heart function (ie, those with left ventricular dysfunction). While beta-blocker therapy has been a cornerstone in managing MI due to its ability to reduce myocardial oxygen demand, prevent arrhythmias, and improve survival rates, its effectiveness for patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) or without heart failure remains unclear. Recent reviews have reported mixed findings regarding the long-term effects of beta-blocker therapy, and have unveiled the fact that most of the evidence suggesting its significant CV mortality and morbidity benefits was derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the prereperfusion era (Central Illustration). This presents a critical gap, as current clinical guidelines are based on outdated evidence and lack data from comprehensive RCTs and real-world evidence (RWE) that accurately reflect today's diverse patient populations seen in clinical practice. There is a need for up-to-date, broader and more representative studies that provide insights into the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapyin the context of modern revascularization procedures and newer pharmacotherapies that have improved post-MI outcomes.

### Β-blocker use and health status among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1157mSPq]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is β-blocker use associated with health status or modification of the health status benefits of spironolactone?

Findings

In this cohort study of 1726 patients with HFpEF from the TOPCAT randomized clinical trial, β-blocker use had no significant association with concurrent health status or modification of the health status benefits of spironolactone at 4 months.

Meaning

These findings suggest that further study is needed to clarify the association of β-blockers with health status among patients with HFpEF, particularly across the range of LVEF.

Meta-Analyses Assessing Long-Term Use of Beta-Blocker Therapy and Health Outcomes

For decades, clinical guidelines have extrapolated these results to make recommendations in an ever-changing clinical setting. Yet these recommendations have been constrained by several factors. First, most RCTs were conducted in controlled environments with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may not capture the full spectrum of patients encountered in routine care. Second, the populations studied often included patients with large MI, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which may not reflect the current clinical setting. Additionally, various study limitations, such as high risk of bias, operational definitions of beta-blocker therapy mainly as intravenous treatment, lack of subanalyses by MI type or LVEF, and variation in beta-blocker agents and dosages, have further complicated the interpretation of results.

Background

The effects of β-blocker therapy on clinical outcomes in patients with myocardial infarction and mildly reduced (40–49%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are largely unknown. Four recently conducted randomised trials tested the efficacy of β blockers after a recent myocardial infarction in patients without reduced LVEF (LVEF ≥ 40%). However, none were individually powered to assess these effects in the subgroup of patients with mildly reduced LVEF. We aimed to assess the efficacy of β blockers in patients with myocardial infarction and mildly reduced LVEF during the index hospitalisation.

Methods

We conducted an individual patient-level meta-analysis of patients with mildly reduced LVEF and no history or signs of heart failure from four recent clinical trials. These studies were included because they were randomised controlled trials testing long-term effects (median follow-up > 1 year) of oral β-blocker therapy in patients who recently had a myocardial infarction (randomisation within 14 days) and had mildly reduced LVEF. No further studies were found in a systematic review (Jan 1, 2020 to June 26, 2025). A one-stage, fixed-effects, Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the treatment effect of β blockers on the predefined primary composite endpoint of all-cause death, new myocardial infarction, or heart failure. All endpoints were independently adjudicated. This meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251023480).

Findings

1885 patients with myocardial infarction and mildly reduced LVEF were included in the meta-analysis: 979 from the REBOOT trial, 422 from the BETAMI trial, 430 from the DANBLOCK trial, and 54 from the CAPITAL-RCT trial. Overall, 991 patients were assigned to β blockers and 894 to control (no β blockers). The primary composite endpoint occurred in 106 patients (32.6 events per 1000 patient-years) in the β-blocker group and 129 patients (43.0 per 1000 patient-years) in the no β-blocker group (hazard ratio 0.75 [95% CI 0.58–0.97]; p = 0.031). No heterogeneity between the trials (trial-by-treatment p interaction = 0.95) or between countries of enrolment was observed (p interaction = 0.98).

Interpretation

In patients with acute myocardial infarction with mildly reduced LVEF without history or clinical signs of heart failure, β-blocker therapy was associated with a reduction in the composite of all-cause death, new myocardial infarction, or heart failure. These results extend the known benefits of these agents in patients with myocardial infarction with reduced LVEF to the subgroup with mildly reduced LVEF.

Evidence in favor of beta-blocker treatment in HFpEF

Most patients (55%–87%) enrolled in HFpEF RCTs used open-label beta-blocker therapy despite sparse trial evidenceand mostly as background therapy for concomitant cardiovascular conditions with high heart rate, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or atrial fibrillation. Therefore, designing prospective RCTs in HFpEF with no beta-blocker use in the placebo arm is virtually impossible.

The SENIORS trial with nebivololincluded HF patients not based on LVEF and demonstrated a beneficial beta-blocker effect independent of LVEF in a prespecified subgroup analysis. The effect on the composite primary outcome of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospital admission showed an overall HR of 0.86, and in the subgroup possessing LVEF ≥ 35%, HR was 0.82. Apart from this single RCT, the published literature in HFmrEF or HFpEF patients is based on observational cohorts, on which meta-analyses have also been made. An example is a meta-analysis on beta-blockers in HFmrEF and HFpEF (LVEF > 40%), which revealed that beta-blocker use was associated with reduced risk of mortality. Beta-blockers also have beneficial effects in HFpEF patients who are in sinus rhythm. A specific reason for the beneficial role of beta-blockers in HFpEF beyond their beneficial effects in patients with the concomitant diseases mentioned above is the increased sympathetic activity in this form of HF, whether patients have obesity or not. Another interesting aspect of assessing beta-blockers in HF is their effect on increasing natriuretic peptide (NP) concentrations, likely because of their heart rate-reducing properties. Thus, although beta-blockers continue to be a major therapy in patients with HFrEF, documented for bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol, it is unclear how the increase in NPs contributes to their benefits and whether NPs can be used for monitoring HF progression during beta-blocker treatment.

### Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system for chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1156h8GZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system improve survival and reduce morbidity in people with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. There is uncertainty whether these treatments are beneficial for people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and a comprehensive review of the evidence is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects of beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two clinical trial registries on 25 July 2017 to identify eligible studies. Reference lists from primary studies and review articles were checked for additional studies. There were no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with a parallel group design enrolling adult participants with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, defined by a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 40 percent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. The outcomes assessed included cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, all-cause mortality and quality of life. Risk ratios (RR) and, where possible, hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous data, mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD) were calculated. We contacted trialists where neccessary to obtain missing data.

Main Results

37 randomised controlled trials (207 reports) were included across all comparisons with a total of 18,311 participants. Ten studies (3087 participants) investigating beta-blockers (BB) were included. A pooled analysis indicated a reduction in cardiovascular mortality (15% of participants in the intervention arm versus 19% in the control arm; RR 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 1046 participants; 3 studies). However, the quality of evidence was low and no effect on cardiovascular mortality was observed when the analysis was limited to studies with a low risk of bias (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.29; 643 participants; 1 study). There was no effect on all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation or quality of life measures, however there is uncertainty about these effects given the limited evidence available.12 studies (4408 participants) investigating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were included with the quality of evidence assessed as moderate. MRA treatment reduced heart failure hospitalisation (11% of participants in the intervention arm versus 14% in the control arm; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.98; NNTB 41; 3714 participants; 3 studies; moderate-quality evidence) however, little or no effect on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and quality of life measures was observed. MRA treatment was associated with a greater risk of hyperkalaemia (16% of participants in the intervention group versus 8% in the control group; RR 2.11; 95% CI 1.77 to 2.51; 4291 participants; 6 studies; high-quality evidence). Eight studies (2061 participants) investigating angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as moderate. The evidence suggested that ACEI treatment likely has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. Data for the effect of ACEI on hyperkalaemia were only available from one of the included studies. Eight studies (8755 participants) investigating angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) were included with the overall quality of evidence assessed as high. The evidence suggested that treatment with ARB has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, or quality of life. ARB was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia (0.9% of participants in the intervention group versus 0.5% in the control group; RR 1.88; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.33; 7148 participants; 2 studies; high-quality evidence). We identified a single ongoing placebo-controlled study investigating the effect of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) in people with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Authors' Conclusions

There is evidence that MRA treatment reduces heart failure hospitalisation in heart failure with preserverd ejection fraction, however the effects on mortality related outcomes and quality of life remain unclear. The available evidence for beta-blockers, ACEI, ARB and ARNI is limited and it remains uncertain whether these treatments have a role in the treatment of HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication for their use. This comprehensive review highlights a persistent gap in the evidence that is currently being addressed through several large ongoing clinical trials.

HFpEF Trials of β-Blockers

Our observations contrast with prior randomized β-blocker trials, which did not report increased HF hospitalizations among patients with HFpEF. However, there are several points to consider. First, to our knowledge, only 2 randomized clinical outcome trials have been performed that studied β-blockers in patients with HFpEF. The larger SENIORS trial (Randomized Trial to Determine the Effect of Nebivolol on Mortality and Cardiovascular Hospital Admission in Elderly Patients With Heart Failure) considered an EF greater than 35% to define HFpEF and analyzed 752 participants with an EF in this range, among whom approximately half had an EF between 35% and 50%. In addition, HF hospitalizations were not specifically recorded. The open-label Japanese Diastolic Heart Failure (J-DHF) trial of carvedilol (mean dose, 8.5 mg/d) randomized 245 patients with an EF greater than 40%. It appears possible that assessing HF hospitalizations in mixed populations with a reduced and normal EF may result in an overall neutral or even beneficial effect associated with β-blockers. Furthermore, patients with a history of HF and a recovered EF have recently been shown to gain sustained benefits from guideline-directed HFrEF therapies, which include β-blockers. Their inclusion in HFpEF cohorts — although likely small in numbers — could also be associated with beneficial HF outcomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF) is defined as the presence of heart failure in the absence of any evidence of reduced LV ejection fraction. This type of heart failure is also known as heart failure with intact left ventricular (LV) function. The incidence of HFpEF is on the rise, and research has linked it to an increase in the number of patients who require hospitalization. Numerous studies on patients with chronic heart failure have shown that this syndrome has a high mortality and morbidity rate. However, evidence from clinical studies revealing improvements in mortality has been variable and essentially unbiased; a few investigations suggest that pharmacological therapy may improve the tolerance for exercise and quality of life of these people. Given that patients with heart failure with intact left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are more likely to be older and have a greater number of comorbidities than their counterparts, the efficacy of pharmacological treatment may be best assessed by its impact on hospitalization and associated symptoms. This condition can be treated with neprilysin inhibitors, sacubitril, valsaltran, an interleukin‐1 blocker, Spironolactone, a RAAS blocker, a beta‐blocker (BB), Sildenafil, an aldosterone antagonist, empagliflozin, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Even though there is a paucity of evidence supporting their advantages, BBs are often recommended for HFpEF. BBs, or beta‐adrenergic blocking medications, works by inhibiting the release of stress chemicals adrenaline and noradrenaline in specific regions, which decreases the heart rate and the force with which blood is pushed throughout the body. In their research articles, Yum et al.and Xu et al.found that over 80% of patients with HFpEF received BBs. However, current research suggests a link between the use of CCBs and better outcomes in individuals with HFpEF. CCBs improve HFPEF by reducing peripheral vasoconstriction and, thus, lowering left ventricular afterload. For instance, Vider et al.reported in their study article that the use of CCBs was related to reduced risks of death in patients with HFpEF, whereas Borlaug et al.observed that CCBs were the third‐ or fourth‐line therapy for hypertension in patients with HFpEF. Due to conflicting or insufficient information concerning the effects of medications in patients with HFpEF, it is essential to examine the efficacy of both current treatment choices to avert unembellished outcomes in patients with HFpEF. There is an immediate need for treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet there are currently no medications that have been shown to be successful. Patients with HFpEF routinely get BBs despite a lack of clinical evidence supporting their use. Recent clinical trials have shown that more than 75% of patients with HFpEF are being treated with BBs. Similarly, recent studies suggested that HFpEF patients who used CCBs had better results. In this meta‐analysis, we sought to examine the impact of BBs and CCBs on all‐cause mortality and hospitalization due to cardiovascular causes among patients with heart failure and preserved LVEF.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114o8xWv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Pre–heart failure (stage B) management to prevent clinical heart failure focuses on disease-modifying therapies and device prevention at specific left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) thresholds. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome, statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events. In patients with a recent myocardial infarction and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality. In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality. In patients who are at least 40 days post–myocardial infarction with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving GDMT and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death to reduce total mortality. In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF. In patients with LVEF < 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations. In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful.

This figure illustrates key updates in the ESC guidelines on beta-blocker therapy for secondary prevention following MI, from 2017 to 2023. It highlights evolving recommendations for patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, heart failure, and a history of MI, as well as the class of recommendation and level of evidence for beta-blocker use in ACS and chronic coronary syndromes. The figure also reflects a shift toward broader use of beta-blockers in ACS patients, regardless of heart failure status. ESC = European Society of Cardiology; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

This figure summarizes the 2016 NHFA and CSANZ guidelines on beta-blocker use for secondary prevention after MI. It emphasizes initiating beta-blockers in patients with reduced LVEF (≤ 40%) unless contraindicated, with a class IIa recommendation and level a evidence for this high-risk group. NHFA/CSANZ = National Heart Foundation of Australia & Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand; other abbreviations as in Figure 1.

These variations in guidelines contribute to differing prescription rates globally. For instance, 93% of eligible patients in Europe receive beta-blockers, compared to just 56.5% in South-East Asia. In Italy, more than one-half of MI patients were prescribed beta-blocker therapy, though prescription rates have declined over time. In Australia, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 33% of adults with CVD used beta-blockers in 2017 to 2018, though adherence rates are suboptimal, with only 73% continuing therapy after 12 months.

Several ongoing trials are expected to provide greater clarity on the optimal use of beta-blocker therapy in the context of modern reperfusion therapies. The following RCTs are assessing the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in post-MI patients with preserved LVEF (≥ 40%): the DANBLOCK (Danish trial of beta-blocker treatment after myocardial infarction without reduced ejection fraction), the BETAMI (BEtablocker Treatment After acute Myocardial Infarction in revascularized patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction), and the REBOOT (tREatment with Beta-blockers after myOcardial infarction withOut reduced ejection fracTion) trial. The results from these studies are anticipated to inform and potentially improve current clinical guidelines.

### Beta-blockers after PCI for stable coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction [^114oHaPZ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this population-based study, designed to emulate a randomized controlled trial, suggest that the strategy of early initiation of beta-blockade after PCI for stable CAD in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function may not confer the anticipated cardiovascular benefits and could potentially increase the risk of all-cause mortality. These findings support the current professional guidelines in this patient population (Class of Recommendation III: No benefit), emphasizing the need for personalized therapeutic strategies based on individual risk profiles rather than a universal approach to prescribing beta-blockers.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — trial populations and outcomes with beta-blockers: Beta-blockers have been evaluated in more than 20 000 patients across more than 20 published placebo-controlled trials, enrolling patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) defined as EF less than 35% to 45% who were already treated with diuretics and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), with or without digitalis. Trials generally excluded or underrepresented patients with preserved systolic function, low heart rates (less than 65 beats per min), low systolic blood pressure (less than 85 mm Hg), hospitalization, or class IV HF; one carvedilol trial enrolled clinically stable NYHA class III and IV patients free of edema and showed a mortality reduction similar to less advanced disease. Collectively, long-term beta-blocker therapy can lessen HF symptoms, improve clinical status and well-being, and reduce the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization, with benefits seen regardless of coronary artery disease or diabetes status and in women and black patients; favorable effects were also observed in patients already taking ACEIs, suggesting additive effects from combined blockade of the 2 neurohormonal systems.

### Misconceptions and facts about beta-blockers [^113tw7oQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Beta-blockers are commonly used medications, and they have been traditionally considered "cardioprotective". Their clinical use appears to be more widespread than the available evidence base supporting their role in cardioprotection. Beta-blockers counteract neurohumoral activation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and offer both symptomatic improvement and reduction in adverse events. On the other hand, the use of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension results in suboptimal outcomes compared to the established first-line antihypertensive agents. Providers at all levels should be familiar with common misconceptions regarding beta-blocker use in routine clinical practice.

### Beta-blockers after myocardial infarction in patients without heart failure [^1125XUnk]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The evidence supporting beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction was established before the introduction of modern coronary reperfusion therapy and secondary prevention strategies.

Methods

In an open-label, randomized trial with blinded end-point evaluation, conducted in Denmark and Norway, we assigned patients who had had a myocardial infarction and who had a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 40%, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive long-term beta-blocker therapy within 14 days after the event or no beta-blocker therapy. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or major adverse cardiovascular events (new myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revascularization, ischemic stroke, heart failure, or malignant ventricular arrhythmias).

Results

A total of 5574 patients underwent randomization and were included in the main analyses - 2783 in the beta-blocker group and 2791 in the no-beta-blocker group. After a median follow-up of 3.5 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.6), a primary end-point event had occurred in 394 patients (14.2%) in the beta-blocker group and in 454 patients (16.3%) in the no-beta-blocker group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75 to 0.98; P = 0.03). Death from any cause occurred in 4.2% of the patients in the beta-blocker group and in 4.4% of those in the no-beta-blocker group; myocardial infarction occurred in 5.0% and 6.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.92), unplanned coronary revascularization in 3.9% and 3.9%, ischemic stroke in 1.6% and 1.3%, heart failure in 1.5% and 1.9%, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in 0.5% and 0.6%. No apparent differences in safety outcomes were observed between the groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with a myocardial infarction and a left ventricular ejection fraction of at least 40%, beta-blocker therapy led to a lower risk of death or major adverse cardiovascular events than no beta-blocker therapy.

### Association between β-blockers and outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: current insights from the swedeHF registry [^115J1MFZ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

β-Blockers have an uncertain effect in heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction of 50% or higher (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]).

Methods and Results

We included patients with HFpEF from the Swedish Heart Failure Registry (SwedeHF) enrolled from 2011 through 2018. In a 2:1 propensity-score matched analysis (β-blocker use vs nonuse), we assessed the primary outcome first HF hospitalization, the coprimary outcome cardiovascular (CV) death, and the secondary outcomes of all-cause hospitalization and all-cause death. We performed intention-to-treat and a per-protocol consistency analyses. There were a total of 14,434 patients (median age 79 years, IQR 71–85 years, 51% women); 80% were treated with a β-blocker at baseline. Treated patients were younger and had higher rates of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease, and higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels. In the 4412:2206 patient matched cohort, at 5 years, 42% (95% CI 40%-44%) vs 44% (95% CI 41%-47%) had a HF admission and 38% (IQR 36%-40%) vs 40% (IQR 36%-42%) died from CV causes. In the intention-to-treat analysis, β-blocker use was not associated with HF admissions (hazard ratio 0.95 [95% CI 0.87–1.05, P = 0.31]) or CV death (hazard ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.85–1.03, P = 0.19]). In the subgroup analyses, men seemed to have a more favorable association between β-blockers and outcomes than did women. There were no associations between β-blocker use and secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

In patients with HFpEF, β-blocker use is common but not associated with changes in HF hospitalization or cardiovascular mortality. In the absence of a strong rational and randomized control trials the case for β-blockers in HFpEF remains inconclusive.

Bullet Points

● The effect of β-blockers with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction of 50% or greater is uncertain.● In a propensity score-matched heart failure with preserved ejection fraction analysis in the SwedeHF registry, β-blockers were not associated with a change in risk for heart failure admissions or cardiovascular deaths.

Lay Summary

The optimal treatment for heart failure with a preserved pump function remains unknown. Despite the lack of scientific studies, β-blockers are very commonly used. When matching patients with a similar risk profile in a large heart failure registry, the use of β-blockers for the treatment of heart failure with a preserved pump function was not associated with any changes in heart failure hospital admissions or cardiovascular death.

Stage B (patients with pre-HF) — preventing clinical heart failure (HF) recommendations include: In patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent or remote history of myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS), statins should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and adverse cardiovascular events (Class 1, Level A). In patients with a recent MI and LVEF ≤ 40% who are intolerant to ACEI, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be used to prevent symptomatic HF and reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with a recent or remote history of MI or ACS and LVEF ≤ 40%, evidence-based beta blockers should be used to reduce mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients who are at least 40 days post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and have reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for > 1 year, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to reduce total mortality (Class 1, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF ≤ 40%, beta blockers should be used to prevent symptomatic HF (Class 1, Level C-LD). In patients with LVEF ≤ 50%, thiazolidinediones should not be used because they increase the risk of HF, including hospitalizations (Class 3: Harm, Level B-R). In patients with LVEF < 50%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with negative inotropic effects may be harmful (Class 3: Harm, Level C-LD).

### The evolution of β-blockers in coronary Artery Disease and heart Failure (part 1 / 5) [^1132LJ5V]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

As new treatments continue to improve clinical outcomes in coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure, it is necessary to characterize the appropriate use of β-adrenergic receptor blockers (β-blockers) in the contemporary management of these conditions. This review examines the current evidence supporting β-blocker use in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart failure with midrange ejection fraction (HFmEF), and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), following acute coronary syndrome and in stable CAD. β-Blockers remain essential in the treatment of HFrEF, but limited evidence supports their use in HFmEF or HFpEF. They should still be considered routinely following acute coronary syndrome, but there is a need for contemporary trials that re-examine this in patients without left ventricular dysfunction, as well as in patients with stable CAD. From a global perspective, more studies are needed to characterize the extent of β-blocker use in CAD and heart failure, and how evidence-based use can be improved in these conditions.

### Beta-blockers after myocardial infarction: effects according to sex in the REBOOT trial [^112zNqj5]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Recent trials have challenged the guideline recommendation of beta-blockers for post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Whether these recent findings apply equally to women and men remains unknown.

Methods

Using data from REBOOT (tREatment with Beta-blockers after myOcardial infarction withOut reduced ejection fracTion), the largest randomized trial evaluating the effect of beta-blockers after acute MI with LVEF > 40%, a pre-specified sex-specific subgroup analysis was performed. A total of 8438 out of the 8505 randomized patients comprised the intention-to-treat population.

Results

Among 8438 patients, 1627 were women, who were older, had more comorbidities, and received fewer guideline-based therapies than men. Over a median follow-up of 3.7 years, women had overall higher rates of the primary composite outcome (death, MI, or heart failure hospitalization) than men. The incidence rate of the primary endpoint in women was 30.4 and 21.0/1000 patient-years in the beta-blocker group and no beta-blocker group, respectively (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.04–2.03). No significant differences were observed in men (hazard ratio .94, 95% confidence interval .79–1.13; P for interaction = .026). The excess risk in women was mainly driven by increased mortality and was most evident among those with preserved LVEF (P for interaction = .030) and those receiving higher beta-blocker doses (P for interaction = .045).

Conclusions

In the REBOOT trial of MI patients managed according to contemporary standards, beta-blocker therapy was associated with evidence of harm in women-particularly those with preserved LVEF and receiving higher doses-an effect not observed in men.

### Drug treatment effects on outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1179Hftw]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical drug trials in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction have failed to demonstrate improvements in mortality.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials (RCT) assessing pharmacological treatments in patients with heart failure with left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction ≥ 40% from January 1996 to May 2016. The primary efficacy outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, exercise capacity (6-min walk distance, exercise duration, VO₂ max), quality of life and biomarkers (B-type natriuretic peptide, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled relative risks (RR) for the binary outcomes, and weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes, with 95% CI.

Results

We included data from 25 RCTs comprising data for 18101 patients. All-cause mortality was reduced with beta-blocker therapy compared with placebo (RR: 0.78, 95%CI 0.65 to 0.94, p = 0.008). There was no effect seen with ACE inhibitors, aldosterone receptor blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and other drug classes, compared with placebo. Similar results were observed for cardiovascular mortality. No single drug class reduced heart failure hospitalisation compared with placebo.

Conclusion

The efficacy of treatments in patients with heart failure and an LV ejection fraction ≥ 40% differ depending on the type of therapy, with beta-blockers demonstrating reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Further trials are warranted to confirm treatment effects of beta-blockers in this patient group.

### What is the current best drug treatment for hypertensive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? Review of the totality of evidence [^113hBT7D]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT DRUG TREATMENT OF HF IN PATIENTS WITH A PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION

The objectives of HF treatment are to increase survival, reduce hospitalizations for worsening HF, and improve quality of life. To achieve these objectives, current Americanand EuropeanHF guidelines have developed specific treatment recommendations for patients with HFrEF. In contrast, most patients with a mildly reduced and a midrange LVEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF, respectively, have been left with symptomatic supportive care due to an alleged lack of evidence. Due to data that have emerged from recent RCTs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved new HF drugs, and American guidelines have been revised accordingly. Also, the European Medical Agency (EMA) and European HF Guidelines may follow, at least partly with the SGLT2Is but not with the traditional drug classes mentioned above.

The treatment recommendations for HFrEF include renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (ACEI or ARB, alternatively ARNI), selected beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2Is. The results of major outcome trials and the scientific basis for using these drug classes, "cornerstones", in HFpEF, are summarized in Figure 3 and are further discussed based on information included in Tables 2 and 5.

Bisoprolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and nebivolol are included because these beta-blockers have been proven to reduce mortality in HFrEF. Hypertensive patients with severe HF may have low blood pressure because of very high total peripheral resistance and may need careful in-hospital up-titration of medications from all 4 corners, as indicated in the lower part of Figure 3.

### BEtablocker treatment after acute myocardial infarction in revascularized patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (BETAMI): rationale and design of a prospective, randomized, open, blinded end point study [^1124WDGf]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines on the use of β-blockers in post-acute myocardial infarction (MI) patients without reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are based on studies before the implementation of modern reperfusion and secondary prevention therapies. It remains unknown whether β-blockers will reduce mortality and recurrent MI in contemporary revascularized post-MI patients without reduced LVEF.

Design

BETAMI is a prospective, randomized, open, blinded end point multicenter study in 10,000 MI patients designed to test the superiority of oral β-blocker therapy compared to no β-blocker therapy. Patients with LVEF ≥ 40% following treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention or thrombolysis and/or no clinical signs of heart failure are eligible to participate. The primary end point is a composite of all-cause mortality or recurrent MI obtained from national registries over a mean follow-up period of 3 years. Safety end points include rates of nonfatal MI, all-cause mortality, ventricular arrhythmias, and hospitalizations for heart failure obtained from hospital medical records 30 days after randomization, and from national registries after 6 and 18 months. Key secondary end points include recurrent MI, heart failure, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and clinical outcomes linked to β-blocker therapy including drug adherence, adverse effects, cardiovascular risk factors, psychosocial factors, and health economy. Statistical analyses will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. A prespecified per-protocol analysis (patients truly on β-blockers or not) will also be conducted.

Conclusions

The results from the BETAMI trial may have the potential of changing current clinical practice for treatment with β-blockers following MI in patients without reduced LVEF. EudraCT number 2018-000590-75.

### Comparison of β-blocker effectiveness in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction versus those with reduced ejection fraction [^114BCDkV]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to compare the benefit of beta-blockers (BB) in heart failure (HF) with preserved versus reduced ejection fraction (EF).

Methods and Results

This was a retrospective study of insured patients who were hospitalized for HF from January 2000 to June 2008. Pharmacy claims were used to estimate BB exposure over 6-month rolling windows. The association between BB exposure and all-cause hospitalization or death was tested with the use of time-updated proportional hazards regression, with adjustment for baseline covariates and other HF medication exposure. The groups were compared by stratification (EF < 50% vs ≥ 50%) and with the use of an EF-group × BB exposure interaction term. A total of 1,835 patients met the inclusion criteria, 741 (40%) with a preserved EF. Median follow-up was 2.1 years. In a fully adjusted multivariable model, BB exposure was associated with a decreased risk of death or hospitalization in both groups (EF < 50%: hazard ratio [HR] 0.53 [P < .0001]; EF ≥ 50%: HR 0.68 [P = 0.009]). There was no significant difference in this protective association between groups (interaction: P = 0.32).

Conclusions

BB exposure was associated with a similar protective effect regarding time to death or hospitalization in HF patients regardless of whether EF was preserved or reduced. An adequately powered randomized trial of BB in HF with preserved EF is warranted.

### Beta-blockers withdrawal in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and chronotropic incompetence: effect on functional capacity rationale and study design of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial (the preserve-HR trial) [^113NZZCJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous syndrome that is the predominant form of HF in western countries. 1, 2, 3, 4 Chronotropic incompetence (ChI), defined as the inability to increase heart rate during exercise adequately, is commonly present (ranging from 20 to 75%) in HFpEF patients. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 Furthermore, ChI has been proposed as a pathophysiologic mechanism associated with poorer outcomes and decreased functional capacity in a subgroup of patients with HFpEF. 8, 12, 13

Data from current registries show a high proportion (ranging from 50% to 80%) of beta‐blockers prescription in HFpEF patients regardless of the heart rhythm. 3, 14 Nevertheless, there is no well‐established evidence endorsing the effect of beta‐blockers. For instance, recent studies suggested that patients with an ejection fraction of 50% or greater did not see any benefits from receiving beta‐blockers. 15, 16, 17 Even more, the evidence is missing stratifying patients with HFpEF across ChI status.

When ChI is present, beta‐blockers may have negative effects on functional capacity and other surrogates of the disease severity by exacerbating the ChI. Thus, we hypothesize that deprescribing beta‐blockers in this particular scenario will translate into an improvement in short‐term maximal functional capacity. The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to evaluate the short‐term effects of beta‐blockers withdrawal on the functional capacity, cognitive function, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with HFpEF and documented ChI.

The primary endpoint of the study is absolute and relative changes in peak oxygen uptake (peakVO₂) at 15‐day after the intervention. The secondary endpoints are: (a) 15‐day absolute changes in cognitive function assessed by the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCa); (b) 15‐day absolute changes in echocardiogram parameters (E/E' ratio and left atrial volume index); (c) 15 days absolute changes in QoL assessed by Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHF); and (d) 15 days absolute and relative changes in prognostic biomarkers (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide ‐NT‐proBNP‐ and serum carbohydrate antigen 125‐CA125‐).

Safety endpoints include the composite event of the total number of episodes of acute HF hospitalizations, total episodes of worsening HF not requiring hospitalization or mortality at 6 months.

### Β-blocker use and health status among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113dEPJS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

β-Blockers are a key pillar of guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but their role in HFpEF remains controversial, given a lack of randomized clinical trial data and inconsistent observational data. In this secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial, more than 75% of patients were receiving β-blockers at randomization. β-Blocker use was not significantly associated with health status at baseline or 4 months, nor was it associated with modification of the health status benefits of spironolactone. In addition, the association between β-blocker use and baseline health status did not differ significantly across subgroups defined by baseline heart rate, atrial fibrillation, prior myocardial infarction, or history of stroke. However, there were a few nonsignificant findings that may warrant further investigation. First, patients with higher LVEF (≥ 65%) receiving β-blockers had worse health status than patients with LVEF of 55% to 64% or those with LVEF of 45% to 54%. This finding is consistent with a prior study that showed an increased risk of heart failure hospitalization with β-blockers among patients with higher LVEFbut differed from a second study that showed potential benefit of β-blockers across the range of LVEF. Second, the association of spironolactone with health status was seen predominantly among patients receiving β-blockers, which may indicate that spironolactone can counter some of the negative associations of β-blockers. However, given the sample size of the current study, particularly among patients not receiving β-blockers, these hypothesis-generating findings need to be explored in larger datasets or, ideally, in prospective trials.

Limitations

There are several limitations to our study, most notably the nonrandomized use of β-blockers. Although we adjusted for a broad set of covariates, residual confounding from unmeasured or unknown factors remains possible. The association of β-blockers with health status among patients with HFpEF is likely complicated and related to many factors, such as the presence of persistent arrhythmias, baseline heart rate, and chronotropic response to exercise, which we could not account for in this study. Second, health status can be affected by a number of clinical and sociodemographic factors that were not captured in this study, which could introduce type II error. Third, we could not account for the duration of, intensity of, or adherence to β-blocker use.

### Role of beta blockers following percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome [^115rHHb5]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

There is a paucity of evidence supporting routine beta blocker (BB) use in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this study was to evaluate BB use post PCI and its association with mortality. Furthermore, the study aimed to evaluate the association between BB and mortality in the subgroups of patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 35%, LVEF 35%-50% and LVEF > 50%.

Methods

Using a large PCI registry, data from patients with ACS between January 2005 and June 2017 who were alive at 30 days were analysed. Those patients taking BB at 30 days were compared with those who were not taking BB. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The mean follow-up was 5.3 ± 3.5 years.

Results

Of the 17 562 patients, 83.3% were on BB. Mortality was lower in the BB group (13.1% vs 19.5%, p = 0.0001). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model showed that BB use was associated with lower overall mortality (adjusted HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97, p = 0.014). In the subgroup analysis, BB use was associated with reduced mortality in LVEF < 35% (adjusted HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.91, p = 0.013), LVEF 35%-50% (adjusted HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95, p = 0.01), but not LVEF > 50% (adjusted HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.21, p = 0.74).

Conclusion

BB use remains high and is associated with reduced mortality. This reduction in mortality is primarily seen in those with reduced ejection fraction, but not in those with preserved ejection fraction.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115KtUYC]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Asymptomatic low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and post–myocardial infarction (MI) risk — key evidence and cautions are as follows: The Framingham studies have shown a 60% increased risk of death in patients with asymptomatic low LVEF compared with those with normal LVEF. MADIT-II showed a 31% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with post-MI with LVEF ≤ 30% receiving a prophylactic ICD compared with standard of care. For prevention of progression, beta-blocker therapy is recommended to prevent symptomatic HF in patients with reduced LVEF. Regarding comorbid therapy, thiazolidinediones should be avoided in patients with reduced LVEF. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil are myocardial depressants and generally not tolerated in HF, and although not specifically tested in asymptomatic patients with low LVEF, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be harmful in this population because of their negative inotropic effects.

In the overall HFPEF cohort, the median follow-up time was 755 days, for a total of 46 976 patient-years of follow-up. Among those who received β-blockers, the total number of deaths was 5639 vs 1518 among those who did not receive them.

Quiz Ref IDIn this large prospective propensity score–matched registry analysis of unselected patients with HFPEF, β-blockers were associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Findings in HFPEF were also similar to findings in a positive-control consistency analysis in patients with HFREF, in whom β-blockers have been proven to reduce mortality. However, β-blockers used to treat HFPEF were not associated with improved combined all-cause mortality or heart failure hospitalization. In our overall HFPEF cohort, 83% were receiving β-blockers, which was nearly as high as the 90% in our overall HFREF cohort. This is higher use than that in previous observational HFREF and HFPEF reports. 1, 10, 11, 26, 27 Only 30% had prior myocardial infarction; 50%, atrial fibrillation. β-Blocker use was only slightly higher when treating ejection fraction levels ranging from 40% through 49% compared with ejection fraction levels of 50% or higher.

This was lower than the 35% mortality reduction in a meta-analysis of RCTs that assessed treatment of patients with HFREF, 5 suggesting that the numerically low mortality reduction in HFPEF was due to study design and population rather than a lesser potential effect of β-blockers used to treat HFPEF than to treat HFREF.

### Contemporary use and implications of Beta-blockers in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF: the DELIVER trial [^111qtQG1]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although beta-blockers are not recommended for the treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) according to the latest European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America guidelines, these therapies remain commonly used for comorbidity management. There has been concern that beta-blockers may adversely influence clinical outcomes by limiting chronotropic response in HFpEF.

Objectives

This study sought to examine the contemporary use and implications of beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or HFpEF.

Methods

In the DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure) trial, a total of 6,263 patients with symptomatic heart failure (HF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 40% were randomized to dapagliflozin or placebo across 20 countries. In this prespecified analysis, efficacy and safety outcomes were examined according to beta-blocker use at randomization. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death or worsening HF.

Results

Overall, beta-blockers were used in 5,177 patients (83%), with wide variation by geographic region. Beta-blocker use was associated with a lower risk of the primary outcome in covariate-adjusted models (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.60–0.83). Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of the primary outcome in patients taking beta-blockers (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.72–0.94) and in patients not taking beta-blockers (HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.61–1.03; P interaction = 0.85), with similar findings for key secondary endpoints. Adverse events were balanced between patients randomized to dapagliflozin and placebo, regardless of background beta-blocker use.

Conclusions

In patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF who were enrolled in DELIVER, 4 out of 5 participants were treated with a beta-blocker. Beta-blocker use was not associated with a higher risk of worsening HF or cardiovascular death. Dapagliflozin consistently and safely reduced clinical events, irrespective of background beta-blocker use.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure does not exist: a non-judgmental framework for describing the level of adherence to evidence-based drug treatments for patients with a reduced ejection fraction [^115Wmqtv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Each of the criteria proposed in the table deserves thought and deliberation, particularly with respect to the use of beta‐blockers. Since not all beta‐blockers reduce mortality, the only members of the drug class that warrant inclusion in stratum I are those that have been specifically shown to reduce mortality in large‐scale trials. Furthermore, analyses of these trials have raised important questions about the ability of beta‐blockers to prolong survival in patients with atrial fibrillation, 48 potentially because the target doses used in the pivotal trials may have caused excessive slowing of the ventricular response, which predisposed to fatal bradyarrhythmic events. 49 Consequently, patients with atrial fibrillation who are treated with a beta‐blocker are assigned to stratum I with no designated target heart rate, since heart rates of 80–90 bpm may be appropriate targets for the use of beta‐blockers if patients have atrial fibrillation. 50

### Meta-analysis: β-blocker dose, heart rate reduction, and death in patients with heart failure [^1137Qd3k]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that patients with heart failure receive beta-blockers in doses used in the trials that have proven their efficacy. Although the adverse effects of beta-blockade are dose-related, it is unclear whether the benefits are.

Purpose

To determine whether the survival benefits of beta-blockade in heart failure are associated with the magnitude of heart rate reduction or the beta-blocker dose.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SIGLE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, supplemented by hand-searches of bibliographies.

Study Selection

Randomized, placebo-controlled heart failure trials that reported all-cause mortality.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, beta-blocker dosing and heart rate reduction, and death.

Data Synthesis

The mean left ventricular ejection fraction in the 23 beta-blocker trials ranged from 0.17 to 0.36, and more than 95% of the 19 209 patients had systolic dysfunction. The overall risk ratio for death was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.84); however, heterogeneity testing revealed moderate heterogeneity among trials (I² = 30%), which was associated with the magnitude of heart rate reduction achieved within each trial (P for meta-regression = 0.006). For every heart rate reduction of 5 beats/min with beta-blocker treatment, a commensurate 18% reduction (CI, 6% to 29%) in the risk for death occurred. No significant relationship between all-cause mortality and beta-blocker dosing was observed (risk ratio for death, 0.74 [CI, 0.64 to 0.86]) in high-dose beta-blocker trials vs. 0.78 [CI, 0.63 to 0.96] in low-dose beta-blocker trials; P for meta-regression = 0.69).

Limitations

The analysis is based on aggregate data and resting heart rates. Few patients in these trials had bradycardia or diastolic dysfunction at baseline.

Conclusion

The magnitude of heart rate reduction is statistically significantly associated with the survival benefit of beta-blockers in heart failure, whereas the dose of beta-blocker is not.

### 2020 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^116LtvZ9]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2020). High credibility.

PM-4: Beta-blocker therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — The performance measure defines the percentage of patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge. The numerator is patients who were prescribed beta-blocker therapy either within a 12-mo period when seen in the outpatient setting or at hospital discharge, where outpatient includes a prescription at ≥ 1 visits in the 12-mo measurement period or documentation that the patient is already taking a beta blocker, and inpatient includes a prescription at discharge or documentation to continue therapy after discharge; beta-blocker therapy should include bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol succinate. The denominator is all patients age ≥ 18 with a diagnosis of heart failure with a current or prior LVEF ≤ 40%, with denominator exclusions of heart transplant and LVAD and denominator exceptions for documentation of medical reason(s) (e.g., intolerance) or patient reason(s) (e.g., patient refusal) for not prescribing beta-blocker therapy. Rationale states that beta blockers improve survival and reduce hospitalization for patients with stable heart failure and reduced LVEF, and treatment should be initiated as soon as a patient is diagnosed with reduced LVEF and does not have prohibitively low systemic blood pressure, fluid overload, or recent treatment with an intravenous positive inotropic agent. Clinical recommendations cited are that use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended for all patients with current or prior symptoms of HFrEF, unless contraindicated, to reduce morbidity and mortality (Class I, Level of Evidence: A), and that initiation of beta-blocker therapy is recommended after optimization of volume status and successful discontinuation of intravenous diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents; therapy should be initiated at a low dose and only in stable patients, with caution when patients have required inotropes during their hospital course (Class I, Level of Evidence: B).

### Beta-blockers for congestive heart failure in children [^112KYEzm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers are an essential part of standard therapy in adult congestive heart failure and therefore, are expected to be beneficial in children. However, congestive heart failure in children differs from that in adults in terms of characteristics, aetiology, and drug clearance. Therefore, paediatric needs must be specifically investigated. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2009.

Objectives

To assess the effect of beta-adrenoceptor-blockers (beta-blockers) in children with congestive heart failure.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS up to November 2015. Bibliographies of identified studies were checked. No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, controlled, clinical trials investigating the effect of beta-blocker therapy on paediatric congestive heart failure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted and assessed data from the included trials.

Main Results

We identified four new studies for the review update; the review now includes seven studies with 420 participants. Four small studies with 20 to 30 children each, and two larger studies of 80 children each, showed an improvement of congestive heart failure with beta-blocker therapy. A larger study with 161 participants showed no evidence of benefit over placebo in a composite measure of heart failure outcomes. The included studies showed no significant difference in mortality or heart transplantation rates between the beta-blocker and control groups. No significant adverse events were reported with beta-blockers, apart from one episode of complete heart block. A meta-analysis of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) data showed a very small improvement with beta-blockers. However, there were vast differences in the age, age range, and health of the participants (aetiology and severity of heart failure; heterogeneity of diagnoses and co-morbidities); there was a range of treatments across studies (choice of beta-blocker, dosing, duration of treatment); and a lack of standardised methods and outcome measures. Therefore, the primary outcomes could not be pooled in meta-analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence to support or discourage the use of beta-blockers in children with congestive heart failure, or to propose a paediatric dosing scheme. However, the sparse data available suggested that children with congestive heart failure might benefit from beta-blocker treatment. Further investigations in clearly defined populations with standardised methodology are required to establish guidelines for therapy. Pharmacokinetic investigations of beta-blockers in children are also required to provide effective dosing in future trials.

### Benefits of β blockers in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: network meta-analysis [^112yyVJ6]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

We report categorical outcomes as numbers and continuous outcomes as median (interquartile range). We derived the raw event rates from individual studies and constructed 2×2 tables with raw number of events and total population of the trial. In trials that did not report raw event rates, investigators reported the percentage or proportion of patients having the event under consideration, which we rounded off to whole numbers by using the sample size of the population; we then calculated the risk difference by using the formula 1/(1+%OR), where OR = odds ratio. We calculated number needed to treat and corresponding absolute risk reduction from the 2×2 tables. We abstracted data in duplicate, and the inter-rater agreement was good (κ statistic = 0.88). Considering different lengths of follow-up for individual trials, and to account for censored data, we obtained the rates of outcomes for all trials with follow-up longer than 12 months and calculated the log hazard ratios (assuming a constant rate of hazards for individual trials) from the event rates reported and mean duration of follow-up. We did standard pair-wise meta-analysis comparing β blockers with comparators, with 95% confidence intervals. We also used a random effect model (DerSimonian and Laird) to calculate prediction intervals for all cause mortality, using RevMan v5.1 and Stata version 11. We assessed and quantified heterogeneity with the help of the I² statistic computed with the Cochran Q test.

Overall, 399 patients (22.7%) underwent hospitalization for HF (β-blocker group, 344 of 1394 [cumulative incidence, 24.7%; unadjusted incidence rate, 96 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 86–106]; no β-blocker group, 55 of 367 [cumulative incidence, 15.0%; unadjusted incidence rate, 56 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 43–73]). In the fully adjusted model, there was a higher incidence of HF hospitalizations among patients with an EF of 50% or greater who were receiving β-blockers (Table 2) compared with those not receiving β-blockers (hazard ratio, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.28–2.37]; P < .001) (Figure 2). There was a significant interaction between an EF threshold, β-blocker use, and incident HF hospitalization (P = 0.03); higher EFs were associated with an increased risk for HF hospitalizations among patients receiving β-blockers (Figure 3). Patients with the highest EFs who did not receive β-blockers were least likely to be admitted for HF. There was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower incidence of HF hospitalizations among patients with an EF between 45% and 49% who were receiving β-blockers (hazard ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.28–1.63]; P = 0.39). Cardiovascular disease mortality occurred among 229 participants (13.0%); β-blockers were not significantly associated with a change in CVD mortality (eTable 6 and eFigure 1 in the Supplement).

### What is the current best drug treatment for hypertensive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? Review of the totality of evidence [^1178CrTH]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The fact that ACEIs or ARBs, selected beta-blockers, MRAs, and good choice and dose of diuretic clinically compensated patients with symptoms and signs of HF, whatever LVEF they might have, and improved the prognosis in HFrEF patients, did not exclude the possibility that these drugs had similar beneficial prognostic effects in patients with HF and a preserved EF (HFpEF). Additionally, for most physicians taking care of decompensated HF patients, dividing into HFrEF and HFpEF subsets when recruiting patients to RCTs and excluding HFpEF patients from these drug benefits did not make sense. When working clinically with patients most HF patients were given these drugs anyway because of hypertension and/or the HF itself with apparent clinical benefits. Later, when RCTs were organized in HFpEF patients, it was too late to do studies in untreated patients without these drugs. They were already well established as background therapies in most HF patients. Surprisingly, it became an uphill effort to document the same beneficial effects in patients with HFpEF as in HFrEF.

Additionally, the RCTs of patients with HFpEF preceded the scientific documentation that systolic LV dysfunction was present in most patients beyond the well-described diastolic LV dysfunction. More refined echocardiographic measures of systolic LV function within the preserved LVEF range showed reduced LV mid-wall shortening, stroke volume (SV), and global longitudinal strain. Longitudinal axis shortening could be partly or completely missing as a sign of extensive systolic dysfunction, an echocardiographic observation in patients with HFpEF since the 1990s or even earlier. Thus, most HF patients have systolic dysfunction, whether EF is reduced or preserved.

Furthermore, the event rate in the RCTs in HFpEF was lower than in the corresponding RCTs of patients with HFrEF (Table 1), suggesting difficulties in excluding from RCTs those patients with normal to supra-normal LVEF who did not have HF and thereby could not expect to benefit substantially of the HF medications.

### Cardiac adrenergic activation in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a role for β-blockade? [^114J5H57]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2022). Medium credibility.

The recent clinical success with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) in treating heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]: ≤ 40%) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (LVEF: ≥ 50%) has given rise to the proposition that LVEF cutoffs should no longer be used as the basis for subclassifying heart failure patients into different pathophysiologic phenotypes and that, going forward, for classification systems to have clinical importance, they should be "more representative of the state of our knowledge about heart failure, and should reflect contemporary approaches to how patients with heart failure are evaluated and treated". With this brief context as background, the results by Kaye et al, in this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science raise provocative questions about the state of our knowledge about heart failure, as well as where and how the field should advance.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF; LVEF 41%–49%) — pharmacologic therapy: Diuretics, as needed (1), are included; in patients with HFmrEF, SGLT2i can be beneficial in decreasing HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality; among patients with current or previous symptomatic HFmrEF (LVEF, 41%–49%), use of evidence-based beta blockers for HFrEF, ARNi, ACEi, or ARB, and MRAs may be considered to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality, particularly among patients with LVEF on the lower end of this spectrum.

Results

Study Population

Among the 1767 TOPCAT participants from North America and South America, the mean (SD) age was 71.5 (9.6) years; 879 participants were women and 882 were men, and 1378 participants were white. Six participants were excluded because of missing EF data or missing baseline visit data (Figure 1). The final analytic population was 1761. Median follow-up was 2.4 years (interquartile range, 1.4–3.9 years).

A total of 1394 participants (79.2%) were receiving β-blockers at baseline and 1567 (89.0%) had an EF of 50% or greater (Table 1). Irrespective of β-blocker use, most patients had preexisting hypertension. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation was 42.6% (594 of 1393) among those receiving a β-blocker and 40.7% (149 of 366) among those not receiving a β-blocker, and the prevalence of prior myocardial infarction was 22.1% (308 of 1395) among those receiving a β-blocker and 13.7% (46 of 336) among those not receiving a β-blocker. The proportion of patients with an advanced functional impairment (New York Heart Association class ≥ 3) was almost identical between groups.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113roJAv]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Beta blockers for HFrEF — In patients with HFrEF, with current or previous symptoms, use of 1 of the 3 beta blockers proven to reduce mortality (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations, and beta-blocker therapy provides high economic value. Treatment with beta blockers reduces the risk of death and the combined risk of death or hospitalization in patients with HFrEF. Beta blockers should be initiated at low doses with efforts to achieve target doses as tolerated, and they can be safely started before hospital discharge when patients are clinically stabilized and do not require intravenous inotropic therapy for HF. Even if symptoms or LVEF improve, long-term treatment with target doses should be maintained to reduce risk of progression, and abrupt withdrawal should be avoided unless indicated.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) — evidence for other guideline-directed therapies: Post hoc and subsets of analyses of HFrEF trials that included HFmrEF (LVEF 41%–49%) have suggested benefit from use of GDMT for HFrEF. The BBmeta-HF meta-analysis of 11 heart failure trials found that, in a subgroup of 575 patients with LVEF 40% to 49% in sinus rhythm, beta blockers reduced the primary outcome of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In a subgroup analysis of PARAGON-HF for patients with LVEF 45% to 57% (lower range of EF in the trial), sacubitril-valsartan versus valsartan alone suggested benefit with a rate ratio of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64–0.95).

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^1155pe41]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed from January 31 to May 2, 2019. Baseline characteristics were tabulated by use of a β-blocker vs no use of a β-blocker. β-Blocker use itself was defined as the receipt of any β-blocker at the baseline visit. To assess the association between β-blockers and incident HF hospitalizations, hazard ratios were calculated comparing baseline β-blocker use vs no β-blocker use and stratified by an EF of 50% or greater or less than 50%. This threshold was chosen because it allows for a clinically meaningful separation between HF phenotypes as recommended by current guidelines. In a minimally adjusted covariate model, we corrected for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and treatment assignment (spironolactone or placebo). In the fully adjusted model, baseline myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and hypertension were added to the minimally adjusted model. This analysis was repeated for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Schoenfeld residuals were examined to confirm no violation of the assumptions of the Cox proportional hazards regression model.

The association between level of baseline EF and relative hazard of HF hospitalization for those receiving β-blockers or not in the fully adjusted model was presented using restricted cubic spline models with 95% CIs relative to the median. Knots were not prespecified and were chosen using the Harrell method. The distribution of the baseline EF in both groups by HF hospitalizations was visualized using kernel density plots.

We performed a sensitivity analysis among the participants whose β-blocker status was constant from baseline through each follow-up visit, censoring at the end of follow-up or at the first HF hospitalization. In this population with consistent documentation of β-blocker or no β-blocker use, we calculated relative hazards using the unadjusted, minimally adjusted, and fully adjusted models for HF hospitalizations overall and in the prespecified EF strata. In a second sensitivity analysis among the participants whose β-blocker status was constant, propensity scores were created using 30 baseline demographic, anthropometric, medication, and medical history patient characteristics. Up to 3 patients receiving β-blockers were matched to each patient not receiving a β-blocker. Heart failure hospitalization was analyzed for the propensity score–matched data using stratified Cox proportional hazards regression, with the matched sets as the stratifying variable.

### Β-blocker withdrawal and functional capacity improvement in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113EjGW6]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Increasing the patient's heart rate (HR) has emerged as a therapeutic option in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, the evidence is conflicting, and the profile of patients who benefit most from this strategy remains unclear.

Objective

To assess the association of β-blocker treatment withdrawal with changes in the percentage of predicted peak oxygen consumption (VO2) across indexed left ventricular diastolic (iLVEDV) and indexed left ventricular systolic volumes (iLVESV), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This post hoc analysis was conducted using data from the investigator-blinded multicenter, randomized, and crossover clinical trial, PRESERVE-HR, that took place from October 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020, to investigate the short-term effects (2 weeks) of β-blocker withdrawal on peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2). Patients with stable HFpEF (New York Heart Association functional class II to III) receiving treatment with β-blocker and chronotropic incompetence were included.

Intervention

Participants in the PRESERVE-HR trial were randomized to withdraw vs continue with β-blocker treatment. After 2 weeks, they were crossed over to receive the opposite intervention. This crossover randomized clinical trial examined the short-term effect of β-blocker withdrawal on peak VO2.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was to evaluate the association between β-blocker withdrawal and short-term changes in percentage of peak VO₂ across iLVEDV, iLVESV, and LVEF in patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence treated with β-blocker.

Results

A total of 52 patients (mean age, 73 [SD, 13] years; 60% female) were randomized. The mean resting HR, peak HR, peak VO₂, and percentage of peak VO₂ were 65 (SD, 9) beats per minute (bpm), 97 (SD, 15) bpm, 12.4 (SD, 2.9) mL/kg per minute, and 72.4% (SD, 17.7%), respectively. The medians (minimum-maximum) of iLVEDV, iLVESV, and LVEF were 44 mL/m² (IQR, 19–82), 15 mL/m² (IQR, 7–32), and 64% (IQR, 52%-78%), respectively. After stopping β-blocker treatment, the median increase in peak HR was plus 30 bpm (95% CI, 25–35; P < .001). β-Blocker cessation was differentially associated with change of percentage of peak VO2 across the continuum of iLVESV (P for interaction = .02), indicating a greater benefit in those with lower iLVESV.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, results showed that in patients with HFpEF and chronotropic incompetence receiving treatment with β-blocker, lower iLVESV may identify those with a greater short-term improvement in maximal functional capacity after stopping β-blocker treatment. Further studies are warranted for further investigation.

### Beta-blockers after myocardial infarction and preserved ejection fraction [^115M75BK]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study REDUCE-AMI was published by Troels Yndigegn and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the REDUCE-AMI study, the trial question was: what is the role of β-blockers in patients with myocardial infarction who underwent early coronary angiography and had a preserved ejection fraction? In the REDUCE-AMI study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the REDUCE-AMI study, the population was: 5020 patients (1131 female, 3889 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with acute myocardial infarction who had undergone coronary angiography and had a ejection fraction ≥ 50%. The key exclusion criteria were an indication for or contraindication to β-blocker therapy. In the REDUCE-AMI study, the interventions were: n = 2508 β-blockers (either a target dose of at least 100 mg daily metoprolol or 5 mg daily bisoprolol) n = 2512 no β-blockers (discouraged from using β-blockers). In the REDUCE-AMI study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death from any cause or a new myocardial infarction (7.9% vs. 8.3%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.79 to 1.16). In the REDUCE-AMI study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from any cause (3.9% vs. 4.1%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.24) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (1.5% vs. 1.3%; HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.84) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (4.5% vs. 4.7%; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.74 to 1.24). In the REDUCE-AMI study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in hospitalization for bradycardia, second- or third-degree AV block, hypotension, syncope, or implantation of a pacemaker; hospitalization for asthma or COPD; hospitalization for stroke. In the REDUCE-AMI study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with acute myocardial infarction who had undergone coronary angiography and had a ejection fraction ≥ 50%, β-blockers were not superior to no β-blockers with respect to death from any cause or a new myocardial infarction.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^112q5dAX]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Beta‐adrenergic receptor blockers

Three trials (CIBIS II, MERIT‐HF and COPERNICUS) demonstrated that certain beta‐blockers reduce the risk of all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular death by 30–35%, with a particularly marked (nearly 50%) decrease in the risk of sudden cardiac death; this benefit is accompanied by a 30% decrease in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. These favourable effects have been demonstrated in patients with mild, moderate and severe heart failure and have been statistically persuasive within each trial. The evidence supports the use of bisoprolol, carvedilol and metoprolol succinate, in contrast to other members of the drug class. These findings are supported by other large‐scale trials in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction and in trials of survivors of a myocardial infarction with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or heart failure.,

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Two trials (RALES and EMPHASIS‐HF) demonstrated a 25–30% reduction in the risk of all‐cause mortality and cardiovascular death, which was accompanied by a 35–40% decrease in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. These benefits have been demonstrated with both eplerenone and spironolactone and in patients with mild as well as moderate‐to‐severe symptoms. These findings are supported by the findings of favourable effects of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in other large‐scale trials in patients with post‐infarction left ventricular dysfunction and in diabetes‐related chronic kidney disease.

Sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors

Two trials (DAPA‐HF and EMPEROR‐Reduced) demonstrated a 30% reduction in the risk of hospitalizations for heart failure when patients were treated with dapagliflozin or empagliflozin. A benefit of similar magnitude has been seen with different inhibitors of SGLT2 in large‐scale trials of patients with type 2 diabetes, including those who have heart failure or are at increased risk of serious heart failure events. In addition, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or all‐cause mortality in trials of patients with chronic heart failure, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease; this benefit on survival has been supported by a meta‐analysis of trials in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction and a meta‐analysis of trials in patients with diabetes.

Cancer therapy–related cardiomyopathy — preemptive pharmacotherapy during cancer treatment: Whether the preemptive use of ACEi+ARB, spironolactone, or selected beta blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol is effective in reducing risk has been investigated in small trials with conflicting findings, with the most supportive study randomizing 114 patients with a posttreatment troponin rise > 0.07 ng/mL to enalapril or placebo. None of the patients in the enalapril arm met the primary endpoint (< 10% decrease in LVEF to below 50%), while 43% of patients in the standard of care group had a significant decrease in LVEF; although other studies have shown similar findings, the difference in LVEF between arms was often small (< 5%) and of questionable clinical significance, and none of the studies have assessed whether preemptive use of HF therapies improves clinical outcomes.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^114XDPEm]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Do the benefits of foundational drugs depend on background therapy?

Assuming that there are four foundational pharmacological treatments for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, it is important to ask if the efficacy of each treatment is influenced (favourably or unfavourably) by co‐administration of the other therapies. Are angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors effective only in patients receiving beta‐blockers? Are the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors evident only if patients are receiving mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists? It is understood that each drug class was tested in patients already receiving certain background therapy; however, the fact that background therapy was present does not imply that the background therapy was needed for the study medication to have demonstrated efficacy in a large‐scale trial.

It is therefore noteworthy that the totality of evidence from randomized controlled trials strongly indicates that background therapy does not influence the response to each of the foundational drug classes (Table 1). In general, for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction, beta‐blockers were tested in patients already receiving conventional inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system. However, in the post‐infarction setting, the converse was true, i.e. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors were typically tested in patients already receiving beta‐blockers. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure following a myocardial infarction, beta‐blockers were shown to reduce mortality in trials with and without background therapy with an angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor. Furthermore, the first trial with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (RALES) tested spironolactone in patients who were largely not receiving a beta‐blocker, but the second trial of the drug class (EMPHASIS‐HF) tested eplerenone in a setting where most patients were receiving a beta‐blocker as background therapy; the benefits reported in the two trials were similar. Enalapril was effective in reducing mortality in a trial in which > 50% of the patients received spironolactone and in a trial where potassium‐sparing diuretics were prescribed to < 10%. In the large‐scale trials with sacubitril/valsartan and with SGLT2 inhibitors, the favourable effects of both drug treatments were similar whether patients were or were not receiving a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitors were effective in reducing hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes (with a magnitude similar to that seen in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction), but most of the patients in these trials were not receiving spironolactone or eplerenone. Finally, in the two trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, background therapy with a neprilysin inhibitor did not minimize the benefits of treatment with dapagliflozin and empagliflozin. Background therapy has influenced the effects of the study medication only when the treatments unequivocally interfered with the same pathophysiological pathway (i.e. angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors).

### Role of high-dose beta-blockers in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and elevated heart rate [^115TTY93]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Beta-blockers in high target doses are recommended for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but not for preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Treatment benefits are often more pronounced in high-risk subgroups, and patients with HFpEF with heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute have emerged as such a high-risk subgroup. We examined the associations of high-dose beta-blocker use with outcomes in these patients.

Methods

Of the 8462 hospitalized patients with heart failure with ejection fraction ≥ 50% in the Medicare-linked Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) registry, 5422 had a discharge heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute. Of these, 4537 had no contraindications to beta-blocker use, of which 2797 (2592 with dose data) received prescriptions for beta-blockers. Of the 2592, 730 received high-dose beta-blockers, defined as atenolol ≥ 100 mg/day, carvedilol ≥ 50 mg/day, metoprolol tartrate or succinate ≥ 200 mg/day, or bisoprolol ≥ 10 mg/day, and 1740 received no beta-blockers. Using propensity scores for the receipt of high-dose beta-blockers, we assembled a matched cohort of 1280 patients, balanced on 58 characteristics.

Results

All-cause mortality occurred in 63% and 68% of matched patients receiving high-dose beta-blocker vs no beta-blocker, respectively, during 6 years (median, 2.8) of follow-up (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.98; P = 0.027). The hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause readmission and the combined endpoint of all-cause readmission or all-cause mortality associated with high-dose beta-blocker use were 0.90 (0.81–1.02) and 0.89 (0.80–1.00), respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with HFpEF and heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute, high-dose beta-blocker use was associated with a significantly lower risk of death. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to examine this association.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: present status and future directions [^113MPeZX]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological interventions for heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction

Pharmacological treatment for HFrEF is well established. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers, RAAS inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers can reduce morbidity and mortality in HFrEF patients. Large-scale clinical trials have been instituted to identify effective drugs based on the risk factors for HFpEF –, some of which are ongoing.

The beta (β)-adrenergic system is primarily located in the heart (β1) and smooth muscle (β2). When endogenous catecholamines activate the β1 signaling cascade, the heart contracts more rapidly and forcefully. However, aberrant activation of the neurohormonal system worsens cardiac remodeling in HFrEF, implying that β-adrenergic blockage is beneficial. The β-blockers allow the heart to rest through a significant reduction in cardiac load. Various studies using β-blockers have been conducted using different patient enrollment criteria. However, the overall outcome of β-blocker trials revealed no survival benefit for HFpEF patients. HFmrEF patients showed better survival than HFpEF patients with β-blocker treatment.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^114di3u3]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

TOPCAT Trial Design

The TOPCAT trial and its design have been previously described in detail, as have its main results. The trial was an international, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial of the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone for patients with HFpEF, defined as symptomatic HF at the time of screening and within the preceding 12 months in patients with a left ventricular EF of 45% or greater. Enrollment took place between August 10, 2006, and January 31, 2012, with mean follow-up of 3.3 years, and was based on either a hospitalization attributed to decompensated HF in the preceding year or elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro BNP (NT-proBNP) levels (BNP level ≥ 100 pg/mL [to convert to nanograms per liter, multiply by 1.0] or NT-proBNP level ≥ 360 pg/mL) within 60 days of screening. The initial comprehensive baseline visit included a detailed medical history of comorbidities, social history, risk factor documentation, medication survey, quality of life questionnaire, and assessment of physical activity and medications. Not all follow-up visits included a medication inventory. The University of Vermont Institutional Review Board deemed this research to be exempt from review as it was a retrospective analysis performed on a deidentified data set. Enrolled patients provided written informed consent. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Analyzed Population

We used the deidentified TOPCAT database from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Biologic Specimen and Data Repositories Information Coordinating Center. Because of reported trial quality concerns in some regions, we analyzed the data only from South America and North America. Patients without a baseline EF and those without a recorded baseline visit were also excluded. We used baseline and follow-up medication logs to chart β-blocker use.

### Effect of age and sex on efficacy and tolerability of β blockers in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: individual patient data meta-analysis [^1129A5s7]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of β blockers in a broad age range of women and men with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) by pooling individual patient data from placebo controlled randomised trials.

Design

Prospectively designed meta-analysis of individual patient data from patients aged 40–85 in sinus rhythm at baseline, with left ventricular ejection fraction < 0.45.

Participants

13,833 patients from 11 trials; median age 64; 24% women.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was all cause mortality; the major secondary outcome was admission to hospital for heart failure. Analysis was by intention to treat with an adjusted one stage Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

Compared with placebo, β blockers were effective in reducing mortality across all ages: hazard ratios were 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.83) for the first quarter of age distribution (median age 50); 0.71 (0.58 to 0.87) for the second quarter (median age 60); 0.65 (0.53 to 0.78) for the third quarter (median age 68); and 0.77 (0.64 to 0.92) for the fourth quarter (median age 75). There was no significant interaction when age was modelled continuously (P = 0.1), and the absolute reduction in mortality was 4.3% over a median follow-up of 1.3 years (number needed to treat 23). Admission to hospital for heart failure was significantly reduced by β blockers, although this effect was attenuated at older ages (interaction P = 0.05). There was no evidence of an interaction between treatment effect and sex in any age group. Drug discontinuation was similar regardless of treatment allocation, age, or sex (14.4% in those give β blockers, 15.6% in those receiving placebo).

Conclusion

Irrespective of age or sex, patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm should receive β blockers to reduce the risk of death and admission to hospital. Registration PROSPERO CRD42014010012; Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00832442.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116p4DEi]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) — pharmacologic recommendations: In patients with HFmrEF, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) can be beneficial in decreasing heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality. Among patients with current or previous symptomatic HFmrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF], 41%–49%), use of evidence-based beta blockers for HFrEF, angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) may be considered to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality, particularly among patients with LVEF on the lower end of this spectrum.

### Pharmacologic management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111kXZAH]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an overview of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), as well as its pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical evidence regarding its pharmacologic management.

Data Sources

Peer-reviewed articles were identified from MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Current Contents (all 1966-August 2010) using the search terms heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, diastolic dysfunction, diastolic heart failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), digoxin, β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and vasodilators. Citations from available articles were also reviewed for additional references.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Fourteen published manuscripts relating to pharmacologic management of HFPEF were identified.

Data Synthesis

The prevalence of HFPEF has continued to increase. Compared to heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, HFPEF has been largely understudied. Unlike in the management of heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists did not demonstrate mortality benefit in HFPEF, with the exception of one small study evaluating the use of propranolol. However, this study enrolled a small number of patients with recent history of myocardial infarction, which limited the generalizability of the results. Most of the current evidence centers on morbidity benefits and symptom reduction. One study showed that treatment with candesartan reduced hospital admissions in this population of patients. Management of HFPEF still focuses on optimally managing underlying diseases (eg, hypertension).

Conclusions

Much remains to be learned about the appropriate pharmacologic management of patients with HFPEF. Hypertension is in most cases the predominant contributor to its development and progression. For this reason, antihypertensive treatment, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, β-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers, has been evaluated and is recommended to control the disease in this patient population, although these agents have not demonstrated significant benefit beyond blood pressure control. Further research into the pathophysiology of HFPEF may contribute to identifying the most optimal agent in managing this disease.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^1111CiNt]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Possible Pathophysiological Mechanisms

Evidence that may help explain these findings comes from related patient populations with preserved EFs. Specifically, the LIFE (Losartan Intervention For Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension) trialand contemporary randomized myocardial infarction trials, have raised concerns that β-blocker use is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including an increased risk of developing HF. Mechanistically, this risk was explained by an increase in central blood pressure by reflected pressure waves. In addition, prolonged diastolic filling increases ventricular volumes and pressures, increasing the ventricular load. These mechanisms combine to increase myocardial wall stress, which may explain why, in historical hypertension trials, BNP and NT-proBNP levels were found to be elevated in patients receiving β-blockers.

Similarly, in the TOPCAT trial, β-blocker use was associated with higher levels of circulating BNPs and NT-proBNPs in patients with a normal EF. The same was seen in the ELANDD (Effects of the Long-term Administration of Nebivolol on the Clinical Symptoms, Exercise Capacity, and Left Ventricular Function of Patients With Diastolic Dysfunction) study, which assessed the effect of nebivolol on clinical symptoms and exercise capacity in patients with diastolic dysfunction, and in the CIBIS-ELD (Titration to Target Dose of Bisoprolol vs Carvedilol in Elderly Patients With Heart Failure) study, which evaluated the tolerability of β-blocker up-titration in patients with HFpEF. In the SWEDIC (Swedish Doppler-Echocardiographic) study of patients with HFpEF randomized to receive carvedilol or placebo, BNP levels also increased, and the authors noted an unexpected worsening in HF in the patients treated with carvedilol. As has been recently demonstrated, β-blocker cessation for patients with stable HFpEF is safe and leads to marked reductions in NTpro-BNP levels.

Although incremental increases in BNP and NT-proBNP levels have been associated with worse outcomes for patients with HFpEF — including in another secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial — it is not clear whether this predictive capacity is preserved if indeed modified by β-blockers. However, in contrast with the observations of patients with HFpEF, BNP and NT-proBNP levels are markedly lowered by sustained β-blocker use among patients with HFrEF.

### Effect of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction [^111ze6WA]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure has traditionally been categorized into two phenotypes based on the measurement of ejection fraction. Patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less typically have heart failure due to loss of cardiomyocytes, which is accompanied by meaningful left ventricular dilatation and a biomarker profile that reflects cardiomyocyte injury and stretch. In contrast, patients with an ejection fraction > 40% have heart failure that is accompanied by comorbidities (such as obesity) that do not lead to marked ventricular enlargement and are accompanied by a biomarker profile that reflects inflammation and fibrosis. Patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less are commonly men, whereas those with an ejection fraction > 40% are commonly women. Although patients with an ejection fraction of 40–50% are often referred to as having mid-range ejection fraction, these patients resemble those with a reduced ejection fraction with respect to their therapeutic responses.

Large-scale clinical trials have shown that several neurohormonal antagonists can reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less, but these drugs have not been consistently effective in patients with an ejection fraction > 50%, although there has been considerably heterogeneity in the reported effect sizes based on ejection fraction. Beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors appear to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalizations in patients with an ejection fraction of 40–49%, but the magnitude of the benefits of all three drug classes is meaningfully reduced in patients with an ejection fraction of 50% or greater. In some analyses, a modest treatment effect with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and neprilysin inhibitors has been reported in patients with an ejection fraction of 50–55%, but only in women, and not in men.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The present meta‐analysis was undertaken following the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

2.1 Data sources and searches

An inclusive literature search was conducted without any limitations on the year and language of publication utilizing the electronic databases Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed up to September 30, 2022 using the following search criteria: (I) "heart failure with preserved ejection fraction " OR "HFpEF"; (II) "beta‐blockers" OR BB; (III) "calcium channel blockers" OR "CCB"; (IV) "all‐cause mortality"; (V) Length of hospitalization; (VI) and "cardiovascular outcomes". Within the context of the search strategy, the Boolean operator "AND" was used to combine the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) with the text keywords. First, duplicate articles were deleted from the search results, followed by a title and abstract screening of the remaining articles. Finally, the full texts of all the qualified studies were retrieved and reviewed for inclusion and exclusion based on the inclusion–exclusion criteria.

2.2 Study selection

The literature search was conducted separately by two authors. Through discussion, a consensus was obtained in the event of dispute. The following conditions must be met for a study to qualify: (a) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of BBs and CCBs; (b) studies that evaluate at least one of the following two outcomes: all‐cause mortality, or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes. Exclusion criteria included clinical trials with a follow‐up time of smaller than one month. Studies that were led on healthy volunteers or on those who suffered from disorders other than HFpEF were also not considered. In the end, studies that compared medications other than BBs and CCBs were not included in this meta‐analysis.

### How to manage heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: practical guidance for clinicians [^113Fz8uh]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Although patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%) comprise nearly half of those with chronic heart failure, evidence-based treatment options for this population have historically been limited. Recently, however, emerging data from prospective, randomized trials enrolling patients with HFpEF have greatly altered the range of pharmacologic options to modify disease progression in selected patients with HFpEF. In the context of this evolving landscape, clinicians are increasingly in need of practical guidance regarding the best approach to management of this growing population. In this review, the authors build on the recently published heart failure guidelines by integrating contemporary data from recent randomized trials to provide a contemporary framework for diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of patients with HFpEF. Where gaps in knowledge persist, the authors provide "best available" data from post hoc analyses of clinical trials or data from observational studies to guide management until more definitive studies are available.

### Β-blocker therapy in heart failure… [^1161D2Bs]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

bisoprolol, carvedilol, and metoprolol; 2 of these, carvedilol and metoprolol, have Food and Drug Administration indications for the treatment of heart failure. Compared with placebo treatment, β-blocker use is associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients. have arrived at the same conclusions: the use of β-blockers was associated with a consistent 30% reduction in mortality and a 40% reduction in hospitalizations in patients with heart failure. In the most recent of these meta-analyses, 92 it was estimated that 26 patients would need to be. treated to avoid 1 death; 25, to avoid 1 hospitalization. Despite differences in patient selection, target doses, methodology, and clinical end points, results were remarkably consistent across these trials. The evidence suggests that virtually all patients with heart failure caused by LV systolic dysfunction benefit from β-blockers.

heart failure and an ejection fraction less than 40% were randomized to placebo or metoprolol. Metoprolol initiated at a dose of 5 mg twice daily and titrated to a high dose of 100 to 150 mg/d was associated with a 34% decrease in the combined primary end point. Although the improvement was due entirely to a. which consisted of different multicenter trials, 8, 81, 97 each with a run-in period and including 1094 patients with chronic heart failure. Within each of the trial protocols, patients with mild, moderate, or severe heart failure and LV ejection fractions of 35% were randomized to carvedilol. used intravenous inotropes or vasodilators within 2 weeks, or had 3 heart failure admissions within 1 year, carvedilol use was associated with a 50% RR reduction in all-cause mortality. Carvedilol was well tolerated at 12 months, with 13% of the carvedilol-treated patients and 16%. therapy.

Patients with LV dysfunction with or without heart failure were randomized to carvedilol or placebo early after an AMI. Patients receiving carvedilol had a lower rate of all-cause mortality, with a hazard ratio of 0.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes — beta-blocker therapy: In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without contraindications, early (< 24 hours) initiation of oral beta-blocker therapy is recommended to reduce risk of reinfarction and ventricular arrhythmias, and a low dose should be started early after diagnosis of ACS (< 24 hours) with slow dose escalation as blood pressure and heart rate permit; examples of contraindications include acute heart failure (HF) [Killip class II–IV], low cardiac output or risk for cardiogenic shock, PR interval > 0.24 milliseconds, second- or third-degree heart block without a pacemaker, severe bradycardia, and active bronchospasm. Use should be discontinued in those with new or worsening HF symptoms or signs of cardiogenic shock. In hemodynamically stable patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who do not have acute HF, intravenous beta blockers can be administered prior to reperfusion if there are ongoing symptoms or a clinical indication, but routine use prior to PPCI is not supported because of inconsistent results regarding infarct size or clinical outcomes. Patients with an initial contraindication can be reassessed after 24 hours for initiation if the contraindication has resolved, although the optimal duration of beta-blocker use remains unclear in patients with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and a randomized trial did not confirm long-term benefit after hospital discharge in lower risk patients with preserved LV function who had undergone coronary revascularization.

Beta-blockers

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

Several landmark RCTs demonstrated significant mortality benefit with the use of beta-blockers in HFrEF. Seventeen non-randomized studies reported 18 estimates of beta-blocker 'treatment-effect'. Sixteen of these suggested beta-blocker use was associated with a lower mortality, and two did not, (Table 3).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

The effect of beta-blockers on mortality was examined in one small randomized trialand a pre-specified subgroup analysis of a randomized trial which included patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF. Overall, we identified 13 non-randomized studies of beta-blockers in HFpEF, of which nine reported an association between beta-blocker use and better survival, whereas four did not, (Table 3).

Mixed/unspecified heart failure phenotype

One moderately large RCT evaluated the effects of nebivolol in patients with both HFrEF and HFpEF, demonstrating a neutral effect on mortality. We identified 17 observational studies reporting 19 estimates of the 'effect' of treatment, with 17 suggesting benefit, and two reporting no difference in outcome between those treated with and not treated with a beta-blocker(Table 3).

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction

Two pivotal RCTs in HFrEF demonstrated the mortality and hospitalization benefits of MRAs. In contrast, of 12 non-randomized studies only one concluded MRAs were of benefit, with 10 finding a neutral effect, and one suggesting a harmful effect(Table 4).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction

One large RCT showed no effect of spironolactone on mortality in patients with HFpEF. Two observational studies also found a neutral effect, but a further non-randomized study reported an association between MRA use and lower mortality(Table 4).

Mixed/unspecified heart failure phenotype

Of five studies of patients with a mixed HF phenotype, two suggested benefit, and three reported a neutral effect, (Table 4).

### Guidelines for treating heart failure [^114pU75L]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Optimal guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction comprises the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril/valsartan), an evidence-based beta-blocker (bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol), a mineralocorticoid antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin). Optimal guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction comprises a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor with emerging evidence to support the use of a mineralocorticoid antagonist and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. This review will summarize the evidence behind the guideline recommendations, the impact of newer trials on management of patients with HF, and strategies for implementation into clinical practice.

### Rapid evidence-based sequencing of foundational drugs for heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction [^117XB13Z]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Step 1. Simultaneous initiation of a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor

Based on the evidence from randomized controlled trials, which of the foundational agents should be initiated as the first step? In our view, the most serious and unexpected complication of heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction is sudden cardiac death, and the most effective and rapidly‐acting means of preventing such death is beta‐adrenergic blockade, presumably because beta‐blockers interfere with catecholamine‐related ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Additionally, among the four foundational drug classes, beta‐blockers are most likely to exert favourable effects on left ventricular remodelling during long‐term treatment, yielding important recovery of a depressed ejection fraction. However, for beta‐blockers to be initiated safely (regardless of their position in the sequence), physicians should ensure that patients are clinically euvolaemic before the start of treatment and that concurrently administered diuretics are promptly intensified if fluid retention (as evidenced by weight gain) occurs. Failure to do so may explain why initiation of beta‐blockade can result in early worsening of heart failure, which can be avoided (even in patients with severe symptoms) if clinical euvolaemia is achieved and maintained.

Because of the predilection of beta‐blockers to cause fluid retention, we favour a strategy where beta‐blockers are combined with an SGLT2 inhibitor as the first step in drug sequencing. As a result of their actions on sodium and glucose transport in the proximal renal tubule, SGLT2 inhibitors promote a short‐term osmotic diuresis, which may contribute to the established ability of this drug class to reduce worsening heart failure events, a benefit that is seen rapidly following initiation of treatment. This early effect may help to minimize the risks of fluid retention that can be seen following initiation of treatment with a beta‐blocker. SGLT2 inhibitors also exert a striking nephroprotective effect, as evidenced by a slowing of the decline in glomerular filtration rate during long‐term therapy. This favourable effect on kidney function is especially important since several other foundational drugs (e.g. angiotensin receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) often act to worsen renal function in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction. Importantly, treatment with a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor does not require specialized safety monitoring or laboratory testing. As a result, the ability of patients to tolerate a combination of a beta‐blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor can generally be fully established within 2 weeks of starting outpatient treatment with both classes of drugs.

### Beta-blocker use is associated with prevention of left ventricular remodeling in recovered dilated cardiomyopathy [^113iQFFj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Swedberg et al demonstrated that withdrawal of beta‐blockers in 15 patients with congestive HF who had recovered from systolic LV dysfunction caused a significant decrease in LVEF, which was improved within a few weeks to months after readministration of beta‐blockers. In a retrospective cohort study of 42 patients with recovered DCM, recurrence of LV dysfunction was correlated with the discontinuation of HF medications. The TRED‐HF open‐label, pilot, randomized trial, examined the effects of phased withdrawal of HF medications in patients with recovered DCM and showed that 44% of these patients met the primary outcome, defined by a decrease in LVEF of > 10% and < 50%, an increase in LV end‐diastolic volume of 10%, a 2‐fold rise in N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide to > 400 ng/L, or clinical evidence of HF. The present study focused on beta‐blockers and LV function and demonstrated the first evidence regarding ameliorating effects of beta‐blockers on a decrease in LVEF in patients with recovered DCM. Beta‐blockers attenuated not only a decrease in the LVEF but also an increase in LVDD, suggesting their preventive effects on recurrence of LV remodeling.

Absolute difference in delta LVEF between groups was small (2.4% in patients with LVEF ≥ 50% and 0.9% in LVEF between 40% and 50%). Previous studies showed that change in LVEF in response to carvedilol compared with placebo was 5% to 8% in patients with HFrEF. One possible reason for this discrepancy is that 60% of the patients had HFmrEF, and around half of the patients did not experience a decrease or increase in LVEF in this study. Although a dose‐response relationship between delta LVEF and beta‐blockers was observed, median carvedilol dose was 10 mg. It was half of the dose recommended in the Japanese Circulation Society Guideline. This also accounted for a modest change in LVEF by beta‐blockers. However, beta‐blockers prevented a decrease in LVEF ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% and transition to HFrEF, which represent clinically relevant differences.

Atenolol

Clinical trials testing atenolol on outcomes in patients with HF are lacking. Atenolol (mean dose 50 mg daily) was compared with metoprolol tartrate (mean dose 65.5 mg daily) in a RCT in 150 patients with mild-to-moderate HF (aged 70 or less) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II and III, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%. During a follow-up of 12 months, atenolol significantly reduced the combined end point (all-cause death plus CV hospitalisation) versus control (p = 0.0001); however, significantly more patients had a combined end point on control (n = 19) and on atenolol (n = 8) versus metoprolol (n = 4; p = 0.0428 for the difference between atenolol, p = 0.0002 for the difference between control). Moreover, the hospitalisation rate was significantly reduced with metoprolol (4%) versus atenolol (12%) and placebo (26.3%). Additionally, the combined end point (all-cause mortality and CV hospitalisation) was significantly reduced with metoprolol (RR reduction (RRR) 77%) versus atenolol (RRR = 53%). This trial indicated that both atenolol and metoprolol are beneficial in patients with HF but that metoprolol is more effective than atenolol.

In another study, 100 patients with class II or III HF (LVEF ≤ 25%) already receiving high-dose enalapril (40 mg daily) were randomised to atenolol (maintenance dose 89 mg/day) or placebo for 395 days. The primary combined end point (worsening HF or death) was significantly reduced with atenolol versus placebo (p < 0.01). Despite this fact, there was no significant reduction in death or worsening HF with atenolol versus placebo when these end points were individually assessed (death: 5 vs 8, worsening HF: 8 vs 19, respectively). However, hospitalisations for CV events (6 vs 21, p = 0.07), hospitalisations for worsening HF (5 vs 12, p = 0.05) and hospitalisations for arrhythmias (1 vs 9, p < 0.01) were all reduced with atenolol.

### Beta-blockers withdrawal in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and chronotropic incompetence: effect on functional capacity rationale and study design of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial (the preserve-HR trial) [^113DbEeU]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is complex and multifactorial. Chronotropic incompetence (ChI) has emerged as a crucial pathophysiological mechanism. Beta-blockers, drugs with negative chronotropic effects, are commonly used in HFpEF, although current evidence does not support its routine use in these patients.

Hypothesis

We postulate beta-blockers may have deleterious effects in HFpEF and ChI. This work aims to evaluate the short-term effect of beta-blockers withdrawal on functional capacity assessed by the maximal oxygen uptake (peakVO2) in patients with HFpEF and ChI.

Methods

This is a prospective, crossover, randomized (1:1) and multicenter study. After randomization, the clinical and cardiac rhythm will be continuously registered for 30days. PeakVO₂ is assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) at 15 and 30days in both groups. Secondary endpoints include quality of life, cognitive, and safety assessment. Patients with stable HFpEF, functional class New York Heart Association (NYHA) II-III, chronic treatment with beta-blockers, and ChI will be enrolled. A sample size estimation [alfa: 0.05, power: 90%, a 20% loss rate, and delta change of mean peakVO₂: +1.2 mL/kg/min (SD ± 2.0)] of 52 patients is necessary to test our hypothesis.

Results

Patients started enrolling in October 2018. As January 14th, 2020, 28 patients have been enrolled. It is projected to enroll the last patient at the end of July 2020.

Conclusions

Optimizing therapy that improves functional capacity remains an unmeet priority in HFpEF. Deprescribing beta-blockers in patients with HFpEF and ChI seems a plausible intervention to improve functional capacity. This trial is an attempt towards precision medicine in this complex syndrome.

### Association of β-blocker use with heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular disease mortality among patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction: a secondary analysis of the TOPCAT trial [^114yqKPj]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

To provide some pathomechanistical insights, we compared BNP and NT-proBNP levels at baseline by β-blocker status overall and stratified by an EF of 50%. We compared log-transformed baseline levels of BNP and NT-proBNP using unadjusted 2-tailed t tests. We visualized distributions of the quartiles of the BNPs and NT-proBNPs and the midrange of each quartile among those with an EF of 50% or greater using stacked bar graphs.

The analyses were performed with Stata MP, version 15.1 (StataCorp) and the SAS, version 9.4 procedure PSMATCH (SAS Institute Inc) for the propensity score matching. We considered a 2-tailed P < .05 to be statistically significant.

### The duration of β-blocker therapy and outcomes in patients without heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction: a multicenter prospective cohort study [^111y83Ki]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Some milestone studies such as the BHAT (The Beta‐blocker Heart Attack Trial), and the ISIS‐I (First International Study of Infarct Survival) had established that beta‐blockers can significantly reduce mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) was published in the 1980s. The beta‐blockers then become a central component of pharmacological treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Subsequently, progress has been made in the treatment of MI and mortality has decreased remarkably thanks to the application of treatments such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), antiplatelet drugs, and statins. Because of this, it is questionable whether beta‐blockers can still benefit AMI patients at a time when reperfusion treatment and secondary prevention therapy are widely available.

There are difficulties in the precise application of beta‐blockers in patients with AMI. Guidelines are inconsistent regarding the indication population for beta‐blocker therapy. Evidence demonstrates that beta‐blocker therapy is essential as a cornerstone in the treatment of AMI patients with reduced left ventricular systolic function (LVEF < 40%). However, the efficacy of beta‐blockers in AMI patients with midrange/preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ≥ 40%) is unclear. Also, Guidelines or consensus, with fewer recommendations for the duration of beta‐blocker therapy after AMI. 2012 ACCF recommends that beta‐blocker therapy be continued for 3 years in patients with the acute coronary syndrome who have a normal left ventricular function (LVEF > 40%). The latest ESC Guidelines for the management of AMI in patients presenting with ST‐segment elevation do not give any recommendations in this respect. The Canadian Heart Research Centre recommends, based on consensus, patients with a mild‐moderate reduction of left ventricular function (LVEF ≥ 40%) who have undergone successful reperfusion, treatment discontinuation could be considered after 6 months. The benefits of early beta‐blocker therapy have been demonstrated, whereas few studies have been conducted on the duration of beta‐blocker therapy, with more attention focused on the impact of long‐term beta‐blocker therapy on outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to learn the effect of continuous beta‐blockers therapy (lasted ≥ 6 months) on AMI patients without heart failure (HF) or left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

In 2016, there were no specific recommendations for any disease‐modifying treatment in HFmrEF or HFpEF. Still, a vast majority of patients in HF III received ACEi/ARB and beta‐blockers. It is unknown if indications have been primarily HF or some comorbidity such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease or diabetic kidney disease. Post‐hoc analyses of randomized HFpEF trials, and the 2021 guidelinessuggest that use in HFmrEF may be reasonable, whereas in HFpEF (EF ≥ 50%) there appears to be no benefit at all from ARBs or beta‐blockers.
