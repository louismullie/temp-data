## Question

Causes of gastroesophageal varesis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of gastroesophageal varices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiology and the portal pressure threshold that drives variceal formation. Then, I should verify the predominant etiologies of portal hypertension, distinguishing cirrhotic from non-cirrhotic causes. Next, I will examine less common contributors and clarify what is not a cause. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, hierarchical summary and ensure each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental mechanism. Gastroesophageal varices are dilated submucosal collaterals that form when portal pressure rises and the normal hepatic venous outflow is impeded, creating portosystemic shunting at the gastroesophageal junction. Clinically significant portal hypertension is typically defined at a portal pressure gradient of 10 mmHg or higher, which correlates with variceal formation and decompensation risk [^4a28ae53] [^3536b9b6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiologies before I verify the major categories. The predominant cause is cirrhosis from chronic liver disease, with alcohol-related liver disease, metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis, and chronic viral hepatitis (notably HCV) being the most common drivers of fibrosis and increased intrahepatic resistance that lead to portal hypertension and varices [^fe64fbf6] [^4a28ae53].

> Wait, let me verify the non-cirrhotic causes so I don't over-attribute everything to cirrhosis. Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension accounts for a meaningful minority and includes portal vein thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. These entities raise portal pressure via obstruction or microvascular remodeling without advanced fibrosis, thereby promoting variceal collaterals at the gastroesophageal junction [^6c42803a] [^42c39ed3] [^afa98fa6].

> I should double-check the contribution of splanchnic inflow and the hyperdynamic circulation. Increased splanchnic blood flow from vasodilation augments portal inflow and, in the setting of fixed outflow resistance, accelerates variceal enlargement and bleeding risk. This hemodynamic component explains why variceal bleeding correlates with the severity of portal hypertension and variceal size rather than liver function alone [^4a28ae53] [^137d06ed].

> Let me consider less common or indirect contributors, but I need to be cautious not to overstate them. Chronic infections, thrombophilias, medications, and immunologic or genetic disorders can underlie non-cirrhotic portal hypertension and thus varices; however, these are upstream drivers of portal hypertension rather than direct causes of varices per se, and their prevalence varies geographically, with infections more prominent in Eastern cohorts and thrombophilia in Western cohorts [^42c39ed3].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "gastroesophageal reflux disease might contribute", but hold on, I should verify that. GERD is not a cause of gastroesophageal varices; it is a separate pathophysiologic entity with different mechanisms and complications, so I should explicitly correct that conflation and keep GERD out of the causal pathway for varices [^69402988] [^400486c0].

> I will now examine the strength of evidence to ensure I'm aligning with guidelines. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same causal framework: varices result from portal hypertension due to cirrhosis in most cases, with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension as the next most common category. This is reflected in AASLD, EASL, and contemporary reviews, and is reinforced by the diagnostic use of varices themselves as evidence of clinically significant portal hypertension on endoscopy or imaging [^4a28ae53] [^2f364b95] [^983ccc16].

> Let me synthesize a concise, hierarchical answer. The primary cause of gastroesophageal varices is portal hypertension, most commonly from cirrhosis due to alcohol-related liver disease, MASH, and chronic hepatitis C. Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension from portal vein thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension are important secondary causes. Less common contributors include chronic infections, thrombophilia, medications, and immunologic or genetic disorders that lead to non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. GERD is not a cause of varices, and the unifying mechanism is a portal pressure gradient of about 10 mmHg or higher that drives portosystemic collateral formation at the gastroesophageal junction [^fe64fbf6] [^4a28ae53] [^6c42803a] [^42c39ed3] [^3536b9b6].

---

Gastroesophageal varices are caused by **portal hypertension** [^4a28ae53], most often due to **cirrhosis** from chronic liver disease (alcohol, hepatitis B/C, NASH) [^fe64fbf6]. Non-cirrhotic causes include portal vein thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and schistosomiasis [^6c42803a] [^42c39ed3]. Varices form when portal pressure exceeds ~10 mmHg [^3536b9b6], forcing collateral veins to enlarge and become fragile, risking life-threatening bleeding [^4a28ae53]. Management focuses on **lowering portal pressure** and preventing hemorrhage [^c0d836b5] [^728a05ad].

---

## Pathophysiology

The key mechanism is **portal hypertension** [^4a28ae53], defined as a portal pressure gradient > 5 mmHg; clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) is ≥ 10 mmHg and drives variceal formation and bleeding risk [^3536b9b6]. CSPH arises from increased intrahepatic resistance (fibrosis, nodules, microthrombi) and increased splanchnic inflow from vasodilation, producing a hyperdynamic circulation and portosystemic collaterals, including gastroesophageal varices [^4a28ae53].

---

## Cirrhotic causes

Cirrhosis is the **most common cause** of portal hypertension and varices [^fe64fbf6]. Major etiologies include:

- **Alcoholic liver disease**: Chronic alcohol use causes fibrosis and cirrhosis, leading to portal hypertension and varices [^fe64fbf6].

- **Chronic viral hepatitis**: HBV and HCV cause progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis, with varices in 50–60% of compensated and up to 85% of decompensated patients [^085a18a0].

- **Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)**: Metabolic liver disease is a rising cause of cirrhosis and varices [^fe64fbf6].

---

## Non-cirrhotic causes

Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension accounts for ~20% of cases and includes:

| **Cause** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) | Thrombotic obstruction of the portal vein increases prehepatic resistance [^6c42803a] |
| Budd-Chiari syndrome | Hepatic vein thrombosis/obstruction increases posthepatic resistance [^afa98fa6] |
| Schistosomiasis | Granulomatous portal fibrosis increases intrahepatic resistance [^notfound] |
| Idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (INCPH) | Unknown; features portal hypertension without cirrhosis [^42c39ed3] |

---

## Risk factors for variceal formation and bleeding

Several factors influence variceal development and bleeding risk:

- **Severity of portal hypertension**: Higher gradients increase variceal size and bleeding risk [^4a28ae53].

- **Variceal size**: Larger varices bleed more often [^085a18a0].

- **Red wale marks**: Endoscopic stigmata indicate high risk of bleeding [^085a18a0].

- **Child-Pugh class**: Advanced liver disease increases bleeding risk [^085a18a0].

---

## Clinical implications

Variceal bleeding is a **major complication** with 6-week mortality ~20% [^fe64fbf6]; risk stratification and prophylaxis are essential [^c0d836b5] [^728a05ad]. Screening endoscopy is recommended at cirrhosis diagnosis, with prophylaxis for medium/large varices using nonselective beta-blockers or band ligation [^a8b70254] [^d930b06b].

---

Gastroesophageal varices result from portal hypertension, most often due to cirrhosis, with non-cirrhotic causes such as portal vein thrombosis, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and schistosomiasis also contributing [^4a28ae53]. The central mechanism is a **portal pressure gradient ≥ 10 mmHg**, which drives collateral formation and variceal enlargement, creating a high risk of bleeding [^3536b9b6].

### Update on the management of gastrointestinal varices [^fe64fbf6]. World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gastroesophageal varices:

- **Definition**: GEV are abnormally dilated submucosal distal veins developing at sites near the formation of gastroesophageal collateral circulation.
- **Pathophysiology**: GEV are most frequently caused by portal hypertension (a result of ALD cirrhosis, MASH, and hepatitis C infection).
- **Epidemiology**: The rate of hospitalization due to esophageal varices in the US is estimated at 1,181 per 100,000 population/year.
- **Disease course**: GEV correlate with the severity of liver disease and are present with other symptoms of chronic liver disease including spider nevi, jaundice, palmar erythema, splenomegaly, ascites, encephalopathy, and caput medusae. The disease increases the risk of variceal bleeding and rebleeding and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The six-week mortality rate of patients with index esophageal variceal bleeding is approximately 20%.

### Gastric varices: an updated review of management [^5b8746ca]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Gastric varices are less prevalent than esophageal varices, but are associated with an increased mortality with each bleeding episode. This review describes the portal hemodynamics, classification, and management of gastric varices. Management options are outlined based on the most recent literature and according to the clinical presentation of acutely bleeding gastric varices, secondary prophylaxis after bleeding, and primary prophylaxis against an initial bleed. The optimal treatment remains controversial because of the lack of data from large controlled trials. We suggest an algorithm for the management based on the etiology of the gastric varices, severity of the underlying liver disease, and local availability and expertise.

### Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^9c9ac334]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal varices are present in almost half of patients with cirrhosis at the time of initial diagnosis. Variceal bleeding occurs in 25% to 35% of patients with cirrhosis. Effective and timely care can prevent variceal bleeding (primary prophylaxis). For example, clinical studies demonstrate that both beta-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation are effective in preventing a first episode of variceal bleeding. The major challenge is to screen patients in a timely manner and institute a form of therapy that has the highest chance of success in terms of patient compliance and effectiveness.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease… [^69402988]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Heartburn, acid reflux, and acid indigestion are all terms used to describe a burning feeling in the chest or a backwash of stomach contents into the mouth or the esophagus. If you have these symptoms more than twice a week for more than a few weeks, you may be diagnosed as having gastroesophageal reflux disease. Symptoms The most common symptoms of GERD are a burning feeling in the chest and regurgitating food or liquid into the throat. Other symptoms include dry, chronic cough; wheezing or asthma; sore throat or hoarseness; and tooth erosion.

Endoscopy, in which the doctor uses a video camera to look at the esophagus X-ray scans of the upper gastrointestinal tract to look for narrowing of the esophagus or other problems Manometry to measure the muscle contractions of the esophagus Treatment There are a number of treatments you can try at home. You may need to use 1 or more treatments on an ongoing basis. Medication: Over-the-counter medications include antacids and 2 types of medicines that reduce stomach acid: H2 receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors. Changes in diet: Some people find it helpful to avoid eating or drinking chocolate, coffee, peppermint, greasy or spicy foods, tomato products, and alcohol. Surgery Sometimes doctors recommend surgery for GERD, most commonly laparoscopic fundoplication. This procedure involves folding the top portion of the stomach over the opening of the esophagus to prevent backwash of contents.

In some cases, the doctor may recommend weight loss surgery. Complications Left untreated, GERD can cause problems in the esophagus, including ulcers, swallowing problems, or Barrett esophagus, a condition that increases risk of esophageal cancer.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of gastric varices [^6c42803a]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hemorrhage, resulting from gastric varies, can be challenging to treat, given the various precipitating etiologies. A wide variety of treatment options exist for managing the diverse range of the underlying disease processes. While cirrhosis is the most common cause for gastric variceal bleeding, occlusion of the portal or splenic vein in noncirrhotic states results in a markedly different treatment paradigm. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^ad90db82]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — conclusions on bleeding gastric varices emphasize that bleeding GV is a rare complication of portal hypertension but is typically more severe with higher mortality than other portal hypertension bleeding. The diagnostic and treatment algorithms of bleeding GV are complex and require a multidisciplinary team approach to management, often at a tertiary care center where multiple options for therapy are available. Given the heterogeneity of prior research and lack of uniform definitions or standardized outcomes in this field, it is difficult to provide strong, evidence-based recommendations. Large studies to define the natural history of GV, risk factors for bleeding, and optimal diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are needed to improve understanding and management of this condition.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of bleeding gastric varices: expert review [^143e43db]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of bleeding gastric varices (GV) presents a unique challenge for patients with portal hypertension. Despite over thirty years of diagnostic and treatment advances standardized practices for bleeding GV are lacking and unsupported by adequate evidence. There are no definitive natural history studies to help with risk assessment or prospective clinical trials to guide clinical decision making. Available literature on the natural history and management of gastric varices consists of case series, restricted cohort studies, and a few small randomized trials, all of which have significant selection biases. This review summarizes the available data and recommendations based on expert opinion on how best to diagnose and manage bleeding from gastric varices. Table 1 summarizes our recommendations.

### Risk of rebleeding from gastroesophageal varices after initial treatment with cyanoacrylate; a systematic review and pooled analysis [^29025b16]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver cirrhosis is the leading cause of portal hypertension which in turn, leads to portal hypertension and gastrointestinal varices. Up to 17% of liver cirrhosis patients will develop esophageal varices, while 15% will develop gastric varices. Up to 30%, gastroesophageal varices will bleed within 2 years. Bleeding from varices is one among gastrointestinal emergencies that account for the majority of mortalities and morbidities among portal hypertension patients despite the cause. About 50 to 80% of patients who survive the first episode of variceal hemorrhage will have a recurrent early or late rebleeding episode. Up to 20% of patients with a rebleeding episode will not survive.

From older literature, half of the variceal hemorrhages would stop spontaneously however, the risk of rebleeding and mortality increases significantly. Current studies, however, report that in patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh of class C or with hepatic venous pressure of higher than 20 mm Hg are less likely to spontaneous stoppage of bleeding. These patients would require interventional hemostatic measures with pharmacological drugs such as octreotide, somatostatin and beta blockers; endoscopic sclerotherapy, band ligation, or tissue adhesives injection; and/or shunting by surgery or by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt to achieve hemostasis. A selective combination of these approaches has also been reported. Different hemostatic approaches differ in terms of their success rates in achieving hemostasis, preventing rebleeding, and reducing mortality and morbidity. With advancing technology, each approach has evolved, and tissue adhesives have increasingly being used as the first line of therapy during the last decades.

### Correlation between serum liver fibrosis markers and early gastroesophageal varices among patients with compensated liver cirrhosis: a cross-sectional analysis [^448ea847]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Portal hypertension, defined as increased pressure in the portal venous system, is a major complication of liver cirrhosis. Vasodilation of the splanchnic capillary beds and arterioles increases the portal blood flow, which, combined with an increase in the intrahepatic vascular resistance, increases the portal pressure. Its complications, which include ascites, gastroesophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome, cause significant morbidity and mortality. Collaterals develop at the sites of communication between the portal and systemic circulation when the portal pressure increases above a threshold. The most significant collaterals are gastroesophageal varices. Anatomic studies have revealed that early gastroesophageal varices (GEVs) are dilated deep intrinsic veins in the submucosa of the distal oesophagus and proximal stomach of patients with portal hypertension. Patients with varices have a one-third probability of developing a variceal bleed 2 years after diagnosis, with a 20 to 40% mortality rate per episode. Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding is a leading cause of death in patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, early detection of early gastroesophageal varices significantly reduces mortality and medical costs and improves patient survival and prognosis. However, most current studies have focused on high-risk oesophageal and gastric varices and bleeding-related research.

### Factors impacting physicians' decisions to prevent variceal hemorrhage [^e896b4d2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal varices are a common complication of portal hypertension, developing in approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis. The risk of bleeding in patients with moderate to large varices (where moderate refers to varices elevated above the mucosal surface but occupying less than one-third of the esophageal lumen and large occupy more than one-third of the esophageal lumen) is up to 15% per year and variceal hemorrhage is associated with a mortality rate of 20% at six weeks. Given the high prevalence of gastroesophageal varices among patients with cirrhosis, and the high risk of mortality associated with bleeding, screening for varices and use of prophylactic therapies to prevent a first variceal hemorrhage are critical components of care.

Two treatment options have been proven to be effective in preventing first variceal bleed in patients with cirrhosis and moderate to large gastroesophageal varices: non-selective beta-blockers (BBs) and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Meta-analyses show that, compared to no treatment or placebo, both options reduce the risk of first variceal hemorrhage and improve survival in patients with medium/large varices. BBs, have the added benefit of potentially decreasing other complications of portal hypertension (such as ascites), but they have disadvantages including the need for daily medication and adverse events such as fatigue, dizziness and impotence. EVL has the added benefit of visually confirming variceal eradication, but requires conscious sedation, periodic endoscopic surveillance, and is associated with a risk of dysphagia and bleeding ulcers. Combination therapy with both BBs and EVL has not been shown to improve outcomes. Thus, evidence-based guidelines recommend that patients with moderate to large gastroesophageal varices be treated with either BBs or EVL (but not both) to prevent an initial hemorrhage.

Editorials and a previous pilot study demonstrate variability in physician preferences for EVL versus BBs. The reasons underlying this variability, however, have not been studied. The objectives of this study were to examine whether gastroenterologists can be classified into at least two distinct subgroups based on how they prioritize the specific attributes related to BBs and EVL and whether physician characteristics are associated with group membership and treatment preference.

### Pediatric gastroesophageal varices: treatment strategy and long-term results [^1b5dde51]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

There are various treatment strategies for gastroesophageal varices in children. We studied the therapeutic value of endoscopic variceal clipping (EVC) and ligation (EVL).

Methods

Four hundred ninety-nine endoscopic examinations performed between 1991 and 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. F2 and F3 varices with red color signs on follow-up endoscopy were treated with prophylactic EVC. In variceal rupture cases, EVC and EVL were used in combination.

Results

Eighty-two prophylactic EVCs were done, and variceal progression was prevented in 89.9%. However, some patients had persistent red color signs and required frequent EVC. Ten emergent procedures were done for variceal rupture, and, in 4 cases, EVL was used to arrest massive variceal bleeding. Five patients developed bleeding during follow-up cause by rupture of gastric fundal varices, which probably had been aggravated by prior treatment for esophageal varices.

Conclusions

The control of gastroesophageal varices by routine EVC was satisfactory. However, ruptures during follow-up suggested the importance of controlling gastric fundal varices. Endoscopic variceal ligation is a simple, effective, and safe treatment tool, particularly for ruptured varices. However, it is difficult to treat gastric fundal varices with EVL; this disadvantage of EVL can be overcome by the concomitant use of EVC.

### Challenges in the management of esophagogastric varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis – A narrative review [^79041189]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Over the past decade, significant advancements in pharmacological, endoscopic, and radiographic treatments have emerged in the management of patients with cirrhosis and esophagogastric varices or variceal hemorrhage. These advances have been in several areas, including the role of screening and primary prophylaxis (preventing an initial variceal bleed), evaluation and management of acute esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage, and in preventing variceal rebleeding. Therefore, we believe there is a need for an updated, evidence-based "narrative review" on this important clinical topic that will be relevant for internists, hospitalists, intensive care unit physicians, and those in training. We believe the guidance presented in this narrative review will enhance daily medical practice of health care professionals and has the potential to improve quality of care for these complex patients.

### Endoscopic treatment for gastroesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis: a survey comparing between developed and developing countries [^f638cabb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is a paucity of consensus among endoscopists in both developing and developed countries regarding the preferred initial endoscopic therapy for non-bleeding medium-to-large esophageal varices, active gastric cardia variceal bleeding, and gastric fundic variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Similarly, there is considerable variation in the time of secondary prophylaxis after acute (esophageal or gastric) variceal bleeding in patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The findings of this study indicate that the medical burden and prognosis of patients with cirrhotic gastroesophageal varices vary between developing and developed countries. Further high-quality clinical research is required to identify more appropriate treatments for gastroesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. In addition, it is of paramount importance to provide continuing education and training for endoscopists.

### Efficacy and safety of endoscopic primary prophylaxis of bleeding in children with high-risk gastroesophageal varices [^23715621]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Primary prophylaxis of bleeding is debated in children with gastroesophageal varices; one of the reasons is the limited number of studies concerning its efficacy and safety. We report our experience with endoscopic primary prophylaxis.

Methods

From 2006 to 2019, 145 children (median age, 3.5 years; cirrhosis, n = 116) with high-risk gastroesophageal varices underwent primary prophylaxis (banding, n = 114; sclerotherapy n = 31, primarily in smaller children).

Results

We observed the eradication of varices in 93% of children after a mean of 6 months, at least one recurrence of varices in 45% after eradication, and gastrointestinal bleeding in 17% of children. Irrespective of the cause of portal hypertension, grade 3 esophageal varices, presence of gastric varices along the cardia and a lower composite score of endoscopic severity were associated with a worse probability of eradication, a longer time to eradication and a lower risk of a first recurrence and of bleeding following the procedure, respectively. Ten-year probabilities of overall survival and of bleeding-free survival were 95% and 75%, respectively.

Conclusions

Endoscopic primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is reasonably effective and safe in children with high-risk gastroesophageal varices. Worse results are observed in children with more advanced endoscopic features. This pleads for endoscopic screening in children with portal hypertension and early detection of varices warranting primary prophylaxis.

### The role of a multidisciplinary team in the management of portal hypertension [^133da483]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Portal hypertension is associated with a series of clinical presentation such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, gastroesophageal varices, and hepatorenal syndrome. Gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage is the hallmark and arguably the most severe complication of portal hypertension, with a mortality rate of 10–20% within 6 weeks. Despite adequate treatment and resuscitation, rate of variceal rebleed within the first year remains concerning. The current recommendations for gastroesophageal varices include pharmacological treatment as primary prophylaxis, as well as endoscopic treatment with band ligation or tissue adhesive injection. While, the utility of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement may be suitable in high-risk patients. Splenectomy with devascularization surgery is also an option for gastroesophageal varices, especially in patients with concurrent hypersplenism.

Multidisciplinary team (MDT) comprises of a group of medical experts and specialists across a range of disciplines, working together to deliver comprehensive patient care. Regardless of guideline recommendations, MDT clinic provides personalized and targeted patient care tailored to each individual's condition, circumstances, and expectations. Relevant experts with different expertise are brought together to discuss and formulate a treatment plan. The present study is aimed at evaluating the value of MDT clinic in the management of gastroesophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension.

### Endoscopic management of esophageal and gastric lesions with underlying varices [^2308b7ce]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recent developments in endoscopic techniques have contributed to establishing endoscopy as an essential tool in the management of different types of esophageal and gastric lesions. However, management of these lesions with underlying varices is challenging, considering the technical difficulties and increased risk of bleeding it entails with current endoscopic techniques. Consequently, most endoscopists are hesitant to use this technically challenging procedure. Nevertheless, rare cases of successful endoscopic resection of superficial lesions on or adjacent to varices have been reported. Several endoscopic techniques, including endoscopic mucosal resection, endoscopic submucosal dissection or radiofrequency ablation, have demonstrated safety and feasibility in this setting, sometimes with technical modifications, or in combination with previous variceal eradication procedures that aim to decrease the risk of bleeding. In this review, we summarize the current evidence regarding endoscopic management of gastroesophageal lesions in patients with portal hypertension and underlying varices. It appears that liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices are not absolute contraindications in selected patients at specialized referral centers. Nevertheless, specific recommendations are lacking and further studies are needed to define the most appropriate endoscopic techniques and to determine which patients may be the best candidates.

### Endoscopic management of portal hypertension and varices [^41534d36]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic liver disease as well as various other conditions can change vascular resistance in the portal system thereby leading to portal hypertension. Acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding is a dreaded complication of portal hypertension associated with high morbidity and mortality. Historically, endoscopy in the management of portal hypertension was limited to the prevention and treatment of esophageal varices. However, advancements in endoscopic-ultrasound techniques and availability of new devices have opened a new frontier in the management of gastric varices. Additionally, advancements in endoscopic techniques now allow for a more comprehensive diagnostic approach to portal hypertension. In this review, we summarize the role of endoscopy in the management of portal hypertension and varices.

### Clinical pharmacology of portal hypertension [^3536b9b6]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension is an increase in pressure in the portal vein and its tributaries. It is defined as a portal pressure gradient (the difference in pressure between the portal vein and the hepatic veins) greater than 5 mm Hg. Although this gradient defines portal hypertension, a gradient of 10 mm Hg or greater defines clinically significant portal hypertension, because this pressure gradient predicts the development of varices, decompensation of cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The most direct consequence of portal hypertension is the development of gastroesophageal varices that may rupture and lead to the development of variceal hemorrhage. This article reviews the pathophysiologic bases of the different pharmacologic treatments for portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis and places them in the context of the natural history of varices and variceal hemorrhage.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease | NEJM resident 360… [^400486c0]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published September 28, 2022 Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition in which the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and complications. Read the NEJM Clinical Practice Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: Describe the range of manifestations associated with GERD. A: Although heartburn and regurgitation are considered typical, a broad range of manifestations have been associated with GERD, including chronic cough, a globus sensation, wheezing, posterior laryngitis, dental erosions, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Risk factors for GERD include an age of 50 years or older, current smoking, use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, obesity, low socioeconomic status, and female sex. Q: Of patients with GERD, who should undergo upper endoscopy.

A: Upper endoscopy is generally limited to patients with GERD who report alarm symptoms, who have no response or an incomplete response to treatment or have recurrent GERD after a successful 8-week course of empirical therapy, who are candidates for antireflux or bariatric surgery, or who are at increased risk for Barrett's esophagus. A: Pharmacologic treatment for GERD includes medications taken as needed or daily. The medications that are most frequently used are antacids, histamine2 blockers, and proton pump inhibitors. PPIs are the most effective medication for GERD symptom relief, healing of erosive esophagitis, and prevention of disease relapse and complications.

In a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials of antireflux therapies in patients with erosive esophagitis, the percentage of patients with esophageal healing within 12 weeks after starting treatment was 51. 9% with histamine2-receptor antagonists as compared with
83. 6% with PPIs, and healing was more rapid with PPIs. Moreover, PPIs were superior to histamine2-receptor antagonists in relieving symptoms, maintaining symptom relief, and preventing complications. PPIs should be used at the lowest dose that controls the patient's symptoms and esophageal inflammation, and the appropriateness of treatment should be periodically reevaluated.

### Diagnosis and management of ectopic varices in portal hypertension [^6c78df73]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Ectopic variceal bleeding is a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding that can occur in settings of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension and is characterised by its development at locations remote from the oesophagus and stomach. Ectopic varices can be difficult to identify and access, and, although a relatively uncommon cause of portal hypertensive bleeding, can represent a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge associated with considerable mortality. Low incidence and variance in variceal anatomy preclude large randomised controlled trials, and clinical practice is based on experience from case reports, case series, and specialist centre expertise. Optimisation of survival outcomes relies on understanding a patient's portal venous anatomy and functional hepatic reserve to guide timely and targeted endoscopic and endovascular interventions to facilitate the rapid control of ectopic variceal bleeding.

### Carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective β-blockers for adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices [^0d4dc26a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Non-selective beta-blockers are recommended for the prevention of bleeding in people with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices. Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with additional intrinsic alpha 1 -blocking effects, which may be superior to traditional, non-selective beta-blockers in reducing portal pressure and, therefore, in reducing the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of carvedilol compared with traditional, non-selective beta-blockers for adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices.

Search Methods

We combined searches in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary's Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index with manual searches. The last search update was 08 May 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials comparing carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers, irrespective of publication status, blinding, or language. We included trials evaluating both primary and secondary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults with cirrhosis and verified gastroesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors (AZ, RJ and LH), independently extracted data. The primary outcome measures were mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and I 2 values as a marker of heterogeneity. We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary domains and the quality of the evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

Eleven trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. One trial did not report clinical outcomes. We included the remaining 10 randomised clinical trials, involving 810 participants with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices, in our analyses. The intervention comparisons were carvedilol versus propranolol (nine trials), or nadolol (one trial). Six trials were of short duration (mean 6 (range 1 to 12) weeks), while four were of longer duration (13.5 (6 to 30) months). Three trials evaluated primary prevention; three evaluated secondary prevention; while four evaluated both primary and secondary prevention. We classified all trials as at 'high risk of bias'. We gathered mortality data from seven trials involving 507 participants; no events occurred in four of these. Sixteen of 254 participants receiving carvedilol and 19 of 253 participants receiving propranolol or nadolol died (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.53; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). There appeared to be no differences between carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers and the risks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.37; 810 participants; 10 trials; I² = 45%, very low-quality evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42; 810 participants; 10 trials; I² = 14%, low-quality evidence). Significantly more deaths, episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events occurred in the long-term trials but there was not enough information to determine whether there were differences between carvedilol and traditional, non-selective beta-blockers, by trial duration. There was also insufficient information to detect differences in the effects of these interventions in trials evaluating primary or secondary prevention. There appeared to be no differences in the risk of non-serious adverse events between carvedilol versus its comparators (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.29; 596 participants; 6 trials; I² = 88%; very low-quality evidence). Use of carvedilol was associated with a greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient than traditional, non-selective beta-blockers both in absolute (MD -1.75 mmHg, 95% CI -2.60 to -0.89; 368 participants; 6 trials; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence) and percentage terms (MD -8.02%, 95% CI -11.49% to -4.55%; 368 participants; 6 trials; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). However, we did not observe a concomitant reduction in the number of participants who failed to achieve a sufficient haemodynamic response (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; 368 participants; 6 trials; I² = 42%; very low-quality evidence) or in clinical outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no clear beneficial or harmful effects of carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers on mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, serious or non-serious adverse events despite the fact that carvedilol was more effective at reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient. However, the evidence was of low or very low quality, and hence the findings are uncertain. Additional evidence is required from adequately powered, long-term, double-blind, randomised clinical trials, which evaluate both clinical and haemodynamic outcomes.

### Preventing the development of varices in cirrhosis [^61d3caf1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal varices are a direct consequence of portal hypertension. Nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers decrease portal pressure and are effective in preventing variceal hemorrhage. However, a large multicenter placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers are not effective in preventing the development of varices and are associated with a significant rate of adverse events. This therapy is, therefore, not recommended in compensated cirrhotic patients without varices at large. In this very compensated group of patients with cirrhosis (stage 1, ie, without varices and without ascites or encephalopathy) the predictive value (both for the development of varices and for the development of clinical decompensation) of a baseline hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 10 mm Hg is confirmed, supporting this threshold level as one that defines a clinically significant portal hypertension. Importantly, reductions in hepatic venous pressure gradient > 10% are associated with a significant reduction in the development of varices, a therapeutic goal that could be achieved through the use of beta-blockers or other drugs being developed for the treatment of portal hypertension.

### Endoscopic treatment for gastroesophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis: a survey comparing between developed and developing countries [^bf24b846]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The rupture of gastroesophageal varices (GOV) is a serious complication in patients with cirrhosis. Despite the recent advancements in treatment, acute variceal bleeding (AVB) is associated with a concerningly high mortality rate of ~ 20% at 6 weeks. The prevalence of gastroesophageal varices (GOV) in patients with portal hypertension is 17–25%, whereas esophageal varices (EV) are found in up to 85% of these patients. Although EV are more prevalent and frequently present with bleeding, bleeding from gastroesophageal varices (GOV) tends to be more severe, with a 3-year incidence rate of 16–45% and a higher mortality rate. The available evidence suggests that gastroesophageal varices type 2 (GOV2) and isolated gastric varices type 1 (IGV1) located on the proximal side of the greater curvature of the cardia present with an elevated risk of rebleeding and mortality and high likelihood of endoscopic treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to manage GOV with the risk of bleeding, including primary prevention for bleeding, treatment for AVB, and secondary prevention for rebleeding.

For patients with AVB, combined treatment with vasoactive drugs, prophylactic antibiotics, and endoscopic techniques is the recommended standard of care. However, many promising new modalities have emerged, such as the combination of coil and glue injection for management of gastric varices and hemostatic powder application. However, the practice of treating GOV is still faced with numerous challenges: (1) The efficacy of endoscopic treatment in AVB is not clear within 24 h of the treatment. (2) There are no guidelines on primary prevention of gastric varices. (3) It is important to know what measures have been taken by the endoscopist, and any regional differences in the practice currently remain unknown.

Currently, there are discrepancies in medical conditions and professional development across different regions. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research examining the current status of GOV treatment. Therefore, we initiated this study to understand the current status of fundal varicose vein treatment in developed and developing countries, identify current problems and directions for improvement, and provide data and useful references for the development of fundal varicose vein treatment in the future.

### Endoscopic management of esophageal and gastric lesions with underlying varices [^612b1ade]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

The presence of superficial esophageal or gastric lesions with underlying varices represents a challenging situation associated with increased technical difficulties and bleeding risk. However, several cases have demonstrated the feasibility of a variety of endoscopic techniques in this setting, including EMR, ESD or RFA, with particular technical adaptations that increase safety and effectiveness (Table 4). Therefore, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices are not absolute contraindications for the endoscopic management of superficial esophageal or gastric lesions in selected patients at specialized referral centers. We hope this review may inspire further studies that can provide more insight into the endoscopic management of superficial lesions with underlying varices. Future directions for research in this field should focus on determining which endoscopic techniques and specific technical refinements may increase safety and effectiveness and define subgroups of patients that may be candidates for endoscopic resection, or when these procedures are contraindicated.

### Management of varices and variceal hemorrhage in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^085a18a0]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology/natural history

Esophageal varices are present in 50–60% of patients with compensated cirrhosis and up to 85% in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Variceal size, red wale marks on varices, and advanced liver disease (CTP-B/C) are all risk factors for variceal hemorrhage (VH). A first VH occurs at a rate of 10–15% per year, depending on the individual risk factorsand a recurrent VH at a rate of up to 60% per year. Advancements from recent years in terms of treatment and prevention of VH have decreased the mortality from around 40% back in the 1980sto a 6-week mortality of 15–20% in most recent years. However, the most common decompensating event, and the one associated with a higher mortality in cirrhosis is ascites, and therefore the goals in the therapy of the patient with compensated cirrhosis have shifted from preventing VH to preventing decompensation (ascites, VH, and encephalopathy).

### Practice patterns in screening for varices: an American survey [^0290e683]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Guidelines recommend screening for gastroesophageal varices. Regional studies suggest screening is underutilized, but information from across the United States is unavailable. We explored practice patterns and adherence to guidelines in a random sample of physicians and sought to define whether differences existed according to practice type, setting and years of practice.

Materials and Methods

Surveys were randomly sent to 600 gastroenterologists and hepatologists. Descriptive data is presented as percentage and comparisons were performed by chi-square analysis. Significance was defined at a p value < 0.05.

Results

180 completed surveys were returned. Mean age was 48.9 ± 10 years and 87% were male. 50% were community-based and 74% had been in practice > 10 years. 53% (78% hepatologists versus 45% of gastroenterologists) screened consistently (> 75% of the time), (p < 0.001). No differences in screening frequency were found according to practice setting or years in practice. 62% screened all cirrhotics whereas 38% screened based on clinical characteristics. In patients without gastroesophageal varices, 60% repeated esophagogastroduodenoscopy in 2–3 years. In those with small gastroesophageal varices, repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was recommended in 1–2 years by 73%. In patients with small and large varices, 40% and 54% of physicians respectively, recommended prophylaxis. 6% of physicians recommend prophylaxis regardless of the presence or size of varices.

Conclusions

Screening for varices is under-implemented. Many screened based on clinical findings that have not been shown to reliably predict high-risk gastroesophageal varices. Continued education and removal of financial barriers to screening are central to increasing screening rates and improving patient outcomes.

### AASLD practice guidance on risk stratification and management of portal hypertension and varices in cirrhosis [^4a28ae53]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of portal hypertension and related complications — mechanisms and sequelae are outlined as follows: Portal hypertension results from maladaptive responses to chronic liver injury and cirrhosis with structural mechanisms (fibrous tissue, regenerative nodules, microthrombi, parenchymal extinction, collapse) increasing intrahepatic vascular resistance; dynamic sinusoidal vasoconstriction contributes to 30% of the total increase in vascular tone. When the portal pressure gradient reaches values of about 10 mm Hg, portal-systemic collaterals form and compensatory splanchnic vasodilation increases portal blood flow and portal pressure. Early consequences include development of portosystemic collaterals in which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-driven angiogenesis plays an important role; gastroesophageal varices are the most clinically relevant collaterals because of increased risk of bleeding. Variceal bleeding is directly dependent on increased wall tension determined by portal pressure, variceal diameter, and thin wall thickness. Systemic vasodilation produces a hyperdynamic circulatory state with decreased effective arterial blood volume leading to activation of neurohumoral and vasoactive systems, sodium and water retention, and increased cardiac output, culminating in ascites and, at late stages, hepatorenal syndrome due to compensatory renal vasoconstriction. Hepatic encephalopathy is multifactorial, resulting from portosystemic shunting, impaired synthetic liver function, increased bacterial translocation, and muscle wasting (sarcopenia). Pulmonary vascular imbalances yield hepatopulmonary syndrome (increased vasodilation) and portopulmonary hypertension (increased vasoconstriction).

### Varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis: a new view of an old problem [^2d22da34]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The management of portal hypertension in cirrhosis has evolved over time, leading to improvements in the care and survival of patients with varices and variceal hemorrhage, particularly in patients who achieve a significant reduction in portal pressure. In addition to better treatment strategies and improved therapeutic options, the issue of risk stratification has become essential to identify different patient subpopulations that require a different treatment. We now recognize that the management of varices and variceal hemorrhage must be taken in the context of other complications of cirrhosis (ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice) and that the goals of therapy should be based on the presence of such complications. Evolving knowledge of the predominant pathophysiological mechanisms at each of the stages of cirrhosis also has evolved and will continue to lead to improvements in therapy. This review focuses on the management of varices and variceal hemorrhage with respect to refinements in the risk stratification of patients with cirrhosis.

### The management of portal hypertension: rational basis, available treatments and future options [^70aaee47]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the last step in a chain of events initiated by an increase in portal pressure, followed by the development and progressive dilation of varices until these finally rupture and bleed. This sequence of events might be prevented - and reversed - by achieving a sufficient decrease in portal pressure. A different approach is the use of local endoscopic treatments at the varices. This article reviews the rationale for the management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the current recommendations for the prevention and treatment of variceal bleeding, and outlines the unsolved issues and the perspectives for the future opened by new research developments.

### Duodenal variceal bleed: an unusual cause of upper gastrointestinal bleed and a difficult diagnosis to make [^a4cc2552]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Portal hypertension is the progressive complication of liver cirrhosis, and gives rise to the development of portosystemic collaterals commonly at the oesophagogastric junction, the abdominal wall and the rectum. Ectopic varices are a term reserved for varices, which exist outside the oesophagogastric region. Although a rare cause of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, they are reported to have a high mortality, around 40%. Up to 17% of ectopic varices occur in the duodenum, but they are not a common cause of variceal bleeding.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors in the management of gastroesophageal varices: a systematic review [^80fd1a70]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in gastroesophageal varices (GEVs).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1946 to September 2014), EMBASE (1974 to September 2014), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to September 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1991 to September 2014), Google, and Google Scholar were searched using the following terms: esophageal varices, gastroesophageal varices, variceal hemorrhage, variceal bleeding, banding ligation, endoscopic variceal ligation, sclerotherapy, proton pump inhibitor, PPI, omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, and esomeprazole.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Published and unpublished studies evaluating the clinical outcomes of PPI use for GEVs were included regardless of study design. Non-English and nonhuman studies were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Of 1156 studies, 20 were included after assessment. There was wide methodological heterogeneity and moderately high risk of bias among studies. Level I evidence suggests that PPIs reduce esophageal ulcer size post-elective esophageal ligation; the clinical importance of such findings is not known given the self-limiting nature of esophageal ulcer. Available evidence does not support a role of PPIs for long-term prophylaxis of portal hypertension-related bleeding and high-dose infusion for acute management of GEV hemorrhage. Retrospective data demonstrate a potential increase in the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis receiving PPIs.

Conclusions

The best available evidence supports the use of short-course (10 days) PPI post-endoscopic variceal ligation to reduce ulcer size if ulcer healing is a concern. Practices such as high-dose infusion and prolonged use should be discouraged until evidence of benefit becomes available.

### The role of a multidisciplinary team in the management of portal hypertension [^5c905a0f]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage is the most severe complication of portal hypertension, with a high mortality rate. The current recommendations for gastroesophageal varices include pharmacological treatment, endoscopic treatment, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement, and splenectomy with devascularization surgery. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) comprises of a group of medical experts and specialists across a range of disciplines, providing personalized and targeted patient care tailored to each individual's condition, circumstances, and expectations.

Methods

Patients referred to the MDT clinic since its establishment in September 2014 were prospectively enrolled and followed-up for at least 12 months. Patient baseline characteristics, treatment methods, outcome and survival were compared to non-MDT patients retrieved from a prospectively maintained database with propensity score matching.

Results

Propensity-score matching (PSM) was carried out to balance available covariates, resulting in 58 MDT patients vs. 111 non-MDT patients. Overall survival and variceal rebleed was compared between the two groups. The rate of variceal rebleed was significantly higher in the non-MDT group, while no difference in overall survival was observed.

Conclusions

This study is the first to investigate the role of a multidisciplinary team in the management of gastroesophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension. Patients treated based on MDT clinic recommendations had a significantly lower risk for variceal rebleed.

### Advances and challenges in cirrhosis and portal hypertension [^19ab87f8]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis: the burden of advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD)

According to the largest study available thus far, cirrhosis represents the fourth cause of death due to non-communicable diseases worldwide, with the total number of deaths from cirrhosis and liver cancer having steadily risen by approximately 50 million per year over the last two decades. This large mortality rate is due, to some extent, to a late diagnosis. A decades-long asymptomatic stage during which no overt sign of the disease is noticed is characteristic of CLD. Indeed, even after the onset of cirrhosis, the disease can remain asymptomatic, or 'compensated', for a long time. Nevertheless, during this time, portal hypertension progressively develops, usually accompanied by a decline in hepatocellular function.

Portal hypertension is the major driver in the transition from the compensated to the 'decompensated' stage of cirrhosis, defined by the presence of clinical complications, including ascites, bleeding from gastroesophageal varices, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. Further decompensating episodes are often triggered by bacterial infections, and are associated with a very high mortality risk. From a prognostic point of view, compensated and decompensated cirrhosis are dramatically different, and can be considered as two separate diseases. Furthermore, within these two major stages, several sub-stages with varying risk of further decompensation and death can be identified (Fig. 1). Knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms driving the transition within these stages is key in the current management of cirrhosis. Besides its negative impact on life expectancy, cirrhosis implies several other burdens, including a marked increase in healthcare costs due to hospitalization and treatment (estimated at approximately $2.5 billion per year in the US), loss of productivity (estimated at $10.6 billion per year in the US), and a marked reduction in quality of life. These burdens are almost exclusively caused by complications during the decompensated stage.

Questionnaire

The items included in this questionnaire were determined by consultation and discussion with members of the collaborative group, comprising gastroenterologists, hepatologists, and endoscopists. The questionnaire (supplementary file) was divided into five parts as described below, with all parts except for the last one presented as single-choice questions.

The first part queried the following characteristics of the respondent, all questions are single choices: (1) Country of practice, (2) Participant's name, (3) Participant's e-mail address, (4) Years of independent gastroenterology /endoscopic experience, (5) practice settings, and (6) How many patients with gastric varices does the participant's institution treat in a year.

The second part of the questionnaire queried about the primary prophylactic given for the bleeding of GOV as follows: (1) In a patient with non-bleeding medium or large esophageal varices, how do you prevent bleeding? (2) In patients with non-bleeding large gastric varices, what do you do?

The third part queried the participants about the timing of the preferred endoscopic treatment for the bleeding of GOV as follows: (1) When do you perform endoscopy in a hemodynamically stable patient with fresh blood hematemesis and cirrhosis? (2) What is your preferred initial endoscopic therapy for active gastric cardia variceal bleeding? (3) What is your preferred initial endoscopic therapy for gastric fundic variceal bleeding?

The fourth part queried about secondary prophylactic measures for the bleeding of GOV in cirrhosis as follows: (1) When do you start measures to prevent rebleeding and secondary prophylaxis after acute (esophageal or gastric) variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis? (2) What is your preferred secondary prophylactic measure?

The fifth part queried the participants about their preferred endoscopic treatment: What is the basis for the selection of the above management preferences?

### Portal hypertension [^137d06ed]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Portal hypertension is the main complication of cirrhosis and is responsible for its most common complications: variceal hemorrhage, ascites, and portosystemic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension is the result of increased intrahepatic resistance and increased portal venous inflow, which in turn is the result of splanchnic vasodilatation. Vasodilatation (splanchnic and systemic) and hyperdynamic circulation are hemodynamic abnormalities typical of cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Gastroesophageal varices result almost solely from portal hypertension, although the hyperdynamic circulation contributes to variceal growth and hemorrhage. Ascites results from sinusoidal hypertension and sodium retention, which is, in turn, secondary to vasodilatation and activation of neurohumoral systems. The hepatorenal syndrome represents the result of extreme vasodilatation with an extreme decrease in effective blood volume that leads to maximal activation of vasoconstrictive systems, renal vasoconstriction, and renal failure. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a potentially lethal infection of ascites that occurs in the absence of a local source of infection. Portosystemic encephalopathy is a consequence of both portal hypertension (shunting of blood through portosystemic collaterals) and hepatic insufficiency that result in the accumulation of neurotoxins in the brain. This paper reviews the recent advances in the pathophysiology and management of the complications of portal hypertension.

### Partial splenic embolization as a rescue and emergency treatment for portal hypertension and gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage [^42c39ed3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage is the most common and sometimes fatal complication of portal hypertension (PH). Portal hypertension can be classified as cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic (CPH and NCPH). Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension (NCPH) is the second leading cause of portal hypertension. The etiology of NCPH comprises the following five categories: 1. chronic infections, 2. exposure to medication, 3. thrombophilia, 4. immunological disorders, and 5. genetic disorders. Chronic abdominal infection is the most important etiological factor in eastern patients and thrombophilia in western patients. NCPH is characterized by features of portal hypertension, and moderate to massive splenomegaly, with or without hypersplenism. Of note, liver function is preserved in NCPH. The majority of patients with NCPH present with complications of PH, mainly splenomegaly and variceal bleeding.

Gastroesophageal varices are present in half of the patients with CPH. Between 25 to 35% of the patients with liver cirrhosis suffer from gastroesophageal hemorrhage. Complications of PH, such as variceal hemorrhage, are of exceptionally high relevance for patients with liver cirrhosis, as they often constitute a progression from compensated cirrhosis to acute decompensation. In more than 50% of CPH patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, concurrent infections occur within two weeks, which can lead to the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), a syndrome characterized by intra- and extrahepatic organ failure and a high short-term mortality.

Acute variceal bleeding is treated using pharmacological, endoscopic, and angiographic techniques as soon as the patient gains hemodynamic stability and airway protection. Endoscopic band ligation is the treatment of choice in case of esophageal variceal bleeding and represents the most effective procedure. In patients with acute hemorrhage of gastric varices, injection of tissue adhesive (cyanoacrylate) or endoscopic band ligation can be performed. In severe cases with refractory gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage, endoscopic placement of a self-expanding, fully silicone-covered nitinol stent system or a temporary balloon tamponade can be performed. Data show that the placement of a self-expanding covered esophageal metal stents is more efficacious and a safer option than balloon tamponade.

### Randomized controlled trial of scleroligation versus band ligation alone for eradication of gastroesophageal varices [^534a3669]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Gastric varices develop in 5% to 33% of patients with portal hypertension. Their most common form is concomitant gastroesophageal varices. Scleroligation (combined sclerotherapy and band ligation) has been used successfully in management of esophageal varices but has not been evaluated previously in the management of gastroesophageal varices. The aim of this work was evaluation of a new scleroligation technique for management of bleeding gastroesophageal varices regarding efficacy, adverse events, variceal recurrence, and survival.

Methods

This study was conducted on 120 cirrhotic patients with bleeding gastroesophageal varices, whom we divided randomly into 2 groups of 60 patients each-a band ligation group and a scleroligation group.

Results

The mean number of sessions was lower in the scleroligation group than in the band ligation group (2.22 ± 0.92 and 3.43 ± 0.67, respectively) (P < .001), as were the duration of treatment and total number of bands used. Cost and survival were comparable in the 2 groups. There was no significant difference between the 2 maneuvers regarding adverse events, recurrence rates, or rebleeding rates after obliteration. Recurrence was significantly higher in patients with larger varices, ulceration, and postprocedure pyrexia. Rebleeding was significantly higher among those who experienced postprocedure pyrexia and developed or had worsening of gastric antral vascular ectasia.

Conclusions

Scleroligation appears to achieve a faster rate of eradication with fewer treatment sessions and total number of bands deployed to achieve variceal obliteration than band ligation and is comparable in cost and in adverse event and recurrence rates.

### The natural history of gastroesophageal varices in children with portal hypertension [^8d7d1274]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

In children with portal hypertension, the natural history of gastroesophageal varices remains unclear. We herein report our experience.

Methods

From 1990 to 2021, 1,586 children with portal hypertension underwent one or more diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopies before any treatment, including 590 with ≥ 2 endoscopies. High-risk varices (HRV) were defined as grade 3 esophageal varices or grade 2 varices with red color signs and/or gastroesophageal varices type 1.

Results

Worsening of the endoscopic pattern occurred in 58% of children over a mean 4-year interval. The 5- and 10-year probabilities of HRV emergence in initially HRV-negative children were 36% and 54%, respectively, and were associated with the severity of the initial endoscopic findings. In children with biliary atresia, a younger age and higher serum bilirubin levels were linked to increased HRV risk. At study end, HRV were present in 639 of 1,586 children; 161/639 were < 12 months of age, 62% of whom had platelet count of ≥ 150,000/mm 3. The 5- and 10-year probabilities of spontaneous bleeding following HRV detection on screening endoscopy were 63% and 75%, respectively. Among children with cirrhosis and no HRV at baseline, the Baveno VI criteria and spleen stiffness ≤ 30kPa were associated with a low 3-year probability of HRV emergence.

Conclusions

Worsening of the endoscopic pattern is common in children with portal hypertension. HRV can be expected to emerge in one-third and one-half of initially HRV-negative children after 5 and 10 years, respectively. Infants with biliary atresia are at particularly high risk. These findings support the rationale for considering primary prophylaxis of bleeding.

Recent advances in the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux and its consequences indicate that reflux esophagitis is the result of the failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to prevent the regurgitation of gastroduodenal secretions with subsequent esophageal mucosal injury. This new information, as well as the development of new esophageal diagnostic tests, have led to a more precise diagnosis and more rational management of this disease process. This review is concerned mainly with the clinical and the pathophysiologic aspects on which we currently base the diagnosis and management of reflux esophagitis.

### New developments in managing variceal bleeding [^b04cbd70]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Liver cirrhosis is the end stage of chronic liver disease, independent of etiology, and is characterized by accumulation of fibrotic tissue and conversion of the normal liver parenchyma into abnormal regenerative nodules. Complications include portal hypertension (PH) with gastroesophageal varices, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, bacteremia, and hypersplenism. The most life-threatening complication of liver cirrhosis is acute variceal bleeding (AVB) which is associated with increased mortality that, despite recent progress in management, is still around 20% at 6 weeks. Combined treatment with vasoactive drugs, prophylactic antibiotics, and endoscopic techniques is the recommended standard of care for patients with acute variceal bleeding. There are many promising new modalities including the combination of coil and glue injection for management of bleeding or non-bleeding gastric varices and hemostatic powder application, that requires minimal expertise, when performed early after admission of a cirrhotic patient with AVB and overt hematemesis acting as a bridge therapy till definitive endoscopic therapy can be performed in hemodynamically stable conditions and without acute bleeding.

### Band ligation versus no intervention for primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices [^232fcf90]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The presence of oesophageal varices is associated with the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic variceal ligation is used to prevent this occurrence but the ligation procedure may be associated with complications.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of band ligation versus no intervention for primary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices.

Search Methods

We combined searches in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index with manual searches. The last search update was 9 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials comparing band ligation verus no intervention regardless of publication status, blinding, or language in the analyses of benefits and harms, and observational studies in the assessment of harms. Included participants had cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no previous history of variceal bleeding.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors extracted data independently. The primary outcome measures were all-cause mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and I 2 values as a marker of heterogeneity. In addition, we calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNTTB) for the primary outcomes. We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary domains; determined the certainty of the evidence using GRADE; and conducted sensitivity analyses including Trial Sequential Analysis.

Main Results

Six randomised clinical trials involving 637 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. One of the trials included an additional small number of participants (< 10% of the total) with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension/portal vein block. We classified one trial as at low risk of bias for the outcome, mortality and high risk of bias for the remaining outcomes; the five remaining trials were at high risk of bias for all outcomes. We downgraded the evidence to moderate certainty due to the bias risk. We gathered data on all primary outcomes from all trials. Seventy-one of 320 participants allocated to band ligation compared to 129 of 317 participants allocated to no intervention died (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.70; I² = 0%; NNTTB = 6 persons). In addition, band ligation was associated with reduced risks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.72; 6 trials, 637 participants; I² = 61%; NNTTB = 5 persons), serious adverse events (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.70; 6 trials, 637 participants; I² = 44%; NNTTB = 4 persons), and variceal bleeding (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.69; 6 trials, 637 participants; I² = 56%; NNTTB = 5 persons). The non-serious adverse events reported in association with band ligation included oesophageal ulceration, dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal and throat pain, heartburn, and fever, and in the one trial involving participants with either small or large varices, the incidence of non-serious side effects in the banding group was much higher in those with small varices, namely ulcers: small versus large varices 30.5% versus 8.7%; heartburn 39.2% versus 17.4%. No trials reported on health-related quality of life. Two trials did not receive support from pharmaceutical companies; the remaining four trials did not provide information on this issue.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found moderate-certainty evidence that, in patients with cirrhosis, band ligation of oesophageal varices reduces mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, variceal bleeding, and serious adverse events compared to no intervention. It is unlikely that further trials of band ligation versus no intervention would be considered ethical.

### AASLD practice guidance on the use of TIPS, variceal embolization, and retrograde transvenous obliteration in the management of variceal hemorrhage [^78316e1c]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Esophageal varices — classification, bleeding risk, and endoscopic therapy — are most likely to bleed at the gastroesophageal junction because they are more superficial in this location and are unable to decompress through the azygos vein; based on subjective endoscopic appearance, they can be classified into (1) small (straight varices that collapse on insufflation), (2) medium (enlarged, tortuous varices that occupy less than one third of the lumen), or (3) large (coil-shaped varices that occupy more than one third of the lumen), and in practice, medium and large varices are grouped as high-risk varices because they require prophylactic therapy to prevent variceal bleeding; owing to their superficial location, esophageal varices are amenable to endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) or sclerotherapy.

### Experience with endoscopic management of high-risk gastroesophageal varices, with and without bleeding, in children with biliary atresia [^c2c53028]. Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Biliary atresia, the most common cause of childhood cirrhosis, increases the risks for portal hypertension and gastrointestinal bleeding. We report the results from a single-center study of primary and secondary prophylaxis of bleeding in children with portal hypertension and high-risk varices.

Methods

We collected data from 66 children with major endoscopic signs of portal hypertension, including grade 3 esophageal varices or grade 2 varices with red wale markings and/or gastric varices, treated consecutively from February 2001 through May 2011. Thirty-six children (mean age, 22 mo) underwent primary prophylaxis (sclerotherapy and/or banding, depending on age and weight). Thirty children (mean age, 24 mo) who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding received endoscopic treatment to prevent a relapse of bleeding (secondary prophylaxis).

Results

In the primary prophylaxis group, a mean number of 4.2 sessions were needed to eradicate varices; no bleeding from gastroesophageal varices was observed after eradication. Varices reappeared in 37% of children, and 97% survived for 3 years. In the secondary prophylaxis group, a mean number of 4.6 sessions was needed to eradicate varices. Varices reappeared in 45%, and 10% had breakthrough bleeding; 84% survived for 3 years. There were no or only minor complications of either form of prophylaxis.

Conclusions

Endoscopic therapy as primary or secondary prophylaxis of bleeding appears to be well tolerated and greatly reduces the risk of variceal bleeding in children with biliary atresia and high-risk gastroesophageal varices. However, there is a risk that varices will recur, therefore continued endoscopic surveillance is needed.
