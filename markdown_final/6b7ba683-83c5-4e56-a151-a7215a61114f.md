## Question

How often should RSV vaccine be given

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often the RSV vaccine should be given. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the user means by "RSV vaccine", since adults get active vaccines while infants generally receive monoclonal antibodies. Then, I should verify the schedules for older adults, for maternal vaccination in pregnancy, and for infant and young child prophylaxis. Next, I will review seasonal timing and regional variation. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, population-specific answer anchored to current ACIP, AAP, CDC, and FDA guidance.

> Let me first confirm the terminology because it drives the dosing frequency: adults and pregnant persons receive active RSV vaccines, whereas infants and many high-risk children receive passive immunization with long-acting monoclonal antibodies rather than a vaccine, and these categories have very different schedules, so I need to ensure I don't mix them up while answering the "how often" question [^115wnmhF] [^11644FKv].

> For older adults, hold on, I should verify what ACIP currently recommends and whether any boosters are advised; ACIP recommends a single dose of an approved RSV vaccine with the 2024 update specifying routine offering to adults aged 75 years and older and to adults 60–74 years at increased risk, and there is no recommendation for repeat or annual dosing at this time, with efficacy in trials evaluated after one pre-season dose and postmarketing surveillance ongoing to inform any future revaccination guidance [^115wnmhF] [^1139Su1S].

> Wait, let me verify label-versus-policy nuances because they can affect interpretation: FDA labeling for at least one product (Arexvy) includes adults 18–59 years at high risk, but ACIP's current U.S. programmatic recommendations are focused on older adults; regardless, frequency remains a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose without a booster schedule at present, and I need to be explicit that this is not an annual vaccine like influenza, even though I initially almost said "annually", which would have been incorrect for RSV right now [^1127x1zq] [^1163s8Qd] [^113uYoLe].

> For maternal RSV vaccination, I need to check the precise gestational window and whether it's once per pregnancy or once in a lifetime; CDC and ACOG recommend a single dose of Pfizer's RSVpreF during 32–36 weeks' gestation, once per pregnancy, timed seasonally to protect the infant during the first months of life via transplacental antibodies, consistent with the FDA-labeled single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose during that gestational window [^111MQqHa] [^116Du5DQ] [^115Tkz9s].

> But wait, what if the local season starts unusually early or late, or if state or territorial guidance shifts the timing; I should confirm that timing can be adapted based on local epidemiology and public health guidance, which some jurisdictions may adjust to align maternal vaccination windows with expected RSV circulation while maintaining the 32–36 week interval per pregnancy [^11644FKv].

> Now for infants and young children, I need to ensure I clearly separate long-acting monoclonal antibodies from vaccines; nirsevimab is given as a single intramuscular dose per RSV season for infants entering their first season, with a second-season dose reserved for specific high-risk groups, and clesrovimab, where available, follows a similar single-dose-per-season concept with a fixed-dose strategy, so frequency here is generally once per season rather than monthly [^11644FKv] [^113yQUKN].

> Hold on, I should not forget that some high-risk infants still use palivizumab, which is different; palivizumab remains 15 mg/kg intramuscularly every month throughout the RSV season, typically about five monthly doses, and additional dosing is recommended after cardiopulmonary bypass to restore protective levels, so this is the scenario where "monthly during the season" applies, not a vaccine schedule [^111eW3Ek] [^116sJhBG] [^112fQVQZ].

> Next, I should review seasonal timing to answer the practical "when" part because that influences "how often"; in most of the continental U.S., administration windows run from about October through March, but circulation varies geographically and by year, with longer or less predictable seasons in places like Alaska and some tropical climates, so I need to emphasize following local public health guidance to optimize timing for all products [^113Gfnh9] [^112QjXHz].

> Let me synthesize and double-check for consistency: for adults, a single dose with no current booster recommendation; for maternal vaccination, a single dose per pregnancy at 32–36 weeks' gestation; for infant prophylaxis, one dose per season with nirsevimab or clesrovimab in most infants, and monthly palivizumab across the season when indicated for specific high-risk children; initially I was going to summarize adult dosing as "once in a lifetime", but I should correct myself and say "a single dose at this time", since future ACIP guidance could evolve pending durability data and postmarketing surveillance [^115wnmhF] [^113u1Hg4] [^116mzcmK] [^113Gfnh9].

> Finally, I need to ensure the user understands that recommendations may change, so I should advise periodic re-checking of ACIP, AAP, CDC, and FDA updates and aligning with local seasonal guidance, especially if unusual RSV circulation patterns emerge or if new evidence leads to revaccination or dosing changes in adults or expanded infant antibody options [^115wnmhF] [^111MQqHa] [^116mzcmK] [^113Gfnh9].

---

RSV vaccination is given as a **single dose** for each target group, timed to maximize protection during the RSV season [^1163s8Qd] [^115Tkz9s] [^113Gfnh9]. In older adults, administer one dose before the season [^115wnmhF], with **no routine revaccination** at this time [^113u1Hg4]. In pregnant individuals, give one dose at **32–36 weeks' gestation** [^116Du5DQ], ideally September–January, to protect infants through age 6 months [^111MQqHa]. In infants and young children, give a single dose of nirsevimab before the first RSV season [^11155iDL]; a second dose is reserved for high-risk children entering a second season [^113yQUKN] [^116mzcmK]. Palivizumab is reserved for select high-risk infants and is administered monthly during the RSV season [^111eW3Ek] [^116sJhBG].

## Current recommendations for RSV vaccination frequency

### Older adults (≥ 60 years)

For older adults (≥ 60 years), the **recommendation** is one dose of an approved RSV vaccine for all adults aged ≥ 75 years and for adults aged 60–74 years at increased risk for severe RSV disease (e.g. chronic medical conditions, moderate or severe immunocompromise, or nursing home residents) [^115wnmhF] [^1163s8Qd]. For **revaccination**, there is no current recommendation for routine revaccination; the need will be determined as more data become available [^113u1Hg4].

---

### Pregnant individuals

For pregnant individuals, the **recommendation** is one dose of an approved RSV vaccine at 32–36 weeks of gestation, ideally administered seasonally (e.g. September–January in most of the continental US) to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infection in infants through age 6 months [^116Du5DQ] [^111MQqHa] [^115Tkz9s]. For **revaccination**, there is no current recommendation in subsequent pregnancies; each pregnancy is considered independently, and vaccination is recommended if it occurs during the RSV season [^111MQqHa].

---

### Infants and young children

For infants and young children, a single dose of **Nirsevimab (Beyfortus)** is recommended for neonates and infants born during or entering their first RSV season [^11155iDL] [^113yQUKN]. For children up to 24 months who remain at increased risk for severe RSV disease, a second dose is recommended for their second RSV season. For **Palivizumab (Synagis)**, monthly injections (15 mg/kg) are recommended for high-risk infants and young children throughout the RSV season, typically from November to April in the northern hemisphere [^111eW3Ek] [^116sJhBG].

---

## Duration of immunity and need for booster doses

- **Older adults**: Clinical trials have demonstrated sustained immunity for at least one RSV season (approximately 6–12 months) following a single dose [^1139Su1S] [^117QL2SW]. The need for booster doses in subsequent seasons is currently under evaluation [^113u1Hg4].

- **Pregnant individuals**: Maternal vaccination provides passive immunity to infants, protecting them through the first 6 months of life. No booster doses are currently recommended for mothers or infants [^111MQqHa].

- **Infants and young children**: Nirsevimab provides protection for a single RSV season [^11155iDL]. Palivizumab requires monthly dosing throughout the RSV season due to its shorter duration of protection [^111eW3Ek].

---

## Factors influencing vaccination frequency

- **Age and health status**: Older adults and individuals with chronic medical conditions or immunocompromise may require more frequent vaccination or booster doses as more data become available [^115wnmhF] [^115NgJzQ].

- **Geographic location and seasonality**: RSV seasonality varies geographically, influencing the timing and frequency of vaccination. Local epidemiology and surveillance data guide vaccination schedules [^112QjXHz] [^116yWgJn].

- **Vaccine type and formulation**: Different vaccines have varying durations of immunity, influencing the need for booster doses or repeated administration [^111W51bd].

## Summary of RSV vaccination frequency recommendations

| **Population** | **Vaccine** | **Frequency** | **Timing** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Older adults (≥ 60 years) | RSV vaccine | Single dose | Before RSV season |
| Pregnant individuals | RSV vaccine | Single dose | 32–36 weeks gestation |
| Infants (first RSV season) | Nirsevimab | Single dose | Before RSV season |
| High-risk infants (second RSV season) | Nirsevimab | Single dose | Before RSV season |
| High-risk infants | Palivizumab | Monthly doses | Throughout RSV season |

---

## Conclusion and future considerations

RSV vaccination is currently recommended as a **single dose** for older adults [^115wnmhF], pregnant individuals [^111MQqHa], and infants [^11155iDL], with timing based on RSV seasonality [^116yWgJn]. Palivizumab remains the only intervention requiring monthly administration for high-risk infants [^111eW3Ek]. The need for booster doses or revaccination in subsequent seasons is under evaluation; future recommendations will depend on emerging data regarding vaccine efficacy, duration of immunity, and RSV epidemiology [^113u1Hg4].

Regarding preventive measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, specifically in the context of immunization for adults, the CDC 2024 guidelines recommend offering a single dose of an approved RSV vaccine to all adults aged ≥ 75 years. This recommendation also applies to adults aged 60–74 years who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease due to certain chronic medical conditions, moderate or severe immunocompromise, or residing in nursing homes.

### Synagis [^111eW3Ek]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The recommended dose of Synagis is 15 mg per kg of body weight, administered monthly by intramuscular injection. The first dose should be given prior to the commencement of the RSV season, with remaining doses administered monthly throughout the season. Children who develop an RSV infection should continue to receive monthly doses during the RSV season. In the northern hemisphere, the RSV season typically begins in November and lasts through April, although it may begin earlier or persist later in certain communities.

Synagis serum levels decrease after cardio-pulmonary bypass [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Children undergoing cardio-pulmonary bypass should receive an additional dose of Synagis as soon as possible after the procedure, even if it is sooner than one month from the previous dose. Thereafter, doses should be administered monthly as scheduled.

The efficacy of Synagis at doses less than 15 mg per kg, or with dosing less frequently than monthly throughout the RSV season, has not been established.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^113u1Hg4]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

RSV vaccination is currently approved and recommended for administration as a single dose; sufficient evidence does not exist at this time to determine the need for revaccination. Optimally, vaccination should occur before the onset of the RSV season; however, typical RSV seasonality was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and has not returned to prepandemic patterns. For the 2023–24 season, clinicians should offer RSV vaccination to adults aged ≥ 60 years using shared clinical decision-making as early as vaccine supply becomes available and should continue to offer vaccination to eligible adults who remain unvaccinated.

- **Vaccine administration, including coadministration with other vaccines**: Coadministration of RSV vaccines with other adult vaccines during the same visit is acceptable. Available data on immunogenicity of coadministration of RSV vaccines and other vaccines are currently limited. Coadministration of RSV and seasonal influenza vaccines met noninferiority criteria for immunogenicity with the exception of the FluA/Darwin H3N2 strain when the GSK RSV vaccine was coadministered with adjuvanted quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine. RSV and influenza antibody titers were somewhat lower with coadministration; however, the clinical significance of this is unknown.

Administering RSV vaccine with one or more other vaccines at the same visit might increase local or systemic reactogenicity. Data are only available for coadministration of RSV and influenza vaccines, and evidence is mixed regarding increased reactogenicity. Data are lacking for other combinations.

### Maternal respiratory syncytial virus vaccination [^116Du5DQ]. ACOG (2023). High credibility.

The 2023 ACOG guidelines recommend offering a single dose of an approved RSV vaccine to pregnant individuals at 32–36 weeks of gestation. This seasonal administration, typically from September to January in most of the continental US, aims to prevent RSV-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants through the first 6 months of life.

### Beyfortus [^11155iDL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage**:

- **First RSV season for neonates and infants**: For neonates and infants born during the RSV season, administer Beyfortus starting from birth. For those born outside the RSV season, administer Beyfortus once prior to the start of the RSV season considering the duration of protection provided by Beyfortus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. The recommended dosage for neonates and infants born during or entering their first RSV season is based on body weight and is administered as a single intramuscular (IM) injection. Refer to Table 1 for weight-based dosing.

- **Second RSV season for children who remain at increased risk for severe RSV disease**: For children up to 24 months of age, regardless of body weight, who remain at increased risk for severe RSV disease in their second RSV season, refer to Table 2 for the recommended dosage.

- **First and second RSV season for children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass**: For children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass, an additional dose of Beyfortus is recommended as soon as the child is stable after surgery to ensure adequate nirsevimab-alip serum levels. The recommended dosage of Beyfortus is administered as an IM injection.

	- **First RSV season**:
		- If surgery is within 90 days after receiving Beyfortus, the additional dose should be based on body weight at the time of the additional dose. Refer to Table 1 for weight-based dosing.
		- If more than 90 days have elapsed since receiving Beyfortus, the additional dose should be 50 mg regardless of body weight.

### Use of nirsevimab for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease among infants and young children: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^113yQUKN]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Infants and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease and who are entering their second RSV season are recommended to receive nirsevimab. Replacing palivizumab with nirsevimab is expected to be cost-saving, and ACIP recommends nirsevimab for eligible children entering their second RSV season, similar to groups of children recommended by AAP for palivizumab during their second RSV season. Research suggests that some American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) children experience high rates of severe RSV disease. A recent study found that the incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization among some AI/AN children aged 12–23 months was four to ten times that of similar-aged children across seven sites in the United States. These studies have been limited to specific populations and might not be broadly representative of the risk in all AI/AN children. Some AI/AN communities live in remote regions, making transportation of children with severe RSV more challenging. Given the available evidence, ACIP also recommends nirsevimab for AI/AN children entering their second RSV season.

- **Precautions and contraindications**: When administering nirsevimab to children with increased risk for bleeding, providers should follow ACIP's general best practice guidelines for immunization. Nirsevimab is contraindicated in persons with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) following a previous dose.

### Immunological lessons from respiratory syncytial virus vaccine development [^116ubscz]. Immunity (2019). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has eluded active vaccination efforts for more than five decades and continues to cause substantial morbidity and mortality in infants, the immunocompromised, and older adults. Although newer approaches of passive antibody-mediated protection show promise, vaccines aimed at eliciting fusion protein (F)-targeting antibodies have repeatedly failed to meet pre-established, modest-efficacy goals.

Newer candidates, including protein-based vaccines, live-attenuated viruses, and gene-based delivery platforms, incorporate structurally defined and stabilized versions of the prefusion form of the F glycoprotein. These candidates are advancing rapidly into critical efficacy studies in susceptible target populations. This review discusses the storied history of RSV vaccine development, immunological lessons learned along the way, and critical findings about protein structure that remodeled our understanding of protective immunity to this important pathogen.

### Cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical strategies to prevent respiratory syncytial virus disease in young children: A decision-support model for use in low-income and middle-income countries [^1143Y7Yq]. BMC Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The model calculates the impact of RSV prevention strategies by assessing various parameters.

For a given week of age in the birth cohort targeted by the RSV intervention, the number of disease events, such as cases, clinic visits, hospital admissions, and deaths, was calculated as follows. PY is defined as the number of person-years lived between birth and age 5.0 years in the birth cohort of interest, derived from UN Population Division interpolated single age/year population estimates. D represents the disease event rate (per 100,000 per year) among children under 5 years of age before the introduction of a maternal vaccine or infant monoclonal antibody (mAb). Aw is the proportion of disease events under 5 years of age in a specific week of age, C1w is the intervention coverage estimated in the same week (considering realistic delays in dose administration and timeliness), and E1w is the efficacy estimated in that week, adjusted for any waning from the time of dose administration.

The model assumes that efficacy, and waning if applicable, starts at birth for all children born to vaccinated women. For simplicity, vaccine coverage of pregnant mothers in a given calendar year is applied to newborns in the same year. For infant mAbs, the user can either assume that the efficacy and waning start at a specified age for all infants included in the program (e.g. birth, 1 month) or assume it aligns with the timeliness and coverage of other birth dose vaccines by week of age, such as BCG, hepatitis B, or polio birth dose. Efficacy can be fixed for a period of time (e.g. 6 months) or assumed to decline gradually over time by exploring different mean and shape parameters.

### Respiratory syncytial virus seasonality and prevention strategy planning for passive immunisation of infants in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study [^116yWgJn]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) represents a substantial burden of disease in young infants in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Because RSV passive immunisations, including maternal vaccination and monoclonal antibodies, can only provide a temporary period of protection, their effectiveness and efficiency will be determined by the timing of the immunisation relative to the underlying RSV seasonality. We aimed to assess the potential effect of different approaches for passive RSV immunisation of infants in LMICs.

- **Methods**: We included 52 LMICs in this study based on the availability of RSV seasonality data and developed a mathematical model to compare the effects of different RSV passive immunisation approaches (seasonal approaches vs. a year-round approach). For each candidate approach, we calculated the expected annual proportion of RSV incidence among infants younger than 6 months averted (effectiveness) and the ratio of per-dose cases averted between that approach and the year-round approach (relative efficiency).

- **Findings**: 39 (75%) of the 52 LMICs included in the study had clear RSV seasonality, defined as having more than 75% of annual RSV cases occurring in 5 or fewer months. In these countries with clear RSV seasonality, the seasonal approach in which monoclonal antibody administration began 3 months before RSV season onset was only a median of 16% (IQR 13–18) less effective in averting RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) hospital admissions than a year-round approach but was a median of 70% (50–97) more efficient.

### SPL drug information for palivizumab [^116sJhBG]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of palivizumab for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children is 15 mg/kg administered intramuscularly (IM) every month. This is recommended for patients who are younger than or equal to six months at the beginning of the RSV season with a history of preterm birth or lower respiratory tract disease. The first dose should be administered before, and continued through, the RSV season.

### Reduced-dose schedule of prophylaxis based on local data provides near-optimal protection against respiratory syncytial virus [^116f65Br]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory infections among young children and can lead to severe disease among some infants. Infants at high risk for severe RSV infection receive monthly injections of a prophylactic monoclonal antibody during the RSV season based on national guidelines. We considered whether a reduced-dose schedule tailored to the local RSV season in the continental United States would provide adequate protection.

- **Methods**: Hospitalization data for 1,942 counties across 38 states from 1997 to 2009 were obtained from the State Inpatient Databases (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality). We assessed the timing of RSV epidemics at the county and state levels using a two-stage hierarchical Bayesian change point model. We used a simple summation approach to estimate the fraction of RSV cases that occur during the window of protection provided by initiating RSV prophylaxis during different weeks of the year.

- **Results**: The timing of RSV epidemic onset varied significantly at the local level. Nevertheless, the national recommendations for initiation of prophylaxis provided near-optimal coverage of the RSV season in most of the continental United States. Reducing from five to four monthly doses (with a later initiation) provides near-optimal coverage (< 5% decrease in coverage) in most settings. Earlier optimal dates for initiating four doses of prophylaxis were associated with being farther south and east, higher population density, and having a higher percentage of the population that was Black or Hispanic.

- **Conclusions**: A four-dose schedule tailored to local RSV seasonality may provide effective protection, with minimal reduction in coverage, compared to the standard five-dose regimen.

### Identifying gaps in respiratory syncytial virus disease epidemiology in the United States prior to the introduction of vaccines [^1154obGg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) frequently causes lower respiratory tract illness. No effective antivirals or vaccines for RSV are approved for use in the United States; however, there are at least 50 vaccines and monoclonal antibody products in development, with those targeting older adults and pregnant women (to protect young infants) in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. Unanswered questions regarding RSV epidemiology need to be identified and addressed prior to RSV vaccine introduction to guide the measurement of impact and future recommendations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened a technical consultation to gather input from external subject matter experts on their individual perspectives regarding evidence gaps in RSV epidemiology in the United States, potential studies and surveillance platforms needed to fill these gaps, and prioritizing efforts. Participants articulated their individual views, and CDC staff synthesized individuals' input into this report.

### Evaluating the next generation of RSV intervention strategies: A mathematical modelling study and cost-effectiveness analysis [^116KSSDz]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

With a suite of promising new RSV prophylactics on the horizon, including long-acting monoclonal antibodies and new vaccines, it is likely that one or more of these will replace the Monoclonal Palivizumab programme. However, choosing the optimal intervention programme will require balancing the costs of the programmes with the health benefits accrued.

- **Methods**: To compare the next generation of RSV prophylactics, we integrated a novel transmission model with an economic analysis. We estimated key epidemiological parameters by calibrating the model to seven years of historical epidemiological data using a Bayesian approach. We determined the cost-effective and affordable maximum purchase price for a comprehensive suite of intervention programmes.

- **Findings**: Our transmission model suggests that maternal protection of infants is seasonal, with 38–62% of infants born with protection against RSV. Our economic analysis found that to cost-effectively and affordably replace the Monoclonal antibody Palivizumab programme with long-acting monoclonal antibodies, the purchase price per dose would have to be less than around £4350 but dropping to £200 for vaccinated heightened risk infants or £90 for all infants. A seasonal maternal vaccine would have to be priced less than £85 to be cost-effective and affordable. While vaccinating pre-school and school-age children is likely not cost-effective relative to elderly vaccination programmes, vaccinating the elderly is not likely to be affordable. Conversely, vaccinating infants at 2 months seasonally would be cost-effective.

### Safety and immunogenicity of palivizumab (Synagis) administered for two seasons [^112PFRsv]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of palivizumab, 55 children who participated in the IMpact-RSV trial received 5 monthly doses of 15 mg/kg palivizumab (Synagis) during the subsequent year. The single child with an antipalivizumab titer of > 1/40 experienced no associated serious adverse events and had expected serum palivizumab trough concentrations. Second-year palivizumab prophylaxis was safe and well-tolerated.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus surveillance data to optimize the timing of immunoprophylaxis [^115QvR35]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

For children in the United States who are at high risk for severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends administering immunoprophylaxis during the RSV season. We present an approach to using surveillance data to help guide application of AAP recommendations for immunoprophylaxis to local patterns of RSV outbreaks.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from laboratories that report consistently to the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System from 1992 to 2007. Local RSV seasons were defined, and an immunoprophylaxis schedule was determined by using the median onset dates from each laboratory during 2002–2007. We applied these dates to 10 preceding years of RSV detection data. We compared how well the 5-year median-based method and a fixed date method were able to match the timing of immunoprophylaxis to the RSV season.

- **Results**: Nineteen laboratories met our inclusion criteria and generally experienced only one RSV outbreak per season. Five years of data gave similar median onset/offset dates and season duration, as did 10 years and 15 years of data. The 5-year median schedule increased the number of seasons that children were protected at the season onset by 15% compared with a fixed start date of November 1 and identified communities that experienced RSV seasons with extended durations.

- **Conclusions**: The 5-year median method can be used to characterize the timing of RSV seasons and optimally apply the AAP recommendations for timing of palivizumab prophylaxis to the local community.

### Revised indications for the use of palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infections [^112yokNk]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Palivizumab and respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin intravenous (RSV-IGIV) are licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for use in preventing severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in high-risk infants, children younger than 24 months with chronic lung disease (formerly called bronchopulmonary dysplasia), and certain preterm infants. This report summarizes the clinical trial information on which the guidance in the accompanying policy statement for administering RSV prophylaxis to certain children with a history of preterm birth, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease is based. Based on the results of a recently completed clinical trial, palivizumab is appropriate for infants and young children with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. RSV-IGIV should not be used in children with hemodynamically significant heart disease.

Palivizumab is preferred for most high-risk infants and children because of ease of intramuscular administration. Monthly administration of palivizumab during the RSV season results in a 45% to 55% decrease in the rate of hospitalization attributable to RSV. Due to the large number of infants born after 32 to 35 weeks' gestation and the high cost, immunoprophylaxis should be considered for this category of preterm infants only if two or more risk factors are present.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^113mC1rg]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of severe respiratory illness in older adults. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccines for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged 60 years and older. Since May 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines Adult Work Group has met at least monthly to review available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these vaccines among adults aged 60 years and older. On June 21, 2023, ACIP voted to recommend that adults aged 60 years and older may receive a single dose of an RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making.

This report summarizes the body of evidence considered for this recommendation and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged 60 years and older. RSV vaccines have demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and have the potential to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults. Postmarketing surveillance will direct future guidance.

### Respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab: 12-year observational study of usage and outcomes in Canada [^116dLJy3]. American Journal of Perinatology (2022). Low credibility.

Definitions and outcomes

Adherence to treatment was defined as follows: (1) expected number of doses versus actual number of doses for the respective RSV season, and (2) interdose interval. For the first definition, the number was calculated assuming monthly injections from the first dose to the end of the RSV season. For the second definition, 30 ± 5 day intervals were considered as adherent. Some centers used an interval of 20 ± 4 days between the first and second injections to possibly yield higher trough levels after the first dose and avoid breakthrough RSV infection. Therefore, an interval of 16 to 35 days between the first and second injection was considered adherent. Hospitalizations were defined by two primary endpoints: RIH and RSVH. We compared hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients to identify potential risk factors for hospitalization.

The RIH rate was determined by the number of children hospitalized for respiratory-related illnesses divided by the total number of children in the study population. The RSVH rate was calculated by multiplying the RIH by the number of RSV-positive children divided by the number of children tested for RSV infection.

Statistical analysis

All data were examined using SPSS v. 17.0. The statistical tests employed were the Student's t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables, and Pearson Chi-square test for nominal variables.

### New interventions to prevent respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants-time for equitable global access [^112T5mj8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

An effective preventive strategy against RSV disease in infants has taken decades to develop. At least two products will be available soon, and several others are in late-stage development. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that rapid global upscaling and implementation of vaccination is possible, including in LMICs. Access and affordability in LMICs are essential, where the impact will be greatest given the severity, number of cases, and mortality. If this does not occur, health inequities will be exacerbated. Now is the time for a concerted global effort to urgently fund and deliver effective RSV prevention strategies to all infants, especially those in LMICs.

### The logistics and coordination of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis use among US pediatric specialists [^115UVJL2]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

An alternative setting in which to receive RSV immunoprophylaxis that has been shown to improve compliance is in the home, with the added benefit of convenience to the family. In a study of 1,446 infants, 224 received the recommended RSV immunoprophylaxis at the pediatrician's office, and 969 received it at home by a nurse every month. More infants who received doses at home (98.0%) had subsequent doses given on schedule compared with those who were given doses in the pediatrician's office (89.2%; P < 0.001). Furthermore, there was a significantly higher percentage of infants in the office setting group with an RSV-related hospitalization compared with those who received doses in the home setting (3.57% vs. 0.93%; P < 0.001). Although findings from this study suggest better adherence with home RSV immunoprophylaxis injections and a lower rate of RSV-related hospitalization as a result, it is important to understand that home-based therapeutic plans may not be practical to implement everywhere and that the need for insurance approval may delay timely receipt of immunoprophylaxis.

In terms of access to RSV immunoprophylaxis, survey respondents of all specialties reported insurance denials as the primary obstacle to getting RSV immunoprophylaxis to high-risk children. Health insurance companies consider several factors when determining coverage for RSV immunoprophylaxis. Because RSV immunoprophylaxis is only indicated for certain at-risk infants and must be administered during a particular time of the year (i.e. the RSV season), most insurance companies r

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^116NEWg1]. American Journal of Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of severe respiratory illness in older adults. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccines for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Since May 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines Adult Work Group met at least monthly to review available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years. On June 21, 2023, ACIP voted to recommend that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of an RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. This report summarizes the body of evidence considered for this recommendation and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years. RSV vaccines have demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and have the potential to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults; postmarketing surveillance will direct future guidance.

### Effectiveness and safety of palivizumab for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract infection caused by respiratory syncytial virus: A systematic review [^113X2JXe]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). High credibility.

- **Treatment-related adverse events**: The frequency of adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of palivizumab was low in both clinical trial (0–12% of patients) and real-world settings (0–7% of patients). In clinical trials, no serious AEs (SAEs) attributable to palivizumab were reported, and the rates of AEs were not statistically different between patients who received palivizumab or placebo for all indications: 11% versus 10% in patients with a history of premature birth (< 35 weeks gestational age) and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and 7.2% versus 6.9% in patients with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease (hs-CHD). Overall, the most common AEs were fever, injection site reaction, diarrhea, and rash.

	- In the real-world setting, rates of AEs associated with palivizumab were 2.1%, 4.0%, 6.4%, and 7%, and the rates of SAEs were 0.3% and 1.4%. The most common events were local erythema, systemic fever, local pain, irritability, vomiting, and diarrhea. Based on one study, serious events, defined as any AE resulting in death, life-threatening situation, inpatient hospitalizations, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other medically important events possibly related to palivizumab, were reported in two patients. These included infection and bronchiolitis in one patient and pneumonia and conjunctivitis in the other.

	- In a retrospective cohort study of 2,018 children aged ≤ 2 years with hs-CHD, there was no increased risk of serious infection or serious arrhythmia associated with the use of palivizumab compared with unmatched controls, with odds ratios of 0.95 and 1.64, respectively, for each SAE.

### Vaccination of older adults against respiratory syncytial virus: The final pieces of the puzzle [^115NgJzQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

While van Effelterre et al. strengthen the consensus that vaccination of older adults against RSV has the potential to significantly reduce the seasonal burden of RSV, it simply highlights but does not fill the pressing knowledge gaps that need resolution. With a large and growing older adult population, these vaccines will rightly come under intense scrutiny regarding their affordability and cost-effectiveness. With little to distinguish each vaccine product's efficacy against acute respiratory infection, the decision to implement a vaccine program — and which vaccine to choose — will likely rest on the vaccine's duration of disease protection, its protection against very severe outcomes and death, and ultimately, its price.

### Respiratory syncytial virus burden in premature infants: The role of season with and without RSV immunoprophylaxis in a multicenter study [^114oeEtE]. Pediatric pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

Several real-world studies, employing different methodologies, have generated conflicting results concerning the impact of the changes in the 2014 AAP RSV immunoprophylaxis guidance on the burden of RSVH among preterm infants. A retrospective US study reported no difference in RSVH rates following the introduction of the restrictive AAP 2014 policy (pre: 5.37/1000 vs. post: 5.78/1000; p = 0.622). In Italy, a similar restrictive policy was implemented in 2016, resulting in a decrease in the rate of RSVH from 6.3/1000 to 5.5/1000. However, in these studies, the adoption of the restricted guidelines was reported to be partial, with limited reduction in Palivizumab utilization. Additionally, some of these studies lacked laboratory confirmation of RSV, while others lacked the power to detect differences among preterm subgroups.

The design of our study, and the high level of compliance with Palivizumab recommendations in Israel, allowed a clear distinction between "in-season" RSV periods, with high level of compliance to Palivizumab use, and "off-season RSV periods" in which Palivizumab was not used.

Indeed, in accordance with our findings, other studies reported at least a twofold increase in RSVH rates following the implementation of a more restrictive policy. Rajah et al. found a significant increase in the proportion of RSVH among 29–34 wGA infants aged < 6 months in 2014–2015 (7.1%) compared to 2013–2014 (3.5%; p = 0.01). Similarly, Kong et al.'s retrospective analysis showed a significant 45%−95% decrease in Palivizumab administration to 29–34 wGA infants.

### A truncated pre-f protein mRNA vaccine elicits an enhanced immune response and protection against respiratory syncytial virus [^114usTuu]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved vaccines designed by GSK, Pfizer, and Moderna to protect high-risk populations against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These vaccines employ the pre-fusion F (pre-F) protein as the immunogen. This study explored an mRNA vaccine based on a modified pre-F protein called LC2DM-lipid nanoparticle (LC2DM-LNP). This vaccine features a truncated version of the pre-F protein that is anchored to the cell membrane.

Experiments in young and old female mice revealed that the LC2DM-LNP vaccine elicited robust neutralizing antibody titers. Moreover, LC2DM-LNP prompted a Th1-skewed T-cell immune response in female rodent models. Female cotton rats immunized with LC2DM-LNP demonstrated strong immunity to RSV, without signs of vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (VERD) even in cases of breakthrough infection. Importantly, when administered to pregnant female cotton rats, LC2DM-LNP ensured the transfer of pre-F-specific antibodies to the offspring and provided protection against RSV without increasing lung inflammation.

These findings suggest that LC2DM-LNP could serve as an alternative RSV vaccine candidate for high-risk groups.

### A randomized phase 1/2 study of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine [^111aQ4L8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of severe acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants and an important cause of disease in older adults. In the United States, most infants are infected during their first winter, with RSV-associated hospitalization rates of approximately 1%–2%, highest in the first months of life.

Over 50 years of vaccine development efforts have not produced a licensed RSV vaccine. The only available preventive is palivizumab (Synagis; MedImmune LLC), a neutralizing monoclonal antibody targeting RSV fusion glycoprotein (F). Palivizumab reduces RSV-related high-risk infant hospitalizations, supporting the ability of neutralizing antibodies to protect against severe disease; however, its practicality is limited by high cost and up to 5 monthly injections each season. Thus, an effective RSV vaccine remains a significant unmet medical need.

Pediatric RSV vaccine development has been impeded since the 1960s when RSV-naive infants immunized with a formalin-inactivated vaccine candidate experienced enhanced disease upon subsequent natural RSV infection. This phenomenon was linked to the vaccine eliciting predominantly non-neutralizing antibodies and a T helper 2 (T H 2)-biased helper T-cell response. In contrast, RSV infection elicits neutralizing antibodies and T H 1 phenotype T-cell responses that are unassociated with disease enhancement upon RSV reexposure. Disease enhancement was not observed in individuals previously infected with RSV, regardless of subsequent immunization.

### The logistics and coordination of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis use among US pediatric specialists [^114qgj21]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to survey US pediatric specialists about the administration of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis, communication patterns among physicians and parents, and barriers to access. Separate surveys were sent to neonatologists, pediatricians, pediatric pulmonologists, and pediatric cardiologists. Most physicians (≥ 93.5%) routinely recommended immunoprophylaxis to high-risk children. Most respondents (≥ 71.8%) reported that over 50% of eligible infants and young children received each monthly dose throughout the RSV season, with the first dose most commonly administered before discharge from the birth hospitalization.

To ensure receipt of subsequent doses, specialists frequently scheduled a follow-up visit at the end of the appointment. All specialists reported insurance denials as the biggest obstacle to the administration of immunoprophylaxis to high-risk children. These findings may be used to improve adherence to immunoprophylaxis by enhancing education and physician-parent communications about severe RSV disease prevention, and by reducing known barriers to the use of this preventive therapy.

### Safety and immunogenicity of 3 formulations of an investigational respiratory syncytial virus vaccine in nonpregnant women: Results from 2 phase 2 trials [^117JbT9T]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a highly contagious human pathogen that causes respiratory tract infections in all age groups. Protection after infection is short-lived, and reinfection is common throughout life. Between 50% and 70% of infants are infected with RSV during their first year of life, and almost all children have experienced RSV infection by their second birthday. RSV disease generally starts as an upper respiratory tract illness and then progresses to lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), with cough, tachypnea, and wheezing.

Bronchiolitis is the signature disease of RSV infection, and some LRTIs progress to pneumonia. Patients may require supplemental oxygen and/or initiation of ventilator support. In high-income countries, RSV infection is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants, with annual rates of 3,600–4,890 cases per 100,000 infants aged < 3 months and slightly lower rates in infants aged 3–6 months. The burden of RSV disease in ambulatory settings has received less attention, but a study using data from the United Kingdom estimated that rates of medically attended RSV disease among infants < 6 months of age were 8.4-fold higher than those for influenza, with a reported 14,441 annual RSV-associated episodes per 100,000 infants who visited a general practitioner.

### Use of clesrovimab for prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2025 [^113Gfnh9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

Eligible infants born during the seasonal administration window for RSV monoclonal antibody products (October 1–March 31 in most of the continental United States) should receive RSV antibody within one week after birth, ideally during the birth hospitalization. Any eligible infant or young child born outside the seasonal administration window (April–September) who has not yet received a recommended dose should receive RSV antibody at the earliest opportunity beginning in October to optimize protection during the peak RSV season. For infants eligible for RSV antibody with prolonged hospitalizations shortly before or during the RSV season, providers may consider administering RSV antibody during the birth hospitalization to prevent healthcare–associated RSV disease. This decision should be based on clinical judgment, considering the potential risks and benefits.

RSV monoclonal antibody should be administered from October through the end of March in most of the continental United States. However, ACIP recommendations on the timing of RSV antibody administration are intentionally flexible to optimize patient access, including reimbursement. For example, in Alaska, RSV circulation patterns are less predictable, and the duration of the RSV season is often longer than the national average. Tropical climates might also have RSV circulation patterns that differ from most of the continental United States or that are unpredictable. In addition, because the timing of RSV activity varies geographically in other regions of the United States, public health authorities may elect to provide guidance based on local RSV activity patterns.

### Initial palivizumab dose administration in outpatient clinic after hospital discharge [^1144K5Ke]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Palivizumab provides passive immunity for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but poor adherence compromises protection. A hospital initiative promoted the administration of first palivizumab doses at an outpatient clinic immediately after discharge. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of the initiative on the location and timing of the first palivizumab dose, patient adherence, reimbursement, acquisition cost, and RSV-positive hospital readmissions.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study included pediatric patients who received palivizumab from 2012 to 2016. Three groups were compared: "before initiative", "transition", and "after initiative". Patients who did not qualify for palivizumab or who were eligible for palivizumab in previous RSV seasons were excluded. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions adjusted for patients' characteristics were used in outcome analysis.

- **Results**: After adjusting for patients' characteristics, there was a 13.5-fold increase (95% confidence interval: 5.9–30.5, P < 0.0001) in odds that patients would receive outpatient administration of palivizumab and a 2.7-fold increase (95% confidence interval: 1.3–5.7, P = 0.0103) in odds of receiving the second dose within 35 days after initiative implementation compared with before. Although there was no significant difference in reimbursement percentage after initiative implementation (32% ± 30% after initiative and 31% ± 22% before), calculated palivizumab acquisition costs were 20.8% lower. RSV readmissions were not significantly different.

- **Conclusions**: Implementation of an initiative to administer the first dose of palivizumab at an outpatient clinic after hospital discharge improved the location and timing of administration and reduced acquisition costs, although it did not significantly affect RSV readmissions.

MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

- **Vaccine efficacy and safety**: In the Pfizer phase 2b and 3 trials, maternal RSVpreF vaccination was administered during 24–36 weeks' gestation. For the GRADE assessment, data were included from phase 2b and 3 trials using the trial dosing interval of 24–36 weeks' gestation. Using all available data from the trial dosing interval provided increased power to detect potential benefits and harms. Additional analyses of efficacy and safety outcomes from participants who received the vaccine or placebo during the approved dosing interval of 32–36 weeks' gestation were reviewed and included as a supplement to the evidence in GRADE. The details of the GRADE evidence profile and supporting evidence for the EtR Framework are available.

- **Vaccine efficacy**: For the GRADE assessment of benefits, data on vaccine efficacy among infants from birth through 180 days of life were evaluated. Efficacy against medically attended RSV-associated LRTI was 51.3% among the full trial population (trial dosing interval of 24–36 weeks' gestation) and 57.3% when maternal RSVpreF vaccination was given during the approved dosing interval (32–36 weeks' gestation). Efficacy against hospitalization for RSV-associated LRTI was 56.8% during the full trial dosing interval and 48.2% during the approved dosing interval.

### Adherence to immunoprophylaxis regimens for respiratory syncytial virus infection in insured and Medicaid populations [^113Wuw3m]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

Immunoprophylaxis is the only pharmaceutical intervention for mitigating respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Patient-level data on adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) immunoprophylaxis recommendations are limited. This study characterizes adherence to AAP guidelines in privately insured and Medicaid populations.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective birth cohort study of 211,174 privately insured children in Northern California and 458,837 publicly insured children in Tennessee born between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2008. Adherence to the AAP guideline was defined for eligible infants as the number of doses of RSV immunoprophylaxis administered over the number recommended for four mutually exclusive eligibility groups: chronic lung disease, prematurity < 29 weeks, prematurity < 32 weeks, and other eligibility.

- **Results**: We identified 3,456 California (Kaiser Permanente Northern California [KPNC]) and 12,251 Tennessee (Tennessee Medicaid [TennCare]) infants meeting AAP eligibility criteria. Immunoprophylaxis administration increased over the study period, from 15% for all eligible groups in 1998 to 54% in 2007. Adherence was highest among babies with chronic lung disease (KPNC 67% and TennCare 55%). Nonadherence (0% adherence) was greatest among infants of African American mothers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98–1.78); those with mothers with less than a high school education (AOR = 1.58; CI = 1.09–2.30) in KPNC; and in infants of Hispanic mothers in TennCare (AOR = 1.65; CI = 1.24–2.20).

### Safety and immunogenicity of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F (RSVPreF3) candidate vaccine in older adults: Phase 1/2 randomized clinical trial [^111W51bd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The geometric mean frequency (GMF) and fold increase, calculated as the ratio of T-cell concentration relative to day 1 values for the corresponding vaccine formulation, in the prefusion conformation of the respiratory syncytial virus F protein (RSVPreF3)-specific CD4+ T cells expressing at least two markers, are evaluated. The geometric mean frequency of RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T cells expressing at least interferon gamma (IFN-γ) is also considered in older adults aged 60–80 years, forming the per-protocol set. At least two in vitro markers — interleukin (IL) 2, CD40 ligand, tumor necrosis factor-α, IFN-γ — and at least IFN-γ among IFN-γ, IL-13, and IL-17, are featured in the analysis.

The timepoints in months (0, 1, 2, and 3) correspond to days 1 (vaccination 1), 31, 61 (vaccination 2), and 91, respectively. Month 14 data derive from the long-term evaluation subset. The syringe symbols above the x-axis indicate vaccination timepoints, while dotted lines represent the assay cutoff of 590. GMF values are plotted as the median, with error bars denoting the range (minimum to maximum). RSVPreF3 antigen concentrations of 30 µg, 60 µg, and 120 µg are examined. Abbreviations include AS01 B and AS01 E for adjuvanted vaccine formulations with the corresponding vaccine adjuvant systems, GMF for geometric mean frequency, IFN-γ for interferon gamma, "plain" for unadjuvanted vaccine formulations, and RSVPreF3 for the prefusion conformation of the respiratory syncytial virus F protein.

### Improved outcomes with home-based administration of palivizumab: Results from the 2000–2004 Palivizumab Outcomes Registry [^117XPjkU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Palivizumab Outcomes Registry data collected over four years were examined to assess compliance and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization rates in high-risk children receiving palivizumab prophylaxis at home compared with an outpatient setting.

- **Methods**: Prospective observational registry enrolling high-risk infants who received one or more doses of palivizumab throughout the 2000–2001 to 2003–2004 RSV seasons at participating U.S. pediatric sites.

- **Results**: Registry data were analyzed for compliance and RSV hospitalization outcomes in 19,548 infants receiving doses at home versus an outpatient setting. Compliance with the injection regimen was determined by comparing the number of palivizumab injections received versus the projected number of anticipated doses and by comparing infants receiving all injections within a 35-day interval. Compliance was significantly greater for infants who received palivizumab at home (n = 1226) as compared with those who received palivizumab in a clinic or office (n = 17,641), whether measured by the number of doses received (88% versus 81%, P < 0.0001) or by the timing of doses (73% versus 66%, P < 0.0001). Infants who received palivizumab at home also had fewer RSV-associated hospitalizations compared with those who received palivizumab in a clinic or office [0.4% (5/1226) versus 1.2% (207/17,641), P = 0.0139].

- **Conclusions**: Home administration of palivizumab was associated with a significantly higher rate of compliance and a lower hospitalization rate for RSV illness in high-risk infants.

### Recommendations for the prevention of RSV disease in infants and children: Policy statement [^116mzcmK]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for respiratory syncytial virus infection, specifically concerning immunization for infants and children, the AAP 2025 guidelines recommend offering RSV immunization for:

- **Infants < 8 months of age**: Born during or entering their first RSV season if the pregnant parent did not receive the RSV vaccine during pregnancy, if the vaccination status of the pregnant parent is unknown, or if the infant was born < 14 days after the pregnant parent's vaccination.

- **Infants and children 8 through 19 months of age**: At high risk of severe RSV disease and entering their second RSV season, regardless of the vaccination status of the pregnant parent or the child's prior receipt of nirsevimab or clesrovimab when < 8 months of age in their first RSV season.

### Use of clesrovimab for prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus-associated lower respiratory tract infections in infants: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2025 [^11644FKv]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

In areas where the timing of the RSV season is less predictable, providers should follow state or territorial guidance on the timing of maternal RSV vaccination. Additionally, state and territorial health departments can consider modifying the timing of administration based on historical seasonality data. They should weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages of any modifications. Providers, including regional medical centers and health systems, are advised to consult with state or territorial health departments before systematically modifying the recommended months for maternal vaccination for their eligible patient populations.

- **Advantages and disadvantages of respiratory syncytial virus maternal vaccination and long-acting monoclonal antibodies**: (clesrovimab or nirsevimab) are considered for protection against RSV-associated severe disease among infants aged < 8 months, born during or entering their first RSV season in the United States, 2025.

- **Routine administration of RSV monoclonal antibodies**: For infants aged < 8 months born during or entering their first RSV season, the recommendations for nirsevimab and clesrovimab are the same, with the exception that the dose of clesrovimab (105 mg) is the same for all infants, whereas the nirsevimab dose differs depending on the infant's weight. In the following recommendations, RSV antibody refers to either nirsevimab or clesrovimab. A dose of RSV antibody is recommended for all eligible infants (i.e. those aged < 8 months) born during or entering their first RSV season.

### Respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein vaccine in older adults [^1139Su1S]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of acute respiratory infection, lower respiratory tract disease, clinical complications, and death in older adults. There is currently no licensed vaccine against RSV infection.

- **Methods**: In an ongoing, international, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, adults 60 years of age or older to receive a single dose of an AS01 E-adjuvanted RSV prefusion F protein-based candidate vaccine (RSVPreF3 OA) or placebo before the RSV season. The primary objective was to demonstrate vaccine efficacy of one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine against RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease, confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), during one RSV season. The criterion for meeting the primary objective was a lower limit of the confidence interval around the efficacy estimate of more than 20%. Efficacy against severe RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease and RSV-related acute respiratory infection was assessed, and analyses according to RSV subtype (A and B) were performed. Safety was evaluated.

- **Results**: A total of 24,966 participants received one dose of the RSVPreF3 OA vaccine (12,467 participants) or placebo (12,499). Over a median follow-up of 6.7 months, vaccine efficacy against RT-PCR-confirmed RSV-related lower respiratory tract disease was 82.6% (96.95% confidence interval, 57.9 to 94.1), with 7 cases (1.0 per 1000 participant-years) in the vaccine group and 40 cases (5.8 per 1000 participant-years) in the placebo group. Vaccine efficacy was 94.1%.

### Association between updated guideline-based palivizumab administration and hospitalizations for respiratory syncytial virus infections [^1176uQfw]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Since its introduction, palivizumab has been used to prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in high-risk populations. Recommendations for palivizumab administration changed in 2014. We examined whether adherence to 2014 palivizumab guidelines affected RSV hospitalization rates.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective sequential period analysis comparing the incidence of RSV hospitalization in patients younger than 2 years of age before and after implementation of 2014 palivizumab use criteria. Hospitalization data were prospectively collected through age-based surveillance for the post-2014 guideline period (November 1, 2014 to April 1, 2015 RSV season). Comparative data were collected retrospectively for hospitalizations during the pre-2014 guideline period of two previous RSV seasons (November 1, 2012 to April 1, 2013 and November 1, 2013 to April 1, 2014). The primary outcome was RSV hospitalization rate, and the number of palivizumab doses administered was analyzed as a secondary outcome.

- **Results**: During the study period, 194 RSV hospitalizations occurred. The rate of RSV hospitalization was 5.37 per 1000 children under 24 months in the pre-2014 guideline period versus 5.78 per 1000 children under 24 months in the post-2014 guideline period (difference of +0.4, 95% confidence interval: -1.2 to +2, P = 0.622). During the pre-2014 guideline period, 21.7 doses per 1000 children under 24 months of palivizumab were administered, which decreased to 10.3 doses per 1000 children under 24 months in the post-2014 guideline period, yielding a reduction of 11.4 doses per 1000 children.

### Phase 3 study assessing lot-to-lot consistency of respiratory syncytial virus prefusion protein F3 vaccine and its immune response, safety, and reactogenicity when co-administered with quadrivalent influenza vaccine [^116PYVex]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

For the immune response, the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of RSV-A neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) were compared between the RSV + Flu (pooled) group and the RSVPreF3 alone group (pooled RSV) at day 31 post-vaccination. The GMT ratio was 0.87 (95% CI, .78–.98). The data illustrated in Figure 5 reveal the results for the co-administered respiratory syncytial virus prefusion protein F3 (RSVPreF3) vaccine and the FLU-D-QIV vaccine versus RSVPreF3 alone, focusing on RSV-A neutralizing antibody titers (estimated dilution 60) at day 31 (per-protocol set).

- **Explanation of pooled groups**: Pooled RSV included data for groups RSV1, RSV2, and RSV3, which correspond to lots 1, 2, and 3 of the RSVPreF3 vaccine. The RSV + Flu (pooled) group is divided by the pooled RSV group.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F (RSVPreF3) candidate vaccine in older adults: Phase 1/2 randomized clinical trial [^117QL2SW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

- **Immunogenicity results**: All tested participants had detectable baseline RSV-specific antibodies (RSVPreF3-specific IgG, RSV-A- and RSV-B-specific nAb) due to previous RSV exposure(s). Baseline RSVPreF3-specific CD4+ T-cell frequencies were below the lower limit of quantification (Figures 5 and 6; Supplementary Figures 3, 5, and 6). RSVPreF3 vaccination robustly increased antibody levels and CD4+ T-cell frequencies compared to prevaccination (Figures 5 and 6; Supplementary Figures 3–5). Results from analyses on ES and PPS were comparable for all immunogenicity parameters (data not shown).

- **Figure 5**: Prefusion conformation of the respiratory syncytial virus F protein (RSVPreF3)-specific immunoglobulin G geometric mean concentration (A), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A-specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titer (GMT) (B), and RSV-B-specific nAb GMT values (C) in part B (older adults [60–80 years of age]) (per-protocol set). *The timepoints in months (0, 1, 2, and 3) reflect days 1 (vaccination 1), 31, 61 (vaccination 2), and 91, respectively. Month 14 data derive from the long-term evaluation subset. The data at timepoint month 1 (day 31) were only tested for formulations with the selected concentration of the RSVPreF3 antigen (120 μg) and placebo; the participants were also vaccinated twice and at the same timepoints, but the blood samples were not analyzed on day 61. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. The syringe symbols above the x-axis designate vaccination timepoints. 30 µg, 60 µg, and 120 µg indicate.

### The respiratory syncytial virus vaccine landscape: lessons from the graveyard and promising candidates [^114koF8J]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The global burden of disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasingly recognized, not only in infants but also in older adults (aged ≥ 65 years). Advances in the knowledge of the structural biology of the RSV surface fusion glycoprotein have revolutionized RSV vaccine development by providing a new target for preventive interventions. The RSV vaccine landscape has rapidly expanded to include 19 vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in clinical trials, reflecting the urgency of reducing this global health problem and, hence, the prioritization of RSV vaccine development.

The candidates include mAbs and vaccines using four approaches:

- **Particle-based**: Involves the use of nanoparticles to deliver the vaccine.
- **Live-attenuated or chimeric**: Utilizes a weakened form of the virus or a hybrid virus for inoculation.
- **Subunit**: Focuses on essential parts of the virus to induce immunity.
- **Vector-based**: Employs a different virus to deliver the RSV antigens.

Late-phase RSV vaccine trial failures highlight gaps in knowledge regarding immunological protection and provide lessons for future development. In this review, we highlight promising new approaches for RSV vaccine design and provide a comprehensive overview of RSV vaccine candidates and mAbs in clinical development to prevent one of the most common and severe infectious diseases in young children and older adults worldwide.

### Priorities for developing respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in different target populations [^113Cxv43]. Science Translational Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The development of an effective vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been hampered by major difficulties that occurred in the 1960s, when a formalin-inactivated vaccine led to increased severity of RSV disease after acquisition of the virus in the RSV season following vaccination. Recent renewed efforts to develop a vaccine have resulted in about 38 candidate vaccines and monoclonal antibodies currently in clinical development. The target populations for effective vaccination are varied and include neonates, young children, pregnant women, and older adults. The reasons for susceptibility to infection in each of these groups may differ and, therefore, could require different vaccine types for the induction of protective immune responses, adding a further challenge for vaccine development. This review examines the knowledge of RSV vaccine development for these target populations and proposes a view and rationale for prioritizing RSV vaccine development.

### The logistics and coordination of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis use among US pediatric specialists [^112SSXu3]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Nearly all physicians in these specialties (93.5%–98.7%) routinely recommended RSV immunoprophylaxis, even when poor parental compliance was suspected. The most frequently provided reasons for not recommending RSV immunoprophylaxis varied slightly across specialties; overall, parental refusal and lack of or insufficient insurance were the reasons most commonly cited.

The majority of respondents (87.2% of neonatologists, 83.3% of pediatricians, 91.4% of pediatric pulmonologists, and 71.8% of pediatric cardiologists) reported that over 50.0% of eligible infants and young children received each recommended monthly dose of RSV immunoprophylaxis throughout the RSV season. Additionally, most respondents (78.3% of neonatologists, 92.0% of pediatricians, 98.3% of pediatric pulmonologists, and 100% of pediatric cardiologists) would start monthly dosing for those who presented after the RSV season had begun.

Between 18.2% and 32.8% of all physicians surveyed had recommended more than five doses during the RSV season; this was most frequently attributed to a prolonged RSV season or ongoing prevalence of RSV in the community. The proportion of respondents recommending RSV immunoprophylaxis for eligible young children in their second RSV season varied considerably by specialty, with a higher proportion of pediatric pulmonologists (94.8%) and pediatric cardiologists (95.5%) making such recommendations compared with a lower proportion of other specialists.

### Phase 1/2 randomized study of the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine in adults with concomitant inactivated influenza vaccine [^116k7oZp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

- **Neutralizing titers and geometric mean fold rises**: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) neutralizing geometric mean titers were measured before and one month post-vaccination 1 for RSV subgroups A and B among expanded cohort participants aged 18–49 years and 65–85 years. The geometric mean fold rises from prevaccination to one month postvaccination are indicated above each pair of bars. The total number of participants was 38–41 per group (18–49 years) and 38–43 per group (65–85 years). Abbreviations: Al(OH)₃, aluminum hydroxide; GMFR, geometric mean fold rise; GMT, geometric mean titer; m, month; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; SIIV, seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine.

- **Serum RSV neutralizing titers**: In the older adult expanded cohort, serum RSV neutralizing titers remained above baseline through 12 months postvaccination, with GMFRs of 3.0–4.5 for RSV A and 2.9–4.3 for RSV B. Corresponding GMFRs for placebo recipients were 1.2 for each RSV subgroup; these findings were similar for older adults in the sentinel cohort. GMFRs also remained above baseline through 12 months postvaccination in younger adults in the expanded cohort. A similar trend was observed for prefusion F–binding IgG. Neither dose nor formulation had a major impact on the durability of antibody responses.

### Respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations in US preterm infants after the 2014 change in immunoprophylaxis guidance by the American Academy of Pediatrics [^116HewF4]. Journal of Perinatology (2020). Low credibility.

Palivizumab is the only FDA-licensed intervention available for the prevention of serious LRTI caused by RSV in children. It is indicated for high-risk infants with a history of premature birth (≤ 35 wGA) who are ≤ 6 months of age at the beginning of RSV season; those with CLDP or BPD who required medical treatment within the previous 6 months and are aged ≤ 24 months at the beginning of RSV season; and those with hemodynamically significant CHD who are aged ≤ 24 months at the beginning of RSV season. Although multiple vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical testing, it is likely that a safe and effective vaccine for RSV disease is years away from licensure. This is particularly true for preterm and younger infants, who would have a longer window before vaccines might be extended to their ages, as additional safety studies will need to be performed in this population.

### Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines — two steps back for one leap forward [^115hcxjd]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Respiratory viruses are among the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. From a vaccine viewpoint, such viruses may be divided into two principal groups: those where infection results in long-term immunity and whose continued survival requires constant mutation, and those where infection induces incomplete immunity, with repeated infections being common even with little or no mutation. Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) typify the former and latter groups, respectively.

Importantly, successful vaccines have been developed against the influenza virus. However, this is not the case for RSV, despite many decades of research and several vaccine approaches. Similar to natural infection, the principal limitation of candidate RSV vaccines in humans is limited immunogenicity, characterized in part by short-term RSV-specific adaptive immunity. The specific reasons why natural RSV infection is insufficiently immunogenic in humans are unknown, but circumvention of innate and adaptive immune responses are likely causes.

Fundamental questions concerning RSV/host interactions remain to be addressed at both the innate and adaptive immune levels in humans in order to elucidate mechanisms of immune response circumvention. Taking the necessary steps back to generate such knowledge will provide the means to leap forward in our quest for a successful RSV vaccine. Recent developments relating to some of these questions are discussed.

### Disagreement FDA and EMA on RSV maternal vaccination: Possible consequence for global mortality [^114vC5UV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Low credibility.

The European Medicines Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration have recently approved a maternal vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus. The US Food and Drug Administration limits vaccination to later in pregnancy. Mathematical modeling demonstrates that this vaccination window may reduce the global mortality impact of the vaccine by 12%. Policymakers should carefully consider vaccine risks and benefits to safeguard vulnerable infants effectively.

### Evaluating vaccination strategies for reducing infant respiratory syncytial virus infection in low-income settings [^114GUdvz]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, for a vaccine-induced immunity shorter than the protection provided by natural infection (for example, 4 months), the ability of the latter strategies to prevent RSV infection in infancy is markedly reduced (see Figure 4). Indeed, in this case, the expected average reduction of RSV infant incidence after 10 years of vaccination with routine immunization and annual vaccination of students ranges between 23.4% and 24.2%, on average.

- **The scenario of sub-optimal coverage**: If the fraction of successfully immunized individuals in the target population is reduced — as a consequence of either a lower vaccine coverage or a limited vaccine efficacy — the expected reduction in RSV incidence among infants and in the general population achieved after 10 years of vaccination decreases for all the considered strategies (see Figure 4). However, if the vaccine-induced immunity lasts for 1 year, even when only 60% of the targeted population is protected, routine immunization of infants and repeated vaccination of all students are predicted to reduce infant RSV incidence by, on average, 39.6% and 45.6%, respectively, after 10 years of vaccination.

In contrast, the effectiveness of newborn immunization through vaccination of pregnant women seems to be only slightly affected by sub-optimal coverage. Indeed, under all assumptions on the duration of vaccine-induced immunity, when the fraction of protected infants through vaccination of pregnant women is 60%, the reduction of RSV infections in infants is predicted to be at most 4% lower than what could be achieved with 100% coverage.

### Seasonality, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus disease by subtype among children aged < 5 years: New Vaccine Surveillance Network, United States, 2016–2020 [^113sy6qq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute respiratory illnesses in children. RSV can be broadly categorized into two major subtypes: A and B. RSV subtypes have been known to cocirculate with variability in different regions of the world. Clinical associations with viral subtype have been studied among children with conflicting findings such that no conclusive relationships between RSV subtype and severity have been established.

- **Methods**: During 2016–2020, children aged < 5 years were enrolled in prospective surveillance in the emergency department or inpatient settings at seven US pediatric medical centers. Surveillance data collection included parent/guardian interviews, chart reviews, and collection of midturbinate nasal plus/minus throat swabs for RSV (RSV-A, RSV-B, and untyped) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

- **Results**: Among 6398 RSV-positive children aged < 5 years, 3424 (54%) had subtype RSV-A infections, 2602 (41%) had subtype RSV-B infections, and 272 (5%) were not typed, inconclusive, or mixed infections. In both adjusted and unadjusted analyses, RSV-A-positive children were more likely to be hospitalized, as well as when restricted to those aged < 1 year. By season, RSV-A and RSV-B cocirculated in varying levels, with one subtype dominating proportionally.

- **Conclusions**: Findings indicate that RSV-A and RSV-B may only be marginally clinically distinguishable, but both subtypes are associated with medically attended illness in children aged < 5 years. Furthermore, the circulation of RSV subtypes varies substantially each year, seasonally.

### Immunological goals for respiratory syncytial virus vaccine development [^1112XR1N]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

Defining the immunological goals for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination requires an understanding of RSV biology and tropism, mechanisms of cell-to-cell spread and immunity, epidemiology, and transmission dynamics. The immunological goals for a particular vaccine would be product-specific based on antigen selection, delivery approach, and target population. There are many ways to achieve immunity against RSV infection, involving innate and adaptive responses, humoral and cellular effector mechanisms, and mucosal and systemic responses. Both protective and pathological immune response patterns have been demonstrated in animal models and humans. In this short commentary, the entire information matrix that may inform the design of particular vaccine candidates cannot be fully reviewed, but the rationale behind the major vaccine approaches in key target populations will be discussed.

### Navigating parental hesitancy in public health: The case for RSV immunization in newborns [^112FnmQD]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). High credibility.

In light of this ongoing challenge, the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) issued a prophylaxis recommendation with monoclonal antibodies to mitigate the severe consequences of RSV infection and reduce the burden on the healthcare system during peak seasons. As of June 27, 2024, monoclonal antibody nirsevimab (trade name: Beyfortus®) should be administered as a single dose to all newborns and infants before their first RSV season, typically between October and March. Infants born between April and September should, if possible, receive it in the fall before the start of their first RSV season. Newborns born during the RSV season should receive nirsevimab as soon as possible after birth, ideally upon discharge from the birthing center.

In Germany, STIKO recommends administering nirsevimab at the standard pediatric well-child visit during birth hospitalization (3rd to 10th day of life), similar to statements given by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in August 2023. Nirsevimab's safety profile is well-established, building on decades of clinical experience with the related monoclonal antibody palivizumab (Synagis®), safely administered to neonates at high risk of severe RSV disease since 1998. Unlike palivizumab, nirsevimab has been engineered to provide extended efficacy, lasting up to five months and covering an entire RSV season with a single dose.

The STIKO recommendation serves as a pivotal anchor in the conversation about RSV prevention.

### The logistics and coordination of respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis use among US pediatric specialists [^111iXPgu]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

In the present study, respondents reported that subsequent outpatient doses of RSV immunoprophylaxis are administered by a variety of health care providers, most commonly by primary care providers or pediatricians. However, a large proportion of young children with CLDP and HS-CHD receive their doses in the pediatric pulmonologists' and pediatric cardiologists' office or clinic. The varied providers and settings in which immunoprophylaxis is administered underscore the importance of ongoing collaborative efforts to coordinate patient care. Regular communication and partnership among specialists will help ensure that all eligible preterm infants and young children at high risk for severe RSV disease receive immunoprophylaxis throughout the entire RSV season without gaps in the monthly dosing schedule.

Parental understanding of the importance of immunoprophylaxis is essential to ensure that each recommended monthly dose is administered in a timely manner. It has been previously shown that the strongest association of compliance with the receipt of all doses is parents' perception of the benefits of RSV immunoprophylaxis. Therefore, counseling parents on the purpose of RSV immunoprophylaxis, how it works, and the importance of adherence is also critical. Parents should be educated about the fact that RSV immunoprophylaxis provides passive immunization rather than eliciting an active immune response against RSV; therefore, immunoprophylaxis must be administered monthly throughout the RSV season for it to be most effective. Furthermore, providing re-education at each follow-up visit is important for maintaining adherence.

### Use of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in older adults: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2023 [^113uYoLe]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a cause of severe respiratory illness in older adults. In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccines for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease in adults aged ≥ 60 years. Since May 2022, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Respiratory Syncytial Virus Vaccines Adult Work Group met at least monthly to review available evidence regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these vaccines among adults aged ≥ 60 years. On June 21, 2023, ACIP voted to recommend that adults aged ≥ 60 years may receive a single dose of an RSV vaccine, using shared clinical decision-making. This report summarizes the body of evidence considered for this recommendation and provides clinical guidance for the use of RSV vaccines in adults aged ≥ 60 years. RSV vaccines have demonstrated moderate to high efficacy in preventing RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease and have the potential to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality among older adults; postmarketing surveillance will direct future guidance.

### Palivizumab prophylaxis in infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory syncytial virus infection [^112fQVQZ]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for the use of palivizumab prophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was first published in a policy statement in 1998. AAP recommendations have been updated periodically to reflect the most recent literature regarding children at greatest risk of severe RSV disease.

Since the last update in 2014, which refined prophylaxis guidance to focus on those children at greatest risk, data have become available regarding the seasonality of RSV circulation, the incidence and risk factors associated with bronchiolitis hospitalizations, and the potential effects of the implementation of prophylaxis recommendations on hospitalization rates of children with RSV infection.

- **Literature review**: This technical report summarizes the literature review by the Committee on Infectious Diseases, supporting the reaffirmation of the 2014 AAP policy statement on palivizumab prophylaxis among infants and young children at increased risk of hospitalization for RSV infection.

Review of publications since 2014 did not support a change in recommendations for palivizumab prophylaxis and continues to endorse the guidance provided in the 2021 Red Book.

### Substantial variability in community respiratory syncytial virus season timing [^112QjXHz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children. Prevention of RSV disease in children in certain high-risk groups through the use of immunoglobulin preparations has been recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics since 1998. A more precise understanding of the timing of annual RSV epidemics should assist providers in maximizing the benefit of these preventive therapies. The objective of this study was to determine whether national RSV surveillance data could be used to define the timing of seasonal outbreaks.

- **Methods**: Weekly RSV testing data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Viruses Surveillance System for the period July 1990 through June 2000 were analyzed. RSV season onset week, peak week, and duration were calculated for the entire United States, Census regions, and select local laboratories. Season variability was estimated by comparing calculations for individual RSV seasons to median measurements for the entire surveillance period.

- **Results**: RSV seasons in the South region began significantly earlier (P < 0.05) and lasted longer (P < 0.05) than seasons for the rest of the nation. Conversely, RSV seasons in the Midwest region began significantly later (P < 0.01) and were shorter (P < 0.05) than those for the rest of the nation. Local RSV seasons varied substantially by year and by laboratory. The variability between laboratories generally increased with the distance between laboratories.

- **Conclusions**: Onset weeks and durations of RSV seasons vary substantially by year and location. Local RSV data are necessary for effective planning and prevention strategies.
