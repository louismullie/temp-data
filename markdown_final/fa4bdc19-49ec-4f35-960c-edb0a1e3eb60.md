## Question

Treatment for interstitial cystitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, preserving natural self-verification and any initial missteps with corrections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should verify first-line behavioral and educational strategies. Next, I will review second-line oral agents and their evidence and risks. After that, I need to examine intravesical therapies and their protocols. Then, I should consider procedures for refractory disease, including Hunner lesion-directed therapy and neuromodulation. Finally, I will address pain management, special populations, and when to reconsider the diagnosis or escalate to surgery, ensuring shared decision-making throughout [^116fyYZj].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics, because I need to ensure we are treating true IC/BPS rather than infection, stones, malignancy, or neurologic disease; the core is bladder pain/pressure/discomfort with lower urinary tract symptoms for more than six weeks, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes, and I should double-check that cystoscopy is not required routinely but is appropriate when the diagnosis is uncertain or to identify Hunner lesions that change management [^111zGemF] [^115SFv6G] [^1177ucRV].

> Wait, let me verify the role of potassium sensitivity testing; my first instinct is to consider it for confirmation, but hold on, I should verify the guideline stance — yes, the AUA advises against routine PST because it lacks predictive value, can provoke flares, and does not change management, so I should not order it in typical cases [^113ajCZp].

> Next, I should review first-line foundational care, because education and behavioral modification are standards and often yield meaningful improvement; I need to ensure the patient understands normal bladder function, that no single therapy works for everyone, and that symptom control may require sequential trials and combinations, and I should implement bladder training, fluid optimization, stress management, and pelvic floor physical therapy when pelvic floor tenderness is present, documenting symptoms to track response and stopping ineffective therapies [^116E5r1N] [^116c2Y4y] [^111vgrDe] [^114tALFt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oral agents; I should confirm that amitriptyline, cimetidine, hydroxyzine, and pentosan polysulfate are reasonable second-line options, each with modest and variable efficacy and distinct adverse effect profiles, and I must counsel on PPS-specific ocular risks and the need for retinal monitoring given maculopathy reports, while titrating amitriptyline slowly to mitigate anticholinergic effects and recognizing that PPS is the only FDA-approved oral agent for IC/BPS with mixed RCT results [^112u34Kv] [^113fkj5u] [^114AJq7V] [^115DgYeP] [^116ptkpb] [^116ucNLL].

> I will now examine intravesical therapies, and I should double-check the evidence hierarchy; DMSO, heparin, and alkalinized lidocaine are acceptable options with largely low-to-moderate quality evidence, with lidocaine offering short-term relief and DMSO showing the most robust albeit still limited data, and I need to ensure we limit DMSO dwell time to 15–20 minutes to reduce pain and be mindful of cocktail mixtures that may enhance absorption and toxicity, especially with lidocaine [^114NjmhR] [^112HdKZ8] [^111qZjs4] [^116xP6it].

> Let me consider procedural options for refractory disease, and I should confirm that cystoscopy with low-pressure, short-duration hydrodistension is an option rather than diagnostic gold, while fulguration and/or triamcinolone injection of Hunner lesions is a Recommendation with strong observational support for durable pain relief, and intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA is an Option for carefully selected patients willing to risk intermittent catheterization, with neuromodulation as a conditional Option for frequency/urgency rather than pain [^112JmyAd] [^1158ar9a] [^114fYTAd] [^111SnoAL].

> But wait, what if pain remains intractable despite bladder-directed therapy; I need to ensure a multimodal pain plan using non-opioid strategies first, reserving opioids as last resort with clear functional goals, contracts, and monitoring, and I should coordinate with pelvic floor physical therapy, psychology, and other specialists because pain control alone is insufficient without addressing bladder symptoms and quality of life [^116C2fyG] [^115JzuXM] [^112ZVPv1].

> I should confirm special populations and overlaps, especially in men where IC/BPS can mimic or coexist with CP/CPPS; if CP/CPPS-directed therapy fails, I need to reconsider IC/BPS and actively look for Hunner lesions, and I should remember that pelvic floor myalgia is common and treatable with targeted physical therapy even when the pain generator is multifactorial [^1177ucRV] [^116vDnhX] [^115ncMVd].

> Hold on, I should verify when to reconsider the diagnosis; if multiple appropriate therapies fail over time, I need to revisit the differential, consider urodynamics when voiding dysfunction is suspected, and evaluate for alternative or overlapping conditions, because persistent nonresponse should prompt diagnostic re-evaluation rather than endless empiric trials [^113sFbae] [^111jj4Ja].

> Finally, I need to ensure we are aligned on expectations and shared decision-making; complete remission is uncommon, most patients have a waxing and waning course with persistent baseline symptoms, and major surgery such as substitution cystoplasty or diversion is reserved for rare, carefully selected patients with bladder-centric disease and severely reduced capacity after all else fails, ideally managed by experienced surgeons with long-term follow-up plans [^112FvnvS] [^111HG1Vt].

---

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) management is **multimodal and individualized**, with **first-line behavioral therapies** (bladder training, diet, stress management) [^113ZGZjn] and pelvic floor physical therapy [^116fyYZj] as the foundation. If symptoms persist, **second-line options** include oral agents (amitriptyline, pentosan polysulfate sodium, hydroxyzine, cimetidine) [^112u34Kv] and intravesical therapies (DMSO, heparin, lidocaine) [^114NjmhR]. For refractory cases, consider intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA [^114fYTAd], neuromodulation [^112JmyAd], or fulguration/injection of Hunner lesions [^112JmyAd]. Major surgery is reserved for **end-stage disease** [^111HG1Vt] after all other options fail. Treatments should be **trialed sequentially** [^114tALFt], with **regular reassessment** [^116fyYZj] and **shared decision-making** to balance benefits and risks [^114NWd3F].

---

## First-line behavioral and non-pharmacologic therapies

First-line behavioral and non-pharmacologic therapies are the **foundation of IC/BPS management** [^116fyYZj], emphasizing education, self-care, and symptom control [^113ZGZjn].

- **Education and self-care**: Patients should be educated about normal bladder function, the chronic nature of IC/BPS, and the need for multiple therapeutic trials [^116E5r1N]. Self-care practices such as fluid management, dietary modifications, and stress management are recommended [^116c2Y4y].

- **Bladder training**: Bladder training with urge suppression techniques can reduce frequency and urgency symptoms [^notfound].

- **Pelvic floor physical therapy**: Pelvic floor muscle relaxation and manual therapy are recommended, particularly for patients with pelvic floor tenderness or dysfunction [^116fyYZj].

- **Stress management**: Stress management techniques, including mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral strategies, are encouraged to cope with symptom flares [^111vgrDe].

---

## Second-line pharmacologic therapies

If first-line therapies fail to provide adequate symptom control, **second-line pharmacologic treatments** may be considered [^112u34Kv].

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Evidence level** | **Common adverse effects** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amitriptyline | Tricyclic antidepressant; modulates pain pathways | Grade B | - Sedation <br/> - Dry mouth <br/> - Constipation [^notfound] |
| Pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) | Glycosaminoglycan layer repair; anti-inflammatory | Grade B | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - Hair loss <br/> - Rare macular toxicity [^116ptkpb] |
| Hydroxyzine | Antihistamine; mast cell stabilization | Grade C | - Sedation <br/> - Dry mouth [^notfound] |
| Cimetidine | H2 antagonist; mast cell stabilization | Grade C | - Gastrointestinal upset <br/> - Headache [^notfound] |

---

These medications may be used individually or in combination, with **careful monitoring for adverse effects** and **regular reassessment of efficacy** [^114tALFt].

---

## Intravesical therapies

Intravesical instillations are **second-line options** for patients who do not respond to oral therapies [^112HdKZ8].

- **Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)**: DMSO is FDA-approved for IC/BPS and has demonstrated significant symptom improvement in clinical trials [^116xP6it]. It is typically administered as a series of instillations with short dwell times to minimize discomfort [^112HdKZ8].

- **Heparin**: Intravesical heparin has shown efficacy in observational studies, particularly when combined with lidocaine or alkalinized solutions [^114Xm3gP].

- **Lidocaine**: Alkalinized lidocaine provides short-term symptom relief and is useful for acute flares [^111qZjs4].

---

## Advanced therapies for refractory cases

For patients with refractory IC/BPS, **advanced therapies** may be considered:

- **Intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA**: Botulinum toxin injections into the bladder wall can reduce urgency and pain, but patients must be willing to accept the possibility of intermittent self-catheterization [^114fYTAd].

- **Neuromodulation**: Sacral or pudendal neuromodulation may be effective in selected patients, particularly those with predominant frequency/urgency symptoms [^111SnoAL].

- **Hunner lesion treatment**: Fulguration or injection of triamcinolone into Hunner lesions is recommended for patients with lesion-positive IC/BPS [^112JmyAd].

---

## Surgical options

Surgical interventions are reserved for **end-stage disease** with severe, refractory symptoms and a small fibrotic bladder [^111HG1Vt]. Substitution cystoplasty or urinary diversion may be considered in carefully selected patients after exhaustive conservative therapy [^111HG1Vt].

---

## Pain management strategies

Pain management is integral to IC/BPS care, employing a **multimodal approach** that prioritizes non-opioid options (NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentinoids) and reserves opioids for refractory cases with careful monitoring and functional goals [^116C2fyG] [^115JzuXM].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment decisions should be **individualized** based on:

- **Symptom phenotype**: Hunner lesions, pelvic floor dysfunction, or widespread pain patterns may guide therapy selection [^113kVahx].

- **Comorbidities**: Patients with overlapping conditions such as endometriosis or irritable bowel syndrome may require tailored approaches [^notfound].

- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment choices with patient values and goals [^116fyYZj].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential to assess treatment efficacy, monitor adverse effects, and adjust therapy [^114tALFt]. Clinicians should **reconsider the diagnosis** if no improvement occurs after multiple treatment approaches [^113sFbae].

---

## Emerging therapies and research directions

Research is ongoing to identify novel therapies and refine existing treatments. Areas of interest include **biomarker development**, personalized medicine approaches, and improved understanding of IC/BPS pathophysiology [^115X5264].

---

Interstitial cystitis treatment requires a **multimodal approach**, starting with behavioral therapies and escalating to pharmacologic, intravesical, and advanced interventions as needed. Individualized care, shared decision-making, and regular reassessment are critical to optimizing outcomes.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) guideline — systematic review methods: Literature searches of English-language MEDLINE spanned January 1, 1983 to July 22, 2009, with an American Urological Association (AUA) update in July 2013 identifying an additional 31 articles, and a 2022 update (search dates: 06/2013–01/2021) identifying 63 studies, 53 of which were added to the evidence base. The review eliminated preclinical, pediatric, commentary, and editorial reports and excluded studies using treatments not available in the US, herbal or supplement treatments, or outcomes collapsed across multiple interventions; mixed patient groups were retained only when more than 50% were IC/BPS patients. Because individual study sample sizes were small, single studies were not deemed sufficient for a Standard, Recommendation, or Option, but were used to support Clinical Principles.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1146S8pH]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — treatment categories and evidentiary designations state that most treatments are designated as Options, except for physical therapy in the setting of pelvic floor tenderness (Standard) and triamcinolone injection and/or fulguration of Hunner lesions (Recommendation). The designation of Option reflects the Panel's judgment that uncertainty existed for the balance between benefits and risks/burdens, including that most treatments may benefit a subset not readily identifiable pre‑treatment and that no treatment reliably benefits most or all patients; uncertainty also arises when studies suggest efficacy but total exposure is small (e.g., cimetidine), and for oral PPS, several randomized trials were contradictory, supporting an Option designation. Given limited understanding of pathophysiology and the goal to control symptoms to optimize QoL, the Panel judged that treatments are best presented as clinical choices when some efficacy for some patients was demonstrated and the risk of serious harms was acceptable.

Behavioral and non-pharmacologic treatments for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — patients should be educated about normal bladder function, what is known and not known about IC/ BPS, the benefits versus risks/burdens of available treatment alternatives, the fact that no single treatment has been found effective for the majority of patients, and that acceptable symptom control may require trials of multiple therapeutic options (including combination therapy) before it is achieved (Clinical Principle). Self-care practices and behavioral modifications that can improve symptoms should be discussed and implemented as feasible (Clinical Principle). Patients should be encouraged to implement stress management practices to improve coping techniques and manage stress-induced symptom exacerbations (Clinical Principle).

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^116VzqKx]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — recognition and research needs include that IC has only been recognized as a highly prevalent health problem in the last 20 years, and there is an urgent need for a long-term registry following patients over several decades prospectively to inform the natural course and effective interventions for future trials. Although progress in developing specific IC/BPS treatments has been slow, modulation of visceral nociceptive pathways can occur at peripheral, spinal and supraspinal sites with a wide variety of potential drug targets; compounds that hit several targets might be the best option in the short term, yet there is emerging evidence that a more refined approach may be achievable.

Management approach — The published literature regarding the typical course of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is conflicting, with some studies suggesting that IC/BPS is a chronic condition with a waxing and waning course with, on average, little improvement over time while other studies suggest that most patients seem to improve over time. It is clear, however, that there is a limited understanding of IC/BPS pathophysiology and that most treatments are targeted at symptom control.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^115X5264]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Future research — Patients with IC/BPS constitute a previously under-recognized and underserved population in need of adequate medical management, and treating IC/BPS patients presents a significant challenge in clinical practice. Treatment approaches may be local (directed to the bladder) or systemic, range from behavioral to pharmacological, and may include many types of adjunctive therapy approaches intended to optimize quality of life. IC/BPS has been recognized as a chronic pain syndrome, the NIDDK has funded the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network, and a wide range of scientific discovery projects are being conducted at six Discovery Sites.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112SN6RN]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Surgical method selection and conclusions for major surgery in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome emphasize study design limits, expert performance, and patient selection. Essentially all publications on major surgery are retrospective reviews in which choice of operation was based on surgeon and patient-specific factors, and each procedure has advantages and disadvantages. The Panel notes that major surgery should be performed only by surgeons with extensive experience in IC/BPS and dedication to long-term care for the patient. Diligent patient selection, to ensure bladder-centric pain, is the most important factor affecting outcome, and the best-documented predictors of success are presence of Hunner lesions and reduced capacity under anesthesia.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^112xwVrk]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — treatment framework and differential diagnosis: The evidence base used to support this guideline did not favor stepwise "first"→"second"→"third line therapy", and to eliminate the concept of "step therapy", options are grouped by invasiveness with an emphasis on shared decision-making to select therapies based on the patient's needs, desires, and side effect tolerance; there are eight treatment categories: incontinence management strategies, behavioral therapies, optimization of co-morbidities, non-invasive therapies, pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters, and patients may select from multiple categories simultaneously. Differential diagnosis and contributors include that interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without UUI, but bladder and/or pelvic pain, including dyspareunia, is crucial; genitourinary syndrome of menopause can contribute to urgency and incontinence symptoms and there is some evidence for improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen; urinary tract infection can mimic OAB but is generally acute, shorter in duration, accompanied by cues such as dysuria or suprapubic discomfort, and resolves with antibiotics; and lower urinary tract symptoms related to neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are considered neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and not idiopathic OAB. Patients with prostates experience OAB nearly as often as those without and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated; some have both benign prostatic hyperplasia and OAB, while others have OAB alone and would benefit from diagnosis specific treatment. Because the term "refractory OAB" lacks a clear definition and consensus, the guideline has refrained from using it.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pharmacologic pain management — overall approach: The goal of pharmacotherapy is to find medication/medications that provide significant pain relief with minimal side effects. Pain management tools include urinary analgesics, NSAIDs, narcotics, and a wide variety of nonnarcotic medications used for chronic pain which have been "borrowed" from the treatment of depression, epilepsy, arrhythmias, etc. Given the current state of knowledge, pharmacological pain management principles for IC/BPS should be similar to those for management of other chronic pain states, and non-opioids alternatives to manage pain should be used preferentially. In addition, effective treatment of symptom flares may require a pain treatment protocol with some flexibility to manage flare-related breakthrough pain. Due to the global opioid crisis, the judicious use of chronic opioids is advised and only after informed decision-making with the patients and with periodic follow-ups to assess efficacy, adverse side effects, compliance, and potential of abuse or misuse.

BTX-A overall effect, adverse events, and panel judgment: In the absence of placebo-controlled studies the true effect of BTX-A cannot be determined, though studies suggest a subset experience symptom relief for several months before returning to baseline; common adverse events included dysuria, need for abdominal straining to void, large post-void residuals greater than 100 mL, and need for CISC persisting one to three months or longer. The Panel notes patients must accept the possibility that CISC may be necessary post-treatment, that this option is not appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate catheterization and is relatively contraindicated with any evidence of impaired bladder emptying, and judged intradetrusor BTX-A an Option with the decision individualized.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^111zGemF]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and differential diagnosis in suspected interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) should prioritize exclusion of overlapping conditions, as disorders such as bacterial cystitis, urinary calculi, vaginitis, carcinoma in situ of the bladder, and chronic bacterial prostatitis must be systematically excluded, and the role of other tests has poor specificity for IC/BPS. Clinicians should weigh test risks and benefits; urodynamic evaluation can identify bladder outlet obstruction or detrusor overactivity, but sensory urgency at low bladder volumes with or without detrusor overactivity is not specific for IC/BPS. In general, additional tests should be undertaken only if findings will alter the treatment approach.

Amitriptyline (Evidence Strength: Grade B) — One randomized controlled trial using oral amitriptyline 25 mg daily titrated over several weeks to a target 100 mg daily if tolerated was superior to placebo with 63% of the treatment group clinically significantly improved compared to 4% of the placebo group at four months. Two observational studies reported 50% to 64% clinically significant improvement using a similar dosing regimen at up to 19 months of follow-up, but adverse events (AEs) were extremely common (up to 79% of patients). Available data suggest beginning at low doses (e.g., 10 mg) and titrating gradually to 75–100 mg if tolerated is an acceptable dosing regimen. In an additional RCT with a standardized education and behavioral modification program, intention-to-treat success at three months was similar (drug – 55%; placebo – 45%), though among patients titrating to at least 50 mg, improvement was 66% and significantly greater than the placebo group; given AE burden, amitriptyline was designated as an Option.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112YSyTY]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pain management — analgesic selection and titration: It is important that the patient understand that finding the medication or combination of medications that provide effective pain control requires a "trial and error" method of prescribing. The efficacy of each analgesic administered should be determined and only one drug should be titrated at a time; otherwise it is not possible to assess the effects of a certain drug on pain scores. The starting dose should always be the smallest available and titration should occur at frequent intervals, guided by pain scores and side effects, and this requires frequent contact between the patient and the clinician. It is important for the patient and the prescribing clinician to understand that some side effects actually improve as the patient continues to take the drug for several weeks, and if these side effects are not intolerable, then the patient should be guided through this period. Patients and clinicians should be aware that 100% pain relief is often not achievable; the focus of pain management is to minimize discomfort and maximize the patient's ability to function in daily life.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^115JzuXM]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pain management — essential principles and stewardship: The rights and responsibilities of the patient and clinician should be clearly stated at the outset; this may take the form of a pain management "contract". All narcotic prescriptions must come from a single source. Increasing doses of medication should be tied to improving function in activities of daily living (e.g., work, parenting, sexual intimacy, ability to exercise) rather than to just relief of pain, and the patient and clinician should set mutual goals in these areas. Patients who require continuous narcotic therapy should be primarily managed with long-acting narcotics, and small doses of short acting narcotics can be used for "breakthrough" pain. Multimodality therapy may help to minimize narcotic use and the risk of tolerance, and narcotic medications should be used in combination with one of the non-narcotic drugs. Complementary therapy (e.g., physical therapy, counseling/pain psychology, stress management), should be considered as they may minimize the dependence on pain medications.

Hydroxyzine (Evidence Strength: Grade C) — In one randomized controlled trial, more patients in the treatment group (23%) experienced clinically significant improvement than in the placebo group (13%) after six months of oral hydroxyzine (10 mg daily titrated to 50 mg daily over several weeks if tolerated), but this difference was not statistically significant. One observational study reported 92% clinically significant improvement with 25 mg daily titrated up to 75 mg daily over several weeks. AEs were common (up to 82% of patients) but generally not serious and were similar in proportion between placebo and treatment groups; the Panel interpreted the disparate findings to indicate uncertainty regarding the balance between benefits/ risks/ burdens.

Intravesical lidocaine (Evidence Strength: Grade B) demonstrates short-term benefit in a multicenter RCT of 10 mL PSD597 (200 mg lidocaine alkalinized with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate once daily for 5 consecutive days with one-hour retention), with treatment-group improvement of 30% and 24% at days 3 and 10 versus 10% and 11.5% with placebo, significant at day 3 but not day 10; an open-label phase after five treatments reported 54% improved at three days and 48% at ten days. Alkalinization increases urothelial penetration but can increase systemic absorption and potential toxicity. Although no studies directly compare lidocaine concentrations, one open-label trial reported 75% success with 40,000 units heparin, 8 mL 1% lidocaine and 3 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, increasing to 94% after lidocaine 2%. AEs are typically not serious (dysuria, urethral irritation, bladder pain). Given that relief is short-term (i.e., less than two weeks) and the procedure can be associated with pain, this treatment alternative was designated an Option.

Intravesical instillations for IC/BPS — Guideline Statement 17: "DMSO, heparin, and/or lidocaine may be administered as second-line intravesical treatments (listed in alphabetical order; no hierarchy is implied). Option (Evidence Strength: Grades C, C, and B)". In one randomized trial, the protocol was four treatments of 50 cc 50% DMSO at two-week intervals with 15-minute retention and one-month post-treatment evaluation, with evaluators indicating 93% of DMSO patients and 35% of placebo patients improved and patient ratings 87% vs 59%. A second trial using six weekly instillations reported 47% improvement with DMSO versus 0% with BCG at three months. Observational studies reported efficacy rates of 25 to 90%, and intravesical DMSO instillation was designated as an Option. If DMSO is used, "the panel suggests limiting instillation dwell time to 15–20 minutes" because longer holds are "associated with significant pain". DMSO is often administered as a "cocktail" with heparin, sodium bicarbonate, a local steroid, and/or lidocaine; at follow-up of six weeks to 12 months, efficacy rates ranged from 61% to 70%, but clinicians should be aware DMSO "potentially enhances absorption of other substances, creating the possibility for toxicity from drugs such as lidocaine", and "No clinical studies have addressed the safety or increased efficacy" of these mixtures versus DMSO alone or across cocktails.

Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) overall efficacy and recommendation status in IC/BPS indicate overlapping improvement proportions between PPS and placebo, with PPS (21% to 56%) versus placebo (13% to 49%). A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials reported a pooled relative risk ratio of 1.69 (95% confidence interval = 1.16 to 2.46), and AE rates were relatively low (10% to 20% of patients). Administration of oral PPS, therefore, is designated an Option, and there is some evidence that PPS has lower efficacy in patients with Hunner lesions.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^111jj4Ja]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — urodynamic evaluation is characterized by the absence of agreed-upon diagnostic criteria, with bladder sensations during cystometric filling that may be normal or markedly abnormal and pain with filling (hypersensitivity) consistent with IC/BPS; most patients will have normal filling pressure and compliance. Detrusor overactivity (DO) is seen in approximately 12–20% of IC/BPS patients, and if the patient also meets the clinical definition criteria for IC/BPS, then it is reasonable to diagnose both conditions. Urodynamic evaluation may provide information regarding concomitant voiding dysfunction, and specific indications that urodynamic evaluation may be useful include suspicion of outlet obstruction in either sex, possibility of poor detrusor contractility, or other conditions that could explain why patients are ultimately refractory to first-line therapy; in general, however, urodynamics are not recommended for routine clinical use to establish an IC/BPS diagnosis.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — psychosocial and sexual function impacts: Quality of life (QoL) burden is high, with the impact on QoL as severe as that of rheumatoid arthritis and end- stage renal disease, and health-related QoL in women with IC/BPS worse than in women with endometriosis, vulvodynia or OAB. In IC/BPS patients, sexual dysfunction is moderate to severe and occurs at high rates compared with controls, and pain appears to mediate sexual dysfunction and its associated effects on QoL. Treatment response is linked to better functioning and QoL, as response to therapy is associated with improved overall QoL, sexual function, and sleep, with concomitant improvements in QoL.

Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) has randomized and comparative trial data with varied dosing and outcomes. Pentosanpolysulfate (Evidence Strength: Grade B) and PPS is the only FDA-approved oral agent for the treatment of IC/BPS, with seven randomized trials reporting on more than 500 patients; of the five trials that included PPS and placebo arms, four were RCTs. Selected results include a multicenter RCT using PPS 200 mg twice daily with clinically significant improvement rates (56% versus 49%, respectively), a study using 100 mg three times daily with improvement (PPS 28% versus placebo 13%), two trials at three months showing higher PPS improvement (28% and 32%, respectively) versus placebo (13% and 16%, respectively) with both administering 100 mg PPS three times daily, a randomized crossover trial demonstrating pain improvement in the PPS group (44%) compared to the placebo group (15%), an open-label comparison to CyA showing a higher improvement rate for CyA (83%) than for PPS patients (21%), and a dose-response study at eight months showing no differences (300 mg daily - 50%; 600 mg daily - 40%; 900 mg daily - 45%). An unpublished randomized trial compared 100 mg PPS once daily, 100 mg PPS three times daily, and placebo for 24 weeks with a primary endpoint of at least a 30% reduction in the ICSI, yielding responder rates: Placebo - 48/118 (40.7%); PPS 100 mg once daily - 51/128 (39.8%); PPS 100 mg three times daily - 52/122 (42.6%).

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^113kVahx]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) conceptualization and phenotypes are described as a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that can be conceptualized as a bladder pain disorder often associated with voiding symptomatology and other systemic chronic pain disorders, and specifically may be part of a more generalized systemic disorder in a subset of patients. More comprehensive studies from the NIH-funded MAPP Research Network found that 44% of IC/BPS patients had at least one additional COPC, and patients displaying widespread pain showed multiple indications of central neurobiological pain sensitization correlated with quantitative sensory testing, functional MRI, and inflammatory markers. Considering these data, it has been suggested that IC/BPS is a member of a family of hypersensitivity disorders, and an additional hypothesis is that IC/BPS might be part of the continuum of painful versus non-painful overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). Subgroups or phenotypes include bladder-centric phenotypes such as Hunner lesions, small bladder capacity, and pain improved with intravesical local anesthetics, and patients with Hunner lesions should be treated differently from those without these lesions. Others have a pelvic-floor phenotype (e.g., pelvic floor tenderness on exam), and women with this feature respond better to pelvic floor manual physical therapy. A third group have more systemic or widespread symptoms characterized by the presence of "widespread pain" defined as significant non-urologic pain outside the pelvis.

Intravesical heparin (Evidence Strength: Grade C) shows symptom improvement in observational and crossover studies with specified regimens: using 10,000 IU heparin in 10cm3 sterile water three times weekly for three months with one-hour retention, 56% reported clinically significant improvement; using 25,000 IU in 5 mL distilled water twice weekly for three months, 72.5% reported significant relief; and continuation for up to one year led to 40% overall reporting continued relief at one year. Combination formulations reported include 40,000 IU heparin with 3 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate plus 8 mL 1% or 2% lidocaine, and 20,000 units heparin with 20 mL 2% lidocaine and 40 mg triamcinolone. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover, at 12 hours after a single instillation the active arm had 50% successful response with a 42% pain reduction versus 13% and 21% with placebo; a prospective observational series giving weekly instillations for 12 weeks and following for 6 months saw responders rise from 33.3% at week 1 to 90% one month after 12 instillations, then diminish to 16.7% by 6 months, with additional improvements in OSSI/OSPI and other symptom measures. AEs were infrequent and appear minor, and for these reasons intravesical heparin is designated an Option.

Guideline Statement 3 — Cystoscopy and/or urodynamics should be considered when the diagnosis is in doubt; these tests are not necessary in uncomplicated presentations (Expert Opinion). Cystoscopy and urodynamic testing are appropriate when IC/BPS diagnosis is in doubt or when cystoscopy information is needed to guide therapy; cystoscopy is valuable to exclude mimics and to identify a Hunner lesion, and suspicion for bladder cancer, bladder stones, urethral diverticula, or intravesical foreign bodies is an indication for diagnostic cystoscopy. There are no agreed-upon cystoscopic findings diagnostic for IC/BPS; the only consistent finding leading to diagnosis is one or several inflammatory appearing lesions or ulcerations described by Hunner, and Hunner lesions are more common in patients of age over 50 years. When Hunner lesions are suspected, it is appropriate to proceed to cystoscopy to assess for their presence; glomerulations may be detected but are non-diagnostic and non-specific for IC/BPS, and lesion appearance can be acute or chronic.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) in men — presentation and diagnosis: Historically, IC/BPS in men has been considered relatively unusual, and diagnosis in men uses the same symptom complex as in women. In the MAPP Study, about 3 out of 4 men had symptoms of "painful bladder filling" and/or "painful urgency"; men with IC/BPS are less likely to report perineal pain as their most bothersome symptom and are more likely to have suprapubic tenderness. Early clinical symptoms may begin with mild dysuria or urinary urgency.

Intravesical instillation therapy for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — heparin‑lidocaine and alkalinized lidocaine show short‑term benefits with specific regimens and outcomes: refractory patients received heparin‑lidocaine (20,000 units heparin, 5 mL 4% alkalized lidocaine, 25 mL 7% sodium bicarbonate) weekly for 12 weeks with response rates 33%, 60%, and 77% after the first, fourth, and 12th instillation, and 90% reported relief at one month that declined to 46.7% and to 16.7% at 2 and 6-months, respectively; in a randomized comparison of 10 mL lidocaine solution versus 15 mL heparin‑lidocaine combined, the combination significantly reduced bladder pain (38% versus 13%; p = 0.029) and urgency (42% versus 8%; p = 0.003) compared to lidocaine alone, and improved GAR at 1 hour (77% versus 50%; p = 0.04) and at 24 hours (57% versus 23%; p = 0.002); in a randomized cross‑over trial, alkalinized lidocaine (n = 16) versus normal saline (n = 8) for 20 minutes yielded responses in Eleven patients in the lidocaine group (68.7%) and increased maximal cystometric capacity among responders (192–261 mL, p = 0.005) while saline showed no significant difference (190–183 mL; p = 0.879).

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112LxkkQ]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — cystoscopy, hydrodistension, and glomerulations are clarified as follows: Glomerulations may also be present in asymptomatic patients undergoing cystoscopy for other conditions, and bladder biopsy may be indicated to exclude other pathologies if a lesion of uncertain nature is present but is not part of the routine diagnostic process and presents a risk of perforation. Given the differing approaches, the finding of glomerulations on hydrodistension (less than 80 cm H2O, less than 5 minutes) is variable and not consistent with clinical presentation, and hydrodistension is not necessary for routine clinical use to establish a diagnosis of IC/BPS. Cystoscopic exam can be indicated if other sources of symptoms remain unclear; if hydrodistension is performed to determine whether Hunner lesions are present or as a treatment, then the technique should be specified and the bladder capacity determined, and it is useful for the clinician and patient to understand when bladder capacity is severely reduced (a low capacity due to fibrosis).

AUA/SUFU guideline on idiopathic overactive bladder — evidence nomenclature and recommendation grades are defined in Table 2 as follows: Strong Recommendation corresponds to "Benefits > Risks/Burdens (or vice versa)" with "Net benefit (or net harm) is substantial", applies "to most patients in most circumstances", and varies by evidence strength such that for A "future research is unlikely to change confidence", for B "better evidence could change confidence", and for C "better evidence is likely to change confidence (rarely used to support a Strong Recommendation)". Moderate Recommendation maintains "Benefits > Risks/Burdens (or vice versa)" with "Net benefit (or net harm) is moderate", applies "to most patients in most circumstances", and for A "future research is unlikely to change confidence", for B "better evidence could change confidence", and for C the benefit "appears moderate" with "better evidence is likely to change confidence". Conditional Recommendation uses "Benefits = Risks/Burdens", where the "Best action depends on individual patient circumstances"; for A "Future Research is unlikely to change confidence", for B "Better evidence could change confidence", and for C "Balance between Benefits & Risks/Burdens unclear", "Net benefit (or net harm) comparable to other options", and "Alternative strategies may be equally reasonable" with "Better evidence likely to change confidence". Additional statement types are defined: Clinical Principle is "a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature", and Expert Opinion is "a statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature".

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^1177ucRV]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis of male chronic pelvic pain — interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS): Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of IC/BPS in male chronic pelvic pain patients who experience an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes (Expert Opinion). The cardinal symptoms of IC/BPS are bladder pain/pressure/discomfort and lower urinary tract symptoms, and these symptoms are characteristic of IC/BPS, with voiding often relieving the bladder/pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort; in the MAPP phenotyping study 75% of men with chronic pelvic pain reported painful bladder filling or painful urge to urinate.

IC/BPS symptoms — population surveys report heterogeneous prevalence: A mailed questionnaire to 1,331 Finnish women aged 17–71 identified probable IC/BPS symptoms in 0.45%. In a US Pacific Northwest managed care population, IC/BPS symptoms were identified in 6–11% of women and 2–5% of men, depending on definition. In the Boston Area Community Health study using six different definitions, prevalence estimates ranged from 0.6% to 2.0%, with symptoms "typically two to three times as common in women as men". In the US Nurses Health Study of women aged 58 to 83 years, prevalence was 2.3%, increasing with age from 1.7% in those younger than 65 years up to 4.0% in women aged 80 years or older. In 981 Austrian women aged 19–89 at a voluntary health screening in Vienna, the prevalence of IC/BPS symptoms was 0.3% (306 per 100,000).

Supratrigonal cystectomy and augmentation with ileum and/or cecum in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) avoids an external appliance but carries augmentation-specific risks and IC/BPS-specific pain risks, and published cohorts report variable outcomes, including success and failure rates and predictors. In the 2014 and 2022 literature reviews, 11 publications reported cohorts who underwent this procedure with cohort sizes ranging from 4 to 40 patients (total 170), success rates ranging from 100% (6 of 6) to zero (4 of 4 failed), and a total combined failure rate of 23% (39 of 170), with 27 patients undergoing secondary cystectomy and diversion for persistent pain. Voiding outcomes after cystoplasty included 103 of 144 patients (72%) voiding spontaneously without intermittent catheterization. Articles analyzing predictors noted outcomes in subgroups: patients with Hunner lesions had 59 of 69 (86%) complete relief; complete pain relief occurred in 6 of 6 patients with capacity < 200 mL and in 2 of 2 patients with small contracted bladders, whereas failure occurred in 6 of 6 patients with large capacities under anesthesia and patients with large capacities under anesthesia were more likely to fail. Advantages included preserving ureteric orifices and avoiding an external appliance, whereas disadvantages included metabolic changes, risk of rupture, and possible need for intermittent catheterization, with a specific risk of persistent pain or recurrent trigonal ulcers in IC/BPS.

Potassium sensitivity test (PST) in IC/BPS — PST does not identify alternate disorders and does not change the clinical plan; a negative test does not alter management because 26% of patients who met strict NIDDK criteria had a negative test. Evidence to date reveals minimal predictive value: PST findings did not predict at least 50% improvement with pentosan polysulfate (PPS), did not predict benefit with combined heparinoid and tricyclic antidepressant treatment, and did not predict success in a randomized trial of PPS versus cyclosporine A. Although a modified PST predicted response to intravesical hyaluronic acid in one study, this treatment is not used in the US and unpublished multicenter randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate efficacy. The PST is painful and risks triggering a severe symptom flare, and the Panel concluded that the risk/benefit ratio was too high for routine clinical use.

Pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) ocular safety — The FDA approved a new warning label for PPS in June 2020 and specified ophthalmic screening measures: a detailed ophthalmologic history should be obtained prior to starting PPS; for patients with preexisting ophthalmologic conditions, a comprehensive baseline retinal examination is recommended prior to starting therapy; a retinal examination is suggested within six months of initiating treatment and periodically while continuing treatment, and if pigmentary retinal changes develop, the risks and benefits of continuing treatment should be reevaluated since these changes may be irreversible. The prevalence of maculopathy varies widely in PPS users and appears related to cumulative PPS exposure.

IC/BPS and CP/CPPS in men — Hunner lesions may be present in both men and women, and there are potential overlaps between CP/CPPS and IC/BPS in men; there should be high vigilance to look for Hunner lesions in men who present with chronic pelvic pain that is worse with bladder filling, associated with urinary frequency and urgency, and in whom the diagnosis of CP/CPPS is in doubt, or do not respond to conventional treatments of CP/CPPS. In a case series that examined 32 men diagnosed with CP/CPPS and refractory to behavioral and pharmacological therapies, 41% (13 of 32) had Hunner lesion on cystoscopy, and men with voided volume less than 150 mL were more likely to have Hunner lesions than those with voided volume exceeding 150 mL.

5.5 Renal Failure

In the randomized clinical trial (TROPIC), renal failure of any grade occurred in 4% of the patients being treated with cabazitaxel, including four cases with fatal outcome. Most cases occurred in association with sepsis, dehydration, or obstructive uropathy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Some deaths due to renal failure did not have a clear etiology. Appropriate measures should be taken to identify causes of renal failure and treat aggressively.

5.6 Urinary Disorders Including Cystitis

Cystitis, radiation cystitis, and hematuria, including that requiring hospitalization, has been reported with cabazitaxel in patients who previously received pelvic radiation [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In PROSELICA, cystitis and radiation cystitis were reported in 1.2% and 1.5% of patients who received prior radiation, respectively. Hematuria was reported in 19.4% of patients who received prior radiation and in 14.4% of patients who did not receive prior radiation. Cystitis from radiation recall may occur late in treatment with cabazitaxel. Monitor patients who previously received pelvic radiation for signs and symptoms of cystitis while on cabazitaxel. Interrupt or discontinue cabazitaxel in patients experiencing severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required to treat severe hemorrhagic cystitis.

5.7 Respiratory Disorders

Interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome have been reported and may be associated with fatal outcome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Patients with underlying lung disease may be at higher risk for these events. Acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur in the setting of infection. Interrupt cabazitaxel if new or worsening pulmonary symptoms develop. Closely monitor, promptly investigate, and appropriately treat patients receiving cabazitaxel. Consider discontinuation. The benefit of resuming cabazitaxel treatment must be carefully evaluated.

Determining the evidence strength — The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to determine the aggregate evidence quality for each outcome informing Guideline Statements, with evidence categorized as high, moderate, low, and very low, and assessment based on the aggregate risk of bias with limitations from inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias; upgrading is possible if the body of evidence indicates a large effect or if confounding factors would suggest either spurious effects or would reduce the demonstrated effect. The American Urological Association employs a 3-tiered strength of evidence system in which high certainty by GRADE translates to A category strength of evidence, moderate to B, and both low and very low to C.

CLINICAL TRIALS

ELMIRON®was evaluated in two clinical trials for the relief of pain in patients with chronic interstitial cystitis (IC). All patients met the NIH definition of IC based upon the results of cystoscopy, cytology, and biopsy. One blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated 151 patients (145 women, 5 men, 1 unknown) with a mean age of 44 years (range 18 to 81). Approximately equal numbers of patients received either placebo or ELMIRON®100 mg three times a day for 3 months. Clinical improvement in bladder pain was based upon the patient's own assessment. In this study, 28/74 (38%) of patients who received ELMIRON®and 13/74 (18%) of patients who received placebo showed greater than 50% improvement in bladder pain (p = 0.005).

A second clinical trial, the physician's usage study, was a prospectively designed retrospective analysis of 2499 patients who received ELMIRON®300 mg a day without blinding. Of the 2499 patients, 2220 were women, 254 were men, and 25 were of unknown sex. The patients had a mean age of 47 years and 23% were over 60 years of age. By 3 months, 1307 (52%) of the patients had dropped out or were ineligible for analysis; overall, 1192 (48%) received ELMIRON®for 3 months; 892 (36%) received ELMIRON®for 6 months; and 598 (24%) received ELMIRON®for one year.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^1174xm6b]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis considerations — OAB must be distinguished from polydipsia and diabetes insipidus (DI); frequency that is the result of polydipsia and resulting polyuria may mimic OAB but the two can only be distinguished with the use of frequency-volume charts, and in polydipsia urinary frequency occurs with normal or large volume voids and the intake is volume matched, while DI is associated with frequent, large volume voids and should be distinguished from OAB. The clinical presentation of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without urgency incontinence; however, bladder and/or pelvic pain, particularly dyspareunia, is crucial in contradistinction to OAB, and in menopausal female patients atrophic vaginitis can contribute to incontinence symptoms with some evidence for symptom improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen.

Overactive bladder (OAB) treatment research needs and medical therapy evidence gaps include that behavioral modifications and non-invasive treatments have been well studied and are relatively effective particularly in milder cases, yet they are time consuming or difficult to implement and adherence is limited by self-efficacy and discipline; individualized recommendations and phenotyping for biological and psychological attributes are proposed to personalize care. In medical therapy, many insurance providers mandate step therapy trialing one or more antimuscarinic medications before other therapies, evidence for advanced therapies in treatment-naive patients is scant, and a key unanswered question is the timepoint (in hours or days) after pharmacotherapy when maximum symptoms control is achieved; most studies assessed patient response at twelve weeks of follow-up even though steady state occurs within days.

5.8 Cognitive Impairment

Short-Term Cognitive Impairment

In a study in healthy volunteers, a single dose of SPRAVATO caused cognitive performance decline 40 minutes post-dose. Compared to placebo-treated subjects, SPRAVATO-treated subjects required a greater effort to complete cognitive tests at 40 minutes post-dose. Cognitive performance and mental effort were comparable between SPRAVATO and placebo at 2 hours post-dose. Sleepiness was comparable after 4 hours post-dose.

Long-Term Cognitive Impairment

Long-term cognitive and memory impairment have been reported with repeated ketamine misuse or abuse. In 1-year and 3-year, long-term, open-label clinical trials in adults, the effect of SPRAVATO on cognitive functioning remained stable over time as evaluated by the Cogstate computerized battery and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised.

5.9 Impaired Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery

Two placebo-controlled studies were conducted to assess the effects of SPRAVATO on the ability to drive [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The effects of SPRAVATO 84 mg were comparable to placebo at 6 hours and 18 hours post-dose. However, two SPRAVATO-treated subjects in one of the studies discontinued the driving test at 8 hours post-dose because of SPRAVATO-related adverse reactions.

Before SPRAVATO administration, instruct patients not to engage in potentially hazardous activities requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery, until the next day following a restful sleep. Patients will need to arrange transportation home following treatment with SPRAVATO.

5.10 Ulcerative or Interstitial Cystitis

Cases of ulcerative or interstitial cystitis have been reported in individuals with long-term off-label use or misuse/abuse of ketamine. In clinical studies with SPRAVATO nasal spray, there was a higher rate of lower urinary tract symptoms (pollakiuria, dysuria, micturition urgency, nocturia, and cystitis) in SPRAVATO-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. No cases of esketamine-related interstitial cystitis were observed in any of the studies, which included treatment for up to a year.

Monitor for urinary tract and bladder symptoms during the course of treatment with SPRAVATO, and refer to an appropriate healthcare provider as clinically warranted.

### Medications for treatment of interstitial cystitis… [^114795AC]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Cimetidine can improve overall symptom scores for interstitial cystitis, and it improves nocturia and suprapubic pain by about 50%. It does not improve dysuria, urgency, frequency, relief after voiding, or incomplete emptying. Amitriptyline and hydroxyzine should not be used to reduce symptom scores for interstitial cystitis. 1 Patients were randomized to pentosan or placebo. Patient self-report questionnaires were used to evaluate symptoms. Pentosan produced minimal or no significant improvement in symptom scores, but a pooled analysis of all five trials showed improvement in overall symptom scores for dysuria, nocturia, frequency, and urgency.

Three of the studies reported patient-assessed overall improvement rates, with numbers needed to treat of six to nine. The only adverse effect reported was edema. A single RCT found that cimetidine improved overall urinary symptom scores more than placebo. P = 0.12). 3 An RCT with 50 patients demonstrated that amitriptyline decreased mean urinary symptom scores more than placebo. 4 Amitriptyline reduced pain and urgency symptoms. Both studies found higher rates of anticholinergic effects with amitriptyline.

Recommendations from Others Guidelines from the American Urological Association recommend patient education, self-care practices, behavioral modification, and stress management as first-line therapy for patients with interstitial cystitis. 6 They recommend oral hydroxyzine, cimetidine, amitriptyline, and pentosan as second-line therapies and note that all of these agents may cause adverse effects and have unpredictable effectiveness.

### Interstitial cystitis is a legitimate and serious condition… [^113DkvCR]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

1 in American Family Physician. We are gratified that your family practice readership has the opportunity to review a comprehensive description of interstitial cystitis, its diagnosis, and the variety of treatment options that are available. Since many new patients with IC may not see a urologist right away, it is crucial that family physicians become more aware of this condition. We would like to point out the omission in the article 1 of any serious discussion of pain treatment for IC. For many patients with IC, the most debilitating aspect is the chronic, unrelenting pain that leads to an exceptionally poor quality of life and, in some cases, even suicide. Because IC is not fatal or malignant, some physicians are reluctant to prescribe strong analgesics, including narcotics.

Research documents that patients with chronic pain can receive great benefit from the use of opioid and nonopioid analgesics, and many patients with IC have regained their quality of life through effective pain management. 2–4 Additionally, for certain patients whose symptoms do not respond well to conventional treatments, experimental therapies may prove effective in pain management. The ICA has numerous informative fact sheets on IC that can be found on the ICA Website atwww. ichelp. org. Additionally, the author's 1 discussion of intravesical therapies commonly used for treatment in IC mentions silver nitrate, which is considered an outmoded therapy of questionable therapeutic value, and oxychlorosene, 0. 4 percent, which can be very painful for patients. Physicians should be discouraged from considering these two treatments.

1 does mention the use of tricyclics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and, possibly, gabapentin for pain relief in patients with interstitial cystitis. Although not mentioned in my article 1, I agree that strong analgesics including narcotics may need to be used to control pain and improve the quality of life in these patients. 2, 3 Opioids along with other pain control measures including physical therapy with biofeedback may be warranted in some patients. While the article 1 does mention the intravesicular treatments silver nitrate and oxychlorosene only in Table 2 and not in the body of the text, both treatments were footnoted as having no studies which showed their efficacy. 4 Given the lack of efficacy and potential side effects, I would therefore also discourage patients from considering these two treatments.
