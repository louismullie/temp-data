## Question

Should a female seeking to become pregnant take clomid and leteazole together?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a woman trying to conceive should take clomiphene citrate (Clomid) and letrozole together for ovulation induction, and under what circumstances that might be reasonable or not recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanisms of clomiphene and letrozole. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines recommend as first-line therapy for anovulatory infertility, especially in PCOS. Next, I will examine the direct evidence for combining clomiphene and letrozole versus using letrozole alone. After that, I need to check safety, including multiple gestation risk and OHSS considerations. Finally, I will consider special scenarios such as clomiphene resistance, unexplained infertility, and IVF contexts, and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale. Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that blocks hypothalamic estrogen feedback to increase GnRH and gonadotropins, whereas letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that reduces estradiol and can transiently increase intraovarian androgens, theoretically enhancing FSH responsiveness; mechanistically, combining them could target complementary pathways, but I need to ensure this translates into improved clinical outcomes rather than just theoretical synergy [^112RMMo3].

> Next, I should review guideline positions before jumping to combinations. Contemporary international PCOS guidelines recommend letrozole as first-line pharmacologic therapy for anovulatory infertility due to higher ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates compared with clomiphene, with no increase in multiple pregnancy or OHSS, and they do not endorse routine combination of clomiphene and letrozole as first-line therapy. ASRM guidance similarly supports oral agents with IUI for unexplained infertility but does not recommend routine combination of oral agents with conventional-dose gonadotropins due to multiple gestation risk, underscoring a conservative stance toward polypharmacy in ovulation induction [^111pkfgU] [^112YVDhs] [^114ZNuQu].

> Now, I will examine the direct evidence for combining clomiphene and letrozole. A randomized controlled trial in women with PCOS showed that letrozole 2.5 mg plus clomiphene 50 mg on cycle days 3–7 increased ovulation rates to 77% versus 43% with letrozole alone, with no serious adverse events or multiple gestations in that single-cycle study. A triple-blind RCT reported a similar absolute increase in ovulation favoring the combination, again in a single cycle, but neither trial was powered for live birth, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting ovulation surrogates as reproductive success [^114DcdU4] [^112LaK2R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check whether improved ovulation translated into better pregnancy outcomes. A multicenter randomized trial in IUI cycles suggested higher chemical, clinical, and ongoing pregnancy and live birth with the combination compared with either agent alone, but the protocol included gonadotropins starting day 8, so the contribution of the oral combination versus the added gonadotropins cannot be cleanly disentangled; thus, while promising, this does not isolate the effect of clomiphene plus letrozole without gonadotropins on live birth outcomes [^112YXHNM].

> I should confirm safety signals next. Letrozole alone has a lower multiple gestation rate than clomiphene in large comparative datasets, and the NEJM PCOS trial showed fewer multiples with letrozole versus clomiphene, although the difference did not reach statistical significance; importantly, the single-cycle combination RCTs did not report multiple gestations, but they were underpowered for this rare outcome, so the multiple pregnancy risk of the combination remains uncertain and could plausibly exceed that of letrozole monotherapy if more than one follicle matures, necessitating careful follicle monitoring and strict cancellation policies when risk is elevated [^114NsMUs] [^116r9DkU] [^114DcdU4] [^112LaK2R].

> Let me consider guideline-concordant sequencing. For anovulatory PCOS, first-line is letrozole. If ovulation fails or there is no pregnancy after a reasonable number of cycles, second-line options include gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian drilling, with IVF as third-line when other therapies fail. None of these pathways currently embed routine clomiphene–letrozole co-administration as standard care, reinforcing that combination therapy should be reserved for select scenarios or research contexts rather than routine practice [^111pkfgU] [^112YVDhs].

> But wait, what if the patient is clomiphene resistant. In clomiphene-resistant PCOS, letrozole is effective and is a recommended alternative; a small randomized trial in clomiphene-resistant women showed higher ovulation and pregnancy with letrozole versus higher-dose clomiphene, supporting a switch to letrozole rather than layering clomiphene back in, although isolated reports and small series have explored combination strategies in resistant cases; given the limited evidence, if combination is considered, it should be framed as off-label and experimental with explicit counseling and close monitoring [^1112Kr62] [^115qXcuZ] [^114mFKFb].

> I need to ensure I address unexplained infertility appropriately. For unexplained infertility, guidelines recommend oral agent–IUI as an initial empiric approach, but they advise against combining oral agents with conventional-dose gonadotropins due to increased multiple gestation without consistent superiority; moreover, oral agents with timed intercourse are not superior to expectant management, so adding clomiphene to letrozole for unexplained infertility lacks supportive evidence and could increase risk without proven benefit [^114ZNuQu] [^1116YprG].

> Next, I should review IVF contexts. In IVF, adding letrozole or clomiphene can reduce gonadotropin requirements and OHSS risk, but effects on live birth are mixed and often neutral overall. A Cochrane review found reduced OHSS with oral agents plus gonadotropins versus gonadotropins alone without a clear live birth advantage, and contemporary OHSS prevention guidance supports considering oral agents to lower gonadotropin dose, but this is not the same as combining two oral ovulation agents for ovulation induction in non-IVF cycles [^114vMyiv] [^113wBSJu] [^112HXY6a].

> Let me synthesize and double-check the bottom line. Routine first-line use of clomiphene plus letrozole is not guideline-supported; letrozole alone remains the preferred first-line agent for anovulatory PCOS, and unexplained infertility care favors oral agent–IUI without routine combination therapy. Combination clomiphene–letrozole may increase ovulation rates in small RCTs, but evidence for live birth benefit is limited, and the multiple gestation risk is uncertain; therefore, if considered at all, it should be in select cases such as clomiphene resistance or research settings, with explicit off-label counseling, ultrasound monitoring, and a low threshold to cancel cycles with excessive follicular development [^111pkfgU] [^114ZNuQu] [^114DcdU4] [^112LaK2R].

> Finally, I should confirm practical counseling points. Before any ovulation induction, exclude pregnancy, optimize preconception health, and discuss off-label status where applicable. During stimulation, use ultrasound monitoring to guide timing and mitigate multiple gestation risk, and consider luteal phase support when indicated, recognizing that evidence for progesterone supplementation improving live birth is uncertain though it may modestly increase clinical pregnancy in some contexts. These steps align with international PCOS guidance and general infertility best practices [^115fUtFh] [^114NsMUs] [^116xaW2Y].

In select cases of **clomiphene-resistant PCOS** [^1112Kr62], combining clomiphene citrate and letrozole can **increase ovulation and pregnancy rates** compared with letrozole alone [^114DcdU4] [^112LaK2R], with no significant increase in multiple gestation in small RCTs [^114DcdU4]. This strategy is **not first-line** [^111pkfgU] and should be reserved for patients who do not respond to standard letrozole therapy [^notfound], with careful monitoring to limit multiple pregnancy risk [^114NsMUs]. There is no evidence of pharmacologic interaction between the two drugs [^111VQfC5], but long-term safety data for the combination are limited; therefore, use should be individualized and guided by a fertility specialist.

---

## Mechanisms of action and potential synergistic effects

Clomiphene citrate is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that **blocks estrogen receptors** in the hypothalamus, increases GnRH, and stimulates FSH and LH to promote follicular development. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor that **reduces estrogen synthesis**, increases GnRH, and raises FSH to stimulate follicular development. Together, they may act synergistically to enhance follicular development and ovulation, particularly in patients with clomiphene resistance [^114DcdU4].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting combination therapy

Several studies have evaluated the combination of clomiphene citrate and letrozole for ovulation induction, particularly in women with PCOS or clomiphene resistance:

- **RCT by Legro et al. (2019)**: In women with PCOS, the combination of letrozole and clomiphene citrate resulted in a significantly higher ovulation rate (77% vs. 43%) compared to letrozole alone, with no significant difference in multiple gestation rates or serious adverse events [^114DcdU4].

- **Triple-blind RCT (2023)**: Similar findings were reported, with the combination therapy achieving higher ovulation rates (73% vs. 38%) compared to letrozole alone, without significant differences in multiple gestation rates or adverse events [^112LaK2R].

- **Systematic review and meta-analysis (2023)**: Letrozole alone was associated with higher ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates compared to clomiphene citrate alone, but the combination therapy was not extensively studied. The review emphasized the need for more robust evidence on combination therapy [^1118zaQw].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

While combination therapy has shown promising results in terms of ovulation and pregnancy rates, several safety considerations must be addressed:

- **Multiple gestation**: Although small RCTs have not shown a significant increase in multiple gestation rates, the risk cannot be entirely excluded, especially given the synergistic mechanism of action of the two drugs [^114DcdU4].

- **Long-term safety**: There is limited data on the long-term safety of combination therapy, particularly regarding fetal outcomes and maternal health. Further research is needed to establish the safety profile of this approach [^notfound].

- **Off-label use**: Both clomiphene citrate and letrozole are used off-label for ovulation induction in many countries, and patients should be informed of this status and the potential risks involved [^115fUtFh].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **do not universally endorse** the routine use of combination therapy with clomiphene citrate and letrozole. Letrozole is recommended as **first-line therapy** for ovulation induction in women with PCOS due to its superior efficacy and safety profile compared to clomiphene citrate [^111pkfgU] [^1144Bmsa]. Combination therapy may be considered in **select cases** of clomiphene resistance or repeated failure with letrozole alone, but it should be approached cautiously and with careful monitoring [^115mqjET].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision-making

The decision to use combination therapy should be individualized based on several patient-specific factors:

| **Factor** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger patients may have a better response to combination therapy, while older patients may require more aggressive interventions. |
| BMI | Obesity may reduce the efficacy of ovulation induction therapies, including clomiphene citrate and letrozole. |
| Ovarian reserve | Patients with diminished ovarian reserve may require alternative approaches, such as gonadotropins or IVF. |
| Previous treatment history | Patients with clomiphene resistance or repeated failure with letrozole alone may benefit from combination therapy. |
| Patient preferences | Shared decision-making is essential, considering patient values, preferences, and tolerance for risk. |

---

## Alternative treatments and adjunctive therapies

If combination therapy with clomiphene citrate and letrozole is not effective or appropriate, **alternative treatments** include:

- **Gonadotropins**: Effective second-line therapy for ovulation induction, particularly in patients with clomiphene or letrozole resistance [^1148p9tW].

- **Metformin**: May be used as an adjunctive therapy, particularly in patients with insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome [^111Jtqeu].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, dietary changes, and exercise can improve ovulation and pregnancy outcomes, particularly in patients with obesity or metabolic syndrome [^114WvnZj].

- **Assisted reproductive technologies (ART)**: In vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be considered in patients who fail to respond to ovulation induction therapies [^111Fq7kH].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Combination therapy with clomiphene citrate and letrozole may be considered in select cases of clomiphene resistance or repeated failure with letrozole alone, as it has been shown to increase ovulation and pregnancy rates in small RCTs. However, **this approach is not first-line**, and careful monitoring is essential to mitigate risks such as multiple gestation. Long-term safety data are limited, and further research is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of combination therapy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): an interview with richard legro [^116r9DkU]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

You also mentioned earlier about fertility as a problem in women with PCOS, so let us discuss the recent trial that you published in NEJM. This trial compares the use of letrozole and clomiphene for infertility in PCOS. Can you briefly describe the findings of that trial and how you think this might inform future therapies for infertility in women with PCOS?

We performed a double-blind multi-center controlled trial, testing letrozole versus clomiphene for infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The hypothesis was that letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) might be superior for the outcome of live birth. Again, that is what patients who are infertile want: a live birth. We thought an aromatase inhibitor might recruit fewer follicles than clomiphene. Clomiphene is an infertility drug associated with an eight-to-ten-fold increased risk of multiple pregnancies. Certainly from a public health perspective, given the morbidity – especially from pre-term delivery of multiple pregnancies – this was definitely an outcome we wanted to avoid. There also were data showing that an aromatase inhibitor might have more favorable effects on the endometrium and aid implantation after ovulation.

In our trial, we showed that women who used letrozole had a 44 percent greater chance of a live birth compared to clomiphene. This is a fairly significant difference. It is actually about a 10 percent absolute increase in the pregnancy rate in women who had undergone our treatment, which was five cycles of treatment with either clomiphene citrate or letrozole. Indeed, while not significant, we found that the multiple pregnancy rate was 7.4 percent with clomiphene and 3.9 percent with letrozole. This was a secondary outcome and, while it was not significant, one needs a trial that was probably about five times as big to detect that difference in rate. However, we are optimistic that lowering the multiple pregnancy rate might be a beneficial side-effect of letrozole.

### Treatment strategies for women with WHO group II anovulation: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113g3eGe]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Multiple pregnancy — Eighteen trials assessed the outcome multiple pregnancy. When expressed per woman randomised, follicle stimulating hormone led to higher multiple pregnancy rates than metformin (odds ratio 16.17, 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 165.54). This difference remained significant in network meta-analysis including predictive intervals. Follicle stimulating hormone also led to a higher rate of multiple pregnancy when compared with letrozole (7.22, 1.00 to 51.84). Metformin (0.22, 0.05 to 0.93) led to lower rates of multiple pregnancy compared with clomiphene alone, but these differences were not significant in network meta-analysis including predictive intervals (appendix 18).

Follicle stimulating hormone had the highest surface under the cumulative ranking curve value (90%), followed by clomiphene (65%), tamoxifen (61%), placebo (47%), clomiphene and metformin combined (41%), letrozole (33%), and metformin (11%; appendix 19).

Further details of the analyses of the secondary outcomes are presented in appendices 20–32.

Sensitivity analysis results

When analyses were restricted to studies reporting clinical pregnancy (appendix 33), the results were consistent with the main findings: letrozole and the combination of clomiphene and metformin were superior to clomiphene alone. However, in studies with treatment naive women or studies with low risk of both randomisation and allocation bias, letrozole remained superior to clomiphene (odds ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.70; 1.97, 1.18 to 3.30; respectively), while the difference between clomiphene and metformin combined and clomiphene alone was not significant (1.65, 0.98 to 2.80; 1.57, 0.96 to 2.57; respectively) (appendices 34 and 35).

4.3 Pharmacotherapy

When anovulatory infertility occurs in women with PCOS and/or obesity, lifestyle changes are strongly suggested. In fact, well‐balanced glycemic status in patients with obesity and/or PCOS is strictly related to lifestyle changes; in this regard, educational therapy represents an important approach.

Clomiphene citrate (CC) is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, and along with letrozole, is the most common medication used for the treatment of subfertility in PCOS anovulatory women. It acts stimulating pituitary gonadotropins secretion through GnRH release, but some adverse effects such as negative changes in the endometrium and cervical mucus might impair the implantation after successful induction of ovulation. These adverse effects lead to a smaller pregnancy rate, approximately 18%, considering the high ovulation rate. The first‐line treatment suggested by guidelines is letrozole, which is considered a better alternative for ovulation induction, including higher pregnancy rates, shorter time to pregnancy and less chances of multiple pregnancy, but the combination of CC and letrozole seems to be even superior to letrozole alone. Opposite to CC, letrozole has no antioestrogenic effects on the endometrium, it has a short half‐life and causes a late follicular rise in circulating oestrogens following endometrial development, leading to better pregnancy rates, shorter FSH window with subsequent mono‐ovulation. It has been suggested that in the case of CC resistance, in 20%−25% of patients, letrozole and gonadotropins could be more effective options. Women with PCOS tend to have a high prevalence of IR in the majority of cases, but higher CC resistance is likely, too. Current evidence supports no difference in miscarriage rates between letrozole and CC.

### Letrozole compared with clomiphene citrate for unexplained infertility: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111VDHLd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the clinical effectiveness, as determined by positive pregnancy test, of letrozole compared with clomiphene citrate for ovarian stimulation in patients with unexplained infertility.

Data Sources

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from electronic databases including Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Methods

We searched for concepts of unexplained infertility, letrozole, clomiphene citrate, and clinical outcomes including pregnancy and live birth. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing clomiphene citrate with letrozole in patients with unexplained infertility. Eight RCTs including 2,647 patients with unexplained infertility were included. Primary outcome was positive pregnancy test per patient. Secondary outcomes included positive pregnancy test per cycle, clinical pregnancy, live birth, spontaneous miscarriage, twin gestation, mean serum estradiol (E2), endometrial thickness, and number of dominant follicles. The Cochrane Q test and Higgin's I were used to assess heterogeneity. Random effects models were used to obtain pooled relative risks (RR) and 95% CIs.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

In analysis per patient, there was no significant difference in positive pregnancy test between patients treated with letrozole compared with clomiphene citrate (24% vs 23%, pooled RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85–1.36). Significant heterogeneity was noted between studies (I = 60.8%). There were no significant differences in clinical pregnancy (pooled RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.71–1.85), live birth (pooled RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.08), spontaneous miscarriage (pooled RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61–1.38), or twin gestation (pooled RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.39–1.68). Mean serum E2 was significantly lower in the letrozole group than in the clomiphene citrate group.

Conclusion

Although limited by heterogeneity, studies of ovarian stimulation in women with unexplained infertility show no difference in clinical outcomes between letrozole and clomiphene citrate.

### Gonadotropins for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^1148p9tW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Ovulation induction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a second-line treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who do not ovulate or conceive on clomiphene citrate or letrozole, though induction protocols and types of gonadotropins used vary greatly.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of gonadotropins as a second-line treatment for ovulation induction in women with PCOS who do not ovulate or conceive after clomiphene citrate or letrozole.

Search Methods

In March 2024, we searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We checked references of all relevant studies. We had no language or date restrictions.

Eligibility Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting data on clinical outcomes in women with PCOS who did not ovulate or conceive on clomiphene citrate or letrozole, and were undergoing ovulation induction with urinary-derived gonadotropins, including urofollitropin in purified FSH (uFSH) or highly purified FSH (HP-FSH) form, human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) and highly purified human menopausal gonadotropin (HP-HMG), or recombinant FSH (rFSH) were eligible. We included trials reporting on ovulation induction followed by intercourse or intrauterine insemination. We excluded studies that described co-treatment with clomiphene citrate, metformin, luteinising hormone, or letrozole.

Outcomes

We implemented the core outcome set for infertility. Our critical outcomes were live birth rate and multiple pregnancy rate per woman. Important outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy loss, incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per woman, total gonadotropin dose, total duration of stimulation per woman, gestational age at birth, birthweight, neonatal mortality, and major congenital anomaly.

Risk Of Bias

We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess bias in the included studies.

Synthesis Methods

Where meta-analysis was possible, we combined data using a fixed-effect model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference. We summarised the overall certainty of evidence for the main outcomes using GRADE criteria.

Included Studies

We included 15 studies with 2348 women. Ten trials compared rFSH with urinary-derived gonadotropins (one compared rFSH with human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG), and nine compared rFSH with urinary FSH). Three trials compared HMG with purified FSH (uFSH). One trial compared HP-FSH with purified FSH (uFSH) and one trial compared gonadotropins with continued clomiphene citrate.

Synthesis Of Results

Recombinant FSH (rFSH) versus urinary-derived gonadotropins There may be little or no difference in the birth rate between rFSH and urinary-derived gonadotropins (RR 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.78; 5 RCTs, 505 participants; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the observed average live birth per woman who used urinary-derived gonadotropins is 16%, the chance of live birth with rFSH is between 13% and 28%. There may be little or no difference between groups in multiple pregnancy (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.61; 8 RCTs, 1368 participants; low-certainty evidence), clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.27; 8 RCTs, 1330 participants; low-certainty evidence), or miscarriage rate (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.04; 7 RCTs, 970 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether rFSH reduces ectopic pregnancy (RR 2.81, 95% CI 0.12 to 67.90; 1 RCT, 151 participants; very-low certainty evidence) or the incidence of OHSS (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.65; 10 RCTs, 1565 participants; very low-certainty evidence) when compared to urinary-derived gonadotropins. Human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) versus purified urinary FSH (uFSH) When compared to uFSH, we are uncertain whether HMG improves live birth rate (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.76; 2 RCTs, 79 participants), or reduces multiple pregnancy (RR 6.56, 95% CI 0.28 to 152.45; 3 RCTs, 102 participants). We are also uncertain whether HMG improves clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.59; 3 RCTs, 102 participants), reduces miscarriage rate (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.97; 2 RCTs, 98 participants), or reduces the incidence of OHSS (RR 7.07, 95% CI 0.42 to 117.81; 2 RCTs, 53 participants) when compared to uFSH. No trials reported on ectopic pregnancy. The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. Gonadotropins versus continued clomiphene citrate Gonadotropins (FSH) probably result in more live births than continued clomiphene citrate (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.46; 1 RCT, 661 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that for a woman with a live birth rate of 41% with continued clomiphene citrate, the live birth rate with gonadotropins was between 43% and 60%. There may be little or no difference in multiple pregnancy between treatments (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.44; 1 RCT, 661 participants; low-certainty evidence). Gonadotropins probably result in more clinical pregnancies than continued clomiphene citrate (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.52; 1 RCT, 661 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and may result in more miscarriages (RR 2.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.47; 1 RCT, 661 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in ectopic pregnancy between the groups (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.77; 1 RCT, 661 participants; very low-certainty evidence). None of the women developed OHSS. The main limitations were imprecision, inconsistency, and indirectness.

Authors' Conclusions

There may be little or no difference in live birth, multiple pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, or miscarriage rates between rFSH and uFSH in women with PCOS. For HMG versus uFSH, we are uncertain whether one or the other improves or lowers rates of live birth, multiple pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, or miscarriage. We are uncertain whether any of the interventions reduce ectopic pregnancy or the incidence of OHSS. In women with clomiphene citrate failure, gonadotropins (FSH) probably result in more live births and clinical pregnancies than continued clomiphene citrate without increasing multiple pregnancies. Gonadotropins may increase the miscarriage rate per woman. We are uncertain if gonadotropins reduce ectopic pregnancy. None of the women developed OHSS.

### Randomized controlled trial comparing superovulation with letrozole versus recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone combined with intrauterine insemination for couples with unexplained infertility who had failed clomiphene citrate stimulation and intrauterine insemination [^1165t3fk]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of letrozole to recombinant FSH for ovarian stimulation combined with IUI in a group of patients that had failed to conceive after clomiphene citrate (CC) and IUI.

Design

Prospective randomized trial with human subjects.

Setting

University-based fertility center.

Patient(S)

Fifty couples with unexplained infertility that failed to conceive after three cycles of CC combined to IUI.

Intervention(S)

Couples were randomized to undergo superovulation either with letrozole or with recombinant FSH combined to IUI.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical pregnancy per cycle of treatment and clinical pregnancy per couple.

Result(S)

Pregnancy rate (PR) per cycle was 8.9% in the letrozole group as compared with 14% in the gonadotropin IUI group. This resulted in a cumulative PR per couple of 24% versus 36% and a take home baby rate of 20% versus 28%. Endometrial thickness was significantly lower in the letrozole group (7.1 ± 2.3 vs 8.6 ± 1.8).

Conclusion(S)

Ovarian stimulation with letrozole is associated with acceptable PRs compared with gonadotropin with significant less cost, risks, and patient inconvenience.

### Predictors of response to ovulation induction using letrozole in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^112S2ki6]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous condition affecting approximately 20% of women worldwide and accounting for approximately 80% of cases of anovulatory infertility in women. The mechanisms causing ovarian follicular arrest are complex, and the exact pathogenesis remains unknown. Ovulation induction is the first-line treatment among infertile women with PCOS, but the responses vary according to different ovarian stimulation protocols or different dosages of the same drug. As personalized medicine, an advancing and accurate treatment, is expected, it is vital to identify the specific characteristics of PCOS patients and make accurate treatment plans.

Letrozole (LET), an aromatase inhibitor, has been recommended as a first-line therapy for anovulatory PCOS, which prevents the aromatase-induced conversion of androgens to estrogens, increases the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and stimulates ovarian follicle development and maturation. A meta-analysis showed that LET was better than clomiphene, the previous first-line agent, for ovulation rate per patient, pregnancy rate per patient, and live birth rate per patient. Also, LET resistance rates and multiple pregnancy rates appear lower with LET versus clomiphene.

Usually, the starting dose of LET is 2.5 mg/day for 5 days (usually starting on day 3 of the cycle). The dose of LET should be increased to 5 mg and then 7.5 mg/day in subsequent cycles in cases of absent ovarian response. Using this approach, 49.4%~83.8% of patients ovulated in response to 2.5 mg LET. Higher dosage of LET may be needed for those un-responsive to 2.5 mg. Patients who ovulated with a higher dosage of LET would take longer to conceive and their compliance would be affected, especially for women of advanced age. Thus, predicting the possible doses of LET in different PCOS patients using their screening characteristics before ovulation induction may increase the effectiveness of treatment.

The objective of this study was to identify whether the pre-treatment characteristics reflecting the reproductive ability of PCOS patients had the predictive value for their ovarian response to the minimal ovulation doses of LET.

### Treatment strategies for women with WHO group II anovulation: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116bHC25]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Summary of key findings

Our systematic review and network meta-analysis on ovulation induction in infertile women with WHO group II anovulation has three key findings. Firstly, all pharmacological treatments were more effective than placebo or no intervention in terms of achieving ovulation and pregnancy. Secondly, the combination of clomiphene and metformin as well as letrozole on its own were superior to clomiphene in terms of pregnancy, and letrozole was superior to clomiphene in terms of live birth. Lastly, metformin was associated with a lower risk of multiple pregnancy when compared with clomiphene.

Strengths and limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first application of network meta-analysis in ovulation induction, analysing all the available data and providing a unique opportunity to rank ovulation induction treatments in one pooled analysis. We reported all major reproductive outcomes in infertility trials and performed sensitivity analyses in different dimensions, including study population and study quality. We made these attempts to guarantee the stability of the results. Another strength of our systematic review was the fact that we did not exclude non-English articles or trials published as abstracts only. These trials are often excluded from other meta-analyses, but in our meta-analysis they contributed 21% (12/57) of studies and 16% (1321/8082) of women. Therefore, we believe that our analysis included all relevant published randomised controlled trials on ovulation induction in WHO group II anovulation, thus reducing publication bias as much as possible.

### In vitro fertilisation for unexplained subfertility [^113zVjfp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a treatment for unexplained subfertility but is invasive, expensive, and associated with risks.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IVF versus expectant management, unstimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI), and IUI with ovarian stimulation using gonadotropins, clomiphene citrate (CC), or letrozole in improving pregnancy outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched following databases from inception to November 2021, with no language restriction: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL. We searched reference lists of articles and conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing effectiveness of IVF for unexplained subfertility with expectant management, unstimulated IUI, and stimulated IUI.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

IVF versus expectant management (two RCTs) We are uncertain whether IVF improves live birth rate (LBR) and clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) compared to expectant management (odds ratio (OR) 22.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.56 to 189.37; 1 RCT; 51 women; very low-quality evidence; OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 9.8; 2 RCTs; 86 women; I² = 80%; very low-quality evidence). Adverse effects were not reported. Assuming 4% LBR and 12% CPR with expectant management, these would be 8.8% to 9% and 13% to 58% with IVF. IVF versus unstimulated IUI (two RCTs) IVF may improve LBR compared to unstimulated IUI (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 5.12; 2 RCTs; 156 women; I² = 60%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there is a difference between IVF and IUI for multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.04 to 27.29; 1 RCT; 43 women; very low-quality evidence) and miscarriage rate (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.14 to 21.25; 1 RCT; 43 women; very low-quality evidence). No study reported ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Assuming 16% LBR, 3% MPR, and 6% miscarriage rate with unstimulated IUI, these outcomes would be 18.5% to 49%, 0.1% to 46%, and 0.9% to 58% with IVF. IVF versus IUI + ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (6 RCTs), CC (1 RCT), or letrozole (no RCTs) Stratified analysis was based on pretreatment status. Treatment-naive women There may be little or no difference in LBR between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles: OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.61; 3 RCTs; 731 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence; 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle: OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.92; 2 RCTs; 221 women; I² = 54%; low-quality evidence); or between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 2.51, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.55; 1 RCT; 103 women; low-quality evidence). Assuming 42% LBR with IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles) and 26% LBR with IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle), LBR would be 39% to 54% and 24% to 51% with IVF. Assuming 15% LBR with IUI + CC, LBR would be 15% to 54% with IVF. There may be little or no difference in CPR between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles: OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.59; 3 RCTs; 731 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence; 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle: OR 4.59, 95% CI 1.86 to 11.35; 1 RCT; 103 women; low-quality evidence); or between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.51 to 8.49; 1 RCT; 103 women; low-quality evidence). Assuming 48% CPR with IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles) and 17% with IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle), CPR would be 44% to 60% and 28% to 70% with IVF. Assuming 21% CPR with IUI + CC, CPR would be 29% to 69% with IVF. There may be little or no difference in multiple pregnancy rate (MPR) between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins (1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles: OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.77; 3 RCTs; 731 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence; 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle: OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.58; 2 RCTs; 221 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence); or between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.41; 1 RCT; 102 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in OHSS between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins with 1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles (OR 6.86, 95% CI 0.35 to 134.59; 1 RCT; 207 women; very low-quality evidence); and there may be little or no difference in OHSS with 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.16; 2 RCTs; 221 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.24 to 9.57; 1 RCT; 102 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in miscarriage rate between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins with 1 IVF to 2 to 3 IUI cycles (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.04; 1 RCT; 207 women; very low-quality evidence); and there may be little or no difference with 1 IVF to 1 IUI cycle (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.02; 1 RCT; 103 women; low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.05; 1 RCT; 102 women; low-quality evidence). In women pretreated with IUI + CC IVF may improve LBR compared with IUI + gonadotropins (OR 3.90, 95% CI 2.32 to 6.57; 1 RCT; 280 women; low-quality evidence). Assuming 22% LBR with IUI + gonadotropins, LBR would be 39% to 65% with IVF. IVF may improve CPR compared with IUI + gonadotropins (OR 14.13, 95% CI 7.57 to 26.38; 1 RCT; 280 women; low-quality evidence). Assuming 30% CPR with IUI + gonadotropins, CPR would be 76% to 92% with IVF.

Authors' Conclusions

IVF may improve LBR over unstimulated IUI. Data should be interpreted with caution as overall evidence quality was low.

### Letrozole compared with clomiphene citrate for polycystic ovarian syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118zaQw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To estimate the effect of letrozole and clomiphene citrate in women with infertility and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Methods Of Study Selection

MEDLINE through PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for relevant studies from inception to February 1, 2022. Two reviewers retrieved, filtered, and extracted data independently using the bibliographic software EndNote X9 and Excel workbook. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting ovulation induction outcomes in women with infertility and PCOS treated with either letrozole or clomiphene citrate followed by timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination. The data were merged into a mean difference or risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI, depending on variable types.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Data collection and organization were conducted in accordance with the 2020 PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) statement. Twenty-nine RCTs were eligible, which included 3,952 women and 7,633 ovulation induction cycles. We acquired evidence from 22 RCTs for the ovulation rate, 28 RCTs for the clinical pregnancy rate, and eight RCTs for live-birth rate. Pooled analysis indicated that letrozole treatment prevailed against clomiphene citrate in ovulation rate (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06–1.21, P < .001), clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.34–1.63, P < .001), and live-birth rate (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.27–1.74, P < .001).

Conclusions

Letrozole was associated with improved ovulation, pregnancy, and live-birth rates compared with clomiphene citrate. We recommend letrozole over clomiphene citrate as an ovulation induction drug in women with infertility and PCOS, although the quality of the evidence is mixed.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113xdTro]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: evidence-based recommendations (EBR) = 31, clinical consensus recommendations (CCR) = 59, and clinical practice points (CPP) = 76. Overall evidence is of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criteria are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed, and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low-dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role, alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 738: aromatase inhibitors in gynecologic practice [^112JY3hQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors have been used for the treatment of breast cancer, ovulation induction, endometriosis, and other estrogen-modulated conditions. For women with breast cancer, bone mineral density screening is recommended with long-term aromatase inhibitor use because of the risk of osteoporosis due to estrogen deficiency. Based on long-term adverse effects and complication safety data, when compared with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors are associated with a reduced incidence of thrombosis, endometrial cancer, and vaginal bleeding. For women with polycystic ovary syndrome and a body mass index greater than 30, letrozole should be considered first-line therapy for ovulation induction because of the increased live birth rate compared with clomiphene citrate. Lifestyle changes that result in weight loss should be strongly encouraged. Aromatase inhibitors are a promising therapeutic option that may be helpful for the management of endometriosis-associated pain in combination therapy with progestins.

### Does the additional use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole for in vitro fertilization deserve more attention? [^112RMMo3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS), one of the key processes of assisted reproductive technology, increases the number of oocytes and embryos in the cycle and the pregnancy rate. Classic gonadotropin (Gn) injections brought great economic and psychological pressure to patients, so the combined oral medicine program sprung up. Clomiphene citrate, competitively binds to estrogen receptors, to inhibit the negative feedback of estrogen to the hypothalamus and pituitary, promoting the release of endogenic FSH to promote follicle development. Letrozole blocks estrogen synthesis by inhibiting aromatase activity, lowering its level in the blood. At the same time, it can block the conversion of androgens to estrogen at ovarian levels, and result in a short build-up of androgens in the ovaries. The accumulated androgens can also improve the ovary's hormone response through the IGF-1 system at the outer weekly level.

The oral medications were previously used to induct ovulation, and were gradually replaced by FSH in pursuit of follicle averaging until the idea of micro/mild stimulation was proposed. Evidently, mild strategy has been being paid much attention because of its economic friendliness and convenience. Since then, a large number of explorations have been made. One group of experts tried to make it easier for clinicians on ISMAAR meeting, where several terminologies were adopted internationally in 2007 but could not take into account the individual differences caused by age, ovarian reservation, BMI, etc. Nargund, Zegers-Hochschild et al. intended to limit the number of retrieved ova to fewer than eight for mild ovarian simulation IVF, because the less retrieved ova means the lower the risk of happening OHSS. Many studies have limited the use of Gn to 150 IU/d for mild stimulation/ minimal stimulation. Actually, mild stimulation still seems to be a vague concept without a strict criterion worldwide.

Oral medications experienced a long but significant process on ovulation induction, from single medicine for five consecutive days to a combination with Gn/HMG. Many studies often revealed the dilemma of choosing the particular protocol or a single population most likely to result in a partial assessment, as oral medication cycle becomes increasingly more universal. Our study retrospectively analyzed 2724 patients who were treated by IVF-ET in reproductive medicine center of Shijiazhuang fourth Hospital from January 2017 to December 2018. To obtain data for clinical practices, we classified them according to whether they were proposed CC/LE in the process of ovulation induction. We ultimately got the clinical and laboratory outcomes.

### In vitro fertilization treatments with the use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole [^1125Wp6Q]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

There has been increasing interest in combining the oral agents clomiphene citrate (CC) and letrozole with gonadotropins in IVF: for poor responders to reduce the amount of gonadotropins used, and in normal responders to reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation (OHSS). In normal responders, mild stimulation with the use of CC and gonadotropins was found to decrease the number of oocytes retrieved and result in good pregnancy rates, but in most studies the cumulative pregnancy rate was lower compared with conventional ovarian stimulation when frozen embryo transfers were considered. Coadministration of letrozole and gonadotropins has mainly been used in patients with breast cancer to prevent the massive elevation of serum E₂ concentrations with the use of standard controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. CC and letrozole have both been used with gonadotropins in poor responders and have been shown to reduce the amount of gonadotropin used without reducing the pregnancy rate. Letrozole use with gonadotropins in IVF cycles may increase endometrial receptivity by increasing integrin expression in the endometrium and by lowering estrogen concentrations to more physiologic levels.

### Aromatase inhibitors (letrozole) for subfertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115HHFRM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infrequent periods (oligomenorrhoea) and absence of periods (amenorrhoea). It affects about 4% to 8% of women worldwide and often leads to anovulatory subfertility. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a class of drugs that were introduced for ovulation induction in 2001. Since about 2001 clinical trials have reached differing conclusions as to whether the AI letrozole is at least as effective as the first-line treatment clomiphene citrate (CC).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of aromatase inhibitors for subfertile women with anovulatory PCOS for ovulation induction followed by timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI).

Search Methods

We searched the following sources from inception to November 2017 to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs): the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Pubmed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) clinical trials register and Clinicaltrials.gov. We also searched the references of relevant articles. We did not restrict the searches by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs of AIs used alone or with other medical therapies for ovulation induction in women of reproductive age with anovulatory PCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted the data and assessed risks of bias. We pooled studies where appropriate using a fixed-effect model to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for most outcomes, and risk differences (RDs) for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The primary outcomes were live birth and OHSS. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and multiple pregnancy. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison using GRADE methods.

Main Results

This is a substantive update of a previous review. We identified 16 additional studies for the 2018 update. We include 42 RCTs (7935 women). The aromatase inhibitor letrozole was used in all studies. Letrozole compared to clomiphene citrate (CC) with or without adjuncts followed by timed intercourseLive birth rates were higher with letrozole (with or without adjuncts) compared to clomiphene citrate (with our without adjuncts) followed by timed intercourse (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.99; 2954 participants; 13 studies; I² = 0%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 10; moderate-quality evidence). There is high-quality evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or clomiphene citrate (0.5% in both arms: risk difference (RD) -0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.00; 2536 participants; 12 studies; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). There is evidence for a higher pregnancy rate in favour of letrozole (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.78; 4629 participants; 25 studies; I² = 1%; NNTB = 10; moderate-quality evidence). There is little or no difference between treatment groups in the rate of miscarriage by pregnancy (20% with CC versus 19% with letrozole; OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.26; 1210 participants; 18 studies; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence) and multiple pregnancy rate (1.7% with CC versus 1.3% with letrozole; OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.16; 3579 participants; 17 studies; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). However, a funnel plot showed mild asymmetry, indicating that some studies in favour of clomiphene might be missing. Letrozole compared to laparoscopic ovarian drillingThere is low-quality evidence that live birth rates are similar with letrozole or laparoscopic ovarian drilling (OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.02; 548 participants; 3 studies; I² = 23%; low-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence for a difference in OHSS rates (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; 260 participants; 1 study; low-quality evidence). There is low-quality evidence that pregnancy rates are similar (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.74; 774 participants; 5 studies; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence for a difference in miscarriage rate by pregnancy (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.43; 240 participants; 5 studies; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), or multiple pregnancies (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 74.90; 548 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Additional comparisons were made for Letrozole versus placebo, Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), Anastrozole, as well as dosage and administration protocols. There is insufficient evidence for a difference in either group of treatment due to a limited number of studies. Hence more research is necessary.

Authors' Conclusions

Letrozole appears to improve live birth and pregnancy rates in subfertile women with anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome, compared to clomiphene citrate. There is high-quality evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or clomiphene citrate. There is high-quality evidence of no difference in miscarriage rates or multiple pregnancy rates. There is low-quality evidence of no difference in live birth and pregnancy rates between letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian drilling, although there were few relevant studies. For the 2018 update, we added good-quality trials, upgrading the quality of the evidence.

### Letrozole, gonadotropin, or clomiphene for unexplained infertility [^1171jZXD]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The standard therapy for women with unexplained infertility is gonadotropin or clomiphene citrate. Ovarian stimulation with letrozole has been proposed to reduce multiple gestations while maintaining live birth rates.

Methods

We enrolled couples with unexplained infertility in a multicenter, randomized trial. Ovulatory women 18 to 40 years of age with at least one patent fallopian tube were randomly assigned to ovarian stimulation (up to four cycles) with gonadotropin (301 women), clomiphene (300), or letrozole (299). The primary outcome was the rate of multiple gestations among women with clinical pregnancies.

Results

After treatment with gonadotropin, clomiphene, or letrozole, clinical pregnancies occurred in 35.5%, 28.3%, and 22.4% of cycles, and live birth in 32.2%, 23.3%, and 18.7%, respectively; pregnancy rates with letrozole were significantly lower than the rates with standard therapy (gonadotropin or clomiphene) (P = 0.003) or gonadotropin alone (P < 0.001) but not with clomiphene alone (P = 0.10). Among ongoing pregnancies with fetal heart activity, the multiple gestation rate with letrozole (9 of 67 pregnancies, 13%) did not differ significantly from the rate with gonadotropin or clomiphene (42 of 192, 22%; P = 0.15) or clomiphene alone (8 of 85, 9%; P = 0.44) but was lower than the rate with gonadotropin alone (34 of 107, 32%; P = 0.006). All multiple gestations in the clomiphene and letrozole groups were twins, whereas gonadotropin treatment resulted in 24 twin and 10 triplet gestations. There were no significant differences among groups in the frequencies of congenital anomalies or major fetal and neonatal complications.

Conclusions

In women with unexplained infertility, ovarian stimulation with letrozole resulted in a significantly lower frequency of multiple gestation but also a lower frequency of live birth, as compared with gonadotropin but not as compared with clomiphene.

### Clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination compared with expectant management for unexplained infertility: pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^114qo5Yw]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

Spontaneous live birth rates in a randomised cohort of women with unexplained infertility do not seem to be enhanced by common first line treatments — clomifene citrate or unstimulated intrauterine insemination. These results challenge current practice, as endorsed by a national guideline in the UK.

### Does the additional use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole for in vitro fertilization deserve more attention? [^114DXP6d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

According to high responders, one recent study had identified that the addition of LE was prior to without LE group depending on higher metaphase II and fertilized oocytes retrieved and similarly clinical pregnancy rates. However, a reduction of clinical pregnancy rates and live birth rates in letrozole group led the role of LE in ovarian stimulation of high responders to be controversial. In our research, only 2 high response cases used LE alone as additional medication. With the addition of CC, our high response results came from most (91/93) cases along in our study, showing that adding CC to the ovulation process reduced Gn consumptions by 24.5%, without reducing other indicators including clinical pregnancy rate. Overall, CC regimen for high responders is recommended further exploration. It is obvious that current researches on the application of CC / LE in IVF cycle are mainly aimed at patients with normal response and low response, and the benefits of CC in high responders are lacking.

### Letrozole vs. clomiphene citrate in patients with ovulatory infertility [^112FDfBR]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) in ovulatory patients with borderline male factor infertility, early stage endometriosis, and unexplained infertility.

Design

Prospective quasi-randomized trial.

Setting

University infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Forty-six consecutive patients with ovulatory infertility were recruited. Twenty-five patients (67 cycles) were given CC and 21 patients (52 cycles) were given letrozole. Both drugs were given orally on days 3–7 of menses.

Intervention(S)

Letrozole, CC, ovulation induction, IUI, timed intercourse.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Number of follicles, endometrial thickness, and pregnancy rates.

Result(S)

The median serum E2 concentration on the day of hCG administration in the letrozole and CC groups were 191.5 pmol/L and 476.0 pmol/L, respectively. The median endometrial thickness on the day of hCG were 8 mm in both groups. Ovulation occurred in 81% (42/52) of the letrozole-treated and 85% (57/67) of the CC-treated patients. Pregnancy rate (PR) per cycle was 9% (5/52) in the letrozole group and 12% (8/67) in the CC group.

Conclusion(S)

Letrozole and CC have comparable effectiveness in ovulatory patients with borderline male factor infertility, early stage endometriosis, and unexplained infertility.

### Aromatase inhibitors for subfertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^111tYqpz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infrequent periods (oligomenorrhoea) and absence of periods (amenorrhoea). It affects about 4% to 8% of women worldwide and often leads to anovulatory subfertility. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a novel class of drugs that were introduced for ovulation induction in 2001. Over the last ten years clinical trials have reached differing conclusions as to whether the AI letrozole is at least as effective as the first-line treatment clomiphene citrate (CC).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of aromatase inhibitors for subfertile women with anovulatory PCOS.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources from inception to 24/10/2013 to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs): the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Pubmed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organisation (WHO) clinical trials register and Clinicaltrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs of aromatase inhibitors used alone or with other medical therapies for ovulation induction in women of reproductive age with anovulatory PCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted the data and assessed trial quality. Studies were pooled where appropriate using a fixed effect model to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for most outcomes and risk differences (RDs) for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The primary outcomes were live birth and OHSS. Secondary outcomes were pregnancy, miscarriage and multiple pregnancy. The quality of the evidence for each comparison was assessed using GRADE methods.

Main Results

We included 26 RCTs (5560 women). In all studies the aromatase inhibitor was letrozole. Live birth (12 RCTs) One RCT compared letrozole with placebo in women who were clomiphene resistant and the results were inconclusive (OR 3.17, 95% CI 0.12 to 83.17, n = 36)Nine RCTs compared letrozole with clomiphene citrate (with or without adjuncts) followed by timed intercourse. The birth rate was higher in the letrozole group (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.03, n = 1783, I² = 3%)Two RCTs compared letrozole with laparoscopic ovarian drilling. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in live birth rate (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.86, n = 407, I² = 0%) OHSS (16 RCTs) There was no evidence of a difference in OHSS rates when letrozole was compared with placebo (one RCT, n = 36), clomiphene citrate (with or without adjuncts) followed by timed intercourse (nine RCTs, n = 2179), clomiphene citrate (with or without adjuncts) followed by intrauterine insemination (IUI) (two RCTs, n = 1494), laparoscopic ovarian drilling (one RCT, n = 260) or anastrozole (one RCT, n = 220). Events were absent or very rare, and no study had more than 2 cases of OHSS. Clinical pregnancy (25 RCTs) One RCT compared letrozole versus placebo in women who were clomiphene resistant and the results were inconclusive (OR 3.17, 95% CI 0.12 to 83.17, n = 36)Fourteen RCTs compared letrozole versus clomiphene citrate (with or without adjuncts) followed by timed intercourse. The pregnancy rate was higher in the letrozole group (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.60, n = 2066, I² = 25%)Three RCTs compared letrozole versus clomiphene citrate (with or without adjuncts) followed by IUI. The pregnancy rate was higher in the letrozole group (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.25, n = 1597)Three RCTs compared letrozole versus laparoscopic ovarian drilling. There was no evidence of a difference in the clinical pregnancy rate (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.65, n = 553, I² = 0%)Two RCTs compared letrozole versus anastrozole, one RCT compared a five day versus a 10 day administration protocol for letrozole and another RCT compared 5 mg of letrozole versus 7.5 mg of letrozole. There was no evidence of a difference in the clinical pregnancy rate in these comparisons. The quality of the evidence was rated as low for live birth and pregnancy outcomes. The reasons for downgrading the evidence were poor reporting of study methods, possible publication bias and the tendency for studies that reported live birth to report higher clinical pregnancy rates in the letrozole group than studies that failed to report live birth (suggesting that results might be somewhat less favourable to letrozole if all studies reported live birth).

Authors' Conclusions

Letrozole appears to improve live birth and pregnancy rates in subfertile women with anovulatory PCOS, compared to clomiphene citrate. The quality of this evidence is low and findings should be regarded with some caution. There appears to be no difference in effectiveness between letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian drilling, though there were few relevant studies. OHSS was a very rare event, with no occurrences in most studies.

### Does the additional use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole for in vitro fertilization deserve more attention? [^113DUqdo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Participants

Women in 23 ~ 42 years old who had given their consent to ovarian stimulation for IVF-ET or ICSI-ET at this center from January 2017 to December 2018 were concluded. A total of 2724 cycles containing 1409 fresh transplantation cycles were obtained. The infertility years were 1 ~ 13 years. The causes of infertility included pelvic fallopian tube factors, male infertility, endometriosis, ovulation disorders and unexplained infertility. Poor responders were defined as patients whose basal antral follicle count (AFC) were less than five referring to the Bologna Criteria. We classified high responders as patients with 15 and more basal antral follicles, and normal responders as 5 ~ 14 basal antral follicles. The comparison of clinical induction protocols included GnRH-a super long protocol, GnRH-a long protocol, GnRH antagonist protocol, minimal stimulation protocol, natural cycle protocol and so on.

For all participants, outcomes including age, BMI, T-Gn, T-retrieved ova, high quality embryos, cultured blastocyst, blastocysts number, and primary clinical outcomes including clinical pregnancy rate and cumulative pregnancy rate between the two groups with or without oral medication were presented.

For high (n = 573), normal (n = 1215) and poor (n = 727) ovarian responders, the above laboratory and clinical indicators were presented respectively. Moreover, we also analyzed the differences between single CC (n = 604) and single LE (n = 112) additions in laboratory and clinical outcomes.

The occurrence rates in high and normal responders of moderate and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) were detected according to a modern classification.

Group

Conventional group: routine ovulation induction by Gn/HMG, no oral CC or LE. Add group: extra CC and/or LE combined with routine Gn/HMG. Each subgroup (high responder; poor responder; normal responder) was divided into Conventional group and Add group according to the same criteria.

Treatment procedure

In conventional group, the dosages (150 ~ 300 IU/d) of Gn were carried by routine dose according to the patients' age, primary disease, ovarian reserve, body mass index (BMI) and so on.

In add group, we started with CC (or LE), 50–100 mg/d × 5d (2.5 mg/d × 5d) since Day 2–5. The dosages (150 ~ 300 IU/d) of Gn were adjusted according to the patients' different conditions (starting dose, starting time, injection QD/QOD, etc.).

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^113qzYk4]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination (IUI) for unexplained infertility — Ovarian stimulation (OS) with IUI is a mainstay of fertility treatment, and this guideline includes 19 randomized trials, 4 systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials, and 3 cohort studies assessing clomiphene citrate with IUI. Two randomized trials versus expectant management showed benefit: in 201 couples treated over 3 cycles, live-birth rate was 31% vs. 9%, respectively, P = 0.0003, and a strict per-protocol analysis showed 24% vs. 7%, P = 0.05. An intermediate-quality randomized controlled trial found a higher pregnancy rate versus untreated cycles (9.7% vs. 3.3%, respectively, P = 0.049), although live-birth outcome by diagnosis was not reported.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115tkeB2]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations to practicing physicians and others regarding the effectiveness and safety of therapies for unexplained infertility.

Methods

ASRM conducted a literature search, which included systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective comparative observational studies published from 1968 through 2019. The ASRM Practice Committee and a task force of experts used available evidence and informal consensus to develop evidence-based guideline recommendations.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Outcomes of interest included: live-birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate, fertilization rate, multiple pregnancy rate, dose of treatment, rate of ovarian hyperstimulation, abortion rate, and ectopic pregnancy rate.

Result(S)

The literature search identified 88 relevant studies to inform the evidence base for this guideline.

Recommendation(S)

Evidence-based recommendations were developed for the following treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: natural cycle with intrauterine insemination (IUI); clomiphene citrate with intercourse; aromatase inhibitors with intercourse; gonadotropins with intercourse; clomiphene citrate with IUI; aromatase inhibitors with IUI; combination of clomiphene citrate or letrozole and gonadotropins (low dose and conventional dose) with IUI; low-dose gonadotropins with IUI; conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI; timing of IUI; and in vitro fertilization and treatment paradigms.

Conclusion(S)

The treatment of unexplained infertility is by necessity empiric. For most couples, the best initial therapy is a course (typically 3 or 4 cycles) of ovarian stimulation with oral medications and intrauterine insemination (OS-IUI) followed by in vitro fertilization for those unsuccessful with OS-IUI treatments.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1141kA4y]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

3.5–3.6 Values and preferences

The committee believes that a priority should be placed on effective treatment. Although the preferred treatment for prevention of T2DM is diet and lifestyle modification, there are a significant number of women who will fail this option. Although metformin treatment incurs expense and has the potential for side effects, the committee feels that metformin may provide an option for treatment of IGT in those women who fail lifestyle management.

Treatment of infertility

3.7 We recommend clomiphene citrate (or comparable estrogen modulators such as letrozole) as the first-line treatment of anovulatory infertility in women with PCOS (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

3.8 We suggest the use of metformin as an adjuvant therapy for infertility to prevent OHSS in women with PCOS undergoing IVF (2|⊕⊕○○).

3.7–3.8 Evidence

Clomiphene and metformin have been studied extensively for infertility in PCOS with multiple large multicenter trials. In almost all of these, clomiphene has had improved pregnancy rates vs metformin, as well as providing comparable rates to injectable gonadotropins. A recent meta-analysis of insulin sensitizers for the treatment of infertility in PCOS concluded that "the use of metformin for improving reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS appears to be limited". In this review, there was no evidence that metformin improved live birth rates, whether it was used alone (pooled OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.16–6.39) or in combination with clomiphene (pooled OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.75–1.47). Metformin has been recommended for use in infertility treatment partly because it is thought to be associated with monofollicular ovulation and lower multiple pregnancy rates. None of the trials have been adequately powered to detect differences in multiple pregnancy rates, although multiple pregnancies with metformin have been rare in these trials (≤ 5%) and more common (around 5%) with clomiphene. The benefit of multiple pregnancy reduction must be balanced against the substantially lower pregnancy rates and lower fecundity per ovulation with metformin alone.

### Treatment strategies for women with WHO group II anovulation: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116kKdvN]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Research implications

Traditionally, the effectiveness of a new treatment option comes from comparisons with placebo or current standard care. To date, no trials have compared letrozole with placebo in treatment naive women. The current network meta-analysis, however, provides insight in this comparison from indirect comparisons, and suggests that trials comparing letrozole with placebo are unnecessary and in our opinion even unethical. Evidence on a head-to-head comparison between letrozole and the combination of clomiphene and metformin is lacking. Therefore, new trials comparing these two interventions are needed. Future trials should also compare new treatment options or combinations with one of these two strategies to enrich the evidence on first line management of WHO group II anovulation.

Current evidence showed similar miscarriage rates in women with metformin compared with women with other ovulation induction interventions during the periconceptional period. Future studies on metformin use during pregnancy in women with WHO group II anovulation, including PCOS, can be beneficial.

Individual participant data meta-analysis on this topic is a necessary next step to find target populations for different ovulation induction interventions and therefore to provide evidence for personally targeted infertility care.

Clinical implications and conclusion

In women with WHO group II anovulation including anovulatory PCOS, expectant management is not recommended, because pharmacological ovulation induction significantly improves pregnancy rate (odds ratios 2.43–6.11) compared with placebo no treatment in the present study.

Letrozole can be recommended as first line treatment due to its higher ovulation, pregnancy, and live birth rate as well as lower multiple pregnancy rate, although the reluctance to adapt such new therapy is common in clinical practice. The superiority of letrozole over clomiphene was stable in all sensitivity analyses including modifying the criteria of population (treatment naive), reporting strategies (reporting clinical pregnancy) and quality of included studies (low risk of randomisation and allocation bias). Miscarriage is often discussed in the literature especially in women with PCOS, and data in relation to this are controversial. In our study, there were no significant differences in miscarriage rates in different comparisons; therefore, the superiority of letrozole over clomiphene in terms of live birth does not seem to be related to a decreased miscarriage rate.

### Oral medications including clomiphene citrate or aromatase inhibitors with gonadotropins for controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation [^114vMyiv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gonadotropins are the most commonly used medications for controlled ovarian stimulation in in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, they are expensive and invasive, and are associated with the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Recent calls for more patient-friendly regimens have led to growing interest in the use of clomiphene citrate (CC) and aromatase inhibitors with or without gonadotropins to reduce the burden of hormonal injections. It is currently unknown whether regimens using CC or aromatase inhibitors such as letrozole (Ltz) are as effective as gonadotropins alone.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of regimens including oral induction medication (such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole) versus gonadotropin-only regimens for controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register (searched January 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL CRSO), MEDLINE (1946 to January 2017), Embase (1980 to January 2017), and reference lists of relevant articles. We also searched trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov (clinicaltrials.gov/) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx). We handsearched relevant conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcomes were live-birth rate (LBR) and OHSS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and Peto odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We analyzed the general population of women undergoing IVF treatment and (as a separate analysis) women identified as poor responders. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 27 studies in the updated review. Most of the new trials in the updated review included poor responders and evaluated Ltz protocols. We could perform meta-analysis with data from 22 studies including a total of 3599 participants. The quality of the evidence for different comparisons ranged from low to moderate. The main limitations in the quality of the evidence were risk of bias associated with poor reporting of study methods, and imprecision. In the general population of women undergoing IVF, it is unclear whether CC or Ltz used with or without gonadotropins compared to use of gonadotropins along with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists resulted in a difference in live birth (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.27, 4 RCTs, n = 493, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.16, 12 RCTs, n = 1998, I² = 3%, moderate-quality evidence). This means that for a typical clinic with 23% LBR using a GnRH agonist regimen, switching to CC or Ltz protocols would be expected to result in LBRs between 15% and 30%. Clomiphene citrate or Ltz protocols were associated with a reduction in the incidence of OHSS (Peto OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.41, 5 RCTs, n = 1067, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). This means that for a typical clinic with 6% prevalence of OHSS associated with a GnRH regimen, switching to CC or Ltz protocols would be expected to reduce the incidence to between 0.5% and 2.5%. We found evidence of an increase in cycle cancellation rate with the CC protocol compared to gonadotropins in GnRH protocols (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.45, 9 RCTs, n = 1784, I² = 61%, low-quality evidence). There was moderate quality evidence of a decrease in the mean number of ampoules used,) and mean number of oocytes collected with CC with or without gonadotropins compared to the gonadotropins in GnRH agonist protocols, though data were too heterogeneous to pool. Similarly, in the poor-responder population, it is unclear whether there was any difference in rates of live birth (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.79, 2 RCTs, n = 357, I² = 38%, low-quality evidence) or clinical pregnancy (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.12, 8 RCTs, n = 1462, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence) following CC or Ltz with or without gonadotropin versus gonadotropin and GnRH protocol. This means that for a typical clinic with a 5% LBR in the poor responders using a GnRH protocol, switching to CC or Ltz protocols would be expected to yield LBRs between 2% to 14%. There was low quality evidence that the CC or Ltz protocols were associated with an increase in the cycle cancellation rate (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.81, 10 RCTs, n = 1601, I² = 64%) and moderate quality evidence of a decrease in the mean number of gonadotropin ampoules used and the mean number of oocytes collected, though data were too heterogeneous to pool. The adverse effects of these protocols were poorly reported. In addition, data on foetal abnormalities following use of CC or Ltz protocols are lacking.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence indicating that clomiphene citrate or letrozole with or without gonadotropins differed from gonadotropins in GnRH agonist or antagonist protocols with respect to their effects on live-birth or pregnancy rates, either in the general population of women undergoing IVF treatment or in women who were poor responders. Use of clomiphene or letrozole led to a reduction in the amount of gonadotropins required and the incidence of OHSS. However, use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole may be associated with a significant increase in the incidence of cycle cancellations, as well as reductions in the mean number of oocytes retrieved in both the general IVF population and the poor responders. Larger, high-quality randomized trials are needed to reach a firm conclusion before they are adopted into routine clinical practice.

### Treatment strategies for women with WHO group II anovulation: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116AJdA7]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Ovulation — For the outcome ovulation per woman randomised, 38 randomised controlled trials were included in the network meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, all interventions except for laparoscopic ovarian drilling led to a significantly higher ovulation rate. These associations remained similar in the network meta-analysis including predictive intervals.

Letrozole (odds ratio 2.00, 95% confidence interval 1.39 to 2.88) led to a higher ovulation rate than clomiphene alone (appendix 14). The combination of clomiphene and metformin was superior to metformin alone (2.50, 1.43 to 4.36), while metformin was inferior to clomiphene alone (0.57, 0.36 to 0.92). Metformin (0.29, 0.16 to 0.51) was inferior to letrozole.

Follicle stimulating hormone had the highest surface under the cumulative ranking curve value (87%) in terms of ovulation, followed by letrozole (86%), clomiphene and metformin combined (70%), clomiphene (50%), tamoxifen (42%), laparoscopic ovarian drilling (38%), metformin (24%), and placebo or no treatment (1%; appendix 15).

Miscarriage — For the outcome miscarriage, after the exclusion of trials with 0% or 100% event rates in all interventions, we included 25 randomised controlled trials in the network meta-analysis. We did not find any significant difference between each comparison in terms of miscarriage per woman randomised or miscarriage per pregnancy in the network meta-analysis (appendices 16 and 17).

### A historical perspective of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction [^112rizyM]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Low credibility.

The concept of using aromatase inhibitors in place of clomiphene citrate (CC) for ovulation induction was introduced > 10 years ago; a brief history of its development is presented. Its worldwide usage for ovulation induction, including as an adjunct for intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization has occurred despite the absence of definitive data of superiority to CC. The results of two ongoing potentially definitive multicenter trials of efficacy and safety of letrozole compared with CC are eagerly awaited.

### Stimulation for low responder patients: adjuvants during stimulation [^114b5Rua]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone, letrozole, and clomiphene citrate do not have US Food and Drug Administration approval for their use in in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. However, despite this fact, they often are used to augment the IVF cycle in women considered "low responders". Unfortunately, because of the problems inherent to recruiting women who have undergone several unsuccessful IVF treatment cycles, and their inevitable low live birth rate, studies involving adjuvants for women considered low responders to ovarian stimulation often are underpowered. This is compounded further by the difficulty in recruiting vulnerable women to a study with a placebo arm. Consequently, the evidence base for their use as adjuncts to IVF treatment may be limited, and consequently their use may be empirical rather than evidence based. This short narrative review describes the evidence for these "add-ons" for a patient with a low response to ovarian stimulation. It suggests that a woman with a low ovarian response will derive benefit from using growth hormone; with a reduction in the ovarian stimulation required for oocyte retrieval, collection of a greater number of oocytes, and improvement in the clinical pregnancy rate. Although there currently is insufficient evidence to state categorically that it leads to an increased chance of a live birth. In the same situation, clomiphene citrate and letrozole lead to a reduced requirement for gonadotropins before oocyte retrieval, but with no improvement in live birth rate for their use.

### Effects of co administration of gonadotropins and letrozole during the ovarian stimulation on IVF outcome for poor responders: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Ycqa2]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

In ovulation induction, the outcomes appear different. Baradwan et al. reported that sequential letrozole/gonadotropin therapy improved ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates compared to letrozole alone in women with PCOS, also increasing endometrial thickness and mature follicle count. Likewise, Liu et al. showed that letrozole monotherapy was superior to clomiphene citrate for ovulation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates in PCOS patients. These results likely reflect the different clinical contexts: in ovulation induction, the goal is to restore ovulatory function, where letrozole's endocrine effects may play a stronger role, while in IVF, the natural ovulation process is bypassed, reducing the impact of these mechanisms.

Patient subgroups may also contribute to the heterogeneity across studies. Shapira et al. showed in a self-controlled trial of poor and suboptimal responders that extended letrozole co-treatment during stimulation increased the number of retrieved oocytes, mature oocytes, 2PN embryos, and top-quality embryos, with a clinical pregnancy rate of 31.5%. Similarly, Bülow et al. in a large meta-analysis of 31 studies, found that poor responders had a 7% absolute increase in live birth rate with letrozole co-treatment, without compromising oocyte yield, and with reduced gonadotropin use. In contrast, normal responders showed a higher oocyte yield but no improvement in live birth or clinical pregnancy rates, while evidence for high responders remained inconclusive.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^111uyoeT]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors with intrauterine insemination (IUI) — evidence summary: It is unclear whether aromatase inhibitors with IUI are an effective form of treatment. A high-quality randomized controlled trial of 201 women randomized to 3 cycles of ovarian stimulation (OS) with IUI versus 3 cycles of expectant management reported higher clinical pregnancy rates (RR 3.33, 95% CI 1.80–6.15; P < .0001) and cumulative live-birth rates (RR 3.41, 95% CI 1.77–6.79; p = 0.0003) in the OS–IUI group; however, only seven women received letrozole. A retrospective cohort included 14,519 IUI cycles in 8,583 couples, with natural cycles (n = 6,746), clomiphene cycles (n = 3,205), letrozole-stimulated cycles (n = 1,989), and gonadotropin-stimulated cycles (n = 2,579).

### Does the additional use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole for in vitro fertilization deserve more attention? [^114mFKFb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Although CC or LE alone has achieved good results in ovarian stimulation for women underwent an-ovulatory infertility, especially PCOS, CC resistance is inevitable. At present, the main solutions to the problem are exogenous Gn therapy and laparoscopic ovarian drilling. In order to save time and avoid more aggressive surgeries, some experts have come up with a combination of CC and LE in infertile patients with CC resistant polycystic ovary syndrome as a novel insight. Under the condition of very low ovarian response in our study, seven cases were treated with CC combined with LE, and one of the three individuals got a high-quality embryo after four times of ova retrieval and two times of transplantation, and finally successful conceived. Therefore, more attention can be paid to the joint CC plus LE strategy.

To estimate the clinical efficacy, related primary outcomes including clinical pregnancy rate and cumulative pregnancy rate were often referred. A cochrane systematic review reported eight RCT studies including clinical pregnancy rate, where no clear evidence of a difference was observed between protocols of CC or LE with or without Gn in conjunction with or without antagonist versus Gn (with GnRH agonist or antagonist). One RCT trial with 695 patients reported clinical pregnancy rates per transfer (23.2% vs 19.9%) and per cycle start (13.2% vs 15.3%) in poor responders. Combining CC or LE with Gn was observed a lightly lower clinical pregnancy count for normal responders receiving mild versus conventional antagonist ovarian stimulation, which was consistent with our results. Despite of the downward trend in terms of our clinical pregnancy rate, there was no significance between two groups for high responders under fresh cycles. Cumulative pregnancy rate, both the fresh and resuscitation cycles included, can accurately reflect the benefits of patients after one ova retrieval. The similar result of cumulative pregnancy rate in high responders (75.9% in add group versus 81.0% in conventional group) approved the conclusion that CC/LE was an effective means for clinical outcome, apart from the low cost and low OHSS rate. And the percentage of normal responders in add group was less than conventional group (62.7% versus 71.4%), suggesting that the diversity may be related to the less transfer number of available embryos. As for cumulative pregnancy rate of poor responders, similar to clinical pregnancy rate under fresh cycles, the percentage in add group was obviously lower than conventional group. We can't ignore the fact that the poor responders who had obtained CC/LE during the medical treatment were likely the ones with worse response in the retrospective study, so the results should be considered more comprehensively and carefully. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to obtain a more effective recommendation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): an interview with richard legro [^116qUoCo]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

However, one of the concerns about letrozole was that there might be an increased risk of birth defects, compared to clomiphene. One of the things that has been well documented in sub-fertile women is that they do have a slightly higher rate of birth defects than women who conceive spontaneously. We found that the rates of birth defects were comparable between letrozole and clomiphene and, actually, both were below what we would expect in an infertile population. Thus, we were reassured about that. However, like any trial like this which we think will change our practice, replication of these results is needed. Clomiphene has been really the first line treatment since the 1960s, so this was, I think, rather a remarkable finding.

As we now draw to the close of this interview, can you just tell us what you think are the most promising future directions for diagnosing and treating PCOS?

Certainly in diagnosis, there has been a lot of research trying to look at an endocrine serum marker that might identify women with a tendency towards polycystic ovary syndrome. Probably the most promising serum marker is a hormone called anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), which roughly correlates with a number of small antral follicles. Thus, this may be a useful blood test especially in younger women where an ultrasound may be unwanted and invasive and one that all practitioners could use, not just gynecologists who have easy access to trans-vaginal ultrasound. I think the jury is still out on that and we have to see more. Another promising marker is our genetic markers that are being identified through genetic studies and genome-wide association studies. I think we have to validate these markers prospectively, and that work is being done.

In terms of the treatment of PCOS, I think there is a lot of interest now in developing oral drugs that might perturb the way the brain and the pituitary communicate with the ovary. I think a lot of these drugs may be very useful for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome.

Another big question and one that I am writing up the results right now – is what to do with obese women with PCOS who want to get pregnant? How much should we focus on lifestyle modification and weight loss prior to treatment and how much we should just proceed directly to treatment. We really need prospective trials that test a lifestyle modification versus a controlled alternate treatment to see what the benefits might be in terms of improving pregnancy outcomes in both mother and infant.

Where can I find out more?

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^112DiPPd]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — natural-cycle IUI: It is not recommended to perform IUI in natural cycles for the treatment of unexplained infertility, as it is less effective than OS with IUI and likely no more effective than expectant management (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of recommendation: Strong). Evidence shows no benefit over expectant management in a study reporting natural-cycle IUI live birth adjusted OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.71–2.18, P = 0.44, and an RCT where live-birth rates were not significantly different between IUI and ICI (12.8% vs. 7.0% over four treatment cycles, P = 0.09). A large retrospective cohort of 14,519 IUI cycles in 8,583 couples found natural-cycle IUI live-birth rate 6.2% versus higher rates with OS plus IUI using clomiphene citrate (8.9%, RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2–1.6), letrozole (9.4%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.7), or gonadotropins (9.5%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.8).

### Treatment strategies for women with WHO group II anovulation: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111WkVzn]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Clomiphene and metformin combined can also be recommended as first line treatment, despite the lack of evidence to improve live birth rates and the instability in sensitivity analyses. Of 18 studies comparing clomiphene and metformin combined with clomiphene or metformin alone, only seven reported live birth. The reduced sample size in the analysis of live birth affected statistical power for this comparison, and could explain the lack of a significant difference between clomiphene and metformin combined and clomiphene alone. The potential higher chances of side effects should also be taken into account in decision making.

Clomiphene alone was not competitive in the network, in terms of effectiveness (pregnancy, live birth, and ovulation) or safety (multiple pregnancy). Gonadotropins, though an effective treatment option, had the greatest probability of leading to multiple pregnancy. It is therefore not recommended to use gonadotropins as the first line treatment in treatment naive women with WHO group II anovulation. Further discussions on quality of evidence and interpretation of data is presented in appendix 36.

Despite the promising results shown in this study, neither letrozole nor metformin are approved for the treatment of anovulation in many countries and continue to be used off-label. The use of letrozole for ovulation induction is explicitly prohibited in many other countries(eg, Denmark), except in approved clinical trials. Some guidelineshave recommended clomiphene citrate or letrozole as first line treatment, whereas letrozole has not been included in the scope of other guidelines, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines in the UK (table 2). Safety concerns about letrozole use in infertility were raised in a study presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's 2005 annual meeting, which showed a higher risk of locomotor malformations and cardiac anomalies in newborns. However, this study was criticised on account of its methodological limitations, including small sample size of the letrozole group and inappropriate choice of control group. This study has not been subsequently published as a peer reviewed paper. According to current evidence (appendix 39), letrozole use in infertility, including PCOS and unexplained infertility, does not increase the risk of congenital anomalies in newborns. These results need to be confirmed by future studies. Moreover, there is an urgent need for long term follow-up data among the offspring of these interventions to confirm the safety of these interventions and help subsequent guideline development.

### Evidence-based approach to unexplained infertility: a systematic review [^11282bcZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize the available evidence for the efficacy of various treatments for unexplained infertility.

Design

Systematic review.

Setting

Not applicable.

Patient(S)

Patients aged 18–40 years with unexplained infertility.

Intervention(S)

Clomiphene citrate, letrozole, timed intercourse, IUI, gonadotropins, IVF, and IVF-intracytoplasmic sperm injection.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical pregnancy rate, ongoing pregnancy rate, and live birth rate.

Result(S)

Thirteen studies with a total of 3,081 patients were identified by systematic search and met inclusion criteria. The available literature demonstrates that expectant management may be comparable to treatment with clomiphene and timed intercourse or IUI. Clomiphene may be more effective than letrozole, and treatment with gonadotropins seems more effective, albeit with significantly higher risk of multiple gestations than either oral agent. On the basis of current data, IVF, with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection, is no more effective than gonadotropins with IUI for unexplained infertility.

Conclusion(S)

Adequately powered, randomized controlled trials that compare all of the available treatments for unexplained infertility are needed. Until such data are available, clinicians should individualize the management of unexplained infertility with appropriate counseling regarding the empiric nature of current treatment options including IVF.

### Comparison of the efficacy of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and clomiphene citrate as adjuvants to recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation: a prospective, randomized, blinded clinical trial [^112uT8WG]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the efficacy of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole as adjuvant to recombinant FSH (rFSH) in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH).

Design

Prospective, randomized, and blinded clinical study.

Setting

Academic tertiary institute.

Patient(S)

Forty-one patients with unexplained infertility undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) therapy were randomized to receive either letrozole or clomiphene citrate (CC) as adjuvants to rFSH.

Intervention(S)

From day 3 to 7 of the cycle 2.5 mg/d letrozole or 100 mg/d CC were administrated. All patients received 75 IU rFSH starting on day 7 of stimulation until the day of hCG administration. Ovulation was triggered with recombinant hCG (250 microg) when the leading follicle(s) reached 18 mm in diameter. A single IUI was performed 36 hours later. The luteal phase was supplemented with micronized progesterone vaginally.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ovarian stimulation response (E₂ levels and number of follicles) was our primary outcome.

Result(S)

There were no differences in demographic characteristics between groups. Although there was a significantly lower peak serum E₂ level in the group receiving letrozole + rFSH compared with CC + rFSH (914 ± 187 vs. 1,207 ± 309 pg/mL, respectively; P < .007), there were no differences in the number of mature (> 16 mm) preovulatory follicles. A significantly higher endometrial thickness was observed at the time of hCG administration in patients that received letrozole (9.5 ± 1.5 mm vs. 7.3 ± 1.1 mm; p = 0.0001). The clinical pregnancy rate was similar between groups (23.8% vs. 20%, respectively).

Conclusion(S)

The aromatase inhibitor letrozole appears to constitute a good alternative to CC in patients with unexplained infertility undergoing gonadotropin-stimulated COH cycles combined with IUI therapy.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^112behWU]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — recommendation on combining oral agents with conventional-dose gonadotropins for intrauterine insemination (IUI): "It is not recommended to use letrozole or clomiphene citrate plus conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, as most studies associated with improved pregnancy rate over OS-IUI with oral medications are also associated with an increased risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate)"

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^1144LW6d]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with conventional-dose gonadotropins — comparisons with oral medications and protocol strategies: One RCT (n = 900) found a significantly higher live-birth rate with gonadotropins and IUI compared to clomiphene citrate with IUI or letrozole with IUI (32.2%, 23.3%, and 18.7%, respectively), and a significantly higher risk of multiple gestations among live births (32%, 5.7%, and 14.3%, respectively). Another RCT (n = 154) showed no difference in live-birth rates between gonadotropins with IUI versus clomiphene with IUI following two treatment cycles (13.5% vs. 15.7%), with no difference in multiple-gestation live-birth rates (14.3% vs. 12.5% of live births). A third RCT (n = 503) reported similar rates per cycle (9.8% vs. 7.6% ongoing pregnancy per initiated cycle). In a well-designed RCT of treatment strategy in 503 women < 40 years, the conventional protocol consisted of ≤ 3 cycles of clomiphene-IUI, followed by ≤ 3 cycles of gonadotropins-IUI, followed by ≤ 6 cycles of IVF, while the accelerated protocol omitted gonadotropins-IUI; per-cycle pregnancy rates were clomiphene-IUI = 7.6%, FSH-IUI = 9.8%, IVF = 30.7%, and time to pregnancy was shorter with the accelerated protocol (8 vs. 11 months; hazard ratio [HR] 1.25, 95% CI 1.00–1.56, P = 0.045).

### Evaluation and treatment of anovulatory and unexplained infertility [^111HLtkj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anovulatory disorders are a primary cause of female infertility. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is the major cause of anovulation and is generally associated with obesity. Lifestyle changes to encourage weight loss are the initial therapy for overweight and obese patients, followed by clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction. For those patients who fail to ovulate on clomiphene citrate, alternatives, such as letrozole; gonadotropins; and complimentary agents to enhance clomiphene citrate, such as metformin and glucocorticoids, are reviewed. Women with unexplained infertility (no identifiable cause of infertility on a routine evaluation) may benefit from ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate, letrozole, or gonadotropins.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^1116YprG]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — letrozole (aromatase inhibitor) with timed intercourse: In a high-quality randomized controlled trial including 996 patients, clinical pregnancy rate was no different between letrozole cycles with timed intercourse and medically unassisted age-matched controls (11.1% vs. 7.0%, respectively, P = NS), and letrozole showed no significant advantage over clomiphene citrate (11.1% letrozole vs. 12.1% clomiphene). Systematic reviews reported no difference in outcomes comparing letrozole to clomiphene, and an earlier trial showed equivalent pregnancy rates across doses 2.5 to 7.5 mg (pregnancy rate/cycle: 2.5 mg, 4.8%; 5 mg, 4.3%; 7.5 mg, 6.5%, P = NS). The summary statement concludes there is good evidence that letrozole with timed intercourse is no more effective than clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse or expectant management, and the recommendation states it is not recommended to use letrozole with timed intercourse as a treatment for unexplained infertility, as it is no more effective than expectant management (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate).

### Treatment strategies for women with WHO group II anovulation: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116LXy9N]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of alternative first line treatment options for women with WHO group II anovulation wishing to conceive.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and Embase, up to 11 April 2016.

Study selection

Randomised controlled trials comparing eight ovulation induction treatments in women with WHO group II anovulation: clomiphene, letrozole, metformin, clomiphene and metformin combined, tamoxifen, gonadotropins, laparoscopic ovarian drilling, and placebo or no treatment. Study quality was measured on the basis of the methodology and categories described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Pregnancy, defined preferably as clinical pregnancy, was the primary outcome; live birth, ovulation, miscarriage, and multiple pregnancy were secondary outcomes.

Results

Of 2631 titles and abstracts initially identified, 54 trials reporting on 7173 women were included. All pharmacological treatments were superior to placebo or no intervention in terms of pregnancy and ovulation. Compared with clomiphene alone, both letrozole and the combination of clomiphene and metformin showed higher pregnancy rates (odds ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 2.14; 1.71, 1.28 to 2.27; respectively). Letrozole led to higher live birth rates when compared with clomiphene alone (1.67, 1.11 to 2.49). Metformin led to lower multiple pregnancy rates compared with clomiphene alone (0.22, 0.05 to 0.93).

Conclusions

In women with WHO group II anovulation, letrozole and the combination of clomiphene and metformin are superior to clomiphene alone in terms of pregnancy. Compared with clomiphene alone, letrozole is the only treatment showing a significantly higher rate of live birth.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111Jtqeu]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

5 | DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: EBR = 31, CCR = 59, and CPP = 76. Overall evidence is low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criterions are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

### On-label and off-label drugs used in the treatment of male infertility [^115WjMK2]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Infertility affects 6.1 million U.S. couples-representing 10% of reproductive-age adults and 15% of all couples trying to conceive. Half of the time, infertility is the result of an abnormal semen analysis or other male factors, with 40%-50% of these infertile men diagnosed with idiopathic or nonclassifiable infertility. While the role of hormone therapy for men with an identified abnormality is well defined, the literature remains inconclusive and controversial regarding hormone manipulation using empirical (off-label) medical therapies for men with idiopathic infertility. This manuscript reviews the commonly used off-label medications used to treat idiopathic male factor infertility: clomiphene citrate, letrozole/anastrozole, exogenous androgens, and pentoxifylline.

### Letrozole versus clomiphene citrate: which is better for ovulation induction? [^114d9jyw]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Letrozole is at least as effective as clomiphene for inducing ovulation and achieving pregnancy in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Potential advantages of letrozole include reduced multiple pregnancies, absence of antiestrogenic adverse effects, and the subsequent need for less intensive monitoring.

### Aromatase inhibitors for ovulation and pregnancy in polycystic ovary syndrome [^111BWSDj]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate evidence for use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction and pregnancy in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-May 2009) was conducted using the search terms anastrozole, aromatase inhibitors, exemestane, letrozole, ovulation, and polycystic ovary syndrome to identify relevant studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective clinical trials published in English and conducted in humans were identified. Trials using intrauterine insemination methods for pregnancy were excluded. The resulting articles were separated into 2 groups: aromatase inhibitor use in clomiphene-resistant patients and use in treatment-naïve patients. Eleven trials were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Accepted pharmacologic treatments for women with PCOS and infertility include clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs. Each medication has variable efficacy rates and adverse effects. Therefore, other treatments are needed for a subset of women with PCOS and infertility. Evidence suggests that nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors, specifically letrozole and anastrozole, may have ovulation-inducing effects by inhibiting androgen-to-estrogen conversion. Select trials with aromatase inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy for increased endometrium thickness, ovulation rates, and pregnancy rates when used in clomiphene citrate-resistant or treatment-naïve patients.

Conclusions

Further trials comparing aromatase inhibitors with clomiphene citrate are necessary before aromatase inhibitors can be recommended routinely for ovulation induction in women with PCOS and infertility. However, aromatase inhibitors may be considered in a subset of this population, specifically women who are clomiphene citrate resistant or those who, after discussion of risks and benefits, are not candidates for clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins, or GnRH analogs.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115fUtFh]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) infertility — general principles include that all fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm (Algorithm 2). Those with PCOS should be reassured that pregnancy can often be successfully achieved either naturally or with assistance. Prenatal vitamins supplementation should be commenced with ovulation induction therapy aligned to routine preconception care. Pregnancy should be excluded prior to ovulation induction therapy. The use of ovulation induction agents, including letrozole, metformin and clomiphene citrate, is off-label in many countries, and where off-label use of ovulation induction agents is allowed, healthcare professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns, and side effects. There should be ongoing monitoring of patients for adverse effects, and infants for congenital anomalies, in all studies conducted with ovulation induction agents and these should be reported in any published papers.

### Aromatase inhibitors (letrozole) for ovulation induction in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^117TrhGH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause of infrequent periods (oligomenorrhoea) and absence of periods (amenorrhoea). It affects about 5% to 20% of women worldwide and often leads to anovulatory infertility. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a class of drugs that were introduced for ovulation induction in 2001. Since about 2001 clinical trials have reached differing conclusions as to whether the AI, letrozole, is at least as effective as the first-line treatment clomiphene citrate (CC), a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM).

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of AIs (letrozole) (with or without adjuncts) compared to SERMs (with or without adjuncts) for infertile women with anovulatory PCOS for ovulation induction followed by timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination.

Search Methods

We searched the following sources, from their inception to 4 November 2021, to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs): the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We also checked reference lists of relevant trials, searched the trial registers and contacted experts in the field for any additional trials. We did not restrict the searches by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

We included all RCTs of AIs used alone or with other medical therapies for ovulation induction in women of reproductive age with anovulatory PCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted the data and assessed risks of bias using RoB 1. We pooled trials where appropriate using a fixed-effect model to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for most outcomes, and risk differences (RDs) for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The primary outcomes were live birth rate and OHSS rate. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and multiple pregnancy rates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence for each comparison using GRADE methods.

Main Results

This is a substantive update of a previous review; of six previously included trials, we excluded four from this update and moved two to 'awaiting classification' due to concerns about validity of trial data. We included five additional trials for this update that now includes a total of 41 RCTs (6522 women). The AI, letrozole, was used in all trials. Letrozole compared to SERMs with or without adjuncts followed by timed intercourse Live birth rates were higher with letrozole (with or without adjuncts) compared to SERMs followed by timed intercourse (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.11; I² = 0%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 10; 11 trials, 2060 participants; high-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 20% chance of live birth using SERMs, the live birth rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 27% to 35%. There is high-certainty evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or SERMs (0.5% in both arms: risk difference (RD) -0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; I² = 0%; 10 trials, 1848 participants; high-certainty evidence). There is evidence for a higher pregnancy rate in favour of letrozole (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.98; I² = 0%; NNTB = 10; 23 trials, 3321 participants; high-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 24% chance of clinical pregnancy using SERMs, the clinical pregnancy rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 32% to 39%. There is little or no difference between treatment groups in the rate of miscarriage per pregnancy (25% with SERMs versus 24% with letrozole: OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.32; I² = 0%; 15 trials, 736 participants; high-certainty evidence) and multiple pregnancy rate (2.2% with SERMs versus 1.6% with letrozole: OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.32; I² = 0%; 14 trials, 2247 participants; high-certainty evidence). However, a funnel plot showed mild asymmetry, indicating that some trials in favour of SERMs might be missing. Letrozole compared to laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) One trial reported very low-certainty evidence that live birth rates may be higher with letrozole compared to LOD (OR 2.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.32; 1 trial, 141 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 22% chance of live birth using LOD with or without adjuncts, the live birth rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 24% to 47%. No trial reported OHSS rates. Due to the low-certainty evidence we are uncertain if letrozole improves pregnancy rates compared to LOD (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.28; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 367 participants; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that in women with a 29% chance of clinical pregnancy using LOD with or without adjuncts, the clinical pregnancy rate in women using letrozole with or without adjuncts would be 28% to 45%. There seems to be no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates per pregnancy comparing letrozole to LOD (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.92; I² = 0%; 3 trials, 122 participants; low-certainty evidence). This also applies to multiple pregnancies (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 74.90; 1 trial, 141 participants; very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Letrozole appears to improve live birth rates and pregnancy rates in infertile women with anovulatory PCOS, compared to SERMs, when used for ovulation induction, followed by intercourse. There is high-certainty evidence that OHSS rates are similar with letrozole or SERMs. There was high-certainty evidence of no difference in miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate. We are uncertain if letrozole increases live birth rates compared to LOD. In this update, we added good quality trials and removed trials with concerns over data validity, thereby upgrading the certainty of the evidence base.

### A triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing combined letrozole and clomiphene versus only letrozole for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome [^112LaK2R]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of combination treatment of letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) in comparison to that of letrozole alone to induce ovulation in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Methods

The current study was designed as a single-center, double-arm and triple-blind, randomized, controlled trial. The study was prospectively registered with the clinical trials registry in India and was conducted after approval from the institutional ethics committee. Study patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either a combination of 2.5 mg of letrozole and placebo (n = 40) or a combination of 2.5 mg of letrozole and 50mg of CC (n = 40) starting from cycle days 3 to 7 for a single treatment cycle.

Results

Ovulation induction with combined letrozole and CC provided a higher ovulation rate, with a 35% absolute difference in its favor. The authors found an ovulation rate of 73% versus 38% (P = 0.003) for treatment with a combination drug and letrozole alone, respectively, while the ovulation rate ratio was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.24–3.01).

Conclusion

Combined treatment of letrozole and clomiphene may be considered as one of the first-line ovulation induction agents for infertile women with PCOS because of its affordability and better safety profile.

### Gonadotrophins for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^111KFuPb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ovulation induction with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a second-line treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who do not ovulate or conceive on clomiphene citrate.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of gonadotrophins as a second-line treatment for ovulation induction in women with clomiphene citrate-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and women who do not ovulate or conceive after clomiphene citrate.

Search Methods

In January 2018, we searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, the World Health Organisation clinical trials register, Clinicaltrials.gov, LILACs, and PubMed databases, and Google Scholar. We checked references of in all obtained studies. We had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials reporting data on clinical outcomes in women with PCOS who did not ovulate or conceive on clomiphene citrate, and undergoing ovulation induction with urinary-derived gonadotrophins, including urofollitropin (uFSH) in purified FSH (FSH-P) or highly purified FSH (FSH-HP) form, human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) and highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophin (HP-HMG), or recombinant FSH (rFSH), or continuing clomiphene citrate. We included trials reporting on ovulation induction followed by intercourse or intrauterine insemination. We excluded studies that described co-treatment with clomiphene citrate, metformin, luteinizing hormone, or letrozole.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors (NW, EK, and MvW) independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted study data. Primary outcomes were live birth rate per woman and multiple pregnancy per woman. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per woman, total gonadotrophin dose, and total duration of stimulation per woman. We combined data using a fixed-effect model to calculate the risk ratio (RR). We summarised the overall quality of evidence for the main outcomes using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

The review included 15 trials with 2387 women. Ten trials compared rFSH with urinary-derived gonadotrophins (three compared rFSH with human menopausal gonadotrophin, and seven compared rFSH with FSH-HP), four trials compared FSH-P with HMG. We found no trials that compared FSH-HP with FSH-P. One trial compared FSH with continued clomiphene citrate. Recombinant FSH (rFSH) versus urinary-derived gonadotrophinsThere may be little or no difference in the birth rate between rFSH and urinary-derived gonadotrophins (RR 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.78; five trials, N = 505; I² = 9%; low-quality evidence). This suggests that for the observed average live birth per woman who used urinary-derived FSH of 16%, the chance of live birth with rFSH is between 13% and 28%. There may also be little or no difference between groups in incidence of multiple pregnancy (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.61; eight trials, N = 1368; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence), clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.27; eight trials, N = 1330; I² = 0; low-quality evidence), or miscarriage rate (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.04; seven trials, N = 970; I² = 0; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether rFSH reduces the incidence of OHSS (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.65, ten trials, n = 1565, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) or HP-HMG versus uFSHWhen compared to uFSH, we are uncertain whether HMG or HP-HMG improves live birth rate (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.52; three trials, N = 138; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence), or reduces multiple pregnancy rate (RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.51 to 8.91; four trials, N = 161; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). We are also uncertain whether HMG or HP-HMG improves clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.59; three trials, N = 102; I² = 0; very low quality evidence), reduces miscarriage rate (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.97; two trials, N = 98; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence), or reduces the incidence of OHSS (RR 7.07, 95% CI 0.42 to 117.81; two trials, N = 53; very low quality evidence) when compared to uFSH. Gonadotrophins versus continued clomiphene citrateGonadotrophins resulted in more live births than continued clomiphene citrate (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.46; one trial, N = 661; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that for a woman with a live birth rate of 41% with continued clomiphene citrate, the live birth rate with FSH was between 43% and 60%. There is probably little or no difference in the incidence of multiple pregnancy between treatments (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.44; one trial, N = 661; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). Gonadotrophins resulted in more clinical pregnancies than continued clomiphene citrate (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.52; one trial, N = 661; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), and more miscarriages (RR 2.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.47; one trial, N = 661; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). None of the women developed OHSS.

Authors' Conclusions

There may be little or no difference in live birth, incidence of multiple pregnancy, clinical pregnancy rate, or miscarriage rate between urinary-derived gonadotrophins and recombinant follicle stimulating hormone in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. For human menopausal gonadotropin or highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophin versus urinary follicle stimulating hormone we are uncertain whether one or the other improves or lowers live birth, incidence of multiple pregnancy, clinical pregnancy rate, or miscarriage rate. We are uncertain whether any of the interventions reduce the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We suggest weighing costs and convenience in the decision to use one or the other gonadotrophin. In women with clomiphene citrate failure, gonadotrophins resulted in more live births than continued clomiphene citrate without increasing multiple pregnancies.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114q8rEB]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Letrozole versus clomiphene citrate with intrauterine insemination (IUI) — comparative outcomes and guidance are as follows: Compared with natural-cycle IUI (live-birth rate 6.2%), adjusted live-birth rates were significantly higher with clomiphene (8.9%, RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2–1.6), letrozole (9.4%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.7), and gonadotropins (9.5%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3–1.8). Multiple-pregnancy rates were significantly higher with gonadotropins (4.6%, RR 6.2, 95% CI 2.1–18.3) and clomiphene (1.9%, RR 3.8, 95% CI 1.7–16.1) than natural cycles (0.7%), but not with letrozole (1.3%, RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.4–7.7). A systematic review of six randomized controlled trials (1,776 women) found clinical pregnancy rates not significantly different overall between letrozole (199/809 [24.5%]) and clomiphene (201/967 [20.8%], RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.89–1.80, P = 0.20; six studies; heterogeneity P = 0.01), with a subgroup showing higher rates with 2.5 mg letrozole versus 100 mg clomiphene (74/261, 28.4% vs 39/260, 15%; RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.31–2.60, P = 0.0004; no heterogeneity, P = 0.60), and another review reporting similar live birth (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.08), spontaneous miscarriage (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.61–1.38), and twin gestation (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.39–1.68). One RCT using extended letrozole (2.5 mg from day 1–9) versus clomiphene (100 mg days 3–7) showed higher ongoing pregnancy with letrozole (35/106, 33%) than clomiphene (20/105, 19%) (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.11–3.95, P = 0.02). In a high-quality RCT of 900 couples, live birth was lower with letrozole and clomiphene versus gonadotropins (gonadotropins 32.2% [97/301]; letrozole 18.7% [56/299], P < .001; clomiphene 23.3% [70/300], P = 0.02), and multiple gestations among live births were highest with gonadotropins (gonadotropins 32% [31/97]; clomiphene 5.7% [4/70]; letrozole 14.3% [8/56]). There is strong evidence that there is no significant difference in pregnancy rates or multiple-gestation pregnancy rate following letrozole with IUI as compared to clomiphene citrate with IUI. It is recommended that letrozole with IUI treatments be considered as an alternative regimen for couples with unexplained infertility; of note, letrozole is not FDA approved for treatment of unexplained infertility, but is considered an effective and well tolerated option (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong).

### Multiple gestation associated with infertility therapy: a committee opinion [^114NsMUs]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). High credibility.

Anovulatory infertility — ovulation induction and ovarian stimulation: Letrozole versus clomiphene citrate (CC) increased live birth rates (OR 1.68;95% CI 1.42–1.99) without increasing multiple pregnancy (1.7% with CC vs 1.3% with letrozole; OR 0.69;95% CI 0.41–1.16). A meta-analysis of 57 RCTs with 8,082 women confirmed higher live birth with letrozole and a lower incidence of multiple gestation than gonadotropins. If ovulation is not achieved with oral agents, low-dose exogenous gonadotropins are acceptable for OI cycles with a strict cancellation policy. It is recommended to start at a low dose of 37.5–75 IU a day with slow increases, and cycle cancellation is strongly recommended for patients with ≥ 2 follicles ≥ 16 mm or if there are ≥ 3 intermediate sized follicles to reduce the risk of multiple gestation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

In 36 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and clomiphene citrate resistance, letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, statistically significantly increased the ovulation rate by 33.3% in the treatment group, indicating that letrozole can be used as an effective and simple alternate ovulation-inducing agent in these women.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115v6o5v]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Intrauterine insemination (IUI) with combination of clomiphene citrate or letrozole and gonadotropins — evidence across trials indicates mixed findings without consistent superiority of combinations over oral agents alone: This guideline includes six RCTs and six cohort studies assessing clomiphene plus low-dose gonadotropins with IUI versus letrozole with IUI or letrozole plus low-dose gonadotropins with IUI. One intermediate-quality RCT found no difference in live birth among clomiphene with IUI, low-dose FSH with IUI, or sequential clomiphene plus low-dose FSH with IUI (8.0%, 12.0%, and 13.6%, respectively) (P = NS). Three randomized trials suggested no difference in fecundity between clomiphene and low-dose gonadotropins with IUI compared to letrozole and low-dose gonadotropins with IUI, and one cohort study found higher pregnancy rates with clomiphene and gonadotropins than letrozole and gonadotropins, but not statistically significant. Conversely, one RCT reported higher clinical pregnancy rates per cycle with letrozole-IUI alone versus clomiphene plus low-dose hMG plus IUI (23/70, 32.8% vs. 10/70, 14.3%), but there was a high risk for bias in the randomization strategy.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — letrozole should be used rather than clomiphene citrate in women with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors to improve ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates, and current evidence demonstrates no difference in fetal abnormality rates between letrozole or clomiphene citrate ovulation induction or natural conception.

Management of Infertility

Overall LSTs were considered the optimal first-line treatment for anovulation in women with PCOS and infertility for 3 to 6 months. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline considered pharmacological ovulation induction a contraindication in obese women (body mass index > 35 kg/m²) with PCOS. Three CPGs recommended the use of letrozole as the primary method of pharmacological ovulation induction. This represented a shift in evidence compared to older CPGs such as the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council guideline, which considered it optional, and the Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM guideline which recommended clomiphene citrate as first-line treatment. Most CPGs recommended ovulation induction with gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian drilling as a second-line treatment. The Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM guideline recommended ovulation induction with a follicle stimulating hormone starting dose of 37.5 to 50 IU/day used up to a 14-day stimulation period with close ovulation monitoring and a maximum of 6 stimulation cycles. In vitro fertilization was suggested as last option with a preference for gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist protocols and metformin to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, although there were limited recommendations on the best in vitro fertilization protocols in women with PCOS.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114ZNuQu]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — recommendations for IUI, OS, oral agents, and gonadotropins are as follows: It is not recommended to perform IUI in natural cycles for the treatment of unexplained infertility. It is less effective than OS with IUI and likely no more effective than expectant management. (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong) It is not recommended to use clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse as a treatment for unexplained infertility, as it is no more effective than expectant management. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) It is not recommended to use letrozole with timed intercourse as a treatment for unexplained infertility, as it is no more effective than expectant management. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) It is not recommended to use gonadotropins with timed intercourse in the treatment of unexplained infertility. Studies report either no difference in pregnancy outcomes compared to OS with oral agents or higher pregnancy rates associated with a higher risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) It is recommended to use clomiphene citrate with IUI in the treatment of couples with unexplained infertility. (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong) It is recommended that letrozole with IUI treatments be considered as an alternative regimen for couples with unexplained infertility, as studies to date suggest similar efficacy. Of note, letrozole is not FDA approved for treatment of unexplained infertility but is considered an effective and well tolerated option. (Strength of Evidence: A; Strength of Recommendation: Strong) It is not recommended to use letrozole or clomiphene citrate plus conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, as most studies associated with improved pregnancy rate over OS-IUI with oral medications are also associated with an increased risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy. (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate) It is not recommended to use low-dose gonadotropins with IUI in the treatment of unexplained infertility, as it is more complex and expensive, and likely no more effective than OS with oral medications with IUI.

### Does the additional use of clomiphene citrate or letrozole for in vitro fertilization deserve more attention? [^114UhhRp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Adding clomiphene citrate (CC) and/or letrozole (LE) to in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles for mild ovarian stimulation is a general approach. Although lots of researches have demonstrated partial benefits of the strategy, all-around effects of oral medications remained deficient. This paper aims to assess whether an addition of oral medication will result in considerable outcomes on T-Gn (total dose of gonadotropin), Gn days, total retrieved ova, high quality embryos, blastocyst number, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) rate, clinical pregnancy rate and cumulative pregnancy rate, even if it was not conventional mild/minimal stimulations.

Results

Participants were categorized to three diverse populations as high responders, normal responders and poor responders according to basal antral follicle count. T-Gn in patients treated with CC/LE distinctly decreased from 2496.96 IU/d to 1827.68 IU/d, from 2860.28 IU/d to 2119.99 IU/d, and from 3182.15 IU/d to 1802.84 IU/d, respectively. For high ovary responders and normal responders, the OHSS incidence rate also declined from 29.2 to 4.3% (P < 0.001) and from 1.1 to 0.0% (P = 0.090). Other, there was no statistical difference with respect to the T-retrieved ova (total retrieved ova), high quality embryos, cultured blastocyst and blastocyst number in high responders. For normal responders and poor ovary responders, T-Gn, Gn days, T-retrieved ova, high quality embryos, cultured blastocyst and blastocysts number in oral medications group all apparently decreased. Clinical pregnancy rate per fresh cycle of poor responders with prior oral medications was significantly decreased (25.7% vs. 50.8%, P = 0.005), and no significant differences in high responders and normal responders were expressed (52.5% vs. 44.2%, P = 0.310; 51.9% vs. 42.4%, P = 0.163) between two groups of participants. The numbers of cumulative pregnancy rates were lower in the conventional group compared to the add group for high (75.90% versus 81.03%, P = 0.279), normal (62.69% versus 71.36%, P = 0.016) and poor (39.74% versus 68.21%, P < 0.001) responders.

Conclusions

The addition of CC/LE to the ovulation induction during IVF has certain efficacy in terms of low cost, low OHSS incidence. CC/LE deserves more recommendations as a responsible strategy in high responders due to advantageous pregnancy outcomes. For normal responders, the strategy needs to be considered with more comprehensive factors.

### Letrozole versus clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction in anovulatory women with polycystic ovarian syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^116FydCj]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) for ovulation induction in infertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Methods

In this assessor blind, randomized controlled trial, 90 infertile women with PCOS were randomized to receive either letrozole or CC for ovulation induction in incremental doses for a maximum of three cycles. Main outcome measures studied were endometrial thickness, ovulation rate, pregnancy rate, rate of monofollicular development, and time to conception.

Results

Mean endometrial thicknesses were 9.86 ± 2.32 mm and 9.39 ± 2.06 mm with letrozole and CC, respectively (P = 0.751). Cumulative ovulation rates were 86.7% and 85.2% with letrozole and CC, respectively (P = 0.751). Pregnancy was achieved in 42.2% of women in the letrozole group and 20.0% of women in the CC group (P = 0.04). Monofollicular development was seen in 68.4% of ovulatory cycles in the letrozole group compared with 44.8% in the CC group (P = 0.000). Mean time to achieve pregnancy was significantly shorter (log rank P = 0.042) with letrozole (9.65 weeks) than with CC (11.07 weeks).

Conclusion

Letrozole is a better alternative for ovulation induction in anovulatory women with PCOS as pregnancy rates are higher, time to pregnancy is shorter, and chances of multiple pregnancy are less because of high monofollicular growth.

### Treatment strategies for women with WHO group II anovulation: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115cK6Nf]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Table 2
Recommendations on first line ovulation induction from current guidelines and consensus

PCOS = polycystic ovary syndrome; ESHRE/ASRM = European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology/American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Laparoscopic ovarian drilling was usually undertaken in clomiphene resistant women, and only one small randomised controlled trial on treatment naive women with PCOS could be included in this network meta-analysis. According to current evidence, including data on long term follow-up, laparoscopic ovarian drilling is recommended as an effective and economic second line treatment for ovulation induction in women with clomiphene resistant PCOS.

In conclusion, in women with WHO group II anovulation, both letrozole and the combination of clomiphene and metformin are superior to clomiphene alone in terms of pregnancy. Letrozole is the only treatment showing a significantly higher rate of live birth when compared with clomiphene alone.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115tdTX5]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) ovulation induction — letrozole recommendations specify that letrozole should be the first-line pharmacological treatment for ovulation induction in infertile anovulatory women with PCOS, with no other infertility factors. The use of letrozole is still off- label in many countries. Letrozole should not be given where there is any possibility of a pre-existing pregnancy, though there is no evidence for increased teratogenicity compared to other ovulation induction agents.

### Fertility drugs and cancer: a guideline [^114Hueek]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Fertility drugs and cancer — evidence review methods and grading process are described as follows: A methodological specialist extracted data for outcomes identified by the task force, including exposure to infertility treatment vs. controls, fertility medications such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), human menopausal gonadotropin, letrozole, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), or clomiphene citrate (CC), and cancer outcomes (breast, ovarian, borderline ovarian tumor [BOT], thyroid, melanoma, colorectal, or uterine) with subsequent incidence/odds of diagnosis. Task force members critically assessed study strengths and limitations, assigned a quality grade using a defined rating scale, and recorded this in an evidence table; the task force chair reviewed assigned grades, determined grades when missing based on study strengths and limitations, and assessed design and methodology components including blinding, allocation concealment, appropriate control groups, intention-to-treat analysis, generalizability, and risk of bias. A consulting epidemiologist and the chair confirmed agreement with the experts' quality assessments; the task force summarized data in narrative form (characteristics, quality, benefit, conclusions), convened via email to review literature and findings, and the chair presented summaries and draft conclusions to the ASRM Practice Committee for deliberation on evidence strength and recommendation strength and for approval of summary statements and recommendations. The quality of the evidence informed the strength of the guideline's evidence, and recommendation strengths were based on both the quality and strength (confidence/certainty) of evidence, risks, benefits, and expert judgment; patient perspective and feedback were elicited during review and before publication.

### Luteal phase support for women trying to conceive by intrauterine insemination or sexual intercourse [^116xaW2Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ovulation induction may impact endometrial receptivity due to insufficient progesterone secretion. Low progesterone is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of luteal phase support (LPS) in infertile women trying to conceive by intrauterine insemination or by sexual intercourse.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, LILACS, trial registries for ongoing trials, and reference lists of articles (from inception to 25 August 2021).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of LPS using progestogen, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist supplementation in IUI or natural cycle.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were live birth rate/ongoing pregnancy rate (LBR/OPR) and miscarriage. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 RCTs (5111 participants). Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias. We graded the certainty of evidence as very low to low. The main limitations of the evidence were poor reporting and imprecision. 1. Progesterone supplement versus placebo or no treatment We are uncertain if vaginal progesterone increases LBR/OPR (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.48; 7 RCTs; 1792 participants; low-certainty evidence) or decreases miscarriage per pregnancy compared to placebo or no treatment (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.25; 5 RCTs; 261 participants). There were no data on LBR or miscarriage with oral stimulation. We are uncertain if progesterone increases LBR/OPR in women with gonadotropin stimulation (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.92; 4 RCTs; 1054 participants; low-certainty evidence) and oral stimulation (clomiphene citrate or letrozole) (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.64; 2 RCTs; 485 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study reported on OPR in women with gonadotropin plus oral stimulation; the evidence from this study was uncertain (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.42; 1 RCT; 253 participants; low-certainty evidence). Given the low certainty of the evidence, it is unclear if progesterone reduces miscarriage per clinical pregnancy in any stimulation protocol (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.91; 2 RCTs; 102 participants, with gonadotropin; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.50; 2 RCTs; 123 participants, with gonadotropin plus oral stimulation; and RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.14; 2 RCTs; 119 participants, with oral stimulation). Low-certainty evidence suggests that progesterone in all types of ovarian stimulation may increase clinical pregnancy compared to placebo (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.74; 7 RCTs; 1437 participants, with gonadotropin; RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.90; 4 RCTs; 733 participants, with gonadotropin plus oral stimulation (clomiphene citrate or letrozole); and RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.98; 6 RCTs; 1073 participants, with oral stimulation). 2. Progesterone supplementation regimen We are uncertain if there is any difference between 300 mg and 600 mg of vaginal progesterone for OPR and multiple pregnancy (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.09; 1 RCT; 200 participants; very low-certainty evidence; and RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.43; 1 RCT; 200 participants, very low-certainty evidence, respectively). No other outcomes were reported for this comparison. There were three different comparisons between progesterone regimens. For OPR, the evidence is very uncertain for intramuscular (IM) versus vaginal progesterone (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.02; 1 RCT; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence); we are uncertain if there is any difference between oral and vaginal progesterone (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.22; 1 RCT; 150 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or between subcutaneous and vaginal progesterone (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.05; 1 RCT; 246 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if IM or oral progesterone reduces miscarriage per clinical pregnancy compared to vaginal progesterone (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.32; 1 RCT; 81 participants and RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.09; 1 RCT; 41 participants, respectively). Clinical pregnancy and multiple pregnancy were reported for all comparisons; the evidence for these outcomes was very uncertain. Only one RCT reported adverse effects. We are uncertain if IM route increases the risk of adverse effects when compared with the vaginal route (RR 9.25, 95% CI 2.21 to 38.78; 1 RCT; 225 participants; very low-certainty evidence). 3. GnRH agonist versus placebo or no treatment No trials reported live birth. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of GnRH agonist in ongoing pregnancy (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.74; 1 RCT; 291 participants, very low-certainty evidence), miscarriage per clinical pregnancy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.10; 2 RCTs; 79 participants, very low-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.47; 2 RCTs; 340 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and multiple pregnancy (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.70; 2 RCTs; 126 participants). 4. GnRH agonist versus vaginal progesterone The evidence for the effect of GnRH agonist injection on clinical pregnancy is very uncertain (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.95; 1 RCT; 242 participants). 5. HCG injection versus no treatment The evidence for the effect of hCG injection on clinical pregnancy (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.13; 1 RCT; 130 participants) and multiple pregnancy rates (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.92; 1 RCT; 130 participants) is very uncertain. 6. Luteal support in natural cycle No study evaluated the effect of LPS in natural cycle. We could not perform sensitivity analyses, as there were no studies at low risk of selection bias and not at high risk in other domains.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if vaginal progesterone supplementation during luteal phase is associated with a higher live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate. Vaginal progesterone may increase clinical pregnancy rate; however, its effect on miscarriage rate and multiple pregnancy rate is uncertain. We are uncertain if IM progesterone improves ongoing pregnancy rates or decreases miscarriage rate when compared to vaginal progesterone. Regarding the other reported comparisons, neither oral progesterone nor any other medication appears to be associated with an improvement in pregnancy outcomes (very low-certainty evidence).

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^114dZ6gq]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Low-dose gonadotropins with intrauterine insemination (IUI) — in couples with unexplained infertility who have a good or intermediate prognosis for unassisted conception, there is fair evidence that treatment with low-dose gonadotropins with IUI is no more effective than 6 months of expectant management. There is no difference in multiple-pregnancy rates between clomiphene citrate or letrozole with IUI treatments compared to low-dose gonadotropins with IUI. It is not recommended to use low-dose gonadotropins with IUI in the treatment of unexplained infertility, as it is more complex and expensive, and likely no more effective than OS with oral medications with IUI (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate).

### A randomized controlled trial of combination letrozole and clomiphene citrate or letrozole alone for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^114DcdU4]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether a combination of letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) results in higher ovulation rates than letrozole alone in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Open-label randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Academic medical center using two clinic sites.

Patient(S)

Women 18–40 years of age with a diagnosis of infertility and PCOS as defined by the Rotterdam criteria and no other known cause of infertility.

Interventions(S)

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by age and body mass index, to either 2.5 mg letrozole alone or the combination of 2.5 mg letrozole and 50 mg CC daily on cycle days 3–7 for one treatment cycle.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ovulation defined as mid-luteal serum progesterone concentration ≥ 3 ng/mL.

Result(S)

Seventy patients were randomized: 35 to letrozole alone and 35 to letrozole and CC. Results were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Women who received the combination of letrozole and CC had a statistically higher ovulation rate compared with those who received letrozole alone (27 of 35 women [77%] vs. 15 of 35 women [43%]). There were no serious adverse events or multiple-gestation pregnancies in either group. The side-effects profile was similar in the two treatment groups.

Conclusion(S)

The combination of letrozole and CC was associated with a higher ovulation rate compared with letrozole alone in women with infertility and PCOS. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect on live birth rate.

Clinical Trial Registration Number

NCT02802865.

### Comparison of efficacy of aromatase inhibitor and clomiphene citrate in induction of ovulation in polycystic ovarian syndrome [^115qXcuZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of letrozole and clomiphene citrate (CC) in induction of ovulation in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Prospective, randomized, not blinded, controlled trial.

Setting

A tertiary level infertility care center.

Patient(S)

Sixty-four anovulatory patients with PCOS, who failed to ovulate when taking 100 mg/day CC in previous cycles.

Intervention(S)

Patients were randomly divided into two groups by lottery and treated with either 7.5 mg/day letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) or 150 mg/day CC for 5 days starting from day 3 of the menstrual cycle.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Occurrence of ovulation, endometrial thickness, and pregnancy rate (PR).

Result(S)

Twenty (62.5%) patients from the letrozole group and 12 (37.50%) patients from the CC group ovulated during the observation period. Mean serum E2 level was 817.75 pg/mL and 448.03 pg/mL in the CC and letrozole groups, respectively, on the day of hCG administration. The mean endometrial thickness on the day of hCG administration was 9.03 mm and 10.37 mm in the CC and letrozole groups, respectively. The mean D21 serum P was 13.09 ng/mL and 19.09 ng/mL in the CC and letrozole groups, respectively. Thirteen patients from the letrozole group (40.63%) and six patients from the CC group (18.75%) became pregnant.

Conclusion(S)

Letrozole has better ovulation and PR in comparison to CC in patients with PCOS.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^112G1rVk]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

American Society for Reproductive Medicine guideline — objective, methods, outcomes, and scope: The objective is to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding the effectiveness and safety of therapies for unexplained infertility. ASRM conducted a literature search including systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and comparative observational studies published from 1968 through 2019, and the literature search identified 88 relevant studies to inform the evidence base. Outcomes of interest included live-birth rate, clinical pregnancy rate, implantation rate, fertilization rate, multiple pregnancy rate, dose of treatment, rate of ovarian hyperstimulation, abortion rate, and ectopic pregnancy rate. Evidence-based recommendations were developed for treatments including natural cycle with intrauterine insemination (IUI), clomiphene citrate with intercourse, aromatase inhibitors with intercourse, gonadotropins with intercourse, aromatase inhibitors with IUI, low-dose and conventional-dose gonadotropins with IUI, timing of IUI, and in vitro fertilization and treatment paradigms.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^115b9KpZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — gonadotropins with intercourse (descriptive context): Gonadotropins have a dose-dependent action on the ovaries, with greater doses resulting in the maturation of additional follicles, and ovulation induction with gonadotropins is considered more aggressive than with letrozole or clomiphene. The more potent action of gonadotropins compared with oral medications frequently results in the development of more ovulatory-sized follicles, which would be anticipated to increase pregnancy rates at the expense of an increase in the risk of multiple-gestation pregnancy.

### Treatment strategies for women with WHO group II anovulation: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114CUYvS]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of alternative first line treatment options for women with WHO group II anovulation wishing to conceive.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and Embase, up to 11 April 2016.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials comparing eight ovulation induction treatments in women with WHO group II anovulation: clomiphene, letrozole, metformin, clomiphene and metformin combined, tamoxifen, gonadotropins, laparoscopic ovarian drilling, and placebo or no treatment. Study quality was measured on the basis of the methodology and categories described in the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Pregnancy, defined preferably as clinical pregnancy, was the primary outcome; live birth, ovulation, miscarriage, and multiple pregnancy were secondary outcomes.

Results

Of 2631 titles and abstracts initially identified, 54 trials reporting on 7173 women were included. All pharmacological treatments were superior to placebo or no intervention in terms of pregnancy and ovulation. Compared with clomiphene alone, both letrozole and the combination of clomiphene and metformin showed higher pregnancy rates (odds ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 2.14; 1.71, 1.28 to 2.27; respectively). Letrozole led to higher live birth rates when compared with clomiphene alone (1.67, 1.11 to 2.49). Metformin led to lower multiple pregnancy rates compared with clomiphene alone (0.22, 0.05 to 0.93).

Conclusions

In women with WHO group II anovulation, letrozole and the combination of clomiphene and metformin are superior to clomiphene alone in terms of pregnancy. Compared with clomiphene alone, letrozole is the only treatment showing a significantly higher rate of live birth.

Secondly, effects of CC or LE on the clinical pregnancy rate of patients with different ovarian function varied during fresh cycle transplantations. Results of chi square test showed that clinical pregnancy rate of poor responders with prior oral medications was significantly decreased (25.7% vs. 50.8%), and no significant differences in high responders and normal responders were expressed (52.5% vs. 44.2%; 51.9% vs. 42.4%) (Fig. 3).

The numbers of cumulative pregnancy rates were lower in the conventional group compared to the add group for high (75.90% versus 81.03%, P = 0.279), normal (62.69% versus 71.36%, P = 0.016) and poor (39.74% versus 68.21%, P < 0.001) responders (Fig. 3).

Simple comparison about the difference between CC and LE

In CC group, compared with the LE group, the T-Gn decreased evidently, while the T-retrieved ova, high quality embryos, cultured blastocyst, blastocysts number and pregnancy rate increased. The differences were statistically significant. And OHSS rate between the two groups indicated no difference (Table 6). Adding CC alone was maybe prior to LE alone.

### Evidence-based treatments for couples with unexplained infertility: a guideline [^116hUMnZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). High credibility.

Unexplained infertility — clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse: Randomized data found no difference versus letrozole for clinical pregnancy or multiple gestation (clinical pregnancy rate: letrozole 11.1%, clomiphene citrate 12.1%, P = NS; multiple-pregnancy rate: letrozole 8.3%, clomiphene 9.1%, P = NS). The summary statement states there is good evidence that clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse is no more effective than expectant management, and the guideline recommends it is not recommended to use clomiphene citrate with timed intercourse as a treatment for unexplained infertility, as it is no more effective than expectant management (Strength of Evidence: B; Strength of Recommendation: Moderate).

### The efficiency of low-dose letrozole plus clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction in intrauterine insemination cycles: a randomized clinical trial [^112YXHNM]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate if combination therapy with clomiphene citrate (CC) plus letrozole (L) was associated with a higher efficacy than L and CC alone in patients undergoing ovarian induction plus intrauterine insemination.

Methods

The present multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial was performed between 2018 and 2020. Participants were randomized into three groups: L (n = 167; 5 mg/day), CC (n = 167; 100 mg/day), and L + CC (n = 167) (2.5 mg/day + 50 mg/day) from day 3. Ovarian stimulation was continued with the appropriate dose of gonadotropins daily starting from day 8 and continued until follicular size was 20 mm or more followed by administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (10 000 IU). Semen samples were prepared by direct swim-up technique.

Results

In the CC group, gonadotropin dose was significantly higher but endometrial thickness was significantly lower compared with other groups. Number of follicles of 18 mm or more was significantly lower in the L group compared with the other two groups. Number of follicles less than 15 mm was meaningfully higher in the CC group compared with the other groups. In the L + CC group, total and largest follicular size, and the rates of chemical, clinical, and ongoing pregnancy, and live birth were significantly higher compared with other groups.

Conclusion

Combination therapy with L + CC was superior to either L or CC for achieving pregnancy in women undergoing ovarian induction plus intrauterine insemination.

### A comparison of letrozole to gonadotropins for ovulation induction, in subjects who failed to conceive with clomiphene citrate [^116JWTuZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare pregnancy rates (PR) for letrozole and gonadotropins in individuals who failed to conceive with clomiphene citrate (CC).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

University reproductive center.

Patient(S)

Individuals treated with letrozole or gonadotropins who failed to conceive with CC.

Intervention(S)

Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), transvaginal ultrasound, ovulation induction, IUI.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy rates per cycle.

Result(S)

Among patients who failed to conceive with at least three cycles of CC, gonadotropins had a higher PR per cycle than letrozole. Among individuals who failed to conceive with less than three cycles of CC and whose medications were changed because of thin uterine lining or intolerable side effects, average PR per cycle for letrozole and gonadotropin treatments were equivalent. All patients conceived within three stimulation cycles with either gonadotropins or letrozole.

Conclusion(S)

In patients who failed to conceive with CC, gonadotropins have higher PR for ovulation induction than letrozole. However, PR were high enough with letrozole to justify its use in this population of patients. Letrozole and gonadotropins should not be used for more than three cycles without a conception.

### In vitro fertilisation for unexplained subfertility [^113DMC34]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

One-third of subfertile couples have no identifiable cause for their inability to conceive. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a widely accepted treatment for this condition; however, this treatment is invasive and expensive and is associated with risks.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of IVF compared with expectant management, unstimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI) or intrauterine insemination along with ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (IUI + gonadotropins) or clomiphene (IUI + CC) or letrozole (IUI + letrozole) in improving pregnancy outcomes.

Search Methods

This review has drawn on the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group. We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched May 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, first quarter), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2015), EMBASE (1985 to May 2015), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (May 2015) and reference lists of articles. We searched the following trial registries: clinicaltrials.gov (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform search portal (http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx). We searched the Web of Science (http://wokinfo.com/) as another source of trials and conference abstracts, OpenGrey (http://www.opengrey.eu/) for unpublished literature from Europe and the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) database (http://regional.bvsalud.org/php/index.php?lang = en). Moreover, we handsearched relevant conference proceedings and contacted study authors to ask about additional publications. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The primary review outcome was cumulative live birth rate. Multiple pregnancy and other adverse effects were secondary outcomes. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed statistical heterogeneity by using the I(2) statistic. We assessed the overall quality of evidence for the main comparisons using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methods.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which the effectiveness of IVF in couples with unexplained subfertility was compared with that of other treatments, including expectant management, unstimulated IUI and stimulated IUI using gonadotropins or clomiphene or letrozole. Live birth rate (LBR) per woman was the primary outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and quality of trials and evaluated the quality of the evidence by using GRADE criteria.

Main Results

IVF versus expectant management (two RCTs):Live birth rate per woman was higher with IVF than with expectant management (odds ratio (OR) 22.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.56 to 189.37, one RCT, 51 women, very low quality evidence). Multiple pregnancy rates (MPRs), ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and miscarriage were not reported. IVF versus unstimulated IUI (two RCTs):Live birth rate was higher with IVF than with unstimulated IUI (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.19 to 5.12, two RCTs, 156 women, I(2) = 60%, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in multiple pregnancy rates (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.04 to 27.29, one RCT, 43 women, very low quality evidence) IVF versus IUI + ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (three RCTs) or clomiphene (one RCT) or letrozole (no RCTs):Data from these trials could not be pooled because of high statistical heterogeneity (I(2) = 93.3%). Heterogeneity was eliminated when studies were stratified by pretreatment status. In trials comparing IVF versus IUI + gonadotropins among treatment-naive women, there was no conclusive evidence of a difference between the groups in live birth rates (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.73, four RCTs, 745 women, I(2) = 8.0%, moderate-quality evidence). In women pretreated with IUI + clomiphene, a higher live birth rate was reported among those who underwent IVF than those given IUI + gonadotropins (OR 3.90, 95% CI 2.32 to 6.57, one RCT, 280 women, moderate-quality evidence). There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth rates between IVF and IUI + CC in treatment-naive women (OR 2.51, 95% CI 0.96 to 6.55, one RCT, 103 women, low quality evidence). In treatment-naive women, there was no evidence of a difference in rates of multiple pregnancy between women who underwent IVF and those who received IUI + gonadotropins (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.39, four RCTs, 745 women, I(2) = 0%, moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in MPRs between women who underwent IVF compared with those given IUI + CC (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.31, one RCT, 103 women, low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome rate between treatment-naive women who underwent IVF and those given IUI + gonadotropins (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.36 to 4.14, two RCTs, 221 women, low quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in OHSS rates between groups receiving IVF versus those receiving IUI + CC (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.20 to 5.31, one RCT, 103 women, low-quality evidence). In treatment naive women, there was no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates between IVF and IUI + CC (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.02, one RCT, 103 women, low-quality evidence), nor between women treated with IVF versus those receiving IUI+ gonadotropins (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.02, one RCT, 103 women). No studies compared IVF with IUI + letrozole. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitation was serious imprecision resulting from small study numbers and low event rates.

Authors' Conclusions

IVF may be associated with higher live birth rates than expectant management, but there is insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. IVF may also be associated with higher live birth rates than unstimulated IUI. In women pretreated with clomiphene + IUI, IVF appears to be associated with higher birth rates than IUI + gonadotropins. However in women who are treatment-naive there is no conclusive evidence of a difference in live birth rates between IVF and IUI + gonadotropins or between IVF and IUI + clomiphene. Adverse events associated with these interventions could not be adequately assessed owing to lack of evidence.

### Anastrozole versus clomiphene citrate: which is better for ovulation induction? [^113HrGJt]. Fertility and Sterility (2011). Low credibility.

Although anastrozole may be used as an oral therapeutic agent in ovulation induction, it is not recommended as a replacement for clomiphene citrate. On the basis of two phase 2 studies, anastrozole should be viewed as a second-tier therapy after clomiphene citrate in anovulatory patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115HL4ei]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors have been proposed as oral agents, and although current cumulative evidence suggests an uncertain risk/benefit ratio to treat infertility, a recent large NIH-sponsored, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, clinical trial (n = 750 subjects) has been completed with a marked superiority in live birth rate of letrozole over clomiphene for the treatment of anovulatory infertility in women with PCOS (with a comparable safety and tolerance profile between drugs). These results may alter recommendations for front-line treatment in subsequent revisions of this guideline. Although concerns about the relative teratogenicity of letrozole compared to clomiphene remain, this trial and other publications are reassuring. The relative success of two drugs that modulate estrogen action to achieve pregnancy further underscores this class of drugs as first-line treatment when compared with insulin sensitizers.

Metformin may have some use as an adjuvant agent for infertility in select women with PCOS, although it is likely to be more effective in obese women than nonobese women. A systematic review of metformin noted that in clomiphene-resistant women, metformin plus clomiphene led to higher live birth rates than clomiphene alone (RR, 6.4; 95% CI, 1.2–35); metformin also led to higher live birth rates than laparoscopic ovarian drilling (RR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1–2.5). In addition, metformin may prevent the development of OHSS in women with PCOS receiving gonadotropin therapy for IVF.

The routine use of metformin during pregnancy in women with PCOS is unwarranted, although it may be useful to treat gestational diabetes. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials demonstrated no effect of metformin on abortion rate (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.59–1.75; p = 0.9). A large, randomized, controlled trial demonstrated no difference in the prevalence of pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, or gestational DM in women with PCOS treated with metformin during pregnancy. Metformin was associated with a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal disturbance, but no serious maternal or fetal adverse effects.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^111PxC7f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Letrozole is the preferred first line pharmacological infertility therapy, with clomiphene in combination with metformin; gonadotrophins or ovarian surgery primarily having a role as second line therapy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) could be offered, potentially with in vitro maturation, as third line therapy, where other ovulation induction therapies have failed and in the absence of an absolute indication for IVF in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility. Given the underlying risk for pregnancy complications in PCOS, single embryo transfer should be preferred.

Overall, evidence in PCOS is low to moderate quality. Based on high prevalence and significant health impact, greater priority, education, models of care, funding, and research are recommended. Guideline translation will be extensive including multilingual education outputs and evidence-based resources for consumers (the ASKPCOS app), healthcare professionals and policy makers.

The guideline recommendations are protected under copyright, however a clear process for adaption of guideline recommendations to regional context is available by contacting the author for correspondence online. The translation program will be free and internationally accessible, building on the existing range of codesigned resources including the patient focused, evidence-based PCOS APP (AskPCOS), used in 186 countries and based on a rigorously developed question prompt list. Multi-faceted patient codesigned resources will aim to enhance health literacy with comprehensive PCOS-related health information available in multiple formats and in 15–20 languages. Internationally accessible resources include education modules for healthcare professionals at different career stages and disciplines, healthcare professional accredited courses, practice resources and tools, webinars with international expert panels, and e-health information resources that will be available online. Importantly, the Guideline and translation of the Guideline is expected to improve patient experiences through the provision of timely and accurate diagnosis, of accessible evidence-based information and of improved multi-disciplinary support. Ultimately, this international initiative may serve as an exemplar for large scale collaborative engagement, pooling of resources, avoidance of duplication and inconsistency with consensus-based statements, and codesign of best quality consistent guidelines with processes for local adaption and healthcare impact. Key elements include extensive collaboration, broad stakeholder representation, consumer partnership, distributive leadership, adequate funding, robust project management and governance, adherence to best practice and integrated comprehensive translation, and evaluation. We sincerely thank the partner and collaborating organizations, consumer groups and members of the GDGs for their substantive commitment to the international partnership to optimize health outcomes for women with this common, heterogeneous, and much neglected condition.

### Prevention of moderate and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a guideline [^112HXY6a]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Lowering gonadotropin dose and/or supplementing with oral agents — In a retrospective GnRH antagonist cohort, reducing FSH from a fixed 225 IU daily regimen to 225 IU on days 1–3, 150 IU on days 4–6, then 75 IU on days 7–8 with 200 IU low-dose hCG until trigger was associated with lower OHSS rates (1.3% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.025), with live birth rates not reported. A Cochrane meta-analysis including 5 studies found a significant decrease in OHSS with oral ovulation-inducing medications (letrozole and/or clomiphene citrate) with or without gonadotropins versus gonadotropins alone (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11–0.41) without a significant difference in live birth rates.
