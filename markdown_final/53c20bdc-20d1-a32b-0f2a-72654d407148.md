## Question

Keith is really anxious about a big presentation he has to give at work tomorrow. As a result tonight he is having trouble getting an erection. Which of the following BEST explains why Keith might be having this problem?

Answer Choices:
A. relaxation is necessary for vasocongestion
B. anxiety inhibits the sympathetic system
C. anxiety causes retrograde ejaculation which inhibits arousal
D. anxiety decreases blood flow to the upper spinal cord inhibiting vasocongestion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option best explains why anxiety about a work presentation is causing Keith to have difficulty getting an erection tonight. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiology of erection and whether parasympathetic or sympathetic tone predominates during arousal. Then, I should verify how anxiety shifts autonomic balance and whether that facilitates or inhibits erection. Next, I will examine each answer choice against that physiology and the evidence on anxiety-related erectile dysfunction. Finally, I will select the best explanation and double-check for any common misconceptions before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology. Penile erection is primarily a parasympathetic-mediated process that produces vasodilation, increased arterial inflow, and corporal smooth muscle relaxation, leading to vasocongestion and rigidity. Ejaculation, by contrast, is sympathetic-driven, so I need to be careful not to conflate the two systems [^3d5c3c8c] [^c7d83586] [^4ca69271].

> Wait, let me verify the anxiety–autonomic link. Anxiety increases sympathetic tone and activates the fight-or-flight response, which releases catecholamines and promotes vasoconstriction. This sympathetic surge antagonizes the parasympathetic signaling required for erection, thereby impairing vasodilation and vasocongestion. Multiple reviews and guidelines explicitly note anxiety as a psychogenic contributor to ED via autonomic and attentional mechanisms, reinforcing that anxiety does not inhibit the sympathetic system but rather augments it [^45a363dd] [^4c2da048] [^db02e7da].

> I will now examine Option A: "relaxation is necessary for vasocongestion". Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought this might be too vague, but wait, it aligns with the physiology: parasympathetic dominance during arousal promotes smooth muscle relaxation and arterial inflow. Anxiety's sympathetic activation opposes that state, so a relaxed, non-threatened state is indeed conducive to the vasocongestion required for erection, making this biologically coherent and clinically consistent with psychogenic ED descriptions [^4ca69271] [^45a363dd].

> Next, Option B: "anxiety inhibits the sympathetic system". Hmm, wait a minute, that's backwards. Anxiety increases sympathetic activity, not inhibits it, and that sympathetic surge is precisely why arousal and erection are disrupted. So this option contradicts established neurophysiology and should be excluded [^45a363dd] [^c7d83586].

> Let me consider Option C: "anxiety causes retrograde ejaculation which inhibits arousal". I should double-check the mechanism here. Retrograde ejaculation is a separate urologic issue related to bladder neck dysfunction and is not a typical mechanism by which anxiety causes erectile difficulty; moreover, anxiety more often impairs erection via autonomic and attentional effects rather than altering ejaculatory direction, so this option misattributes the pathophysiology and is not the best explanation for Keith's problem tonight [^notfound].

> Now, Option D: "anxiety decreases blood flow to the upper spinal cord inhibiting vasocongestion". Hold on, I should verify the anatomy. Erection is coordinated by spinal and supraspinal pathways, but anxiety does not selectively reduce perfusion to the "upper spinal cord", and the immediate effect of sympathetic activation is peripheral vasoconstriction and reduced penile inflow, not a focal spinal cord ischemia. This option introduces an inaccurate mechanism and should be rejected [^c7d83586] [^4ca69271].

> Putting this together, the best explanation is Option A, because anxiety heightens sympathetic tone, which antagonizes the parasympathetic vasodilatory response required for vasocongestion and erection. A relaxed state facilitates that parasympathetic dominance and smooth muscle relaxation, so "relaxation is necessary for vasocongestion" captures the proximate mechanism of anxiety-induced erectile difficulty in this scenario [^4ca69271] [^45a363dd] [^db02e7da].

---

The best explanation is **A. relaxation is necessary for vasocongestion**. Anxiety activates the sympathetic nervous system, which causes vasoconstriction and reduces penile blood flow, making it hard to achieve erection. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because anxiety increases sympathetic activity (it does not inhibit it), retrograde ejaculation is unrelated to arousal/erection, and anxiety does not selectively reduce upper spinal cord blood flow to impair vasocongestion.

---

## Physiological mechanism of erection

Erection is a **neurovascular process** involving coordinated parasympathetic, sympathetic, and somatic pathways [^c7d83586]. Key steps include:

- **Sexual stimulation**: activates parasympathetic fibers (S2–S4), releasing nitric oxide (NO) and causing smooth muscle relaxation and arterial dilation in the corpora cavernosa [^4ca69271].
- **Vasocongestion**: increased arterial inflow and venous outflow restriction trap blood, causing engorgement and rigidity [^c7d83586].
- **Sympathetic role**: normally maintains flaccidity; during arousal, sympathetic tone decreases to allow vasodilation and erection [^notfound].

---

## Impact of anxiety on erectile function

Anxiety activates the **sympathetic nervous system** ("fight-or-flight"), releasing catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine) that cause vasoconstriction and reduce penile blood flow, opposing the parasympathetic-mediated vasodilation needed for erection [^45a363dd]. Anxiety also increases muscle tension, distracts from sexual cues, and can create a vicious cycle of performance anxiety and erectile failure [^3bb6fbd2].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Explanation** | **Correctness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Relaxation is necessary for vasocongestion | Anxiety increases sympathetic tone, causing vasoconstriction and reducing penile blood flow; relaxation allows parasympathetic-mediated vasodilation and engorgement. | Correct |
| B. Anxiety inhibits the sympathetic system | Anxiety increases sympathetic activity, not inhibits it. | Incorrect |
| C. Anxiety causes retrograde ejaculation which inhibits arousal | Retrograde ejaculation is unrelated to arousal/erection and is not caused by anxiety. | Incorrect |
| D. Anxiety decreases blood flow to the upper spinal cord inhibiting vasocongestion | Anxiety does not selectively reduce upper spinal cord blood flow; the issue is sympathetic vasoconstriction in the penis. | Incorrect |

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **A. relaxation is necessary for vasocongestion**. Anxiety-driven sympathetic activation causes vasoconstriction and reduces penile blood flow, preventing the vasocongestion required for erection; relaxation restores parasympathetic tone and enables engorgement [^45a363dd].

### Difficulties in achieving vs maintaining erection: organic, psychogenic and relational determinants [^6e025827]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

Achieving and maintaining a penile erection are two essential components of the male sexual response. It has recently been suggested that distinct molecular mechanism could underlie the two disturbances. The aim of the present study is to verify possible clinical differences on pathogenetic factors underlying difficulties of achieving and maintaining an erection. We studied a consecutive series of 560 patients (aged 51.9+/-12.8 y old) reporting erectile dysfunction (ED), using SIEDY structured interview. Patients were classified into two distinct categories: those with difficulties in maintaining, rather than achieving, an erection (sample A) and those with main problems in achieving an erection (sample B). A complete physical examination and a series of metabolic, biochemical, hormonal, psychometric, penile vascular tests and nocturnal penile tumescence and rigidity evaluations (NPT) were also performed. Sample B patients showed a higher prevalence of organic conditions related to ED, when compared with sample A as confirmed by higher SIEDY scale 1 scores (3[1-5] vs 1[0.1-3] for sample B vs sample A, respectively; P < 0.0001) which explores organic component of ED and higher prevalence of pathological instrumental parameters. No difference among groups was observed for SIEDY scale 2 (relational component) and SIEDY scale 3 (intrapsychic component) of ED. In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that patients with difficulties in maintaining erection are less likely to be affected by organic disturbances interfering with sexual function, when compared with those unable to achieve a valid erection.

### Erectile dysfunction in patients with anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^5a73589c]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to achieve or maintain a penile erection satisfactory for sexual intercourse. ED has both organic and psychogenic causes; the mechanism of how psychogenic factors such as anxiety and depression leads to ED is not fully understood. Psychiatric illness has been associated with sexual dysfunctions in both men and women, this could be through the mental health disorder itself or the psychotropic medications used to treat them.

ED has a substantial effect on the quality of life and patients’ well-being. Many studies have shown that the psychological impact of ED is greater in men with greater erectile impairment. Men with ED tend to have lower self-esteem and poorer satisfaction for sexual activity thereby making them prone to have anxiety and depression. The presence of anxiety disorders in the ED population has been reported to be up to 37%, in addition, ED has also been associated with free-floating anxiety. The role of anxiety in ED has not been clearly established, however, it is proposed that anxiety contributes to a vicious cycle that impairs the sexual relation between the patient and partner resulting in communication problems, which further impede sexual functioning. It is also suggested that a small level of anxiety contributes to the physiologically normal sexual cycle especially during the arousal stages, this is thought to be because there is an overlap of features between arousal and the typical anxiety response such as tachycardia and excess sweating.

There have been other reviews that look at ED and other mental conditions like depression, however, there has not been any review evaluating the association between anxiety and ED. Both ED and anxiety disorders have been underdiagnosed in primary care. This makes the patients suffering from these conditions at a higher risk of having a low quality of life, as they are less likely to be identified and be given the care and support they need. Therefore, this review was proposed to explore the link between these conditions.

This systematic review, therefore, aims to (1) define the prevalence of ED in people with anxiety disorders and (2) identify the severity of ED symptoms in this cohort.

### Priapism pathophysiology: clues to prevention [^a4620867]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Priapism, in which penile erection persists in the absence of sexual excitation, is an enigmatic yet devastating erectile disorder. Current endeavors to manage the disorder suffer from a poor fundamental knowledge of the etiology and pathogenesis of priapism. These endeavors have remained essentially reactive, which commonly fail to avert its pathological consequences of erectile tissue damage and erectile disability, not to mention its psychological toll. The role of preventative management seems paramount with respect to priapism. As a prerequisite to formulating prevention strategies, gaining understanding of its pathogenic features and likely pathophysiologic mechanisms is viewed to be quite important. This review combined an analysis of clinicopathologic reports as well as a summary of clinical and basic science investigations on the subject to date. These assessments support the basic classification of priapism into low-flow (ischemic) and high-flow (nonischemic) hemodynamic categories, resulting from venous outflow occlusion and unregulated arterial overflow of the penis, respectively. In addition, consistent with the hypothesis that dysregulative physiology of penile erection accounts for some presentations of priapism, several plausible molecular mechanisms influencing the functional state of the erectile tissue are discussed. Current progress in the field suggests prevention possibilities using androgenic suppressive therapy, adrenergic agonist therapies, and effectors of the nitric oxide-dependent erection regulatory pathway in the penis. New ideas for prevention may emerge from targeting molecular mechanisms involved in regulating erectile tissue function.

### Are premature ejaculation symptoms curable? [^f5612246]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

While premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common sexual dysfunction in men under 40, there is currently no government-approved therapy for its treatment. Is a cure possible?

Methods

Four experts in the area of PE and its treatment were asked to contribute their opinions.

Main Outcome Measure

To provide food for thought, discussion, and possible further research in a poorly understood area of sexual medicine.

Results

Differences among the different types of PE, and the ability to cure them are discussed. One expert examines the possible differences in lifelong and acquired PE as an explanation as to why treatment for the former does not carry over after termination of treatment whereas the latter can be treated successfully. The second and third experts break PE into four categories, explaining that those forms that are curable at present are not true PE or are based on anxiety. The last expert discusses the potential of a combined clinical and research platform to better understand the relative contributions of biological, behavioral, and couple factors to the disorder for potential curability.

Conclusion

Improved understanding of the types of PE and their various etiologies and pathophysiologies would improve the potential for cure.

1 SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION

It is important to note that whilst DSM lists a number of formal sexual disorders, these are not common in routine in clinical practice and not easily assessed. Instead, in clinical assessments involving mental health it is far more useful to describe any sexual dysfunction that causes significant distress in terms of the actual symptoms the person is experiencing (e.g. loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty achieving orgasm). In addition, it is critical to bear in mind that sexual experiences are inherently psychological and subject to the attachment of personal meaning. These then guide our expectations of what our sexual experiences should entail.

Although we have mentioned the importance of assessing sexual wellbeing previously, it is important to note that sexual dysfunction is surprisingly common. Indeed, it verges on being the norm with an estimated 45% of all couples experiencing some form of sexual dysfunction at some time or another.

The most common sexual dysfunction reported by females is low sexual desire (33.4%), followed by inhibited orgasm (24.1%), whereas in males the most common problem is premature ejaculation (28.5%) followed by performance anxiety (17%).However, it is also very common for most individuals experiencing sexual dysfunction to feel as though they are among a rare minority experiencing such difficulties. This is because even though the topic of sex seems to be ubiquitous, sexual problems or difficulties are seldom discussed, and may not be disclosed even within a medical context.

### Anxiety and erectile dysfunction: a global approach to ED enhances results and quality of life [^3bb6fbd2]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Anxiety plays a major role in the development of the problems associated with erectile dysfunction (ED). Psychological and behavioural responses to ED can lead to a vicious cycle of increased uneasiness, distance and conflicts. This in turn leads to a lower frequency of sexual encounters, less time spent together and lack of communication between partners in a relationship. In this review, methods to decrease sexual anxiety are discussed. Primary care psychosexual counselling including a detailed explanation of ED, reassurance to the patient and proposal of a solution for ED are outlined. A multidisciplinary approach to ED therapy is recommended using psychosexual counselling in conjuction with pharmacotherapy.

### Update on central function relevant to sex: remodeling the basis of drug treatments for sex and the brain [^6a8add9f]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2003). Low credibility.

Sexual function draws on a complex network of peripheral and central neural pathways. The standard focus on erectile difficulties and peripheral therapies has been highly successful clinically but there are many unresolved issues in men and newly discussed issues in women that will likely benefit from improved understanding of the central nervous system and sexual function. The spectrum of future therapies, based on evolving central neurophysiological understanding, will include the management of problems related to orgasm, ejaculation, desire, motivation, anxiety, and pleasure. This new range of therapies will employ old and new neurochemicals and pathways singly or in combination. The capability of hormones to modulate many of the sexual pathways will also contribute to the rise of multiagent therapy. The expanded understanding, in combination with enhanced imaging technologies, will renew the role of diagnosis and cause-specific treatment.

### Anxiety disorders in patients with idiopathic priapism: risk factor and pathophysiologic link? [^b41f19c1]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

A scientific explanation remains elusive for many presentations of recurrent ischemic priapism.

Aim

The aim of this article was to evaluate the possible clinical association between idiopathic priapism and anxiety disorders.

Methods

Twenty-one patients without identifiable, presumed etiologies for their priapism disorders presented consecutively to a single practitioner's clinical practice and underwent clinical history evaluation and management over a 2(1/2)-year interval.

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcome is the documentation of patient demographics and clinical profiles relating to medical history and priapism presentations.

Results

Anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder were self-reported in 10 patients.

Conclusions

The possible association between idiopathic priapism and anxiety disorders lends support for a central neurobiologic pathophysiology for the erectile disorder. Further neuropsychiatric studies of this clinical population is required to confirm the hypothesis.

### Anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction [^68b6cb52]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Significant scientific advances during the past 3 decades have deepened our understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of penile erection. A critical evaluation of the current state of knowledge is essential to provide perspective for future research and development of new therapies.

Aim

To develop an evidence-based, state-of-the-art consensus report on the anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction (ED).

Methods

Consensus process over a period of 16 months, representing the opinions of 12 experts from seven countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on the grading of scientific and evidence-based medical literature, internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate.

Results

ED occurs from multifaceted, complex mechanisms that can involve disruptions in neural, vascular, and hormonal signaling. Research on central neural regulation of penile erection is progressing rapidly with the identification of key neurotransmitters and the association of neural structures with both spinal and supraspinal pathways that regulate sexual function. In parallel to advances in cardiovascular physiology, the most extensive efforts in the physiology of penile erection have focused on elucidating mechanisms that regulate the functions of the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum. Major health concerns such as atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) have become well integrated into the investigation of ED.

Conclusions

Despite the efficacy of current therapies, they remain insufficient to address growing patient populations, such as those with diabetes and MetS. In addition, increasing awareness of the adverse side effects of commonly prescribed medications on sexual function provides a rationale for developing new treatment strategies that minimize the likelihood of causing sexual dysfunction. Many basic questions with regard to erectile function remain unanswered and further laboratory and clinical studies are necessary.

### Dramatic improvement in sexual function induced by intranasal oxytocin [^6f429d73]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

A variety of sources indicate that oxytocin has beneficial effects on several components of sexuality. This is a case report on a male who had significant, broad-spectrum improvements in sexual function during a course of intranasal oxytocin treatment for social anxiety.

Aim

To document a case of diverse, salutary effects of oxytocin on sexual function.

Methods

The patient was in individual treatment for a variety of difficulties, including social avoidance and relational problems. A biopsychosocial evaluation ruled out medical conditions and substance-related issues as a cause of sexual difficulties. After obtaining informed consent, an off-label trial of intranasal oxytocin was administered targeting his social anxiety and relational avoidance.

Results

Oxytocin positively impacted a number of components of sexual function, including libido, erection, and orgasm, and was well tolerated.

Conclusions

This is the first case we are aware of documenting broad-spectrum benefits of chronic intranasal oxytocin on male sexual function. Future trials of oxytocin for psychiatric indications should specifically monitor its effects on sexuality, and trials directly investigating oxytocin's impact on aspects of sexual function are warranted.

### Erectile dysfunction in patients with anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^232557ee]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our review identified a high prevalence of ED in the anxiety disorder population and evidence that suggest ED may be more severe in this population, therefore this advocates that this is an important clinical topic. However, the evidence is limited because of the high heterogeneity between the study populations of the papers. More research is required to help improve patient care in this population. Literature suggests that men with anxiety disorders may exhibit risk factors for ED, but it is hard to say whether anxiety disorder alone is a risk factor for ED. For future research, it would be good to eliminate potential confounders and risk factors of ED, therefore, using treatment-naive populations with a singular psychiatric diagnosis of an anxiety disorder in a cross-sectional study measuring ED using a validated tool like the IIEF-5 on a large sample of anxiety disorder participants encompassing these factors mentioned earlier will give a good idea about the true prevalence and severity of ED in this population.

### Physiology of penile erection and pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction [^5ada18ce]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

This article reviews the physiology of penile erection, the components of erectile function, and the pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction. The molecular and clinical under-standing of erectile function continues to gain ground at a particularly fast rate. Advances in gene discovery have aided greatly in working knowledge of smooth muscle relaxation/contraction pathways. The understanding of the nitric oxide pathway has aided not only in the molecular understanding of the tumescence but also greatly in the therapy of erectile dysfunction.

### Disorders of ejaculation: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^704f1799]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA guideline—disorders of ejaculation are defined and the evidence base summarized: Men who ejaculate before or shortly after penetration, without a sense of control, and who experience distress may be diagnosed with premature ejaculation (PE), while men who experience difficulty achieving sexual climax may be diagnosed with delayed ejaculation (DE). The role of the clinician in managing PE and DE is to conduct appropriate investigation, to provide education, and to offer available treatments that are rational and based on sound scientific data. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to March 1, 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through January 2019) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through March 1, 2019), with an update on September 5, 2019; database searches resulted in 1,851 potentially relevant articles, after which 223 systematic reviews and individual studies were selected for full-text dual review, and 8 systematic reviews and 59 individual studies were determined to meet inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Several psychological health, behavioral, and pharmacotherapy options exist for both PE and DE; however, none of these pharmacotherapy options have achieved approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration and their use in the treatment of PE and DE is considered off-label. Disturbances of the timing of ejaculation can pose a substantial impediment to sexual enjoyment for men and their partners.

### Lack of awareness of erectile dysfunction in many men with risk factors for erectile dysfunction [^230cf3a8]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Erectile dysfunction affects quality of life and may be associated with depression[-]. Men with erectile dysfunction often have other comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease[-]. Conversely, men consulting with their physician for comorbidities or other risk factors for erectile dysfunction may also have underlying erectile dysfunction, which may or may not be recognized.

Erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to attain or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. However, men who experience a change in their ability to achieve an erection might not immediately recognize that erectile dysfunction is the problem. The quality of men's erections deteriorates gradually over time. Consequently, men may be uncertain whether their erectile difficulties are permanent or temporary and may wait to see if the erectile dysfunction resolves on its own. Alternatively, the stigma or embarrassment of having erectile dysfunction symptoms may lead to denial of the problem.

We hypothesized that men with comorbidities and risk factors associated with erectile dysfunction frequently have this condition but might deny it and not identify themselves as erectile dysfunction sufferers. The current report discusses the design and outcome of a screening strategy for men with erectile dysfunction-associated comorbidities and risk factors who do not self-identify as having erectile dysfunction. The objective was to create a profile of these men by describing the general characteristics (demographics, comorbidities, and risk factors) of men who answered the question, "Do you have erectile dysfunction?" with "yes," "no," or "unsure" responses. Such information is needed in order to allow formulation of strategies to identify previously unrecognized or undiagnosed erectile dysfunction in order that it may be addressed as a medical condition.

### Priapism [^231b16ab]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Priapism is a relatively uncommon condition that may present as a medical emergency associated with significant pain and anxiety in the veno-occlusive or low-flow variant. Pharmacologic advances and, specifically, the availability of intracavemosal alpha-agonist therapy have dramatically improved the prospects of resolution for patients with low-flow priapism presenting within the first few hours of the acute episode. High-flow priapism is not considered an emergency and treatment measures are typically conservative aimed at preservation of potency. Urologists, radiologists, and other health care personnel caring for the patient with priapism must be familiar with various etiologic factors implicated in low-flow and high-flow priapism to formulate a logical step-care approach. Differentiation of the low-flow from the high-flow state is perhaps the most critical initial diagnostic challenge that determines the sequence of further interventions including surgical shunts in low-flow priapism refractory to medical therapy.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^47d16e46]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline—guideline statements for erectile dysfunction (ED) state: Men presenting with symptoms of ED should undergo a thorough medical, sexual and psychosocial history, a physical examination, and selective laboratory testing (Clinical Principle). For the man with ED, validated questionnaires are recommended to assess the severity of ED, to measure treatment effectiveness, and to guide future management (Expert Opinion). Men should be counseled that ED is a risk marker for underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other health conditions that may warrant evaluation and treatment (Clinical Principle). In men with ED, morning serum total testosterone levels should be measured (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For some men with ED, specialized testing and evaluation may be necessary to guide treatment (Expert Opinion). For men being treated for ED, referral to a mental health professional should be considered to promote treatment adherence, reduce performance anxiety, and integrate treatments into a sexual relationship (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

Premature ejaculation (PE) clinical evaluation—history, psychological assessment, and physical examination: A detailed history is an essential element and a psychological health assessment should also be obtained with queries that can include significant psychiatric problems over the past 6-12 months. Physical examination rarely contributes to the evaluation of PE, but a focused physical examination is reassuring to patients and may identify issues meriting consideration so should be conducted if/when possible.

### Erectile dysfunction: AUA guideline [^c4f659ea]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

AUA guideline—history, examination, and laboratory assessment for ED specify that when the man’s presenting concern is ED, a comprehensive evaluation and targeted physical exam should be performed. General medical history factors to consider when a man presents with ED are age, comorbid medical and psychosocial conditions, prior surgeries, medications, family history of vascular disease, and substance use. Key questions regarding ED include identifying the onset of symptoms, symptom severity, degree of bother, specification of whether the problem involves attaining and/or maintaining an erection, situational factors; the presence of nocturnal and/or morning erections, the presence of masturbatory erections, and prior use of erectogenic therapy. The presence of nocturnal and/or morning erections suggests (but does not confirm) a psychogenic component to ED symptoms that would benefit from further investigation. Vital signs including pulse and resting blood pressure should be assessed. General examination should include assessment of penile skin lesions and placement/configuration of the urethral meatus. Examination of the penis for occult deformities or plaque lesions should occur with the penis held stretched and palpated from the pubic bone to the coronal sulcus. The presence/absence of a palpable plaque should not be taken as definitive evidence for clinically relevant penile deformity such as Peyronie’s Disease. If Peyronie’s Disease is suspected, then additional diagnostic procedures should be undertaken. Digital rectal examination is not required for evaluation of ED; however, benign prostate hyperplasia is a common comorbid condition in men with ED and may merit evaluation and treatment. With the possible exception of glucose/hemoglobin A1c and serum lipids, no routine serum study is likely to alter ED management. Serum total testosterone should be measured in all men with ED to determine if testosterone deficiency (TD), defined as total testosterone <300 ng/dL with the presence of symptoms and signs, is present.

### Erectile dysfunction [^b0eae4c5]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

An overview of the latest concepts advanced with regard to the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of male ED is provided.

Materials and Methods

Published literature and current paradigms promoted by consensus bodies in the field with regard to the management of ED were reviewed.

Results

ED is a neurovascular phenomenon modulated by hormonal, local biochemical, and biomechanical/structural factors of the penis. Once viewed primarily as a psychological issue, ED is now understood to represent predominantly organic etiologies. It has a significant association with cardiovascular disease and could serve as a harbinger of subsequent cardiovascular events. Goal directed assessment and management implies a focus on patient (and partner) preferences regarding various treatment options. These options range from oral pharmacological agents to surgery and may be pursued according to a stepwise management approach. Psychosocial interventions also may serve as useful therapeutic adjuncts.

Conclusions

ED is a highly manageable disorder in most patients. The patient and his partner have integral roles in the decision making process, since preferences regarding the importance of sexual activity, and the risks and benefits of treatment will vary greatly among individuals.

### Short-term intracavernous self-injection treatment of psychogenic erectile dysfunction secondary to sexual performance anxiety in unconsummated marriages [^203ed7cc]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erectile dysfunction (ED), the inability to achieve and/or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual intercourse is traditionally considered an age dependent male dysfunctional disorder, resulting from the physiological changes associated with the aging process. Previous surveys demonstrated an age associated 3-fold increased probability of ED in men between ages 20–60. However, in recent multinational studies, the prevalence of ED in young men (under 40) has been shown to be as high as 30%.

The hemodynamic changes associated with achieving an erection are dependent on the seamless synergistic interplay between healthy psychologic, neurologic, endocrinologic, metabolic, and vascular factors. In younger men without vascular risk factors, psychogenic ED is generally considered to be the main etiology of ED. Psychogenic ED is predominantly or exclusively due to psychologic or interpersonal factors including: sexual performance anxiety, global anxiety, relationship and social factors, depression, guilt and fear.

Physicians treating patients with psychogenic ED in certain conservative societies frequently face situations that are uniquely related to the specific culture and family attitudes. Newly married couples in conservative societies may have limited premarital sexual experiences. The men might be under a significant amount of stress, which affects their ability to achieve an erection leading to unconsummated marriage, a condition in which newly married couples are unable to achieve penile-vaginal intercourse for variable periods despite the couple’s desire and numerous attempts. Moreover, when psychogenic ED is left unresolved, fear of failure may preclude future attempts, frequently resulting in a vicious cycle of sexual performance anxiety, often with the cessation of all sexual activity and increased distancing within the relationship.

One of the many benefits of intracavernous injection (ICI) therapy, it is a purely physiological treatment that offers an almost instant natural erection; this alone reduces anxiety in patients with a substantial psychogenic component in their ED.

In the case series presented herein we assessed the success of at-home use of self-injected ICI treatment following diagnosis of psychogenic ED, secondary to sexual performance anxiety, in young men from traditional Muslim communities who reported on unconsummated marriages.

Thoughtful discussion of these issues with men and their partners is a key component of patient education and can promote acceptance of incorporating a mental health/sexuality expert into the treatment plan. Psychotherapy and psychosocial counseling focus on helping patients and their partners improve communication about sexual concerns, reducing anxiety related to entering and during a sexual situation, and introducing strategies for integrating ED treatments into their sexual relationship. For men with predominantly psychogenic ED, providers should offer a referral to a psychotherapist as either an alternative or adjunct to medical treatment to ED.

### Hard flaccid syndrome: initial report of four cases [^e57a3125]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Hard flaccid (HF) is a group of symptoms that significantly affects a man's sexual and social life. As this syndrome has only been reported in several patient forums, exact prevalence of this rare condition is unknown. Currently, no scientific literature exists of the syndrome. We, hereby, aimed to present four cases suffering from HF and compare the common signs and symptoms with those reported in patient forums. We searched internet forums, chat groups, and private support groups to collect information about symptoms of HF patients. We have identified several complaints regarding penis, erections, libido, urination, and ejaculation. Moreover, we have also collected common findings of laboratory and imaging tests that are used in the workup of HF. The majority of the HF patients is in their 20s-30s. Patients usually seek medical advice due to the following complaints: penile sensory changes (numb or cold), semi-rigid penis at the flaccid state, decreased frequency of morning and/or nocturnal erections, loss in erectile rigidity, difficulty in achieving and maintaining their erections, need for excessive physical or visual stimulation to become erect, and pain on ejaculation and/or urination. Psychological symptoms are usually present ranging from mild anxiety to severe depression. Moreover, laboratory and imaging tests are often unremarkable. Our cases included men between the ages of 22 and 34 years of age and they all reported the onset of their symptoms after a trauma during sexual intercourse or tough masturbation. Compared with reports in patient forums, many of these symptoms (except the urination problems) were observed in our patients and the imaging/laboratory tests were inconclusive. The patients were provided daily/on-demand phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, which were not effective. Currently, HF syndrome has not been universally recognized by urologists and a number of patients seem to suffer from this disorder. In order to raise awareness of this clinical phenomenon, HF must be recognized by professional organizations and a better understanding of the disorder must be established.

### Erectile dysfunction in patients with anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^45a363dd]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Moreover, the prevalence of ED in the different anxiety disorder subgroups varied immensely, we found the prevalence in the PTSD population to range between 3 and 85%, this could be because the studies looking at PTSD had a sample size varying from 82 to 405,275. Bentsen et al. conducted a systematic review on sexual dysfunction in veterans with PTSD and found the prevalence of ED was between 63 and 85%.

A meta-analysis, with a total sample of 48,254, reported that the severity-specific prevalence of ED in mainland China was 32.54%, 9.86% and 13.97% for mild, moderate and severe ED, respectively, suggesting that more people in the general population of China with ED had a mild severity. Other individual studies with large sample sizes from other parts of the world also report that mild ED is the most common severity type. The median severity of ED reported by the studies in the review was 17.62, indicating a mild to moderate severity. This could suggest anxiety disorder patients may be at risk of developing ED at a higher severity than the general population, however, due to the sizable heterogeneity between the studies in this review this association cannot be implied.

The findings of this review suggest that the anxiety disorder populations are at a higher risk of developing ED. The role of anxiety in sexual functioning in this population has not been clearly established but it is thought that an abnormal anxiety response causes an increase in sympathetic tone, resulting in a distraction from erotic stimuli leading to impaired arousal and erection. Therefore, in psychiatric practice and in primary care clinicians must routinely screen for sexual dysfunction in patients with anxiety disorders and refer then to urology to attain the right support they need, especially if they exhibit some of the common risk factors of both conditions such as using psychotropics. In this case, clinicians should evaluate baseline erectile function before commencing anxiety disorder patients on any psychotropic medications and adjust the dosages appropriately, this could increase adherence to the medication, while not compromising their quality of life. Overall, the significance of the findings in this review is that caring for patients with ED and anxiety requires a multidisciplinary approach requiring psychiatric clinicians to work together with the urology team to attain the best outcomes for the patient.

### Diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in the male partner in the setting of infertility: a committee opinion [^e8684115]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

American Society for Reproductive Medicine committee opinion—erectile dysfunction (ED) in the male partner during infertility evaluation: It is the responsibility of the clinician to assess for the presence of erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, or diminished libido in men presenting for evaluation of infertility, and referral to a reproductive urologist or other appropriate specialist is often warranted. ED is prevalent and increases with age; severe and moderate-severity ED occur in 5% and 17%, respectively, of men aged 40–49 years. Globally, more than 152 million men were reported to have ED in 1995, with projections to 322 million in 2025. Among men with infertility, ED is present in 18%–89%, and the prevalence of ED in infertile men is significantly higher than in fertile controls. Men with ED without a history of cardiovascular disease have a 45% increased risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event within 5 years compared with those without ED. In infertility care, ED can be psychogenic or organic; psychogenic ED occurs when a man has normal penile blood flow and nerve function and may achieve an erection under some circumstances but typically not with his partner when trying to conceive, whereas organic ED is commonly a result of diminished penile blood flow or nerve dysfunction and results in the inability to achieve or maintain an erection regardless of the situation.

### Physiology of erectile function [^b9fc6602]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are numerous investigations concerning the balance and interactions between relaxant and contractile factors regulating penile smooth muscle (arterial and trabecular) tone, the determinant of penile flaccidity or erection. Enhanced knowledge of erectile physiology may improve management of men with erectile dysfunction. Aim. To provide state-of-the-art knowledge on the physiology of erectile function.

Methods

An international consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five continents developed in a process over a two-year period. Concerning the physiology of erectile function and pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction committee, there were seven experts from five countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate.

Results

Key roles in the mechanism determining the tone of penile smooth muscle are played by the rise of the intracellular concentration of free calcium and the sensitivity of the contractile machinery to calcium, endothelial health, endothelium-derived nitric oxide, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), neuronal nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase and phosphodiesterase type 5.

Conclusions

A number of new mechanisms have been identified for the local regulation of penile smooth muscle contractility and therefore penile erection. Molecules participating in these pathways can be considered targets for the development of new treatments to treat erectile dysfunction.

### Erectile dysfunction in patients with anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^5cdcb8e3]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to evaluate the prevalence of ED in anxiety disorders as a whole. Previous reviews have focused on a single anxiety disorder; however, we provide an overview of the spectrum of anxiety disorders. We identified a high prevalence of ED in patients with anxiety disorders, with a median value of 20%. There was, however, a wide range of estimates identified, likely secondary to the diverse methodology utilised in included studies. Additionally, this reflects the findings in the literature of the prevalence of ED as a whole, which varies widely, depending on age and how the diagnosis is made.

Certain risk factors in the literature have been identified to make this population of patients more likely to suffer from ED. This includes the use of psychotropic drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. It has been shown that antidepressants like these may cause 30 to 40% of patients to develop sexual dysfunction. Another risk factor is the co-existence of other psychiatric conditions with anxiety disorder, this was especially a concern in PTSD, as studies have shown that patients with PTSD usually have an additional mental health diagnosis. Depression is the most common co-morbid psychiatric condition and depressive symptoms have been associated with ED, a meta-analysis found that the pooled odds ratio for risk of ED in depression exposure was 1.39 (95% CI: 1.35–1.42). The overlie between anxiety and depressive symptoms could not be fully investigated in this review due to the inability to identify where this overlap was. An additional risk factor is increased alcohol consumption or alcohol abuse; it has been shown that alcohol’s depressive effect also gives short-term alleviation of anxiety disorder symptoms, so patients not receiving adequate treatment may resort to self-medication through alcohol which may lead to abusive tendencies. The same depressive effect of alcohol is thought to contribute to the development of ED.

### Strategies for managing sexual dysfunction induced by antidepressant medication [^399bfc61]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sexual dysfunction (including altered sexual desire, orgasmic and ejaculatory dysfunction, erectile and other problems) is a relatively common side effect of antidepressant medication. These sexual side effects may compromise a person's lifestyle and result in a lack of compliance with the prescribed antidepressant to the detriment of the person's mental health. A wide range of management strategies are possible to address this problem, including behavioural, psychological and pharmacological approaches.

Objectives

1. To determine the effectiveness of management strategies for sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressants.2. To determine the adverse effects and acceptability of the different management strategies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 1 January 2013), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Additional searches were carried out by the author team on the same biomedical databases (using terms for 'sexual dysfunction' only) together with CINAHL (1982 to Jan 2012). The reference lists of reports of all included studies were screened.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared management strategies for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction versus placebo or any alternative strategy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

We included 23 trials involving 1886 people in this updated review. Twenty-two of these trials investigated the addition of medication to treat the identified dysfunction, with most agents studied in only single studies. One study investigated switching to an alternative antidepressant.In men, data for the phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil (three studies, 255 participants) and tadalafil (one study, 54 participants) indicated they led to a greater improvement in erectile function than placebo. Combined data from three sildenafil studies found benefit over placebo on International Index of Erectile Function ratings of ability to achieve (MD 1.04, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.44), and maintain erections (MD 1.18, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.59). A single point improvement on these ratings is equivalent to an improvement in frequency from 'sometimes' to 'most times'. Men receiving tadalafil were more likely to report improved erectile function (RR 11.50, 95% CI 3.03 to 43.67). For women it remains uncertain whether sildenafil is more effective than placebo. Unpublished data could reduce this uncertainty.Data from three studies in men and women of bupropion 150 mg twice daily indicate a benefit over placebo on rating scale scores (SMD 1.60, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.81), but response rates in two studies of bupropion 150 mg once daily demonstrated no statistically significant difference in effect (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.09 to 4.41).Other augmentation strategies failed to demonstrate significant improvements in sexual dysfunction compared with placebo.One trial involving 75 people with sexual dysfunction due to sertraline assessed the effect of changing antidepressant. Switching to nefazodone was significantly less likely to result in the re-emergence of sexual dysfunction than restarting sertraline (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60), however, nefazodone is no longer available for clinical use.There is an absence of randomised trials assessing the effects of switching to currently-available antidepressant agents with lower rates of adverse sexual effects, the role of psychological or mechanical interventions, or of techniques such as drug holidays.We identified no data for any of the strategies included in the trials assessed that indicated that they led to a worsening of psychiatric symptoms. However, the relatively small numbers assessed for many of the interventions studied means that the possibility of such an effect cannot confidently be excluded in all cases.Given the small numbers of studies assessing most of the strategies assessed, the presence of any unpublished trials could have substantial effects on estimates of effect. In some cases, only results from particular items or subscales within ratings scales are available. It is likely that this could act to bias estimates of effect obtained, increasing apparent effectiveness.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence currently available is rather limited. For men with antidepressant-induced erectile dysfunction, the addition of sildenafil or tadalafil appears to be an effective strategy. For women with antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction the addition of bupropion at higher doses appears to be the most promising approach studied so far.

### Neurophysiology of erection and ejaculation [^c7d83586]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Penile erection and ejaculation are closely associated during sexual intercourse. Erection is a central psychoneuroendocrine and peripheral neuro-vasculo-tissular event, resulting in blood filling the sinusoidal spaces of the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. Ejaculation represents the climax of the sexual cycle and comprises emission (secretion of semen) and expulsion (propulsion of semen) phases.

Aim

This article provides an overview of the proposed neurophysiology of erection and ejaculation.

Methods

Review of the literature.

Main Outcome Measures

Current data on the neurophysiology of erection and ejaculation.

Results

In terms of peripheral innervation, the pelvic plexus represents a junction for efferent nerves to the structures involved in erection and ejaculation. At the spinal level, the spinal cord contains three sets of neurons (thoracolumbar sympathetic, sacral parasympathetic, and somatic) innervating the sexual organs involved in erection and ejaculation. The presence of cerebral descending pathways to spinal erection and ejaculation centers indicates that the brain has an excitatory or inhibitory effect on these processes. Brain structures that modulate spinal command of erection and ejaculation are part of a larger network that is dedicated to regulating sexual responses. Neurophysiological and pharmacological research has elucidated that dopamine and serotonin have central roles in modulating erection and ejaculation. Interestingly, erection is not a prerequisite for ejaculation, and each of these sexual responses can exist without the other.

Conclusion

Despite the association between erection and ejaculation during intercourse, these two processes can be considered distinct events from an anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological perspective.

### Erectile dysfunction in patients with anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^47eecd89]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Data collection and data items

Data was extracted by the first author (RV) from each eligible study onto a pre-defined extraction sheet. Generic study data extracted included study characteristics such as first author, year of study, country of study, study design, total number of participants, the specific anxiety disorder investigated in the study and the criteria used to identify patients with anxiety disorder and ED. Additionally, we extracted specific data pertaining to the three outcome measures of this review: prevalence, severity and risk factors for ED. For the prevalence of ED in patients with an anxiety disorder, the number of participants with the anxiety disorder of interest and the number of those who had ED was extracted. In studies where the exact number of participants with ED and anxiety disorders was not reported, but the prevalence of ED and the number of participants with an anxiety disorder were, these values were used to calculate the rough number of participants with ED and anxiety disorders.

Study quality assessment

Quality appraisal of individual studies included was done using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Exposures. This tool evaluates confounders and assesses for risk of bias in seven domains in studies of different methodologies: confounding, participant selection, classification of exposure, departure from intended exposure, missing data, measurement of outcome and selection reported result. A score of low, moderate or serious was given for each domain, if a study received a serious score in at least one domain, it would automatically receive an overall score of serious. If it does not have any serious score and it received moderate scores in at least three different domains it will be given an overall score of moderate, otherwise, it will receive an overall score of low. A traffic light visualisation plot made using robvis shows the scores each study received on each domain.

### Can we consider erectile dysfunction as an early marker of Cardiovascular disease? [^3c57c2cd]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to achieve or maintain an erection that is sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. This problem affects a considerable proportion of men at least occasionally, and it is estimated that around 52% of men experience some form of ED with an increase from about 5 to 15 percent between ages 40 and 70 years. Although it is not a lethal condition, the interest surrounding ED and its remedies has been constant and present in history since the 15th century when Leonardo da Vinci described the increase in blood flow in the penis as a cause of erection.The causes of ED are classified into 2 main categories: psychogenic and organic causes, the last representing 80% of the total. Organic causes can be broadly divided into nonendocrine and endocrine. Among the nonendocrine etiologies, the vasculogenic (affecting blood supply) is the most common and can involve arterial inflow disorders and abnormalities of venous outflow (corporeal veno-occlusion); there are also neurogenic (affecting innervation and nervous function) and iatrogenic (relating to a medical or surgical treatment) etiologies. Among endocrine factors leading to ED, reduced serum testosterone levels have been implicated, but the exact mechanism has not been fully elucidated.

The incidence of ED increases with age, passing from 20 to 40% in men 60 to 69 years to 50 to 100% in men 70 to 80 years, depending on the differing definitions of ED in various studies.In addition to age, cardiovascular (CV) risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and dyslipidemia are significantly associated with ED, and this has led over time to hypothesize a close link between ED and CV disease.The interaction between androgens, chronic inflammation, and CV risk factors can determine endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, resulting in disorders of penile and coronary circulation. Evidence demonstrated that ED and vascular diseases share a similar pathogenic involvement of nitric oxide pathway leading to impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (early phase) and structural vascular abnormalities (late phase).

The smaller size of penile artery size compared with coronary arteries may explain why the same level of endothelial dysfunction can cause a more significant reduction of blood flow in erectile tissues compared with that in coronary circulation.Nowadays, the correlation between ED and CV disease has been widely demonstrated, and ED often precedes CV events and can be used as an early marker to identify men at high risk of major CV disease.

### Questions in psychiatry (quiP): assessing sexual well-being [^541249aa]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

4 IMPACT OF ILLNESS ON SEX

Sexual dysfunction is common in individuals diagnosed with depression. Most commonly this entails decreased libido, but depression can also result in difficulties with arousal (erectile dysfunction and vaginial dryness) and orgasm (absent or delayed).This is to be expected, as depression impacts and indeed comprises changes in mood, energy and interest and in particular the capacity to experience pleasure, and, therefore, it is no surprise that depression lowers sexual interest, engagement in sexual activities and the ability to gain satisfaction. As a consequence, this impacts the depressed individual's confidence and self‐esteem. Depression also usually cooccurs with other conditions such as anxiety, and medical health problems such as cardiovascular disease, many of which can directly impact sexual function.

Importantly, the link between sexual dysfunction and depression appears to be both strong and bidirectional, meaning those with sexual dysfunction should be screened for depression and vice versa.Overall, those with depression have been shown to have a 50%–70% increased risk of developing sexual dysfunction, and those with sexual dysfunction have a 130%–210% increased risk of developing depression.

In addition, sexual dysfunction is also a frequently reported side‐effect of many treatments used to manage depression, often leading to poor treatment adherence or withdrawal and cessation.

### Phosphodiesterase 5 mechanisms and therapeutic applications [^f4fdbb73]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signal transduction system, which is an essential mediatory pathway for penile erection, contains several molecular targets available for pharmacologic manipulation to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). The most prominent target identified thus far is phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5), which enzymatically converts the intracellular second messenger molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to its inactive form. By its preservation, cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase I, which pivotally drives a biochemical cascade resulting in corporal smooth muscle relaxation and, hence, penile erection. This system mechanistically requires the synthesis of cGMP, secondary to the production and release of NO during sexual arousal. Accordingly, PDE5 inhibitors augment the erectile response. Key to erectogenesis are the relatively high concentrations of PDE5 enzymes in the corporal smooth muscle of the penis relative to other structures of the body. At present, 3 PDE5 inhibitors are approved for the therapeutic management of ED. All 3 have been studied extensively, both at the molecular pharmacologic level and in clinical trials. They have shown excellent clinical efficacy and safety. This presentation affirms the value of PDE5 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for ED.

### Erectile dysfunction in patients with anxiety disorders: a systematic review [^9ce806af]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The findings of this review cannot be generalised to the universal population of men with anxiety disorders, as 57% of our sample size were veterans, who are a population that exhibit many predictors for ED. Therefore, this does bias our assumptions and our findings may be an overestimate of the true association between ED and anxiety disorders, if we excluded studies involving veterans, we may have had more reliable findings. Furthermore, the most common anxiety disorders in the general population are phobic disorders, SAD and GAD, which were tremendously underrepresented in our review. This could be because there are not many studies that look at ED in this population or it could be due to our search strategies, as we only included studies published in the English language consequently missing out a large proportion of the literature. While going through the study screening process, we found many studies that measure anxiety levels but do not actually diagnose an anxiety disorder. Many of these studies used the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) to quantify GAD symptoms but do not clinically diagnose GAD. In addition, in many countries clinical psychologist commonly diagnose mental health conditions besides psychiatrists, if we included these studies and the studies that used the GAD-7, we may have had a study population with better represents the general population.

From the literature, we know that the prevalence of ED increases with age. Therefore, many studies report the age-specific prevalence. However, we were not able to find the mean ages of most of our studies, as they were calculated for the whole study population which included female participants or participants without anxiety disorders. In addition, a third of the studies in this review were flagged as high risk of bias. The presence of these biases makes it seem like there is an association between having anxiety disorders and ED or even mask a true association. Also, we were not able to distinguish the different types of ED in the study population to see if anxiety has a different role to play in organic and psychogenic ED.

Further research must be undertaken to find the true association between ED and anxiety disorders, this should focus on each subgroup of anxiety disorders rather than anxiety disorders as a whole. This is because the prevalence of ED in each subgroup varies drastically, this could be due to different risk factors in each subgroup, for example, military deployment and experiencing combat trauma were recognised as potential risk factors identified in the PTSD studies.

### The diagnosis and management of recurrent ischemic priapism, priapism in sickle cell patients, and non-ischemic priapism: an AUA / SMSNA guideline [^911b73a2]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

AUA/SMSNA Guideline—Prolonged erections after iatrogenic intracavernosal injection (ICI) should be differentiated between conditions that require therapy and those that may be reasonably observed, because men with prolonged erections that are not fully rigid are less likely to later progress to acute ischemic priapism compared to those with fully rigid erections, and partial erections should likely not be counted towards the four-hour time criteria. The specific medication used to achieve the erection matters, as men treated with alprostadil alone are less prone to progress to ischemic priapism compared to those treated with papaverine and phentolamine, and pain is not likely a helpful indicator due to injection-related discomfort or full engorgement. Clinical judgment is required to determine if therapy is warranted versus additional observation, and prolonged erections frequently occur following deformity assessments, PDUS for erectile dysfunction (ED), ICI training for ED therapy, or other intracavernosal therapies.

### Characteristics of men who report symptoms of delayed ejaculation: providing support for empirically derived diagnostic criteria [^a3a66e2f]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known regarding the demographic, sexual, and relationship characteristics of men with symptoms of delayed ejaculation (DE).

Aim

To identify differences between men with and without DE symptomology to validate face-valid diagnostic criteria and to identify various functional correlates of DE.

Methods

A total of 2679 men meeting inclusion criteria were partitioned into groups with and without DE symptomology on the basis of their self-reported "difficulty reaching ejaculation/orgasm during partnered sex." Men were then compared on a broad array of demographic and relationship variables, as well as sexual response variables assessed during partnered sex and masturbation.

Outcomes

Outcomes included the identified differences between men with and without DE symptomology.

Results

Men with DE-whether having comorbid erectile dysfunction or not-differed from men without DE on 5 face-valid variables related to previously proposed diagnostic criteria for DE, including ones related to ejaculation latency (P<.001); self-efficacy related to reaching ejaculation, as assessed by the percentage of episodes reaching ejaculation during partnered sex (P<.001); and negative consequences of the impairment, including "bother/distress" and (lack of) "orgasmic pleasure/sexual satisfaction" (P<.001). All such differences were associated with medium to large effect sizes. In addition, men showed differences on a number of functional correlates of DE, including anxiety, relationship satisfaction, frequency of partnered sex and masturbation, and level of symptomology during partnered sex vs masturbation (P<.001).

Clinical Implications

Face-valid criteria for the diagnosis of DE were statistically verified, and functional correlates of DE relevant to guiding and focusing treatment were identified.

Strengths and Limitations

In this first comprehensive analysis of its kind, we have demonstrated widespread differences on sexual and relationship variables relevant to the diagnosis of DE and to its functional correlates between men with and without DE symptomology during partnered sex. Limitations include participant recruitment through social media, which likely biased the sample; the use of estimated rather than clocked ejaculation latencies; and the fact that differences between men with acquired and lifelong DE were not investigated.

Conclusion

This well-powered multinational study provides strong empirical support for several face-valid measures for the diagnosis of DE, with a number of explanatory and control covariates that may help shed light on the lived experiences of men with DE and suggest focus areas for treatment. Whether or not the DE men had comorbid erectile dysfunction had little impact on the differences with men having normal ejaculatory functioning.

### Pathophysiology of premature ejaculation [^58ad50f0]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Although the characteristics of premature ejaculation (PE) are established, the exact aetiology is largely unknown. Genetic, neurobiological, pharmacological, psychological, urological and endocrine factors have all been proposed. In addition PE and erectile dysfunction are often co-morbid.

Aim

This article provides an overview of the proposed biological and psychological aetiologies of PE.

Methods

Review of the literature.

Main Outcome Measures

Current data on the pathophysiology of PE.

Results

This review shows that most of the proposed biological and psychological aetiologies of PE are not evidence-based and/or that attempts to confirm them have given conflicting results. There are good data to support roles for genetic and psychological factors, either causal, or secondary to PE for the latter, in lifelong PE. Conversely, more evidence-based data support the responsibility of opioid substance withdrawal, prostatic inflammation or hyperthyroidism in some cases of acquired PE, in addition to a probable role of psychological factors.

Conclusions

The determinants of PE are certainly complex and multifactorial, while each partner's reaction to the frustration caused by the sexual dysfunction may exacerbate or perpetuate it. It is important to understand, as far as possible, the aetiology in the individual patient to ensure appropriate assessment and treatment. It should be noted that identification of an aetiological factor does not necessarily mean the cause of the PE has been completely explained, and the patient may require a combination of treatment approaches.

### Adult-onset hypogonadism [^6917e475]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical signs and symptoms—adult-onset hypogonadism: Adult-onset hypogonadism is an often overlooked condition because hypogonadal men often ignore their symptoms, and the clinical signs and symptoms are variable and nonspecific with a gradual onset and slow progression. Because T influences all steps of the male sexual response cycle, sexual dysfunction is common and can be the presenting symptom; symptoms may include hypoactive sexual desire, reduced nocturnal and morning erections, reduced sex-induced erections, delayed ejaculation, and reduced semen volume. The clinical practice guidelines of the Endocrine Society and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists as well as other authors suggest that physicians should measure the T levels of men with any of the symptoms and signs given in Table 2. The physical examination may not be helpful in making an AOH diagnosis.

### Specific aspects of erectile dysfunction in psychiatry [^153cba96]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2004). Low credibility.

The participation of the psychiatrist in the management of erectile dysfunction (ED) is focused on three types of patients based on the origin of the dysfunction: (1) patients with functional or psychogenic ED, (2) patients with mixed, organic psychogenic ED, and (3) patients with ED and active psychopathology. The second group is influenced by three psychological factors: perpetuating factors, aggravating factors, and accompanying factors. The main psychopathological disorders that interfere directly with the erectile mechanism are depressive disorders (18-35%), anxiety disorders (37%), obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychotic disorders (46-47%), and the antipsychotic medications used to treat these disorders. The diagnostic proposal includes psychological and sexologic evaluation and differential diagnosis. The therapeutic proposal includes the basic principles of sex therapy in the model of behavioral-cognitive therapy (eg, prohibition of intercourse, sensate focus, voluntary loss of erections, no expectations about response), pharmacological therapy (eg, sildenafil, intracavernous injection of vasoactive drugs), and a combination of both therapies.

### Pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction [^7ba71604]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Multiple regulatory systems are involved in normal erectile function. Disruption of psychological, neurological, hormonal, vascular, and cavernosal factors, individually, or in combination, can induced erectile dysfunction (ED). The contribution of neurogenic, vascular, and cavernosal factors was thoroughly reviewed by our committee, while psychological and hormonal factors contributing to ED were evaluated by other committees.

Aim

To provide state of the art knowledge on the physiology of ED.

Methods

An international consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five different continents developed in a process over a 2-year period. Concerning the pathophysiology of ED committee, there were seven experts from five different countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate.

Results

The epidemiology and classification of neurogenic ED was reviewed. The evidence for the association between vascular ED and atherosclerosis/hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and diabetes was evaluated. In addition, the pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in vascular ED were defined, including: arterial remodeling, increased vasoconstriction, impaired neurogenic vasodilatation, and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. The possible mechanisms underlying the association between chronic renal failure and ED were also evaluated as well as the evidence supporting the association of ED with various classes of medications.

Conclusions

A better understanding of how diseases interfere with the physiological mechanisms that regulate penile erection has been achieved over the last few years, which helps establish a strategy for the prevention and treatment of ED.

### Neurophysiology / pharmacology of erection [^7856dd19]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2001). Low credibility.

Despite considerable advances, both the central regulation of erection with processing of various stimuli, and the different steps involved in neurotransmission, impulse propagation and intracellular transduction of neural signals in penile smooth muscles, are still incompletely known. Centrally as well as peripherally, many transmitters and transmitter systems are involved. Dopamine, nitric oxide, oxytocin and ACTH/alpha-MSH, seem to have a facilitatory role, whereas serotonin may be either facilitatory or inhibitory, and enkephalins are inhibitory. Peripherally, the balance between contractant (eg noradrenaline, endothelins, angiotensins) and relaxant (eg NO, VIP and related peptides, prostanoids) factors controls the degree of contraction of the smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa, and determines the functional state of the penis. Neurogenic NO is considered the most important factor for relaxation of penile vessels and corpus cavernosum. The roles of other putative transmitters/mediators and of various intracellular mechanisms, producing relaxation of vascular and corpus cavernosum smooth muscle, have not been established. For example, recent findings have suggested a role of Rho/Rho-kinase in the regulation of cavernosal tone, and that Rho-kinase antagonism could be a new potential principle for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Further research in this area may be rewarding.

### 'Never again will I be carefree': a qualitative study of the impact of hypoglycemia on quality of life among adults with type 1 diabetes [^a8475651]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Sex life

Sexual activities were often postponed, interrupted, or discontinued due to hypoglycemia. Some participants were ‘too tired’ or ‘not receptive’ to sexual advances following hypoglycemia. Others were unable to achieve climax and some men reported difficulties getting an erection. Consequently, ‘lust or pleasure dissipated’ and they felt ‘bad’, ‘frustrated’, ‘embarrassed’, ‘insecure’, or ‘humiliated’. Participants were worried about disappointing or frightening their partner, particularly in a new relationship and/or when their partner was unfamiliar with hypoglycemia. Since sex often induced hypoglycemia, participants lacked spontaneity with sex or were preoccupied with fear of hypoglycemia during sex.

Physical health

Due to consuming additional calories to treat hypoglycemia, some had gained weight or found it difficult to lose weight, and felt uncomfortable with their body. Some women explained that, prior to pregnancy, it was difficult to achieve recommended hemoglobin A1c levels because they were too scared to maintain glucose levels in such a low range or overtreated hypoglycemia and experienced rebound hyperglycemia. Some mentioned that comorbidities (eg, multiple sclerosis) were exacerbated by hypoglycemia. Participants explained that they were fearful of long-term health complications due to frequent hypoglycemia and/or rebound hyperglycemia.

Mental health

Emotional difficulties during and after episodes

Participants described many emotional states during and after hypoglycemia, including irritability, sadness, helplessness, and general moodiness. They felt ashamed or angry with themselves for recurrences. Some explained that hypoglycemia exacerbated stress and pre-existing disordered eating behaviors, whereby they suspended or turned off their insulin pumps and/or skipped meals to compensate for calories consumed for hypoglycemia treatment.

Persistent emotional impacts of hypoglycemia

Participants described a pervasive sense of anxiety and ‘tenseness’ related to the ever-present threat of hypoglycemia. They reported an enduring fear of hypoglycemia between episodes. Many were preoccupied with hypoglycemia and always ‘working on’ hypoglycemia, at the expense of enjoying leisure activities and quality time with others. Participants commented that they no longer had ‘peace of mind’: “Never again will I be carefree”.

### Citalopram (Celexa) [^cd64f11a]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1 0 Sexual Dysfunction

Use of SSRIs, including CELEXA, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm.

It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of CELEXA and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.

### Erectile dysfunction in diabetes mellitus: a comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, genetic association studies and therapeutic approaches [^311772d1]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Erectile dysfunction (ED), a common yet often underreported complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), significantly impacts the quality of life, self‐esteem, and psychological well‐being of affected men. Defined as the persistent inability to achieve and/or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity, ED affects an estimated 50% or more of men with DM. Furthermore, the prevalence of ED is at least threefold higher in men with DM compared to men without the disease.

DM is a group of metabolic disorders characterised by impaired carbohydrate metabolism, in which glucose is underutilised as an energy source and overproduced due to dysregulation of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, ultimately leading to hyperglycaemia. There are many different forms of DM, each distinguished by unique aetiologies and pathophysiological mechanisms. It remains one of the most widespread chronic diseases, with a rapidly increasing global incidence and prevalence. An estimated 537 million adults aged 20–79 years currently live with DM worldwide, contributing directly and indirectly to approximately 6.7 million deaths globally in 2021 alone. The global prevalence of DM in adults aged 20–79 years was estimated at 10.5% (standardised to the 2021 United Nations population), with the rate peaking at 24.0% in the 75–79 age group.

The pathophysiological link between DM and ED involves a complex interplay of vascular, hormonal, neurological, psychological and iatrogenic/lifestyle factors, ultimately disrupting the delicate neurovascular mechanisms required for normal erectile function. Although not life‐threatening, ED can be an early marker of systemic vascular damage in men with DM. It negatively impacts the quality of life for affected men and their partners and imposes a substantial economic burden on employers due to increased absenteeism and reduced workplace productivity. The condition is also associated with numerous psychosocial consequences, including reduced self‐esteem, anxiety, depression and diminished confidence and intimacy.

This review explores the mechanisms by which DM increases the risk of ED. Recent advances in genetics provide novel insights into ED susceptibility in patients with DM, as several polymorphisms and genetic pathways have been identified as significant contributors to the condition. Furthermore, given the expanding landscape of ED treatment options, we summarise current pharmacological and non‐pharmacological approaches, highlighting promising emerging therapies. Our goal is to facilitate the integration of personalised medicine into clinical practice by synthesising recent advancements in the understanding of risk factors, epidemiology, pathophysiology and treatment modalities, with a particular emphasis on genetic contributions.

### Lack of awareness of erectile dysfunction in many men with risk factors for erectile dysfunction [^888e724c]. BMC Urology (2010). Low credibility.

A limitation of the trial design was that the reasons for men's specific answers to the screening question were not further investigated. However, studies investigating treatment-seeking behavior of men with erectile dysfunction and those assessing men's sexual attitudes and beliefs may serve to provide insight into how men react when they begin to experience erectile dysfunction as well as why some men may not recognize that they have erectile dysfunction.

Erectile dysfunction may produce a profound sense of loss. Men may try to make sense of the cause of their erectile dysfunction, which may include guilt or the pressures of business or work, or they may want to confirm that an existing medical problem is the cause rather than their feelings for their partner or their sexuality. Men frequently cited psychological stress, organic disease, and aging as causes for erectile dysfunction in a study of men's sexual beliefs and attitudes. Men's emotional reactions to erectile dysfunction include denial, embarrassment, depression, and acceptance. In keeping with this, men who have intermittent erection problems are less likely to seek treatment. The duration and severity of erectile dysfunction was also determined to be a factor in whether men sought treatment, suggesting that erectile dysfunction symptoms may not be immediately recognized. When considered together, these factors suggest that for men who answered "no" or "unsure" in the current study and were identified as having erectile dysfunction by IIEF-EF score, the onset of erectile dysfunction symptoms may have been poorly understood, not recognized as erectile dysfunction, or may have been denied.

Men who answered "yes" to the screening question and had erectile dysfunction apparently recognized that they had this condition, but had not been previously diagnosed. This suggests that these men may not have been interested in or were reluctant to seek resolution or treatment for their erectile dysfunction. Some treatment-seeking barriers that may explain why men with recognized erectile dysfunction do not seek treatment for it include the belief that erectile dysfunction is a natural part of aging, concern about the side effects of or not wanting to take drugs, the belief that nothing can be done about erectile dysfunction, fear that the underlying condition causing erectile dysfunction may be serious, and the cost of treatment. One study found that men would prefer to purchase erectile dysfunction medications anonymously or wanted the medication to be available without a prescription, suggesting that men may feel embarrassed about purchasing erectile dysfunction medications.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) medication side effects—sexual dysfunction management: Sexual side effects affect a third or more of patients. Management approaches include dose reduction; waiting for the symptom to remit, which may occur within 2 months in about 10% of patients; trying a once-weekly, one-day drug holiday before sexual activity; switching to another SSRI; or adding a counteracting agent. Drug holidays may alleviate erection or orgasm but not libido, are not effective for fluoxetine and may induce withdrawal with paroxetine or venlafaxine, and taking drug holidays more than once weekly risks a return of OCD symptoms. Reported pharmacologic options include amantadine, bupropion, buspirone, yohimbine, Ginkgo biloba extract, ropinirole, stimulants, cyproheptadine, or mirtazapine; adding bupropion has the best evidence base but findings are mixed, and controlled trials support sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil to restore erection and orgasmic function.

Initially, when assessing the presenting complaint, and its immediate history the patient may spontaneously volunteer any sexual difficulties they have been experiencing. However, if this does not occur it may be possible to explore this by assessing whether past or current diagnoses, symptoms or treatments have impacted sexual functioning. When taking a developmental and family history, it may be possible to explore the impact of trauma, and/or the patient's sexual development a and sexual identity b on current sexual functioning. When returning to current circumstances and functioning, it may be possible to enquire about current relationships and sexual practices a. Finally, when concluding an assessment, it is often useful to ask open‐ended questions to ensure that nothing of importance has been overlooked and that all the relevant and necessary information has been gathered. It is important to note that (for a variety of reasons) it may not be appropriate to assess sexual functioning on every occasion and that if this area is not fully examined in one assessment it can be addressed at a later time.

FIGURE 2 
Key domains that should be addressed when assessing sexual functioning. This schematic shows the three key domains that should be addressed when assessing sexual functioning. Sexual interest includes sexual desire (libido), and changes in this domain can signify psychiatric disorders such as depression. The domain of general health includes physiological factors that can impact sexual functioning such as medications (e.g. antidepressants, diuretics, hormonal contraceptives), medical conditions (e.g. chronic diseases such as heart disease or diabetes), or other factors such as menopause. Finally, practices and behaviours should also be assessed, and these can be solo practices such as masturbation, or practices with a partner, such as intercourse. Within each domain, exemplar questions or statements have been included that can be used to tactfully approach each domain in an assessment, which can commence with any of the three domains depending on each patient and the circumstances of their consultation.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^e62cf172]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Management approach—shared decision-making and initial nonsurgical care: Treatment decisions should be made based on shared decision-making between the patient and clinician, with the patient informed of the risks, potential benefits, and treatment alternatives, and initial treatment should typically be nonsurgical (Clinical Principle). Individual patient factors, clinical judgment and patient preferences are the most important factors in treatment choice, and education, self-care, and behavioral modification are essential to any treatment plan; it is important to document treatment response at appropriate intervals to ensure only effective treatments are continued while ineffective treatments are ceased. It is essential to set reasonable expectations because very few patients achieve complete remission with elimination of pain, although most patients are able to achieve an acceptable QOL and good daily functioning; education regarding home rescue therapies (e.g., TENS unit, warm bath) and engagement of relevant comanaging specialists can reduce anxiety as symptoms fluctuate.

### The importance of sexuality, changes in erectile functioning and its association with self-esteem in men with localized prostate cancer: data from an observational study [^7a9e0d9d]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Men who are diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (PCa) have to choose among treatment options that differ considerably in their invasiveness, ranging from active surveillance (AS) to radical prostatectomy (RP). In AS, treatment is delayed until a predefined histological or biochemical disease progression occurs, or until the patient choses a different treatment strategy due to other reasons, for example, cancer-related anxiety. One of the most important reasons that men opt for AS is the possible impairment of sexual function as a side effect of invasive treatment. Negative effects of RP on sexual function compared to AS have been summarized in systematic reviews and were confirmed by the latest results from the randomized controlled trial ProtecT that compared RP to AS directly. Recent research has also highlighted a close association of PCa treatment and psychosexual outcomes, such as sexual bother and an impaired sense of masculinity. However, most studies dealing with sexuality in PCa patients still focus on the physiological aspects of sexuality despite the fact that an impairment of erectile function has far-reaching consequences on men’s quality of life. For most men, sexuality is a vital aspect of their male identity and an impairment of erectile functioning may also affect their self-esteem (i.e. men’s appraisal of their individual abilities combined with a sense of self-worth).

### Comparison of the simplified international index of erectile function (IIEF-5) in patients of erectile dysfunction with different pathophysiologies [^06f50bc2]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

ED is a serious and growing public health problem. The prevalence of ED increased with age. In most countries, a large proportion of patients visiting outpatient clinics were older than 40 years. However, our results indicated that the number of young (<40 years) ED patients were more than ones over 40 years (Table 1). Similar results were also obtained in several studies of Chinese ED patients. In a 5-year survey in 11 cities in China, Liu et al. found that most patients were younger than 50 years old (75.7% in 2003 and 74.5% in 2008). Another study in older (>40 years) patients in Beijing also showed that only 27.4% of them recognized ED as a disease, and just 12.1% visited their doctors. These were likely associated with more conservative culture in China.

ED has serious effects on men’s physical and mental health. According to different pathogenic mechanisms, ED has usually been classified as psychogenic, organic (ie, neurogenic, hormonal, vasculogenic, anatomic/structural, or drug-induced), or mixed psychogenic and organic causes. If ED is longstanding, this may build patient’s own world of fear, anxiety, worry, depression and distress around his disorder. Hence, the mixed form is generally regarded as the most common category in most studies. In this study, we also found that nearly half of subjects have combined different causes. Their combined causes are not necessarily the same with each other. Hence, it is not conducive to analyze the ED causes if this large number of patients all just classified as “the mixed form”. Therefore, the primary causes of subjects were studied in this investigation to avoid confusion in patients with mixed causes. The primary cause was determined by an experienced urologist or andrologist according to the comprehensive diagnostic procedures (for details see Methods and Additional file 1). It has been confirmed that the comprehensive procedures are superior in establishing the causes of ED. Under some circumstances doctors could not draw a clear distinction between the primary cause and the minor cause. These cases (176/3327, 5.3%) were excluded from present investigation. This proportion was similar to a study by Hatzichristou et al. (78/1276, 6.1%).

### Treatment (...) [^b4a8116a]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Causes and Related Conditions ED has vascular, neurologic, psychological, and hormonal causes. Conditions commonly associated with ED include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, testosterone deficiency, and prostate cancer treatment. 6–8 Performance anxiety and relationship issues are common psychological causes. MEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE Many medications cause or exacerbate ED. 9–12 Antidepressants are a common cause, especially the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline, and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. CVD ED and CVD share similar risk factors, including older age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, obesity, and diabetes. ED is associated with an increased risk of CVD, coronary artery disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality, and it is probably an independent risk factor for CVD.

Managing Psychogenic ED Many men have ED that is predominantly or exclusively caused by psychological or interpersonal factors. 65 Psychogenic ED occurs at all ages but is most common in men younger than 40 years. A thorough history can elicit potential causes such as performance anxiety and relationship conflicts, which distract attention and impair sexual arousal. Problems such as premature ejaculation, genital pain, or dyspareunia can lead to psychogenic ED, as can cultural or religious taboos or a history of sexual abuse. Although men and their partners may resist a psychological explanation for ED, counseling can be effective.
60. ED of mixed organic and psychogenic origin is common. Psychogenic causes are more likely when the patient has normal erections with masturbation or when nocturnal penile tumescence is normal. Devices are available to measure the number, duration, and rigidity of erections during sleep.

However, normal nocturnal erections do not always correlate with sexually relevant erections, and this test may be unreliable in older or anxious patients. 66 When ED coexists with depression or anxiety, treatment of the mood disorder may be the most appropriate first step. If antidepressants are used, the specific agent should be one that is less likely to worsen ED. PDE-5 inhibitors are effective in men with depression and can be used in combination with treatments for mood disorders.

### Specificity of anhedonic depression and anxious arousal with sexual problems among sexually healthy young adults [^3f88ef19]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Past research has suggested that depression and anxiety are similarly associated with sexual problems. However, methodological limitations may have hindered the ability of prior studies to detect potential specificity between depression and anxiety with distinct sexual problems. Specifically, previous studies have frequently used measures that confound depression and anxiety, focused exclusively on populations with medical complications, and failed to account for the iatrogenic effects of antidepressants.

Aim

Clark and Watson's tripartite model was used to differentiate anxious and depressive symptoms and examine their associations with indices of sexual functioning. Specifically, we examined how general distress, anxious arousal, and anhedonia are differentially related to sexual desire, arousal, erection and lubrication difficulties, orgasm achievement, pain, satisfaction, avoidance, pleasure, concerns, and sexual self-image.

Methods

In a cross-sectional study, 1,258 young men and women completed the Female Sexual Function Index, Male Sexual Function Index (adapted for the current investigation), Profile of Female Sexual Function, and Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire.

Results

Zero-order correlations revealed some specificity between the three affective constructs, as they were associated with sexual problems. However, multiple regression analyses revealed clearer patterns, showing that anhedonic depression was more uniquely related to most sexual problems among women, whereas the relations of anxiety and depression with male sexual problems were more mixed.

Discussion

This study of young subjects not identified to have affective or sexual disorders suggests that specificity exists between depression and anxiety as they relate to sexual functioning, and that this specificity varies between genders. Such findings highlight the importance of considering the unique influences of anxiety and depression in the conceptualization and treatment of sexual dysfunction.

### Short-term intracavernous self-injection treatment of psychogenic erectile dysfunction secondary to sexual performance anxiety in unconsummated marriages [^9f9d1ac9]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Our perspective

During recent years the Clinic of Sexual Health has focused on treatment of younger men from traditional Muslim communities diagnosed with psychogenic ED, secondary to sexual performance anxiety. All of the men in the current case series had no sexual experience (apart from one previously married) and all reported on unconsummated marriages and sought treatment on an average of 18 months (range 1–3 years) after their wedding. In unresolved psychogenic ED the vicious cycle of sexual performance anxiety frequently results in the loss of sexual or affectionate interaction, which is associated with increased performance demands and interpersonal distress.

In these cases of psychogenic ED, following previous treatment failure with PDE5 inhibitors, we offered the couples a simple, inexpensive, short term intervention: a brief course of ICI of vasoactive drugs. Patients reported good erection after one to two treatments with intracavernous self-injection leading to successful sexual intercourse. Due to successful ICI therapy, our patients experienced resumption of spontaneous erections, most probably due to the resolution of performance anxiety, therefore they no longer had need for further treatment. Thus, they effectively ended the cycle of sexual performance anxiety, which led in these couples to an improved sexual quality of life. As such, ICI therapy may have, in addition to improving their sexual life, also contributed to their quality of life, possibly even preempting feelings of marriage failure and depression.

Societies in which couples have enough opportunity for premarital sex, rarely report on unconsummated marriage. In contrast, in traditional and conservative societies, premarital sex is strictly prohibited and is considered scandalous and an insult to the family honor, therefore, the majority of current publications on unconsummated marriage originate from Eastern or Middle Eastern countries as Iran, Turkey, Tunisia, and Egypt. Indeed, in many of these reports, psychogenic ED was considered to be the major etiological factor of unconsummated marriage, secondary to performance anxiety. Previous similar studies with young males from traditional conservative populations diagnosed with ED also recognized secondary sexual performance anxiety, thus chose ICI therapy.

While we demonstrated that a brief course (1-2 self-injections) of ICI was sufficient in all patients to overcome the psychogenic barriers of sexual performance anxiety, other studies with similar populations reported up to 30% required 3 or 4 ICI treatments.

### Erectile physiological and pathophysiological pathways involved in erectile dysfunction [^ab642a2f]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

The importance of signaling pathways in penile smooth muscles involved in normal erection and erectile dysfunction (ED) is discussed based on a review of the literature.

Materials and Methods

Erection is basically a spinal reflex that can be initiated by recruitment of penile afferents but also by visual, olfactory and imaginary stimuli. The generated nervous signals will influence the balance between the contractant and relaxant factors, which control the degree of contraction of penile smooth muscles and, thus, determine the functional state of the penis. The different steps involved in neurotransmission, impulse propagation and intracellular transduction of neural signals may be changed in different types of erectile dysfunction.

Results

Recent findings have suggested an important role for RhoA/Rho kinase in the regulation of cavernosal smooth muscle tone and that changes in this pathway may contribute to ED in various patient subgroups, eg diabetes and vascular disease. Neurogenic nitric oxide is still considered the most important factor for immediate relaxation of penile vessels and corpus cavernosum. However, endothelially generated nitric oxide seems essential for maintaining erection. Endothelial dysfunction can contribute to ED in several patient subgroups. In addition, in conditions associated with reduced function of nerves and endothelium, such as aging, hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, circulatory and structural changes in the penile tissues can result in arterial insufficiency and defect muscle relaxation.

Conclusions

Different types of ED often have overlapping pathophysiologies but may also have common pathways contributing to ED. Such pathways may be potential treatment targets.

### Exercise therapy for sexual dysfunction after prostate cancer [^335b0047]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2013). Medium credibility.

Sexual dysfunction is one of the most common, distressing and persistent adverse effects of prostate cancer treatment, and has a profound effect on quality of life for the patient and his partner. Current health-care provisions are inadequate to address the demand for the management of sexual dysfunction, with approximately half of prostate cancer survivors reporting unmet sexual health-care needs. Management strategies predominately involve pharmacological interventions to address the direct physiological effects of prostate cancer treatment on erectile function. However, the aetiology of sexual dysfunction is multifaceted and considerable physiological and psychological adverse effects of prostate cancer treatments, which are not addressed by pharmacological intervention, contribute to sexual dysfunction. Exercise has established efficacy for improving many of these factors in men with prostate cancer, including changes in body composition (especially to counteract body feminization), fatigue, physical function, risk of comorbid conditions, depression, anxiety and quality of life. Emerging evidence indicates that exercise also has a positive effect on sexual desire and sexual activity in men with prostate cancer.
