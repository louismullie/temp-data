## Question

High-intensity NIPPV in acute COPD exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether high-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) should be used in acute COPD exacerbations with hypercapnia, and how to reconcile conflicting trial signals with guideline positions and practical implementation details. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the standard of care for NIPPV in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Then, I should verify the definition of "high-intensity" NIPPV and the key randomized trial evidence. Next, I will examine the primary and secondary outcomes, including intubation criteria versus actual intubation and adverse effects. After that, I need to check how guidelines interpret this evidence and where they align or diverge. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and note uncertainties and alternatives like high-flow nasal therapy and helmet interfaces, before stating a cautious, evidence-based conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline standard of care. In acute COPD exacerbations with acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis, NIPPV is first-line ventilatory support to improve gas exchange, reduce work of breathing, lower intubation risk, shorten hospital stay, and improve survival, provided there are no absolute contraindications, and this is consistently endorsed by GOLD and ERS/ATS guidance [^115zhq1a] [^111N61dN] [^112iKm5c].

> Now, I need to define what "high-intensity" NIPPV means in this setting. High-intensity strategies target larger tidal volumes, typically 10–15 mL/kg predicted body weight, by using higher inspiratory pressures and sometimes higher backup rates to more aggressively augment alveolar ventilation and reduce PaCO2, contrasting with low-intensity approaches targeting 6–10 mL/kg predicted body weight; this concept is supported by physiologic and chronic NIV literature and operationalized in the pivotal HAPPEN trial protocol [^11135pUz] [^111m6pEb].

> Next, I should review the pivotal randomized evidence. The HAPPEN trial enrolled patients with AECOPD and persistent hypercapnia after 6 hours of low-intensity NIPPV and randomized them to high-intensity versus continued low-intensity NIPPV. The primary outcome was meeting prespecified criteria for intubation, which occurred in 4.8% with high-intensity versus 13.7% with low-intensity, an absolute reduction of 9.0% with a one-sided P value of 0.004, suggesting benefit on the composite intubation-criteria endpoint [^111m6pEb] [^112qU2uW].

> Wait, let me verify the actual intubation rates because that's what clinicians care about most. The observed intubation rate was 3.4% with high-intensity versus 3.9% with low-intensity, and this difference was not statistically significant, likely attenuated by a protocolized crossover from low to high intensity when deterioration occurred. Thus, the trial shows a reduction in intubation criteria but no statistically significant reduction in actual intubations, which tempers enthusiasm despite the primary endpoint signal [^111m6pEb] [^112qU2uW].

> I should double-check safety and tolerability. Abdominal distension was significantly more frequent with high-intensity NIPPV (37.4% vs 25.5%), and serious adverse events were similar between groups, indicating that higher pressures can worsen aerophagia and bloating without a clear increase in major complications. This trade-off matters for comfort and adherence during prolonged sessions [^111m6pEb] [^112qU2uW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check how guidelines position this. GOLD 2025 continues to recommend NIPPV as first-line in AECOPD with acute respiratory failure but does not specifically endorse high-intensity settings, reflecting that the HAPPEN signal is promising yet not definitive for hard outcomes. ERS/ATS similarly support NIPPV broadly without specifying intensity targets, and contemporary reviews highlight uncertainty pending replication and standardization of "high-intensity" protocols [^115zhq1a] [^111N61dN] [^113tpf85].

> Let me consider the broader evidence base to avoid overgeneralization. Classic meta-analyses and Cochrane reviews show robust reductions in mortality and intubation with NIPPV versus usual care in AECOPD, but they do not isolate intensity strategies; thus, the core benefit of NIPPV is established, while the incremental value of high-intensity settings remains hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing at this time [^113ECmdx] [^115GNgHM].

> I will now examine practical implementation if a clinician elects to trial higher-intensity settings. Start with standard low-intensity parameters and escalate IPAP toward 18–24 cm H2O if hypercapnia and acidosis persist, monitor for aerophagia and discomfort, and be prepared to adjust the interface or settings. Maximize daily NIPPV hours early, reassess ABGs frequently, and maintain a low threshold to escalate to invasive ventilation if pH, respiratory rate, or mental status worsen despite optimization [^111XRycb] [^116tU8wG] [^1175BsF6].

> But wait, what if NIPPV is not tolerated or unavailable. High-velocity nasal insufflation (HVNI) has shown noninferiority to NIPPV for short-term dyspnea relief in moderate hypercapnic AECOPD in the ED, with better comfort in some studies, though it is not yet a replacement for NIPPV in severe acidosis; similarly, helmet interfaces may improve tolerance but are less efficient at CO2 removal than facemasks, so they should be considered case-by-case rather than as default [^113YN6Jd] [^111sy7wH] [^114WwmFa].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. High-intensity NIPPV reduced the likelihood of meeting intubation criteria in a well-conducted RCT of persistent hypercapnia after a brief low-intensity trial, but it did not significantly reduce actual intubations and increased abdominal distension. Therefore, it is reasonable to escalate to higher pressures in selected, closely monitored patients who fail to improve with standard settings, while recognizing that current guidelines have not yet adopted high-intensity targets as standard and that replication is needed before routine implementation [^111m6pEb] [^113tpf85].

> Final synthesis: High-intensity NIPPV is a promising, physiology-guided rescue strategy for AECOPD with persistent hypercapnia after an initial low-intensity trial, with a likely reduction in intubation-criteria events but no proven reduction in actual intubations and with more abdominal distension. Use it selectively with careful monitoring, continue to prioritize early NIPPV initiation and guideline-based care, and escalate promptly to invasive ventilation if the patient deteriorates despite optimization [^111m6pEb] [^115zhq1a] [^1175BsF6].

High-intensity NIPPV is appropriate for acute COPD exacerbations with **persistent hypercapnia** [^111m6pEb] after 6 hours of low-intensity NIPPV, as it reduces the need for intubation [^111m6pEb] and improves gas exchange [^115zhq1a]. It is not first-line; start with **low-intensity NIPPV** [^115zhq1a] and escalate only if hypercapnia persists or worsens. High-intensity NIPPV increases abdominal distension [^111m6pEb] but not serious adverse events [^111m6pEb]; monitor closely and adjust settings as needed [^116tU8wG]. Use high-intensity NIPPV when PaCO2 remains > 45 mmHg despite optimal low-intensity settings, and avoid in patients with poor mask fit, severe hemodynamic instability, or inability to tolerate higher pressures [^111m6pEb].

---

## Definition and settings of high-intensity NIPPV

High-intensity NIPPV uses **higher inspiratory pressures** and larger tidal volumes (10–15 mL/kg PBW) [^111m6pEb] to improve alveolar ventilation and reduce PaCO2. Typical settings include:

- **IPAP**: 18–25 cm H₂O (titrate to tidal volume 10–15 mL/kg PBW)
- **EPAP**: 4–6 cm H₂O
- **Backup rate**: 12–16 breaths/min
- **Tidal volume target**: 10–15 mL/kg PBW

---

## Clinical evidence supporting high-intensity NIPPV

The HAPPEN randomized trial [^111m6pEb] showed that high-intensity NIPPV reduced the need for intubation versus low-intensity NIPPV (4.8% vs 13.7%; absolute difference −9.0%; 95% CI −15.4% to −2.5%; P = 0.004) in patients with persistent hypercapnia after 6 hours of low-intensity NIPPV. Actual intubation rates were similar (3.4% vs 3.9%; P = 0.81), likely due to crossover from low to high intensity. High-intensity NIPPV improved gas exchange and reduced work of breathing without increasing serious adverse events, though **abdominal distension** was more frequent (37.4% vs 25.5%) [^111m6pEb].

---

## Indications for high-intensity NIPPV

High-intensity NIPPV is indicated for acute COPD exacerbations with **persistent hypercapnia** (PaCO2 > 45 mmHg) despite 6 hours of optimized low-intensity NIPPV [^111m6pEb]. It is not first-line; start with low-intensity NIPPV and escalate only if hypercapnia persists or worsens [^113tpf85].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications and precautions include:

- **Absolute contraindications**: Respiratory arrest, severe hemodynamic instability, inability to protect airway, severe facial trauma, recent upper gastrointestinal surgery, active upper GI bleeding, excessive secretions, severe vomiting, untreated pneumothorax [^notfound].
- **Relative contraindications**: Severe cognitive impairment, inability to tolerate mask, severe obesity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea.
- **Precautions**: Monitor for abdominal distension, discomfort, and mask leaks; adjust settings as needed [^116tU8wG].

---

## Comparison with low-intensity NIPPV

| **Parameter** | **High-intensity NIPPV** | **Low-intensity NIPPV** |
|-|-|-|
| IPAP | 18–25 cm H2O | 10–15 cm H2O |
| Tidal volume | 10–15 mL/kg PBW | 6–10 mL/kg PBW |
| Intubation criteria | Lower (4.8%) | Higher (13.7%) |
| Abdominal distension | More frequent (37.4%) | Less frequent (25.5%) |
| Clinical outcomes | Improved gas exchange; reduced intubation criteria | Standard care; may be insufficient in persistent hypercapnia |

---

High-intensity NIPPV is superior to low-intensity NIPPV for **persistent hypercapnia** [^111m6pEb], but it carries a higher risk of abdominal distension [^112qU2uW].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

High-intensity NIPPV improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing, and lowers intubation criteria without increasing serious adverse events [^111m6pEb]. The main complication is **abdominal distension** (37.4%), which is usually manageable with adjustments [^111m6pEb].

---

## Patient selection criteria

High-intensity NIPPV is best suited for patients with:

- **Persistent hypercapnia** (PaCO2 > 45 mmHg) after 6 hours of optimized low-intensity NIPPV [^111m6pEb].
- **Moderate-to-severe acidosis** (pH 7.20–7.35).
- **Good tolerance** of higher pressures and larger tidal volumes.
- **No contraindications** to NIPPV [^115DGFBa].

---

## Practical implementation and monitoring

- **Initial settings**: Start with low-intensity NIPPV (IPAP 10–15 cm H2O, EPAP 4–6 cm H2O) and titrate to patient comfort and gas exchange targets [^112QsjVL].
- **Escalation**: If PaCO2 remains > 45 mmHg after 6 hours, increase IPAP to 18–25 cm H2O and target tidal volume 10–15 mL/kg PBW [^111m6pEb].
- **Monitoring**: Track respiratory rate, tidal volume, gas exchange, comfort, and complications; adjust settings and interface as needed [^116tU8wG].
- **Discontinuation**: Wean once PaCO2 normalizes, pH improves, and the patient is stable on low-intensity settings [^1119HCQq].

---

High-intensity NIPPV is appropriate for acute COPD exacerbations with **persistent hypercapnia** after low-intensity NIPPV, improving gas exchange and reducing intubation criteria [^111m6pEb]. It is not first-line; escalate only if hypercapnia persists, and monitor for abdominal distension and tolerance issues [^111m6pEb].

Objective

The frequency of home ventilation has increased greatly. The objective of the study was, first, to compare the outcome of episodes of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with mask intermittent positive-pressure ventilation (MIPPV) in patients with home MIPPV and in patients without home ventilatory support and, second, for each category of patients, to compare patients successfully ventilated with MIPPV with those who failed with MIPPV.

Design

Prospective, controlled, nonrandomized clinical study.

Setting

Medical intensive care unit of a university hospital.

Patients

In the groups with and without home MIPPV, respectively, 31 and 78 episodes of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were studied.

Interventions

MIPPV was performed in a sequential mode and delivered through a full-face mask with a bilevel positive airway pressure system.

Measurements and Main Results

The clinical and functional characteristics of the two groups, at admission, were similar. In groups with and without home ventilation, respectively, success rates were 68% and 72% (p = .68), length of intensive care unit stay was 8 ± 6 and 10 ± 4 days (p = .02), and intensive care unit deaths were 13% and 8% (p = .30). In survivors and in groups with and without home ventilation, respectively, the total time of ventilatory assistance in intensive care unit was 5 ± 4 and 8 ± 4 days (p = .004), and the length of intensive care unit stay was 7 ± 5 and 10 ± 4 days (p = .003). A greater correction of pH, after 45 mins of MIPPV with optimal settings, was recorded in the success patients than in the failure patients, respectively; in the group with home MIPPV, the pH after 45 mins was 7.34 ± 0.04 vs. 7.31 ± 0.04 (p = .06), and in the group without home MIPPV, pH was 7.34 ± 0.04 vs. 7.30 ± 0.04 (p = .001).

Conclusion

MIPPV may also be favorable during episodes of acute exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Experience with MIPPV could benefit selected patients in the management of acute respiratory failure.

Search strategy

Our search strategy was multifaceted and comprehensive, incorporating a range of relevant terms to ensure that all pertinent studies were identified. We combined keywords such as non-invasive ventilation, NIV, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and variable positive airway pressure (VPAP) with terms related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, including COPD, pulmonary disease, and pulmonary emphysema. Additionally, we utilized Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms to further enhance the sensitivity of our search. To identify potential studies for inclusion, two reviewers (LZ and CL) conducted an independent evaluation of article titles, abstracts, and full texts. This rigorous process allowed us to carefully assess the relevance and eligibility of each study. In instances where discrepancies arose between the two reviewers, a senior researcher (JY) was engaged to facilitate resolution through discussion and consensus. Furthermore, to ensure that our search was exhaustive, we manually searched the reference lists of relevant studies to identify additional articles that may have been missed through our database search. This supplementary search strategy enabled us to capture a broader range of studies and increase the comprehensiveness of our review. The details of our search strategy, including the specific terms and databases used, are outlined in Table 1.

Data extraction process

Following the identification of articles meeting the inclusion criteria, we systematically extracted relevant data using a standardized data extraction form, capturing key study characteristics and outcomes, including study details (author, year, design), intervention and comparator specifics (NIV intervention and control group details), follow-up duration, COPD phase (stable or post-exacerbation), participant demographics (age), exacerbation information (rates, frequency, severity), and physiological measures (PaCO2 levels), ensuring consistency and accuracy in data extraction to facilitate systematic analysis of included studies.

Data items

We analyzed key outcomes, including mortality, exacerbation rates, intubation rates, and arterial blood gas parameters (PaCO2 and PaO2 levels), comparing the NIV intervention group with the control group. To ensure accuracy and reliability, two researchers (LZ and CL) independently extracted relevant data, including patient demographics and event data, from the selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using a predefined data extraction form, thereby minimizing errors and ensuring consistency in data collection and analysis.

Introduction

COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world and is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Despite progress in the treatment of symptoms and prevention of acute exacerbations, few advances have been made to ameliorate disease progression or decrease mortality. To date, the only therapeutic interventions known to reduce mortality in COPD are smoking cessation and long-term treatment with continuous supplemental oxygen for patients who have severe hypoxemia at rest.

Since the development of NIV, there has been interest in its use for the treatment of patients with COPD and chronic stable hypercapnia. During acute exacerbations with ventilatory failure, NIV is frequently used because it has been shown to improve survival (reviewed in Reference). However, there have been fewer studies addressing the use of chronic domiciliary, nocturnal NIV for stable hypercapnic COPD. Most older studies were small and/or used modest driving pressures in an attempt to normalize gas exchange, improve symptoms, and reduce morbidity and mortality. More recently, however, interest in the use of NIV in chronic hypercapnic COPD has been renewed with studies of so-called "high-intensity" NIV, which refers to inspiratory pressures higher than those used in most previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as controlled ventilation with higher-than-baseline respiratory rates to maximally reduce the PaCO₂.

Thus, in stable patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnia (defined as FEV₁/FVC < 0.70; resting PaCO₂ > 45 mm Hg; not during exacerbation), long-term NIV has the potential to improve physiological parameters (e.g. lung function or gas exchange), clinical symptoms (e.g. functional capacity, dyspnea, quality of life [QOL], and sleep quality) and patient-centered outcomes (e.g. hospital readmission and survival).

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to summarize the available evidence and provide actionable recommendations addressing 1) patients with COPD, especially potential subgroups who might benefit from NIV therapy; 2) the ideal timing and location (e.g. hospital or sleep laboratory vs. home) for NIV initiation; and 3) the identification of optimal modes and settings for chronic NIV therapy.

Pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) as an adjunct: NPPV used with exercise-based pulmonary rehabilitation appears to augment exercise effects, with benefits most marked in severe COPD and potential for greater gains with higher positive pressures, and adding NPPV during sleep with rehabilitation in severe COPD results in improved exercise tolerance and quality of life. Because NPPV is difficult and labor-intensive, feasibility may be limited to experienced institutions and to individuals who have demonstrated benefit, more likely those with severely impaired lung function; in hospitalized patients early after an acute exacerbation, a goal is inspiratory pressures of greater than 10 cm H2O subject to tolerance.

Management of exacerbations — ventilatory support and recovery course: Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival; exacerbation recovery time varies, taking up to 4–6 weeks to recover, with some patients failing to return to the pre-exacerbation functional state, and following an exacerbation appropriate measures for exacerbation prevention should be initiated.

High-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) — COPD exacerbations and hypercapnia: HFNT delivers heated and humidified air-oxygen blends via special devices at rates up to 8 L/min in infants and up to 60 L/min in adults and has been associated with decreased respiratory rate and effort, decreased work of breathing, improved gas exchange, improved lung volume and dynamic compliance, and improved oxygenation and clinical outcomes in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. In COPD with hypercapnia, HFNT has been reported to improve oxygenation and ventilation, decrease hypercarbia and improve health-related quality of life during an acute exacerbation and in select patients with stable hypercapnic COPD, although interpretation is limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneity, and short follow-up. HFNT did not prevent intubation in a randomized controlled trial in patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation. The European Respiratory Society Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend trialling NIV prior to use of HFNT in patients with COPD and hypercapnic ARF, and there is a stated need for well-designed, prospective, randomized and controlled multicenter trials to study HFNT effects in acute or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.

DISCUSSION

In this randomized clinical trial that included 68 adult patients in the ED with respiratory distress due to acute exacerbation of COPD, patients treated with HVNI had a dyspnea score of 3.17, while patients treated with NiPPV had a dyspnea score of 3.34 after 4 h of treatment, indicating a noninferior difference (p = 0.03). This finding correlated with other measures of respiratory distress, such as intubation rates, changes in respiratory rate, and changes in pCO 2 and pH. Despite there being no significant improvement seen in the patients treated with HVNI, we similarly did not see a significant advantage with NiPPV when comparing measures of respiratory distress. All values for respiratory distress, such as intubation rates and changes in pCO 2 and pH, were all not statistically different between the two treatment groups. Since the findings of this study suggest that HVNI is noinferior to NiPPV in relieving dyspnea within 4 h in COPD patients presenting to the ED primarily with uncomplicated acute hypercapnia, we believe these findings warrant further investigation into the usage of HVNI in patients with acute COPD exacerbation.

NiPPV has long been recommended for ED management of patients with COPD who show respiratory acidosis or hypoxia. The use of NiPPV has increased since its introduction in the 1980s and has contributed to a reduced overall mortality from acute exacerbations of COPD. Early management with NIPPV is associated with reduced need for endotracheal intubation as well as reduced mortality for COPD patients. However, an alternative to NiPPV is required because between 5% and 30% of patients with hypercapnic COPD do not tolerate NiPPV.

Multiple physiological studies have assessed the effectiveness of HVNI or a similar technology known as high‐flow nasal insufflation. The use of HVNI has shown physiological improvements in respiratory rate and pCO 2. In general, the physiological benefits of HVNI appear to be due to its ability to wash out the anatomical dead space and generate positive end‐expiratory pressure. Although HVNI has been found to be effective in improving gas exchange and reducing the work of breathing, its ability to address hypercapnic respiratory distress is controversial.

Evidence supporting a reduction in mortality with pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy in COPD patients — randomized clinical trial (RCT) data show that single inhaler triple therapy compared to dual long-acting bronchodilator (LABD) therapy achieved a relative risk reduction with IMPACT: HR 0.72 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.99) and ETHOS: HR 0.51 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.80) in symptomatic people with a history of frequent and/or severe exacerbations. For smoking cessation, the hazard ratio for the usual care group compared to the intervention group was HR 1.18 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.37). Pulmonary rehabilitation showed mortality effects with old trials RR 0.28 (95% CI 0.10, 0.84) and new trials RR 0.68 (95% CI 0.28, 1.67) in patients hospitalized for exacerbations of COPD (during or ≤ 4 weeks after discharge). Long-term oxygen therapy demonstrated NOTT: ≥ 19 hours of continuous oxygen vs ≤ 13 hours: 50% reduction and MRC: ≥ 15 hours vs no oxygen: 50% reduction among patients with PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or < 60 mmHg with cor pulmonale or secondary polycythemia. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) reported 12% in NPPV (high inspiratory positive airway pressure [IPAP] level) and 33% control HR 0.24 (95% CI 0.11, 0.49) in stable COPD with marked hypercapnia, and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) yielded 0.07 deaths/person-year (LVRS) vs 0.15 deaths/ person-year (UC) RR for death 0.47 (p = 0.005).

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] is a significant health burden worldwide and is currently the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019. It is estimated to be the seventh and tenth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years in high-income and low- middle-income countries, respectively. Globally, the COPD burden is projected to increase in the coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and the aging of the population5.

Acute exacerbations of COPD [aeCOPD] are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, ranging between 8 to 26% in patients admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU]. 20% to 60% of these patients receive ventilatory support to decrease work of breathing and restore adequate gas exchange with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [NPPV], which has been shown to reduce mortality significantly and or the need for invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV].

Previous observational data have shown that among patients hospitalized for aeCOPD, the use of NPPV has increased significantly over time, and the need for IMV and in-hospital mortality has declined. Conversely, patients failing NPPV and transitioning to IMV have the highest in-hospital mortality and the most expensive and most extended hospitalizations.

However, data on the use and clinical impact of NPPV and IMV in aeCOPD are from studies restricted to one country and over a short period, potentially precluding the global generalizability of the results. In addition, several aspects of the ventilatory management of critically ill patients have been shown to differ over time across ICUs and countries, leading to considerable clinical variability and, therefore, raising the question of whether these differences impact patient outcomes around the world.

The International Study Group on Mechanical Ventilation [VENTILAGROUP] carried out a worldwide observational study to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients receiving IMV or NPPV in 1998, 2004, 2010, and 2016, using the same methodological approach in the four patient cohorts, which include patients with aeCOPD. This is the only study that has investigated the potential change in the management and clinical outcomes of aeCOPD based on data from different countries worldwide over about two decades.

The objective of this study was to estimate whether mortality in patients with aeCOPD admitted to the ICU for respiratory support has changed over time across different countries and to identify factors associated with failure of NPPV and duration of IMV.

Oxygen therapy and ventilatory support in stable COPD — core effects and indications: The long-term administration of oxygen increases survival in patients with severe chronic resting arterial hypoxemia (Evidence A). In patients with stable COPD and moderate resting or exercise-induced arterial desaturation, prescription of long-term oxygen does not lengthen time to death or first hospitalization or provide sustained benefit in health status, lung function and 6-minute walk distance (Evidence A). Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may improve hospitalization-free survival in selected patients after recent hospitalization, particularly in those with pronounced daytime persistent hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 53 mmHg) (Evidence B), and in patients with severe chronic hypercapnia and a history of hospitalization for acute respiratory failure, long-term noninvasive ventilation may be considered (Evidence B).

### High-velocity nasal insufflation versus noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^112moTWA]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, high‐velocity nasal insufflation was noninferior to noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in reducing subjective dyspnea at 4 h in ED patients presenting with moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, we found that patients treated with high‐velocity nasal insufflation had similar pH and pCO 2 levels to noninvasive positive pressure ventilation–treated patients. Based on these data it is reasonable to use high‐velocity nasal insufflation in patients with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, especially when noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is not tolerated.

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117M3tSj]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of noninvasive ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure unrelated to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and bibliographies of articles were retrieved inception until June 2016.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials comparing application of noninvasive ventilation with standard oxygen therapy in adults with acute hypoxemic nonhypercapnic respiratory failure were included. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and cardiogenic pulmonary edema patients were excluded. The primary outcome was intubation rate; ICU mortality and hospital mortality were secondary outcomes.

Data Extraction

Demographic variables, noninvasive ventilation application, and outcomes were retrieved. Internal validity was assessed using the risk of bias tool. The strength of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology.

Data Synthesis

Eleven studies (1,480 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed by using a random effects model. Compared with standard oxygen therapy, the pooled effect showed that noninvasive ventilation significantly reduced intubation rate with a summary risk ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.44–0.79; p = 0.0004). Furthermore, hospital mortality was also significantly reduced (risk ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.24–0.87; p = 0.02). Subgroup meta-analysis showed that the application of bilevel positive support ventilation (bilevel positive airway pressure) was associated with a reduction in ICU mortality (p = 0.007). Helmet noninvasive ventilation could reduce hospital mortality (p = 0.0004), whereas face/nasal mask noninvasive ventilation could not.

Conclusions

Noninvasive ventilation decreased endotracheal intubation rates and hospital mortality in acute hypoxemia nonhypercapnic respiratory failure excluding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and cardiogenic pulmonary edema patients. There is no sufficient scientific evidence to recommend bilevel positive airway pressure or helmet due to the limited number of trials available. Large rigorous randomized trials are needed to answer these questions definitely.

### High-velocity nasal insufflation versus noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^1144ZhYB]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the emergency department (ED) involve dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort; frequent exacerbations are associated with increased mortality and reduced quality of life. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) is commonly used to help relieve symptoms but is limited due to patient intolerance. We aimed to determine whether high-velocity nasal insufflation (HVNI) is noninferior to NiPPV in relieving dyspnea within 4h in ED patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Methods

This randomized control trial was conducted in seven EDs in the United States. Symptomatic patients with suspected COPD, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO₂) ≥ 60mmHg, and venous pH7.0–7.35 were randomized to receive HVNI (n = 36) or NiPPV (n = 32). The primary outcome was dyspnea severity 4h after the initiation of study intervention, as measured by the Borg score. Secondary outcomes included vital signs, oxygen saturation, venous pCO 2, venous pH, patient discomfort level, and need for endotracheal intubation.

Results

Sixty-eight patients were randomized between November 5, 2020, and May 10, 2023 (mean age 65.6years; 47% women). The initial pCO₂ was 77.7 ± 13.6mmHg versus 76.5 ± 13.6mmHg and the initial venous pH was 7.27 ± 0.063 versus 7.27 ± 0.043 in the HVNI and NiPPV groups, respectively. Dyspnea was similar in the HVNI and NiPPV groups at baseline (dyspnea scale score 5.4 ± 2.93 and 5.6 ± 2.41) and HVNI was noninferior to NiPPV at the following time points: 30min (3.97 ± 2.82 and 4.54 ± 1.65, p = 0.006), 60min (3.09 ± 2.70 and 4.07 ± 1.77, p < 0.001), and 4h (3.17 ± 2.59 and 3.34 ± 2.04, p = 0.03). At 4h, there was no difference between the groups in the pCO₂ mmHg (68.76 and 67.29, p = 0.63). Patients reported better overall comfort levels in the HVNI group at 30min, 60min, and 4h (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

In participants with symptomatic COPD, HVNI was noninferior to NiPPV in relieving dyspnea 4h after therapy initiation. HVNI may be a reasonable treatment option for some patients experiencing moderate acute exacerbations of COPD in the ED.

### Association of home noninvasive positive pressure ventilation with clinical outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115wPEai]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The association of home noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercapnia is uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate the association of home NIPPV via bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) devices and noninvasive home mechanical ventilator (HMV) devices with clinical outcomes and adverse events in patients with COPD and hypercapnia.

Data Sources

Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Central Registrar of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Scopus for English-language articles published from January 1, 1995, to November 6, 2019.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and comparative observational studies that enrolled adults with COPD with hypercapnia who used home NIPPV for more than 1 month were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction was completed by independent pairs of reviewers. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool for RCTs and select items from the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for nonrandomized studies.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were mortality, all-cause hospital admissions, need for intubation, and quality of life at the longest follow-up.

Results

A total of 21 RCTs and 12 observational studies evaluating 51 085 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.7 [2.1] years; 43% women) were included, among whom there were 434 deaths and 27 patients who underwent intubation. BPAP compared with no device was significantly associated with lower risk of mortality (22.31% vs 28.57%; risk difference [RD], -5.53% [95% CI, -10.29% to -0.76%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.51–0.87]; p = 0.003; 13 studies; 1423 patients; strength of evidence [SOE], moderate), fewer patients with all-cause hospital admissions (39.74% vs 75.00%; RD, -35.26% [95% CI, -49.39% to -21.12%]; OR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.11–0.43]; P < .001; 1 study; 166 patients; SOE, low), and lower need for intubation (5.34% vs 14.71%; RD, -8.02% [95% CI, -14.77% to -1.28%]; OR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.14–0.83]; p = 0.02; 3 studies; 267 patients; SOE, moderate). There was no significant difference in the total number of all-cause hospital admissions (rate ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.71–1.17]; p = 0.47; 5 studies; 326 patients; SOE, low) or quality of life (standardized mean difference, 0.16 [95% CI, -0.06 to 0.39]; p = 0.15; 9 studies; 833 patients; SOE, insufficient). Noninvasive HMV use compared with no device was significantly associated with fewer all-cause hospital admissions (rate ratio, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.35–0.71]; P < .001; 1 study; 93 patients; SOE, low), but not mortality (21.84% vs 34.09%; RD, -11.99% [95% CI, -24.77% to 0.79%]; OR,0.56 [95% CI, 0.29–1.08]; p = 0.49; 2 studies; 175 patients; SOE, insufficient). There was no statistically significant difference in the total number of adverse events in patients using NIPPV compared with no device (0.18 vs 0.17 per patient; p = 0.84; 6 studies; 414 patients).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis of patients with COPD and hypercapnia, home BPAP, compared with no device, was associated with lower risk of mortality, all-cause hospital admission, and intubation, but no significant difference in quality of life. Noninvasive HMV, compared with no device, was significantly associated with lower risk of hospital admission, but there was no significant difference in mortality risk. However, the evidence was low to moderate in quality, the evidence on quality of life was insufficient, and the analyses for some outcomes were based on small numbers of studies.

### High flow nasal oxygen at home to prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations? [^1125i63H]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The natural history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by recurrent exacerbations leading to lung function decline and reducing quality of life with an increased risk of early death. Even though there is no strong evidence that long-term oxygen using conventional oxygen therapy is beneficial to reduce mortality and need for hospital admission, a new approach using high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) as long-term treatment at home could be beneficial.

Although HFNC is widely used in intensive care units for management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and is now recommended in most recent clinical practice guidelines, few clinical trials have assessed HFNC for acute exacerbation of COPD or as long-term treatment at home.

However, several physiological studies have shown beneficial effects of HFNC in hypercapnic patients, as a flow-dependent clearance of carbon dioxide of the upper airways, contributing to the reduction of anatomical dead space ventilation and carbon dioxide rebreathing. Breathing pattern is improved with increased Vs and decreased respiratory rate, resulting in increased alveolar ventilation and reduced neuro-ventilatory drive and work of breathing. HFNC also helps to generate positive end-expiratory pressure effect, thereby counterbalancing flow-limited intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure and further decreasing work of breathing. All of these physiological effects suggest potential benefits of HFNC in patients with acute moderate exacerbation of COPD, and several studies have shown that it may reverse respiratory acidosis and improve prognosis. In addition, HFNC may have long-term effects promoting respiratory muscle recovery and through the conditioning of inspired gas, i.e. humidification and heating of the inhaled air, which could facilitate mucociliary clearance and potentially decrease chronic airway inflammation.

### Clinical review: long-term noninvasive ventilation [^1137Fiht]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Noninvasive positive ventilation has undergone a remarkable evolution over the past decades and is assuming an important role in the management of both acute and chronic respiratory failure. Long-term ventilatory support should be considered a standard of care to treat selected patients following an intensive care unit (ICU) stay. In this setting, appropriate use of noninvasive ventilation can be expected to improve patient outcomes, reduce ICU admission, enhance patient comfort, and increase the efficiency of health care resource utilization. Current literature indicates that noninvasive ventilation improves and stabilizes the clinical course of many patients with chronic ventilatory failure. Noninvasive ventilation also permits long-term mechanical ventilation to be an acceptable option for patients who otherwise would not have been treated if tracheostomy were the only alternative. Nevertheless, these results appear to be better in patients with neuromuscular/-parietal disorders than in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This clinical review will address the use of noninvasive ventilation (not including continuous positive airway pressure) mainly in diseases responsible for chronic hypoventilation (that is, restrictive disorders, including neuromuscular disease and lung disease) and incidentally in others such as obstructive sleep apnea or problems of central drive.

### Effect of high-flow nasal therapy during acute aerobic exercise in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after exacerbation: protocol for a randomised, controlled, cross-over trial [^116PQr6t]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by non-reversible bronchial obstruction associated with systemic disorders and comorbid factors. As the disease progresses, the patient frequently experiences episodes of exacerbation that lead to a progressive worsening of respiratory function and vital prognosis. Exacerbations are frequently accompanied by several months of increased anxiety, limitations in activities of daily living and reduced quality of life. Early pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is recommended following an exacerbation in order to limit these consequences. However, functional signs of dyspnoea 'too breathless' and fatigability 'too weak' often lead patients to abandon PR programmes prematurely. Some patients are unable to reach the required training intensity to achieve clinical or physiological benefits. High-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) can deliver up to 60 L/min of reheated, humidified air via nasal cannula, with or without additional oxygen. Above a flow of 20 L/min, HFNT generates a positive pressure in the upper airways. It induces an increase in alveolar ventilation, improvements in gas exchange and a reduction in ventilatory work in patients with COPD. Currently, one pilot study has demonstrated that HFNT can increase exercise tolerance in patients with severe COPD in a stable state. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the effect of HFNT during exercise after a severe exacerbation. We hypothesised that HFNT could be a simple and effective strategy to improve exercise tolerance following a severe exacerbation.

The primary aim of this randomised, controlled, cross-over study is to evaluate the impact of HFNT on endurance time (TLim) in patients with severe COPD post exacerbation.

The secondary aims are to evaluate the impact of HFNT on tissue oxygenation, dyspnoea and muscle fatigue, transcutaneous CO₂ pressure (PtCO₂), respiratory rate (RR), cardiac rate (CR), pulsed O₂ saturation (SpO₂) during exercise and respiratory muscle fatigue.

### High-velocity nasal insufflation versus noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^113YN6Jd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the emergency department (ED) involve dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort; frequent exacerbations are associated with increased mortality and reduced quality of life. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) is commonly used to help relieve symptoms but is limited due to patient intolerance. We aimed to determine whether high‐velocity nasal insufflation (HVNI) is noninferior to NiPPV in relieving dyspnea within 4 h in ED patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Methods

This randomized control trial was conducted in seven EDs in the United States. Symptomatic patients with suspected COPD, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2) ≥ 60 mm Hg, and venous pH 7.0–7.35 were randomized to receive HVNI (n = 36) or NiPPV (n = 32). The primary outcome was dyspnea severity 4 h after the initiation of study intervention, as measured by the Borg score. Secondary outcomes included vital signs, oxygen saturation, venous pCO 2, venous pH, patient discomfort level, and need for endotracheal intubation.

Results

Sixty‐eight patients were randomized between November 5, 2020, and May 10, 2023 (mean age 65.6 years; 47% women). The initial pCO 2 was 77.7 ± 13.6 mm Hg versus 76.5 ± 13.6 mm Hg and the initial venous pH was 7.27 ± 0.063 versus 7.27 ± 0.043 in the HVNI and NiPPV groups, respectively. Dyspnea was similar in the HVNI and NiPPV groups at baseline (dyspnea scale score 5.4 ± 2.93 and 5.6 ± 2.41) and HVNI was noninferior to NiPPV at the following time points: 30 min (3.97 ± 2.82 and 4.54 ± 1.65, p = 0.006), 60 min (3.09 ± 2.70 and 4.07 ± 1.77, p < 0.001), and 4 h (3.17 ± 2.59 and 3.34 ± 2.04, p = 0.03). At 4 h, there was no difference between the groups in the pCO 2 mm Hg (68.76 and 67.29, p = 0.63). Patients reported better overall comfort levels in the HVNI group at 30 min, 60 min, and 4 h (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

In participants with symptomatic COPD, HVNI was noninferior to NiPPV in relieving dyspnea 4 h after therapy initiation. HVNI may be a reasonable treatment option for some patients experiencing moderate acute exacerbations of COPD in the ED.

### Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in acute respiratory failure outside clinical trials: experience at the Massachusetts general hospital [^111hTvvL]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been shown to be effective in select patients enrolled in clinical trials. However, few data are available on the use of NPPV as routine standard medical care for patients with respiratory failure outside of controlled trials.

Measurements and Main Results

All patients receiving NPPV for a 1-yr period for acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure who did not select do not intubate/resuscitate status were evaluated. Demographic, physiological, and laboratory data were collected for as long as NPPV was provided. Data were recorded on 449 patients. Intubation rate was 18%, 24%, 38%, 40%, and 60%, respectively, for patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema (n = 97), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 87), non-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (n = 35), postextubation respiratory failure patients (n = 95), and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (n = 144). The hospital mortality for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who failed NPPV was 64%. A logistic regression showed that baseline Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.10; p < .0001), Glasgow Coma Scale (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66–0.87; p < .0001), PaO2/FIO2 ratio (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93–0.99; p = .02), and serum albumin (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16–0.57; p < .001) were the variables associated with NPPV failure.

Conclusion

NPPV as routine standard medical care resulted in the intubation of a similar percentage of patients with respiratory failure due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation as shown in randomized controlled trials but in a higher percent of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure than reported in these trials. NPPV failure was associated with high hospital mortality for patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure.

### Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation to treat respiratory failure resulting from exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ECmdx]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in the management of respiratory failure secondary to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials that compared NPPV and usual medical care with usual medical care alone in patients admitted to hospital with respiratory failure resulting from an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and with PaCO2 > 6 kPa.

Results

The eight studies included in the review showed that, compared with usual care alone, NPPV as an adjunct to usual care was associated with a lower mortality (relative risk 0.41 (95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.64)), a lower need for intubation (relative risk 0.42 (0.31 to 0.59)), lower likelihood of treatment failure (relative risk 0.51 (0.38 to 0.67)), and greater improvements at 1 hour in pH (weighted mean difference 0.03 (0.02 to 0.04)), PaCO2 (weighted mean difference -0.40 kPa (-0.78 to -0.03)), and respiratory rate (weighted mean difference -3.08 breaths per minute (-4.26 to -1.89)). NPPV resulted in fewer complications associated with treatment (relative risk 0.32 (0.18 to 0.56)) and shorter duration of stay in hospital (weighted mean difference -3.24 days (-4.42 to -2.06)).

Conclusions

NPPV should be the first line intervention in addition to usual medical care to manage respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in all suitable patients. NPPV should be tried early in the course of respiratory failure and before severe acidosis, to reduce mortality, avoid endotracheal intubation, and decrease treatment failure.

### Outcomes of noninvasive ventilation for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the United States, 1998–2008 [^111fZaK4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale

The patterns and outcomes of noninvasive, positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) use in patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) nationwide are unknown.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence and trends of noninvasive ventilation for acute COPD.

Methods

We used data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's Nationwide Inpatient Sample to assess the pattern and outcomes of NIPPV use for acute exacerbations of COPD from 1998 to 2008.

Measurements and Main Results

An estimated 7,511,267 admissions for acute exacerbations occurred from 1998 to 2008. There was a 462% increase in NIPPV use (from 1.0 to 4.5% of all admissions) and a 42% decline in invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) use (from 6.0 to 3.5% of all admissions) during these years. This was accompanied by an increase in the size of a small cohort of patients requiring transition from NIPPV to IMV. In-hospital mortality in this group appeared to be worsening over time. By 2008, these patients had a high mortality rate (29.3%), which represented 61% higher odds of death compared with patients directly placed on IMV (95% confidence interval, 24–109%) and 677% greater odds of death compared with patients treated with NIPPV alone (95% confidence interval, 475–948%). With the exception of patients transitioned from NIPPV to IMV, in-hospital outcomes were favorable and improved steadily year by year.

Conclusions

The use of NIPPV has increased significantly over time among patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of COPD, whereas the need for intubation and in-hospital mortality has declined. However, the rising mortality rate in a small but expanding group of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation after treatment with noninvasive ventilation needs further investigation.

### Home high-flow therapy during recovery from severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: a mixed-methods feasibility randomised control trial [^112ruLey]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a common cause of admission to hospital in the UK and worldwide. Up to 24% of patients recovering from severe COPD exacerbation are readmitted to hospital within thirty days of discharge. This proportion has remained static despite implementation of readmission prevention strategies, including changes in process of care as well as optimisation of medical management.

In patients who are hospitalised with COPD exacerbation, without evidence of persistent hypercapnia during recovery, interventions to reduce risk of re-exacerbation and readmission are limited. Although inhaled bronchodilation and mucolytics have been shown to reduce exacerbation riskand emerging data indicate that type 2 inflammation inhibition can reduce moderate and severe exacerbation rates, these studies have targeted stable COPD patients. In hospitalised eucapnic COPD patients, evidence supports non-pharmacological interventions, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, to reduce 12-month readmission and mortality risk. However, shortfalls in access, uptake and programme completion have failed to change clinical outcomes. Other interventions, such as home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with oxygen therapy in post-acute COPD patients with persistent hypercapnia and long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in stable hypoxaemic COPD patients, have been shown to increase admission-free survivaland are part of clinical guidelines.

Home high-flow therapy (HFT) delivers heated, humidified air or air-oxygen blend, and there is growing evidence of clinical and physiological effects in COPD patients following acute treatment with mechanical ventilationand stable patients with hypoxaemia and hypercapnia. Short-term physiological studies in COPD patients demonstrate that HFT reduces respiratory rate, respiratory drive and inspiratory effort, by changing breathing pattern and increasing expiratory time, and reduces breathlessness. These observations of the effect of HFT during acute exacerbation recovery, combined with a physiological home monitoring study which demonstrated early post-discharge improvements in airflow obstruction, neural respiratory drive and breathlessness, provide the rationale to use HFT in eucapnic COPD patients in the recovery phase at home. Additionally, despite clinical trials demonstrating reduced exacerbation frequency and symptom burden with home HFT and LTOT, there has been no demonstrable impact on hospital admissions and readmissions, providing further support for the rationale to target eucapnic normoxaemic post-acute COPD patients.

The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised clinical trial to evaluate clinical, patient-reported and physiological effects of home HFT, in addition to usual medical therapy, in eucapnic patients recovering from severe COPD exacerbation following hospitalisation.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113YbAL6]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) in COPD improves acute outcomes in acute on chronic respiratory failure but the effects of long-term NIV in chronic respiratory failure remain uncertain; some studies show benefits in health status, dyspnea, or blood gases but little or no impact on rehospitalization or mortality, although one recent study found NIV may improve survival. We recommend: Studies that assess the effects of long-term NIV in patients with COPD who have chronic respiratory failure, and Studies that identify characteristics of patients who are most likely to benefit from long-term NIV.

### High-velocity nasal insufflation versus noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^113gepfG]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Study design

This prospective, multicenter, noninferiority, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to assess whether HVNI is noninferior to NiPPV in relieving dyspnea primarily within 4 h in ED patients with acute exacerbation of COPD. Seven EDs in geographically diverse U.S.‐based hospital groups, which included three community hospitals, three academic hospitals, and one military hospital (eTable S1). Study was approved by a central institutional review board (IRB) Sterling IRB. After randomization in the ED, patients were assigned to treatment, either with HVNI or with NiPPV and assessed at baseline, 30 min, 60 min, and 4 h. All other care was provided at the discretion of the treating team.

Participants

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age ≥ 18 years; (2) a known history of COPD or high clinical suspicion for COPD, based on a history of smoking or secondhand smoke exposure, and prior history of wheezing, chronic cough, bronchospasm, or hypercapnia; (3) partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO₂) equal or greater than 60 mm Hg on blood gas analysis; and (4) serum pH between 7.0 and 7.35 on venous blood gas analysis. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) need for immediate endotracheal intubation; (2) presence of respiratory or cardiac arrest; (3) dyspnea that was more likely due to any alternative cause such as congestive heart failure, pneumonia, neurologic dysfunction, or toxicologic exposure; (4) a known intolerance to NiPPV or HVNI; (5) determination by the treating emergency physician that the patient is clinically unstable to participate; (6) altered mental status; or (7) a known or suspected pregnancy. Written or verbal consent was obtained before participation and randomization. In cases where verbal consent was initially provided, patients provided written consent once the symptoms improved to the point where they were able to provide written consent. Sex, race, and ethnicity were self‐reported by participants.

Randomization

The study intervention was assigned using block randomization with a block size of four participants. Both interventions were implemented with standard initial settings and then titrated according to standard practice for optimal effect. Random allocation sequence was implemented via sealed envelopes at each site and envelopes were opened after the participant consent was given. Sequence was generated a priori by statistician who was not involved in enrollment.

Randomised controlled trials comparing NPPV plus usual medical care versus usual medical care alone were selected. Trials needed to recruit adult patients admitted to hospital with respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD and with PaCO2 > 6 kPa (45 mmHg).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected articles for inclusion, evaluated methodological quality of the studies and abstracted the data.

Main Results

Eight studies were included in the review. NPPV resulted in decreased mortality (Relative Risk [RR] 0.41; 95% Confidence Intervals [CI] 0.26, 0.64), decreased need for intubation (RR 0.42; 95%CI 0.31, 0.59), reduction in treatment failure (RR 0.51; 95%CI 0.39, 0.67), rapid improvement within the first hour in pH (Weight Mean Difference [WMD] 0.03; 95%CI 0.02, 0.04), PaCO2 (WMD -0.40 kPa; 95%CI -0.78, -0.03) and respiratory rate (WMD -3.08 bpm; 95%CI -4.26, -1.89). In addition, complications associated with treatment (RR 0.32; 95%CI 0.18, 0.56) and length of hospital stay (WMD -3.24 days; 95%CI -4.42, -2.06) were also reduced in the NPPV group.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Data from good quality randomised controlled trials permit NPPV to be recommended as the first line intervention, coupled with usual medical care, in all suitable patients with respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of COPD. A trial of NPPV should be considered early in the course of respiratory failure, and before severe acidosis ensures, as a means of avoiding endotracheal intubation, reducing mortality and treatment failure.

### Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation using a helmet in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a feasibility study [^114WwmFa]. Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) with a facemask (FM) is effective in patients with acute exacerbation of their chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Whether it is feasible to treat these patients with NPPV delivered by a helmet is not known.

Methods

Over a 4-month period, the authors studied 33 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with acute exacerbation who were admitted to four intensive care units and treated with helmet NPPV. The patients were compared with 33 historical controls treated with FM NPPV, matched for simplified acute physiologic score (SAPS II), age, PaCO2, pH, and PaO2:fractional inspired oxygen tension. The primary endpoints were the feasibility of the technique, improvement of gas exchange, and need for intubation.

Results

The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Ten patients in the helmet group and 14 in the FM group (P = 0.22) were intubated. In the helmet group, no patients were unable to tolerate NPPV, whereas five patients required intubation in the FM group (P = 0.047). After 1 h of treatment, both groups had a significant reduction of PaCO2 with improvement of pH; PaCO2 decreased less in the helmet group (P = 0.01). On discontinuing support, PaCO2 was higher (P = 0.002) and pH lower (P = 0.02) in the helmet group than in the control group. One patient in the helmet group, and 12 in the FM group, developed complications related to NPPV (P < 0.001). Length of intensive care unit stay, intensive care unit, and hospital mortality were similar in both groups.

Conclusions

Helmet NPPV is feasible and can be used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with acute exacerbation, but it does not improve carbon dioxide elimination as efficiently as does FM NPPV.

### High-intensity versus low-intensity non-invasive ventilation in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Qrpjk]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a key treatment for acute exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD). This meta-analysis compares high- versus low-intensity NIPPV.

Methods

A systematic search was conducted across major databases. Studies comparing high- and low-intensity NIPPV in AECOPD were included. Statistical analysis- using RevMan, statistical significance set at p < 0.05, risk ratio for dichotomous data, while mean difference for continuous data with 95% CI via random effect model, and Higgins I 2 to measure heterogeneity was carried out following PRISMA guidelines.

Results

Four studies, which consisted of 618 patients, were analyzed. Primary outcomes were intubation need and short-term mortality. Secondary outcomes included PaCO 2 at 48 and 72 hours and abdominal distension. High-intensity NIPPV significantly reduced short-term mortality (RR: 0.43, CI: [0.22, 0.85], P = 0.02) but had no significant effect on intubation rates. PaCO 2 levels at 48 and 72 hours showed no significant difference. Abdominal distension was more common in the high-intensity group (RR: 1.49, P = 0.02).

Conclusion

High-intensity NIPPV lowers short-term mortality but increases abdominal distension. Further studies are needed.

### High flow nasal therapy versus noninvasive ventilation as initial ventilatory strategy in COPD exacerbation: a multicenter non-inferiority randomized trial [^115Zjt9h]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study had a parallel-group design with short-term timepoints of assessment, so we cannot evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential use of the study treatments. The findings that 32% of patients after 6 h and more than 50% of patients during hospitalization needed NIV suggest that the two treatments may have a complementary role in AECOPD that should be further studied. We collected data about the primary outcome, blood gases and secondary outcomes at 6 h as the longest follow-up without further assessments. This can limit the evaluation of the long-term efficacy of HFNT. However, we registered patients' safety-related outcomes until hospital discharge or death.

At 6 h, the number of patients actually treated as randomly allocated was slightly lower (n = 53) than the calculated sample size (n = 56) for the primary outcome at 2 h. The power of our per-protocol analysis after 6 h was 76.5%, and therefore, the estimate of the compared effect at this timepoint should be considered with caution. Finally, it has to take into account also the documented clinical heterogeneity of COPD exacerbations; therefore, although we used strict criteria to define mild-to-moderate AECOPD, we may have enrolled patients with different trajectories of the diseases and responses to ventilator support and medical treatments.

### High-velocity nasal insufflation versus noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^112j6sPi]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) contribute to 600,000–1,500,000 emergency department (ED) visits and 140,000 deaths annually in the United States. The annual economic burden of the condition is approximately $50 billion.COPD represents a collection of respiratory diseases that result in airflow obstruction and breathing difficulties, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Acute exacerbations of COPD are distinct episodes of symptom exacerbation that involve dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort. These episodes are typically associated with increased airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, and gas trapping. Frequent COPD exacerbations are associated with increased mortality, reduced quality of life, and a higher likelihood of lung function decline.

The standard treatment for acute exacerbations of COPD in the ED includes oxygen therapy in the presence of hypoxia, inhalational bronchodilators, and corticosteroids. For patients with persistent respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or respiratory acidosis, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) is used to assist with respiration. BiPAP ventilation significantly improves patient comfort, respiratory parameters, and oxygenation, while reducing the need for intubation in patients with respiratory failure and COPD. However, its use is limited by patient discomfort, risk of aspiration due to vomiting, difficulty in administering concomitant oral medication, inability to create a seal on the face due to the anatomy or facial hair, and concerns about pulmonary barotrauma. Some patients require sedation to minimize the adverse effects of NiPPV. Therefore, an effective alternative is highly desirable for managing acute exacerbations of COPD in some patients.

### Effect of high-intensity vs low-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation on the need for endotracheal intubation in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the HAPPEN randomized clinical trial [^112qU2uW]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study HAPPEN was published by Zujin Luo and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the HAPPEN study, the trial question was: what is the role of high-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD and persistent hypercapnia? In the HAPPEN study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the HAPPEN study, the population was: 300 patients (97 female, 203 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with acute exacerbation of COPD and persistent hypercapnia. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; excessive respiratory secretions or an upper airway obstruction; recent oral, facial, or cranial trauma or surgery; recent gastric or esophageal surgery; restrictive ventilatory dysfunction; active bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract; recent cardiac or respiratory arrest. In the HAPPEN study, the interventions were: n = 147 high-intensity NPPV (inspiratory positive airway pressure adjusted to obtain tidal volume of 10–15 mL/kg of predicted body weight) n = 153 low-intensity NPPV (inspiratory positive airway pressure adjusted to obtain tidal volume of 6–10 mL/kg of predicted body weight). In the HAPPEN study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in need for endotracheal intubation during hospitalization (4.8% vs. 13.7%; RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.76). In the HAPPEN study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in endotracheal intubation (3.4% vs. 3.9%; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.72) Significant decrease in endotracheal intubation (3.4% vs. 11.1%; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.76) No significant difference in death at day 90 (4.1% vs. 4%; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.11). In the HAPPEN study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. significant difference in abdominal distension (37.4% vs. 25.5%). In the HAPPEN study, the conclusion was: in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD and persistent hypercapnia, high-intensity NPPV was superior to low-intensity NPPV with respect to need for endotracheal intubation during hospitalization.

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure [^114gkJcR]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Noninvasive ventilation has assumed an important role in the management of respiratory failure in critical care units, but it must be used selectively depending on the patient's diagnosis and clinical characteristics.

Data

We review the strong evidence supporting the use of noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure to prevent intubation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations or acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and in immunocompromised patients, as well as to facilitate extubation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who require initial intubation. Weaker evidence supports consideration of noninvasive ventilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with postoperative or postextubation respiratory failure; patients with acute respiratory failure due to asthma exacerbations, pneumonia, acute lung injury, or acute respiratory distress syndrome; during bronchoscopy; or as a means of preoxygenation before intubation in critically ill patients with severe hypoxemia.

Conclusion

Noninvasive ventilation has assumed an important role in managing patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of noninvasive ventilation failure and promptly intubated before a crisis develops. The application of noninvasive ventilation by a trained and experienced intensive care unit team, with careful patient selection, should optimize patient outcomes.

### Which patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease benefit from noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation? A systematic review of the literature [^1139xrnM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past decade, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) in the setting of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has increased in popularity. Although several trials have been published on the relative effectiveness of this treatment, apparent inconsistencies in study results remain.

Purpose

To assess the effect of NPPV on rate of endotracheal intubation, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital mortality rate in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD and to determine the effect of exacerbation severity on these outcomes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1966 to 2002) and EMBASE (1990 to 2002). Additional data sources included the Cochrane Library, personal files, abstract proceedings, reference lists of selected articles, and expert contact. There were no language restrictions.

Study Selection

The researchers selected randomized, controlled trials that 1) examined patients with acute exacerbation of COPD; 2) compared noninvasive ventilation and standard therapy with standard therapy alone; and 3) included need for endotracheal intubation, length of hospital stay, or hospital survival as an outcome.

Data Extraction

Methodologic quality and results were abstracted independently and in duplicate.

Data Synthesis

The addition of NPPV to standard care in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD decreased the rate of endotracheal intubation (risk reduction, 28% [95% CI, 15% to 40%]), length of hospital stay (absolute reduction, 4.57 days [CI, 2.30 to 6.83 days]), and in-hospital mortality rate (risk reduction, 10% [CI, 5% to 15%]). However, subgroup analysis showed that these beneficial effects occurred only in patients with severe exacerbations, not in those with milder exacerbations.

Conclusions

Patients with severe exacerbations of COPD benefit from the addition of NPPV to standard therapy. However, NPPV has not been shown to benefit hospitalized patients with milder COPD exacerbations.

### High flow nasal therapy versus noninvasive ventilation as initial ventilatory strategy in COPD exacerbation: a multicenter non-inferiority randomized trial [^116UT4WK]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this trial are that HFNT was non-inferior to NIV as initial ventilatory support in mean PaCO 2 reduction in patients with mild-to-moderate AECOPD considering a non-inferiority margin of 10 mmHg; HFNT was able to reduce PaCO 2 over both study timepoints significantly, but 32% (14/40) of patients were switched to NIV within 6 h.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing NIV and HFNT in mild-to-moderate AECOPD. In our study, we included patients with mild-to-moderate AECOPD for two reasons: (1) the efficacy and safety of HFNT in AECOPD have not been demonstrated so far; (2) NIV is considered the gold standard respiratory support for managing patients with AECOPD with high-quality evidence supporting its use. However, HFNT has shown several valuable effects in COPD patients and there are some drawbacks of using NIV, such as reduced comfort and poor patient–ventilator interaction, which is often challenging to recognize and manage. We intended to determine whether HFNT was not inferior to NIV in achieving relevant changes in physiologic outcomes in AECOPD patients (i.e. PaCO 2) and explore its safety as the first step for future superiority trials.

Evidence Summary and Critical Appraisal of Included Studies

The methodologists extracted data and imported them into RevMan version 5.3 software (Cochrane) for meta-analysis. We used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to conduct all meta-analyses. Study weights were generated using the inverse-variance method. We present results of all analyses using relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risk of bias (RoB) independently and in duplicate for each outcome of individual studies using the Cochrane RoB tool that classifies RoB as "low", "high", or "unclear" for each of the following domains: sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. We rated the overall RoB as the highest risk attributed to any criterion.

With input from the panel chairs, the methodologists developed an evidence profile for each PICO. Following GRADE principles, the certainty of evidence for each outcome was judged to be "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low". In accordance with GRADE, the certainty of evidence for each outcome was originally set as high if it originated from RCTs and low if it originated from observational data. We subsequently downgraded the quality of the evidence by one or two degrees if results from individual studies had a serious or very serious RoB, there were serious inconsistencies in the results across studies, the evidence was indirect, the data were imprecise, or publication bias was believed to be likely.

Generation of Clinical Recommendations for PICO Questions

The direction and strength of recommendations was decided by consensus at an in-person panel meeting. With the assistance of the methodologists, the chairs led the panel in developing recommendations for each PICO question by working through the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework, which considers the quality of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable effects, assumptions of patient values and preferences, resource use, health equity, acceptability of an intervention, and feasibility of implementation. For question 2 (obstructive sleep apnea [OSA] screening), we used the GRADE EtD framework for diagnostic tests. Following GRADE guidance, each recommendation was designated as "strong" or "conditional", using the phrasing "we recommend" for strong recommendations and "we suggest" for conditional recommendations.

Procedures

Hospital respiratory therapists who were not a part of the study initiated all the ventilatory regimens. The initial settings for HVNI (Vapotherm Inc.) included fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) 0.50, flow 30 L/min, and temperature 37°C. The initial settings for NiPPV included FiO 2 0.50 and pressure settings of 10–12 cmH 2 O in inspiration and 5–6 cmH 2 O in expiration were chosen for a targeted tidal volumes of 6–8 mL/kg ideal body weight as a volume goal, with each center's standard humidification settings. The settings for both HVNI and NiPPV were titrated according to standard practice to determine the optimal effect. Details about changes in settings during titration and the final settings of each ventilatory support were recorded as part of study protocol. The treating clinician at each center decided on the need for intubation, specific medication treatment regimen, and final disposition per routine practice.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^113ojhy6]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) post‑exacerbation ventilatory support — In COPD with persistent hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 53 mmHg) after 2–4 weeks post‑discharge, a multicenter prospective RCT comparing home noninvasive ventilation (NIV) plus oxygen versus oxygen alone reported that adding home NIV significantly prolonged the time to readmission or death within 12 months; a systematic review and meta‑analysis confirms that NIV decreases mortality and risk of hospitalization, though the best candidate subgroups remain unclear. Across observational and randomized studies, reductions in re‑hospitalization and improved survival with using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) post‑hospitalization have been reported, although one study showed no benefit of NPPV for survival; NPPV when indicated should be instituted and monitored under the direction of personnel familiar with the process and the devices utilized. In chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, a meta‑analysis suggested that long‑term high‑flow nasal cannula (HFNC) may reduce acute exacerbations and improve SGRQ scores compared to standard care, but its effect on mortality and hospitalizations is uncertain.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112BWGSJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

We suggest not using in-hospital initiation of long-term NIV after an episode of acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, favoring instead reassessment for NIV at 2–4 weeks after resolution (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

Background

COPD exacerbations are a key cause of morbidity and mortality and place a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Unfortunately, patients often do not recover to the baseline amount of lung function or degree of symptoms, and COPD exacerbations are therefore an important contributor to worse outcomes, including lung-function decline, poorer QOL, and increased risk of death. After discharge, 60–80% of the patients are readmitted within 1 year, and 30–49% die within this first year after their hospital admission for an acute COPD exacerbation. These disappointing outcomes raised the question of whether long-term NIV should be provided to patients admitted to the hospital with an exacerbation of COPD.

Summary of the evidence

We identified four RCTs evaluating the use of long-term NIV after an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Pooled data suggest that there are no major differences in mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.25; low certainty), exacerbations (MD, 0.3 fewer; 95% CI, 1.17 fewer to 0.57 more; low certainty), the need for hospitalization (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.24; very low certainty), changes in dyspnea (MD, 0.8 points lower; 95% CI, 2.17 points lower to 0.58 points higher; low certainty), QOL (MD, 2.89 points higher; 95% CI, 1.03 points lower to 6.8 points higher; low certainty), or exercise tolerance measured with 6MWD (MD, 8.64 m lower; 95% CI, 209 m lower to 192 m higher; very low certainty) when using NIV. There was a significant reduction in PaCO₂ (MD, 3.41 mm Hg lower; 95% CI, 4.09 to 2.73 mm Hg lower; moderate certainty), but there was no improvement in PaO₂ (MD, 1.53 mm Hg lower; 95% CI, 4.24 mm Hg lower to 1.17 mm Hg higher; very low certainty) or FEV₁ (SMD, 0.36 SD; 95% CI, −0.74 to 0.03; low certainty).

### Non-invasive ventilation for the management of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115GNgHM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) is commonly used to treat patients admitted to hospital with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of NIV applied in conjunction with usual care versus usual care involving no mechanical ventilation alone in adults with AHRF due to AECOPD. The aim of this review is to update the evidence base with the goals of supporting clinical practice and providing recommendations for future evaluation and research.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), and PsycINFO, and through handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. This update to the original review incorporates the results of database searches up to January 2017.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared usual care plus NIV (BiPAP) versus usual care alone in an acute hospital setting for patients with AECOPD due to AHRF were eligible for inclusion. AHRF was defined by a mean admission pH < 7.35 and mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) > 45 mmHg (6 kPa). Primary review outcomes were mortality during hospital admission and need for endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes included hospital length of stay, treatment intolerance, complications, changes in symptoms, and changes in arterial blood gases.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied the selection criteria to determine study eligibility, performed data extraction, and determined risk of bias in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. Review authors undertook meta-analysis for data that were both clinically and statistically homogenous, and analysed data as both one overall pooled sample and according to two predefined subgroups related to exacerbation severity (admission pH between 7.35 and 7.30 vs below 7.30) and NIV treatment setting (intensive care unit-based vs ward-based). We reported results for mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, and hospital length of stay in a 'Summary of findings' table and rated their quality in accordance with GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We included in the review 17 randomised controlled trials involving 1264 participants. Available data indicate that mean age at recruitment was 66.8 years (range 57.7 to 70.5 years) and that most participants (65%) were male. Most studies (12/17) were at risk of performance bias, and for most (14/17), the risk of detection bias was uncertain. These risks may have affected subjective patient-reported outcome measures (e.g. dyspnoea) and secondary review outcomes, respectively. Use of NIV decreased the risk of mortality by 46% (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.76; N = 12 studies; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 12, 95% CI 9 to 23) and decreased the risk of needing endotracheal intubation by 65% (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.46; N = 17 studies; NNTB 5, 95% CI 5 to 6). We graded both outcomes as 'moderate' quality owing to uncertainty regarding risk of bias for several studies. Inspection of the funnel plot related to need for endotracheal intubation raised the possibility of some publication bias pertaining to this outcome. NIV use was also associated with reduced length of hospital stay (mean difference (MD) -3.39 days, 95% CI -5.93 to -0.85; N = 10 studies), reduced incidence of complications (unrelated to NIV) (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.53; N = 2 studies), and improvement in pH (MD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.07; N = 8 studies) and in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) (MD 7.47 mmHg, 95% CI 0.78 to 14.16 mmHg; N = 8 studies) at one hour. A trend towards improvement in PaCO 2 was observed, but this finding was not statistically significant (MD -4.62 mmHg, 95% CI -11.05 to 1.80 mmHg; N = 8 studies). Post hoc analysis revealed that this lack of benefit was due to the fact that data from two studies at high risk of bias showed baseline imbalance for this outcome (worse in the NIV group than in the usual care group). Sensitivity analysis revealed that exclusion of these two studies resulted in a statistically significant positive effect of NIV on PaCO 2. Treatment intolerance was significantly greater in the NIV group than in the usual care group (risk difference (RD) 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17; N = 6 studies). Results of analysis showed a non-significant trend towards reduction in dyspnoea with NIV compared with usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.16, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.02; N = 4 studies). Subgroup analyses revealed no significant between-group differences.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from good quality randomised controlled trials show that NIV is beneficial as a first-line intervention in conjunction with usual care for reducing the likelihood of mortality and endotracheal intubation in patients admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The magnitude of benefit for these outcomes appears similar for patients with acidosis of a mild (pH 7.30 to 7.35) versus a more severe nature (pH < 7.30), and when NIV is applied within the intensive care unit (ICU) or ward setting.

Finally, the patient and clinician acceptability scores were similar between the two groups (Table 4). There were no significant differences in the clinicians' ratings for patient stability, outcomes, comfort, or ease of use. On a VAS of 0 to 100, where lower scores represented greater comfort, patients described HVNI as having greater comfort than NiPPV (20.13 vs. 43.25, p = 0.003). Post hoc ANCOVAs and logistic regression analyses showed results similar to those above.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1141oFDp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale for the recommendation

Patients with COPD and frequent hospitalizations might be expected to benefit from NIV, and inpatient hospitalization might provide a convenient clinical pathway to initiate NIV. Although the pooled evidence might suggest a possible benefit in starting NIV in patients who remain hypercapnic after an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, the RESCUE trial, the largest of the included trials, suggests that initiation of NIV in the hospital directly after termination of NIV for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure does not improve patient-important outcomes. Indeed, these trials are complementary in that many (nearly 21%, and the largest reason for exclusion) potential HOT-HMV patients who were hypercapnic at hospital discharge were no longer hypercapnic 2–4 weeks later. These data suggest that initiation too early may result in many patients receiving long-term NIV unnecessarily. The panel also noted that the theoretical benefits of starting NIV earlier (reducing early readmission or recurrent exacerbation) were not supported by the data from the HOT-HMV trial, which demonstrated a larger effect size than the trials that initiated long-term NIV during an admission for acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Lastly, there might be potential convenience to initiating NIV during an admission for acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, including availability of trained staff and equipment, but it might further prolong hospitalization to acclimatize to NIV. In fact, more recent data suggest that home initiation of NIV leads to similar outcomes yet is less costly. Given all of the above concerns, the panel made a conditional recommendation against in-hospital initiation of long-term NIV after an episode of acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, favoring instead reassessment for NIV at 2–4 weeks after resolution.

Patients with known or suspected OSA were excluded from many of these studies and should be considered separately, as reviewed above in PICO question 2. These recommendations would not apply to those who remain persistently hypercapnic and cannot be "weaned" from NIV in the hospital. In such patients, in-hospital continuation and transition to long-term NIV may be required.

### High-pressure NIV for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in COPD: improved survival in a retrospective cohort study [^1144BfP9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) secondary to acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is associated with substantial mortality and risk of intubation. Treatment of AHRF with non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has improved these outcomes since the treatment was introduced in 1990. Even though early studies showed more efficient resolution of respiratory acidaemia when using a inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 20 cm H 2 O than 12 cm H 2 O, early NIV treatment guidelines recommended quite conservative pressure settings. The Danish Society of Respiratory Medicine suggested initial IPAP of 12 cm H 2 O, to be increased to a maximum 20 cm H 2 Obut in a Danish retrospective study of 286 patients undergoing in-hospital NIV treatment in 2012–2013 median maximum IPAP was only 12 cm H 2 O (IQR 12–14), that is, suggesting that the recommended use of higher IPAP was not implemented fully. With evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on home long-term NIV (LT NIV) treatment of patients with COPD the use of higher IPAP to reduce PaCO 2 has become more common. Updated Danish treatment guidelines for AHRF in 2016 recommend initial IPAP of 12–15 cm H 2 O and a rapid increase to 20 cm H 2 O within the first 30 min of treatment and possible further increase if the patient is not responding. Recommendations were similar to the 2016 British Thoracic Society and Intensive Care Society 'Guideline for the ventilatory management of AHRF in adults'. The efficacy and safety of using higher IPAP are mainly derived from data on out-of-hospital patients with COPD in LTNIV treatment and the high-intensity NIV concept. Less is known of the short-term and long-term effects of increased IPAP in treatment of AHRF. Further RCT, comparing NIV with low and high IPAP settings, does not seem to be likely nor ethically justified.

The aim of this study was to determine whether NIV treatment according to updated guidelines, recommending rapid increase and higher IPAP, compared with earlier treatment regimens using lower IPAP, was associated with better outcome in patients with COPD admitted with AHRF.

### Noninvasive respiratory supports in ICU [^115sTPnx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Noninvasive respiratory supports are routinely applied in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure to avoid intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, thereby reducing the risk of related complications, and to facilitate successful weaning from mechanical ventilation after extubation. They are also applied during the intubation procedure for preoxygenation with the aim of enhancing oxygenation and ensuring the safety of the procedure.

Main Body

High-flow nasal oxygen decreases airway dead space, provides a stable concentration of inspired oxygen, generates low level of flow-dependent positive airway pressure, and optimizes comfort. Positive-pressure noninvasive supports include continuous positive-airway pressure and noninvasive ventilation and enable providing higher end-expiratory pressure, thereby further improving oxygenation. Noninvasive ventilation, but not continuous positive-airway pressure, better decreases inspiratory effort, and increases tidal volume and transpulmonary driving pressure.

Conclusion

High-flow nasal oxygen has become the first-line therapy in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, while noninvasive ventilation remains the reference treatment during exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in patients with respiratory acidosis. In patients requiring intubation, noninvasive ventilation is the optimal technique for preoxygenation to decrease the risk of hypoxemia, while high-flow nasal oxygen is an alternative option for non-hypoxemic patients or those with contraindications to noninvasive ventilation. After extubation in patients at high risk of reintubation, prophylactic noninvasive ventilation, eventually alternating with high-flow nasal oxygen, improves weaning outcome compared to other strategies; high-flow nasal oxygen alone outperforms conventional oxygen in low-risk patients.

LIMITATIONS

While the pragmatic nature of the trial can be viewed as a strength, this study has several limitations. First, the participants, providers, and assessors were not blinded to the treatment arms; however, participants did not know which group they would be assigned prior to consent, allocation, and enrollment. Second, patients typically presented with undifferentiated dyspnea presumed to be due to COPD; although, patients with respiratory distress due to mixed reasons may have been included as undifferentiated complaints are typical in the ED settings. Third, this study only enrolled patients who were not in imminent respiratory arrest and were able to provide at least initial verbal consent; therefore, caution should be exercised when extrapolating the results of this study to patients in extreme distress. Fourth, all patients in the study received standard care according to the treating physician and the respiratory therapist. As such, the protocol did not dictate exactly how the HFNC or NiPPV settings should be titrated nor specify the use of adjunct medication such as bronchodilators, antibiotics, and steroids. There is an inherent variability among individual clinicians regarding standard of care. Fifth, we used a subjective measure as a primary outcome, the degree of dyspnea. However, this subjective outcome was augmented by more quantitative measures such as pH and pCO 2. Finally, this study was initiated during the COVID‐19 pandemic, which made enrollment, staffing, and clinical research challenging. While fewer patients completed the study than initially planned, reducing the overall power of the study, this did not significantly impact the study's findings, as we were still able to detect significant effects.

### Noninvasive positive pressure in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113tpf85]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) is standard of care for patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). We review the most current evidence and highlight areas of uncertainty and ongoing research. We highlight key concepts for the clinician caring for patients with AECOPD which require NIV.

Recent Findings

Implementation of NIV in AECOPD is not uniform in spite of the evidence and guidelines. Initiation of NIV should be done early and following protocols. Low-intensity NIV remains the standard of care, although research and guidelines are evaluating higher intensity NIV. Scores to predict NIV failure continue to be refined to allow early identification and interventions. Several areas of uncertainty remain, among them are interventions to improve tolerance, length of support and titration and nutritional support during NIV.

Summary

The use of NIV in AECOPD is the standard of care as it has demonstrated benefits in several patient-centered outcomes. Current developments and research is related to the implementation and adjustment of NIV.

### Effect of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation on the need for endotracheal intubation in COPD… [^115T1akY]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question In patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypercapnia who first received 6 hours of low-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, does high-intensity NPPV decrease the likelihood of meeting prespecified criteria for the need for endotracheal intubation compared with continuing low-intensity NPPV. Meaning Patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and persistent hypercapnia were significantly less likely to meet criteria for the need for endotracheal intubation when randomized to high-intensity vs low-intensity NPPV, although patients in the low-intensity NPPV group were allowed to crossover to high-intensity NPPV and the endotracheal intubation rate did not significantly differ between groups.

Importance The effect of high-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation on the need for endotracheal intubation in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is unknown. Objective To determine whether the use of high-intensity NPPV vs low-intensity NPPV reduces the need for endotracheal intubation in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD and hypercapnia. Patients in the low-intensity NPPV group who met the prespecified criteria for the need for endotracheal intubation were allowed to crossover to high-intensity NPPV. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the need for endotracheal intubation during hospitalization, which was defined by prespecified criteria. There were 15 prespecified secondary outcomes, including endotracheal intubation. Abdominal distension occurred more frequently in the high-intensity NPPV group compared with the low-intensity NPPV group.

Conclusions and Relevance. Patients with COPD and persistent hypercapnia in the high-intensity NPPV group were significantly less likely to meet criteria for the need for endotracheal intubation; however, patients in the low-intensity NPPV group were allowed to crossover to high-intensity NPPV, and the between-group rate of endotracheal intubation was not significantly different.

### Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in stable patients with COPD [^11135pUz]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Long-term noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) used to be a controversial form of therapy for patients with stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (SH-COPD). New evidence described in this review defines the optimal settings, timing and target population for NIV utilization in SH-COPD necessary to maximize its benefit.

Recent Findings

NIV, when titrated appropriately, leads to improved clinical outcomes. High inspiratory positive airway pressures aimed at decreasing CO2 levels can ensure NIV success in SH-COPD. NIV initiated when patients remain hypercapnic whereas in a clinical stable state following an acute exacerbation can prolong the time to a readmission. Technological advances in NIV algorithms and remote monitoring have the potential to improve use and titration. NIV and portable NIV improve exercise tolerance and may accentuate the benefits derived from pulmonary rehabilitation alone.

Summary

Use of high-intensity NIV in SH-COPD is beneficial yet appropriate patient selection and implementation is paramount.

### A high-flow nasal cannula versus noninvasive ventilation in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1147N5E5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We investigated the efficacy and safety of a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at different flow rates compared to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in patients with acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, single-blind study assigned patients to one of three study groups. The NIV group (n = 47) received bilevel positive airway pressure. The HFNC-30 (n = 44) and HFNC-50 (n = 46) groups received HFNC therapy at flow rates of 30 and 50 L/min, respectively. Demographic and clinical characteristics and arterial blood gas parameters before and 30, 60, and 120 min after treatment were compared among the treatment groups.

Results

This study included 137 consecutive patients with acute exacerbations of COPD, comprising 90 males and 47 females, with a mean age of 68.1 ± 10.5 years. A total of 21 patients (15.33%) were intubated, and the overall mortality rate was 10.2%. The mean PaCO 2 levels on admission were 64.69 ± 10.81, 61.51 ± 9.03, and 62.29 ± 9.87 in the NIV, HFNC-30, and HFNC-50 groups, respectively, with no significant differences observed (p = 0.372). A significant reduction in mean PaCO 2 was observed in all treatment groups at 30, 60, and 120 min (p < 0.05 for all). However, the ΔPaCO 2 at 60 min was significantly higher in the HFNC-30 group compared to the NIV group (p = 0.042). Additionally, neither intubation rates nor 28-day mortality differed among the treatment groups (p = 0.368 and p = 0.775, respectively).

Conclusion

HFNC was not inferior to NIV in improving arterial blood gas parameters, particularly PaCO 2 in patients with COPD exacerbations, especially those with hypercarbia. Moreover, HFNC at a flow rate of 30 L/min was superior to NIV for reducing PaCO 2 levels at 60 min.

### Chronic non-invasive ventilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114yaVQv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly being used to treat people with COPD who have respiratory failure, but the evidence supporting this treatment has been conflicting.

Objectives

To assess the effects of chronic non-invasive ventilation at home via a facial mask in people with COPD, using a pooled analysis of IPD and meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Register of Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, proceedings of respiratory conferences, clinical trial registries and bibliographies of relevant studies. We conducted the latest search on 21 December 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chronic NIV for at least five hours per night for three consecutive weeks or more (in addition to standard care) versus standard care alone, in people with COPD. Studies investigating people initiated on NIV in a stable phase and studies investigating NIV commenced after a severe COPD exacerbation were eligible, but we reported and analysed them separately. The primary outcomes were arterial blood gases, health-related quality of life (HRQL), exercise capacity (stable COPD) and admission-free survival (post-exacerbation COPD). Secondary outcomes for both populations were: lung function, COPD exacerbations and admissions, and all-cause mortality. For stable COPD, we also reported respiratory muscle strength, dyspnoea and sleep efficiency.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. After inclusion of a study, we requested the IPD. We analysed continuous and time-to-event data using linear- and cox-regression mixed-effect models with a random effect on study level. We analysed dichotomous IPD using generalised estimating equations. We adjusted all models for age and sex. We assessed changes in outcomes after three and 12 months. We also conducted a meta-analysis on aggregated trial data.

Main Results

We included 14 new RCTs in this review update, in addition to the seven previously included. Seventeen studies investigated chronic NIV in stable COPD and four studies investigated chronic NIV commenced after a severe COPD exacerbation. Three studies compared NIV to sham continuous positive airway pressure (2 to 4 cmH 2 O). Seven studies used a nasal mask, one study used an oronasal mask and eight studies used both interfaces. Five studies did not report the interface. The majority of trials (20/21) were at high risk of performance bias due to an unblinded design. We considered 11 studies to have a low risk of selection bias and 13 to have a low risk of attrition bias. We collected and analysed the IPD from 13 stable COPD studies (n = 778, 68% of the participants included) and from three post-exacerbation studies (n = 364, 96% of the participants included). In the stable COPD group, NIV probably results in a minor benefit on the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) after three months (adjusted mean difference (AMD) 0.27 kPa, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.49; 9 studies, 271 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but there was little to no benefit at 12 months (AMD 0.09 kPa, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.42; 3 studies, 171 participants; low-certainty evidence). The arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) was reduced in participants allocated to NIV after three months (AMD -0.61 kPa, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.45; 11 studies, 475 participants; high-certainty evidence) and persisted up to 12 months (AMD -0.42 kPa, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.16; 4 studies, 232 participants; high-certainty evidence). Exercise capacity was measured with the 6-minute walking distance (minimal clinical important difference: 26 m). There was no clinically relevant effect of NIV on exercise capacity (3 months: AMD 15.5 m, 95% CI -0.8 to 31.7; 8 studies, 330 participants; low-certainty evidence; 12 months: AMD 26.4 m, 95% CI -7.6 to 60.5; 3 studies, 134 participants; very low-certainty evidence). HRQL was measured with the Severe Respiratory Insufficiency and the St. Georges's Respiratory Questionnaire and may be improved by NIV, but only after three months (3 months: standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.62; 5 studies, 259 participants; very low-certainty evidence; 12 months: SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.43; 4 studies, 200 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Lastly, the risk for all-cause mortality is likely reduced by NIV (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.97; 3 studies, 405 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In the post-exacerbation COPD group, there was little to no benefit on the PaO 2 after three months, but there may be a slight decrease after 12 months (3 months: AMD -0.10 kPa, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.45; 3 studies, 234 participants; low-certainty evidence; 12 months: -0.27 kPa, 95% CI -0.86 to 0.32, 3 studies; 170 participants; low-certainty evidence). The PaCO 2 was reduced by NIV at both three months (AMD -0.40 kPa, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.09; 3 studies, 241 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and 12 months (AMD -0.52 kPa, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.18; 3 studies, 175 participants; high-certainty evidence). NIV may have little to no benefit on HRQL (3 months: SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.51; 2 studies, 219 participants; very low-certainty evidence; 12 months: SMD 0.25, 95% -0.06 to 0.55; 2 studies, 164 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Admission-free survival seems improved with NIV (AHR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.94; 2 studies, 317 participants; low-certainty evidence), but the risk for all-cause mortality does not seem to improve (AHR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28; 2 studies, 317 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Regardless of the timing of initiation, chronic NIV improves daytime hypercapnia. In addition, in stable COPD, survival seems to be improved and there might be a short term HRQL benefit. In people with persistent hypercapnia after a COPD exacerbation, chronic NIV might prolong admission-free survival without a beneficial effect on HRQL. In stable COPD, future RCTs comparing NIV to a control group receiving standard care might no longer be warranted, but research should focus on identifying participant characteristics that would define treatment success. Furthermore, the optimal timing for initiation of NIV after a severe COPD exacerbation is still unknown.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, noninvasive ventilation, indications, ERS 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate bilevel noninvasive ventilation in patients with COPD exacerbation with acute respiratory failure leading to acute or acute-on-chronic respiratory acidosis (pH ≤ 7.35).

### Where to perform noninvasive ventilation? [^112HZxXH]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) has been shown to be a means of reducing the need for endotracheal intubation, which when effective reduces the complication rate and improves outcome. Because paralysis and sedation are not needed and because the patient is not necessarily dependent upon a machine for respiration, ventilation outside the intensive care unit (ICU) is an option. A number of studies have shown that NPPV for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be effective in the non-ICU environment, though usually in patients with less severe exacerbations. However, there have been no direct comparisons of the application of NPPV in different locations. The likelihood of success of the technique is an important factor in deciding there NPPV should be performed. Ready access to invasive ventilation is important when NPPV is not indicated from the outset or fails after an initial trial. In acute exacerbations of COPD, NPPV is less likely to be successful the more severe the exacerbation, as measured by the severity of acidosis. Good tolerance of NPPV, which translates into an improvement in pH and a fall in respiratory rate, predicts a successful outcome and is a useful way of monitoring progress. NPPV has been shown to be cost effective both in the ICU and when performed on general wards. A dedicated intermediate care unit with particular expertise in noninvasive modes of ventilation may provide the best environment, both in terms of outcome, but also cost effectiveness. The ideal location for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation will vary from country to country and indeed from hospital to hospital, depending upon local factors. However, the most important factor is that staff be adequately trained in the technique and be available throughout the 24-h period.

### High-velocity nasal insufflation versus noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^116Hq33T]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

HVNI has a well‐established role in improving oxygenation for infectious causes of respiratory distress but its role in improving ventilation for COPD is unclear. In our study population, we had low rates of COVID‐19 infections. The small proportion of COVID‐19 patients in each treatment arm alleviates a concern that these patients had a combination of hypercapnic respiratory failure from COPD exacerbation and hypoxemic respiratory failure from severe COVID‐19.

While we described our patient population as having "mild to moderate" COPD exacerbation due to the low rates of intubation at 48 h, this description contrasts with other definitions of severity. Both the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society describe acute exacerbations of COPD as "severe" if the patient has respiratory acidosis. In addition, hypercapnia is traditionally defined as mild if pCO 2 ≤ 50 mm Hg, moderate if 55–70 mm Hg, and severe if ≥ 70 mm Hg. All participants had hypercapnic respiratory acidosis > 60 mm Hg as an inclusion criterion, with one pCO 2 having a level of 120 mm Hg.

### High-velocity nasal insufflation versus noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^113c35JX]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This study lends more evidence to the expanding role of HVNI in respiratory conditions. This work builds off prior clinical studies that have regarding the use of HVNI for nonspecific respiratory distress, and comparing HVNI to conventional oxygen therapy. Observational studies have analyzed the sequential use of HVNI and NiPPV, HVNI's role in preventing reintubation after extubating. Most recently, in a study of 225 patients comparing HVNI to NiPPV for acute COPD patients who were admitted to the ICU, outcomes were not different during the first 48 h of care. However, intubation rates were higher in the HVNI group between Day 4 and Day 28 of ICU stay with no differences in hospital length of stay or 28‐day mortality.

Several prior studies have also shown results that cumulatively support the potential usage of HVNI in the treatment of acute exacerbations. One study with 92 patients supported the use of HVNI for the acute management of COPD exacerbation. In another study of 82 patients with COPD and moderate hypercarbia due to acute respiratory failure, compared to NiPPV, the use of HVNI led to fewer nursing interventions and skin breakdown episodes in the HVNI group. Further, in a subgroup analysis of 65 patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure who randomized to HVNI or NiPPV groups, the impact on pCO 2, pH, intubation rate, and treatment failure rate was similar.HVNI is also been shown effective in patients with mixed OSA and COPD.

In this study, treatment was noninferior at secondary outcomes of 30 min and at 1 h. The longer 4‐h time interval set as the primary outcome allowed the control group to catch up to the treatment group, but significant noninferiority was still detected. While lowering our significance level due to multiple comparisons, we continue to detect similar results and conclusions about the noninferiority of the treatment group for relieving dyspnea. Since all participants in this study who tolerated respiratory devices would be expected to eventually achieve minimal dyspnea, the study outcome was subject to "ceiling effects" at the longer time interval of 4 h. To avoid missing true differences between groups, a 5% error band was used. Since the treatment had the advantage of being more comfortable for the HVNI participants, we felt it was reasonable to adjust the significance level per guidelines that support a wider noninferiority margin for efficacy.

### Effect of home noninvasive positive pressure ventilation combined with pulmonary rehabilitation on dyspnea severity and quality of life in patients with severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease combined with chronic type II respiratory failure: a randomized controlled trial [^115MXHA3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common chronic respiratory disease characterized by irreversible airflow limitation and airway inflammation. It is progressive and prone to recurrent acute exacerbations. COPD is one of the leading causes of death globally. In the context of an aging population and worsening environmental pollution, the incidence and mortality rates of COPD continue to rise worldwide. According to statistics, the prevalence of COPD among people over 40 years old is approximately 13.6%, severely impacting patients'quality of life and health burden.

Currently, the treatment of COPD is mainly divided into pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Pharmacological treatment typically includes inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids, with the primary goals of alleviating symptoms, preventing acute exacerbations, and improving quality of life. However, studies have shown that pharmacological treatment is not effective in slowing the decline in lung function. With the deepening of COPD management, non-drug therapy, especially respiratory rehabilitation therapy, has gradually become a key means of COPD management.

Current research in pulmonary rehabilitation focuses on personalized and home-based interventions, particularly for COPD patients. Evidence suggests that these interventions significantly improve perioperative recovery. Additionally, individualized rehabilitation programs for elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have attracted considerable attention, showing promising results in enhancing physical function and quality of life.

For patients with severe stable COPD and chronic type II respiratory failure, the treatment model combining home non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) with home-based pulmonary rehabilitation has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach. This method not only effectively alleviates patients'breathing difficulties but also enhances lung function through continuous respiratory function exercises, thereby reducing the risk of acute exacerbations). Advancements in telemedicine have enhanced patients'self-management and made home rehabilitation more convenient. Online platforms allow for frequent and timely interactions between doctors and patients, improving compliance and outcomes. The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of combining NPPV with home-based pulmonary rehabilitation in improving the quality of life and disease prognosis for stable COPD patients.

Evidence for LTNIV in COPD

Randomized controlled trials of NIV in COPD published before 2010 largely failed to demonstrate benefits for physiologic, functional, or patient-reported outcomes or reduction of hospitalizations or survival. One exception was an Australian trial comparing LTNIV with long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) or LTOT alone, which found improvement in mortality with LTNIV after a mean follow-up of 2.21 years. However, worsening of certain quality-of-life parameters was observed, which hampered widespread support for LTNIV in COPD.

In parallel, work carried out in Europe generated increasing evidence that LTNIV could result in improved outcomes if settings were adjusted targeting obstructive COPD physiologic features and with specific CO 2 reduction goals, termed high-intensity ventilation. Although the exact definition of high-intensity NIV remains somewhat contentious, it is primarily the high pressure, rather than a high backup rate, that is the most relevant parameter. Using this type of strategy, Kohnlein et aldemonstrated markedly improved survival with LTNIV in stable hypercapnic patients with COPD, with improved quality of life. The mean inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) were 21.6 and 4.8 cm H 2 O, respectively, with backup rate (BUR) of 16.1/min. This trial included participants with Pa 2 of ≥ 52 mm Hg (mean, 58 mm Hg) and showed reduction, but not normalization, of daytime Pa 2 and improvement in oxygen saturation and FEV 1. Murphy et alstudied patients who remained hypercapnic (mean P 2, 59 mm Hg) 2 to 4 weeks after hospitalization for exacerbation requiring acute NIV and who met criteria for LTOT. Using mean IPAP and EPAP of 24 and 4 cm H 2 O, respectively, they demonstrated delayed time to readmission, reduced readmission rate, and improved quality of life. No improvement in mortality was found, but many control patients eventually crossed over to active treatment, and few deaths occurred. Conversely, another trial also including hypercapnic participants (mean P 2, approximately 59 mm Hg) after exacerbation did not demonstrate benefit of NIV on readmissions or deathusing mean IPAP and EPAP of 19 and 4 cm H 2 O, respectively. It has been suggested that this resulted from inclusion of participants randomized as early as 48 h after discontinuation of acute NIV who may not have been chronically hypercapnic, because reduction of P 2 in the control group mirrored that in the NIV group in the first 3 months. Variable results across modern trials highlight that LTNIV benefits very specific patient populations with COPD; the trials with positive results define the indications and target populations.

### High-velocity nasal insufflation versus noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^112VD2r1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

One potential alternative for ventilatory support is high‐velocity nasal insufflation (HVNI), which provides warm humidified oxygenated air to the nares at a higher rate than possible with a standard nasal cannula. Because HVNI provides pressurized, warmed, and humidified oxygen via a less constrictive nasal cannula, HVNI may be a more tolerable alternative to NiPPV and may not require sedation. Other potential benefits of HVNI over NiPPV include ease in speech, possibility of clearing secretions through coughing, consumption of food, and use of oral and inhaled medications. The ability to address sputum production with suctioning and deliver bronchodilator medication has been demonstrated in clinical practice. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommends NIPPV over HVNI in patients with COPD and acute hypercapnic respiratory failure; however, this recommendation was made considering the insufficient evidence confirming a clinically significant benefit of HVNI. Currently, ERS does suggest a conditional recommendation of utilizing HVNI prior to NiPPV due to HVNI's higher tolerability for patients and recommends HVNI over conventional oxygen therapy during NIPPV breaks for COPD patients. Therefore, additional investigation of HVNI in COPD and hypercapnic respiratory failure is necessary to elucidate the clinical benefits or harms of HVNI in this patient population to justify increased usage during COPD exacerbation events.

The ability of HVNI to improve oxygenation especially during the COVID‐19 pandemic led to widespread availability of the technology over the past several years. A recent multicenter randomized clinical trial demonstrated the noninferiority of HVNI to NiPPV in the treatment of undifferentiated respiratory distress in patients presenting to the ED. However, it is unknown whether HVNI is a reasonable alternative to NiPPV to improve ventilation and to reduce dyspnea in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD with hypercapnia. There exists clinical equipoise that HVNI may be an effective alternative treatment option for these patients. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether HVNI is noninferior to NiPPV in reducing dyspnea within 4 h in ED patients with acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114A1ywW]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should no longer be seen as a condition for which little can be done. Novel pharmacotherapeutic interventions, surgical and procedural advances, and respiratory assist devices have provided numerous ways to help patients with COPD and treatable traits. For nearly 30 years, non-invasive ventilation, the application of positive pressure through a mask interface placed outside of the airway, has been the cornerstone for treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation. Clinical trials indicate that this intervention could benefit patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in a stable state. This narrative review aims to provide the necessary background for internists to consider this therapeutic option for their COPD patients. We discuss the mechanism of action and implementation, and provide a glimpse into the future of this promising intervention.

### Home non invasive ventilation (NIV) treatment for COPD patients with a history of NIV-treated exacerbation; a randomized, controlled, multi-center study [^111Gqr3H]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the prognosis for patients who have survived an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation is poor. Despite being shown to improve survival and quality-of-life in stable patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, long-term noninvasive ventilation is controversial in unstable patients with frequent exacerbations, complicated by acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. In an uncontrolled group of patients with previous episodes of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, treated with noninvasive ventilation, we have been able to reduce mortality and the number of repeat respiratory failure and readmissions by continuing the acute noninvasive ventilatory therapy as a long-term therapy.

Methods

Multi-center open label randomized controlled trial of 150 patients having survived an admission with noninvasive ventilatory treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The included patients are randomized to usual care or to continuing the acute noninvasive ventilation as a long-term therapy, both with a one-year follow-up period. The primary endpoint is time to death or repeat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure; secondary endpoints are one-year mortality, number of readmissions and repeat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, exacerbations, dyspnea, quality of life, sleep quality, lung function, and arterial gases.

Discussion

Though previous studies of long-term noninvasive ventilation have shown conflicting results, we believe the treatment can reduce mortality and readmissions when applied in patients with previous need of acute ventilatory support, regardless of persistent hypercapnia.

### The evidence for noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in the care of patients in acute respiratory failure: a systematic review of the literature [^11456LjV]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) is increasingly being used in the care of patients suffering acute respiratory failure. High-level evidence supports the use of NPPV to treat exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). NPPV has also been successfully used with selected patients suffering acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and to allow earlier extubation of mechanically ventilated COPD patients. The evidence for NPPV for acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema is inconclusive. With selected patients NPPV decreases the rate of intubation, mortality, and nosocomial pneumonia. Predictors of NPPV failure include greater severity of illness, lower level of consciousness, lower pH, more air leak around the patient-mask interface, greater quantity of secretions, poor initial response to NPPV, and the presence of pneumonia. NPPV obviates intubation in > 50% of appropriately selected patients. Both nasal and oronasal interfaces have been successfully used to apply NPPV, but the oronasal interface is often preferred for acute respiratory failure. Any ventilator and ventilator mode can be used to apply NPPV, but portable pressure ventilators and pressure-support mode are most commonly used. Inhaled bronchodilators can be administered during NPPV, and NPPV can be delivered with helium-oxygen mixture. Institution-specific practice guidelines may be useful to improve NPPV success.

### Effect of home noninvasive ventilation with oxygen therapy vs oxygen therapy alone on hospital readmission or death after an acute COPD exacerbation: a randomized clinical trial [^1126qVhr]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study NIV in COPD with chronic hypercapnia was published by Murphy PB and colleagues in 2017 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and Dyspnea in palliative care. In the NIV in COPD with chronic hypercapnia study, the trial question was: what is the effect of home noninvasive ventilation plus oxygen therapy in patients with persistent hypercapnia after an acute COPD exacerbation? In the NIV in COPD with chronic hypercapnia study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the NIV in COPD with chronic hypercapnia study, the population was: 116 patients (61 female, 55 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with persistent hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 53 mmHg) who had an acute COPD exacerbation. The key exclusion criteria were obesity (BMI > 35), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, or other causes of respiratory failure. In the NIV in COPD with chronic hypercapnia study, the interventions were: n = 57 home noninvasive ventilation plus oxygen therapy (ventilator setting are inspiratory positive airway pressure of 24 cmH₂O, an EPAP of 4 cmH₂O, and a backup rate of 14 breaths/minute plus median oxygen flow rate of 1.0 L/min) n = 59 home oxygen therapy alone (median oxygen flow rate, 1.0 L/min). In the NIV in COPD with chronic hypercapnia study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in time to readmission or death within 12 months (4.3 months vs. 1.4 months;). In the NIV in COPD with chronic hypercapnia study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in readmission or death at 12 months (63.4% vs. 80.4%; ARR 17, 95% CI 0.1 to 34). In the NIV in COPD with chronic hypercapnia study, the conclusion was: in patients with persistent hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 53 mmHg) who had an acute COPD exacerbation, home noninvasive ventilation plus oxygen therapy was superior to home oxygen therapy alone with respect to time to readmission or death within 12 months.

### Managing acute respiratory failure during exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116hiooU]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major health problem, causing more than half a million hospital admissions per year in the United States. Although overall mortality is low, it is substantially higher with severe exacerbations that require intensive care and mechanical ventilation. The majority of COPD exacerbations result from infection, with typical bacterial organisms most commonly identified. Numerous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have documented the benefits of antibiotics, low-flow oxygen, and systemic corticosteroids, and the therapeutic equivalency of the major classes of bronchodilators (short-acting beta-agonist and anticholinergics). Randomized controlled trials also demonstrate that noninvasive ventilation can decrease the incidence of intubation, shorten stay, reduce infectious complications, and improve survival. Although patients who require intubation have the worst prognosis, the vast majority of them can be successfully liberated from mechanical ventilation. For invasively ventilated patients the clinical emphasis should be on improving patient-ventilator interaction and avoiding dynamic hyperinflation (intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure).

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: the evidence base [^115hpsKm]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

In long-term management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a number of medications improve pulmonary function test results. The long-term clinical benefits of those drugs would seem intuitive, but there is very little strong evidence that long-term outcomes in COPD are substantially affected by those drugs. Nevertheless, symptom improvement such as dyspnea reduction is certainly strong reason to use those agents. The 2 most compelling bodies of evidence in stable COPD are for oxygen therapy in the chronically hypoxemic patient and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve exercise tolerance and dyspnea. Inhaled corticosteroids also appear to be useful in patients at risk for frequent exacerbations. In acute exacerbations, the rationale for therapy comes in part from the large body of literature regarding acute asthma therapy. Bronchodilator therapy and corticosteroids both seem to reduce the severity and the duration of exacerbations. Moreover, routine antibiotic use seems beneficial, and the role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation with patients suffering impending respiratory failure from acute COPD exacerbations is well supported by the literature.

### Official ERS / ATS clinical practice guidelines: noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure [^116TSPc6]. The European Respiratory Journal (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, noninvasive ventilation, indications, ERS 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate a trial of bilevel noninvasive ventilation in patients deemed to require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation unless the patient is immediately deteriorating.

### High-velocity nasal insufflation versus noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for moderate acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the emergency department: a randomized clinical trial [^1122PTgw]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Perception of comfort by the participant was measured on a continuous 10‐point Visual Analog Scale (VAS), with responses ranging from insufficient to excellent. Finally, we asked the clinicians three questions: (1) "How satisfied were you with the degree of respiratory support that this patient received since presenting and enrolling in the study?" (2) "How satisfied were you with the degree of comfort and tolerance exhibited by this patient with the received therapy since presentation and enrollment in the study?" (3) "During the study procedures, what degree of challenge did you find setting up and using/adjusting the device providing therapy to this patient?"

Outcomes were chosen to match those used in prior NIPPV efficacy studies. The rationality for choosing a noninferiority design is that NIPPV is an established treatment modality; however, it is associated with patient discomfort and delayed relief while HVNI is generally perceived to be more comfortable for patients. Demonstrating that HVNI is equivalent to controlling dyspnea would suffice to establish it as a more desirable treatment option. The noninferiority margin of 1.0 was selected based on clinical experience with the dyspnea score and a review of literature. While there are no equivalent prior studies used to establish a minimally significant difference, in a study of ED patients with acute heart failure, a similar change was used as the minimal clinically important difference for improvement in dyspnea over 6 h.

### Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for exacerbation… [^115dzjJo]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Narrative: COPD is a progressive lung disease characterized by hyperinflation of the lungs, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD death rates in the United States have declined since 1999, predominantly in males. 1 Endotracheal intubation with ventilatory support for severe exacerbations is difficult to reverse. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, if effective in avoiding endotracheal intubation, could, therefore, save lives and reduce suffering. NIPPV reduced both primary outcomes, including death and endotracheal intubation. Inability to comply with treatment was higher in the NIPPV group. Complications due to NIPPV occurred in nearly one in three patients. However, overall there were fewer complications unrelated to NIPPV. 1 After the publication of this Cochrane review, the European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society published practice guidelines for NIPPV in patients with COPD during acute exacerbation. 2 These guidelines advise against NIPPV to prevent respiratory acidosis but recommend it for treating acute respiratory acidosis. They also recommend NIPPV for those with severe acidosis and severe distress, as an alternative to invasive ventilation. NIPPV reduces mortality and endotracheal intubation in hypercapnic respiratory failure caused by COPD exacerbation. Inability to comply with treatment is higher with NIPPV. However, unrelated complications are less common, and related complications are typically minor.

Because of major benefits and the absence of serious harms, we have assigned a color recommendation of green for this intervention.

### Effect of high-intensity vs low-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation on the need for endotracheal intubation in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the HAPPEN randomized clinical trial [^111m6pEb]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The effect of high-intensity noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) on the need for endotracheal intubation in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unknown.

Objective

To determine whether the use of high-intensity NPPV vs low-intensity NPPV reduces the need for endotracheal intubation in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD and hypercapnia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial conducted at 30 general respiratory non-intensive care unit wards of Chinese hospitals from January 3, 2019, to January 31, 2022; the last 90-day follow-up was on April 22, 2022. The included patients had an acute exacerbation of COPD and a Paco2 level greater than 45 mm Hg after receiving 6 hours of low-intensity NPPV.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive high-intensity NPPV with inspiratory positive airway pressure that was adjusted to obtain a tidal volume 10 mL/kg to 15 mL/kg of predicted body weight (n = 147) or to continue receiving low-intensity NPPV with inspiratory positive airway pressure that was adjusted to obtain a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg to 10 mL/kg of predicted body weight (n = 153). Patients in the low-intensity NPPV group who met the prespecified criteria for the need for endotracheal intubation were allowed to crossover to high-intensity NPPV.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the need for endotracheal intubation during hospitalization, which was defined by prespecified criteria. There were 15 prespecified secondary outcomes, including endotracheal intubation.

Results

The trial was terminated by the data and safety monitoring board and the trial steering committee after an interim analysis of the first 300 patients. Among the 300 patients who completed the trial (mean age, 73 years [SD, 10 years]; 68% were men), all were included in the analysis. The primary outcome of meeting prespecified criteria for the need for endotracheal intubation occurred in 7 of 147 patients (4.8%) in the high-intensity NPPV group vs 21 of 153 (13.7%) in the low-intensity NPPV group (absolute difference, -9.0% [95% CI, -15.4% to -2.5%], 1-sided P = 0.004). However, rates of endotracheal intubation did not significantly differ between groups (3.4% [5/147] in the high-intensity NPPV group vs 3.9% [6/153] in the low-intensity NPPV group; absolute difference, -0.5% [95% CI, -4.8% to 3.7%], P = 0.81). Abdominal distension occurred more frequently in the high-intensity NPPV group (37.4% [55/147]) compared with the low-intensity NPPV group (25.5% [39/153]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients with COPD and persistent hypercapnia in the high-intensity NPPV group (vs patients in the low-intensity NPPV group) were significantly less likely to meet criteria for the need for endotracheal intubation; however, patients in the low-intensity NPPV group were allowed to crossover to high-intensity NPPV, and the between-group rate of endotracheal intubation was not significantly different.

### Two-year home-based nocturnal noninvasive ventilation added to rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: a randomized controlled trial [^113Vs8gt]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease leading to severe dyspnea at low exercise levels, reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and high mortality rates.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improves dyspnea, exercise capacity, and HRQoL in patients with COPD. These positive effects can be maintained well if the exercise training is continued at home after initial intensive PR. However, in severe COPD patients, PR may be difficult to perform, and effects may be less maintainable at home. Therefore, there is a need for additive therapies enhancing the effectiveness of PR, especially in patients with severe COPD.

We recently showed that the addition of 3-month nocturnal noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to an intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation program improves the outcomes of PR in severe COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Three other studies have also investigated noninvasive ventilation in combination with PR, but assessed short-term effects only. A few studies showed conflicting results of long-term effects of NIPPV in COPD. However, these studies did not add NIPPV to PR and ventilator settings used were probably too low to provide beneficial effects. The present study explores whether the initial positive effects of 3-month NIPPV in addition to PR, with the use of sufficient ventilator settings, can be maintained over 2-year home-based follow-up in COPD patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Outcome parameters were HRQoL, mood state, dyspnea scores, gas exchange, functional status, pulmonary function, and exacerbation frequency.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111uetDp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

As this analysis was driven by two large RCTs, the RESCUE (Respiratory Support in COPD after Acute Exacerbation) trial (Struik and colleagues) and the HOT-HMV (Home Oxygen Therapy–Home Mechanical Ventilation) trial (Murphy and colleagues), some detail of these trials is important. In RESCUE, 201 patients with COPD admitted to the hospital with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure who had persistent hypercapnia more than 48 hours after ventilatory support were randomly assigned to NIV or to no NIV. At 1 year, although there was improvement in both daytime and nocturnal hypercapnia, there was no improvement in mortality, frequency of exacerbation, or time to hospital readmission or death. In HOT-HMV, 116 patients with severe COPD who received NIV during acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and who remained hypercapnic (defined as Pa CO 2 > 53 mm Hg) 2–4 weeks afterward were randomly assigned to long-term NIV (HMV) with HOT or to HOT alone. At 1 year, there was no significant difference in 12-month mortality between the groups (28% for HOT + HMV vs. 32% for HOT), although there was some crossover to NIV in the HOT-only arm. However, there were fewer exacerbations (3.8 exacerbations/yr with HOT + HMV vs. 5.1 exacerbations/yr in HOT-only arm).

### Heliox and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation: a role for heliox in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease? [^115PLvFC]. Respiratory Care (2006). Low credibility.

Evidence-based respiratory therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes oxygen, inhaled bronchodilators, and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Examining the physics of gas flow, a case can be made either for or against the use of helium-oxygen mixture (heliox) in the care of patients with COPD. The evidence for the use of heliox in patients with COPD exacerbation is not strong at present. Most of the peer-reviewed literature consists of case reports, case series, and physiologic studies in small samples of carefully selected patients. Some patients with COPD exacerbation have a favorable physiologic response to heliox therapy, but predicting who will be a responder is difficult. Moreover, the use of heliox is hampered by the lack of widespread availability of an approved heliox delivery system. Appropriately designed randomized controlled trials with patient-important outcomes, such as avoidance of intubation, decreased intensive-care-unit and hospital days, and decreased cost of therapy, are sorely needed to establish the role of heliox in patients with COPD exacerbation, including those receiving noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Lacking such evidence, the use of heliox in patients with COPD exacerbation cannot be considered standard therapy.

Regarding respiratory support for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to noninvasive ventilation, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating long-term noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation to improve hospitalization-free survival in patients with severe chronic hypercapnia (particularly with pronounced daytime persistent hypercapnia, PaCO2 ≥ 53 mmHg) and a history of hospitalization for acute respiratory failure.

### Noninvasive vs. conventional mechanical ventilation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after failure of medical treatment in the ward: a randomized trial [^111Hwkns]. Intensive Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We conducted a randomized prospective study comparing noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) with conventional mechanical ventilation via endotracheal intubation (ETI) in a group of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who failed standard medical treatment in the emergency ward after initial improvement and met predetermined criteria for ventilatory support.

Design and Setting

Prospective randomized study in a university hospital 13-bed general ICU.

Patients

Forty-nine patients were randomly assigned to receive NPPV (n = 23) or conventional ventilation (n = 26).

Results

both NPPV and conventional ventilation significantly improved gas exchanges. The two groups had similar length of ICU stay, number of days on mechanical ventilation, overall complications, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. In the NPPV group 11 (48%) patients avoided intubation, survived, and had a shorter duration of ICU stay than intubated patients. One year following hospital discharge the NPPV group had fewer patients readmitted to the hospital (65% vs. 100%) or requiring de novo permanent oxygen supplementation (0% vs. 36%).

Conclusions

The use of NPPV in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support after failure of medical treatment avoided ETI in 48% of the patients, had the same ICU mortality as conventional treatment and, at 1-year follow-up was associated with fewer patients readmitted to the hospital or requiring for long-term oxygen supplementation.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^111rBbiC]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Ventilatory support in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) notes that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is occasionally used in patients with stable very severe COPD, and NIV may be considered of some use in a selected group of patients, particularly in those with pronounced daytime hypercapnia and recent hospitalization, although a systematic review was unable to support or refute this; in contrast, in patients with both COPD and obstructive sleep apnea there are clear indications for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). During exacerbations of COPD, NIV in the form of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is the standard of care for decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of COPD and acute respiratory failure, and in stable patients with both COPD and obstructive sleep apnea there are clear benefits associated with the use of CPAP to improve both survival and the risk of hospital admissions.

### Noninvasive ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis [^115HEmW4]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Although long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival, it has little effect on hypoventilation and other outcomes in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recent studies have shown that the use of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, when used in combination with LTOT in selected stable COPD patients, controls hypoventilation and improves daytime arterial blood gases, sleep quality, health status and may have a benefit in reducing exacerbation frequency and severity. Patients who show the greatest reduction in overnight carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood with ventilation are most likely to benefit from long-term ventilatory support. Some benefits have also been shown in patients with chronic respiratory failure due to bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis, though survival is inferior in this patient group. As most studies of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been relatively short term, large multicentre studies with survival, exacerbations and hospital admissions as the primary end points are required to evaluate longer term effects.

### Internet of things-based management versus standard management of home noninvasive ventilation in COPD patients with hypercapnic chronic respiratory failure: a multicentre randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^1153ZwZC]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The role of home noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in the management of patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF) has long been controversial, with published studies yielding conflicting results regarding the impact of home NPPV on clinical, physiological, hospital readmission, and survival outcomes. However, more promising results have been obtained from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of high-intensity NPPV on patients with hypercapnic COPD. Indeed, home NPPV with high levels of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP), combined with a high backup respiratory rate to promote a maximal reduction in partial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO 2), may result in significant physiological and clinical benefits. On the basis of these results, the 2023 report of the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) indicated that NPPV may well improve hospitalization-free survival in patients with pronounced daytime persistent hypercapnia. Moreover, the latest guidelines from the European Respiratory Societyand American Thoracic Societysupport the use of home NPPV for patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD.

### Acute exacerbations and respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^115wT5mG]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) describe the phenomenon of sudden worsening in airway function and respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD. These exacerbations can range from self-limited diseases to episodes of florid respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The average patient with COPD experiences two such episodes annually, and they account for significant consumption of health care resources. Although bacterial infections are the most common causes of AECOPD, viral infections and environmental stresses are also implicated. AECOPD episodes can be triggered or complicated by other comorbidities, such as heart disease, other lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary emboli, aspiration, pneumothorax), or systemic processes. Pharmacologic management includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics in most patients. Oxygen, physical therapy, mucolytics, and airway clearance devices may be useful in selected patients. In hypercapneic respiratory failure, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may allow time for other therapies to work and thus avoid endotracheal intubation. If the patient requires invasive mechanical ventilation, the focus should be on avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury and minimizing intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure. These may require limiting ventilation and "permissive hypercapnia". Although mild episodes of AECOPD are generally reversible, more severe forms of respiratory failure are associated with a substantial mortality and a prolonged period of disability in survivors.

### Efficacy of non-invasive ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease management: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112Jjh8A]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our meta-analysis provides strong evidence that NIV is a valuable therapeutic strategy for managing COPD, yielding significant improvements in clinical outcomes. Specifically, NIV was associated with reduced mortality, decreased intubation frequency, lower exacerbation frequency, and improved gas exchange, as evidenced by decreased PaCO2 levels and increased PaO2 levels. These findings suggest that NIV can be a highly effective treatment approach for COPD patients, particularly those with acute exacerbations or stable disease. By reducing respiratory muscle fatigue, improving alveolar ventilation, and enhancing gas exchange, NIV can help to alleviate symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve quality of life. Furthermore, by reducing the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, NIV can also lower the risk of complications and improve patient outcomes. Despite the promising findings, our meta-analysis highlights the need for further research to refine patient selection and optimize NIV protocols to identify the patient subgroups that derive the most benefit from NIV, determine the optimal duration and intensity of NIV therapy.

### Effect of home NIV on outcomes after acute COPD exacerbation… [^117BL9Hb]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the effect of home NIV plus oxygen on time to readmission or death in patients with persistent hypercapnia after an acute COPD exacerbation. Design, Setting, and Participants. Main Outcomes and Measures Time to readmission or death within 12 months adjusted for the number of previous COPD admissions, previous use of long-term oxygen, age, and BMI. Results. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with persistent hypercapnia following an acute exacerbation of COPD, adding home noninvasive ventilation to home oxygen therapy prolonged the time to readmission or death within 12 months. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00990132. Patients were recruited from 13 UK centers and were followed up for 12 months. Patients admitted with acute decompensated hypercapnic exacerbations of COPD requiring acute noninvasive ventilation were screened for eligibility at least 2 weeks after resolution of decompensated acidosis and within 4 weeks of attaining clinical stability. Chronic respiratory failure was attributed to severe COPD provided that the forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration was less than 50% of predicted, the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was less than 60%, and the patient had a smoking history of greater than 20. The randomized cohort had severe COPD as evidenced by severe airflow obstruction and hypercapnia respiratory failure. There was no evidence of significant obstructive sleep apnea in randomized patients. The per-protocol and sensitivity analyses also were consistent with these results. A post hoc analysis of 28-day readmission identified a significant treatment effect with an unadjusted HR of 0. 27 and an adjusted HR of 0.
26. The majority of readmissions during follow-up were related to respiratory concerns.
