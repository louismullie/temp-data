## Question

46 yo F with chronic migraines and a history of intermittent Raynaud's phenomenon presents with severe, refractory headache. She has failed sumatriptan at home. BP 122/76, HR 68, normal neuro exam. Neurologist recommends dihydroergotamine (DHE) IV in ED. Start DHE infusion as ordered?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) should be administered to a 46-year-old woman with chronic migraine, a history of intermittent Raynaud's phenomenon, and failure of sumatriptan at home. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's diagnosis and whether DHE is indicated for refractory migraine. Then, I should verify absolute and relative contraindications, especially vasospastic disorders like Raynaud's. Next, I will review the pharmacology and risk profile of DHE, including peripheral vasoconstriction and ischemic complications. After that, I should weigh benefits versus risks in this specific patient. Finally, I will outline safer alternatives and a practical decision framework, including what monitoring and precautions would be necessary if DHE were still considered despite risks [^506b0c38] [^2723f761] [^861b1676].

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and indication. She has chronic migraine with a severe, refractory attack and has failed sumatriptan, which makes DHE a reasonable rescue option in principle, as DHE is indicated for acute migraine and is often used when triptans fail or are contraindicated, with evidence supporting efficacy in refractory presentations and inpatient protocols [^8f6403d9] [^506b0c38] [^982b634c].

> Wait, let me verify the key contraindication. Multiple FDA labels for DHE explicitly warn about vasospastic reactions, including peripheral vascular ischemia and Raynaud's syndrome, and advise that patients who develop signs of decreased arterial flow such as Raynaud's syndrome should be evaluated and that DHE should be discontinued if vasoconstriction develops; this is a red flag for use in someone with preexisting Raynaud's phenomenon [^2723f761] [^861b1676] [^f834b3dd].

> I need to check the pharmacologic mechanism next. DHE is an ergot alkaloid with prominent vasoconstrictive effects mediated through 5‑HT1B/1D agonism and alpha-adrenergic activity; while it is less peripherally vasoconstrictive than ergotamine, it still causes vasospasm and has been associated with peripheral ischemia, including digital ischemia and gangrene in susceptible patients, which directly intersects with Raynaud's pathophysiology [^800587ee] [^2723f761] [^861b1676].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should quantify risk. Although exact incidence is not specified, FDA labeling repeatedly emphasizes that persistent vasospasm can result in gangrene or death in patients with compromised circulation, and case literature documents vasospastic angina and ischemic complications even in patients without overt coronary disease; given her baseline vasospastic tendency, the relative risk is materially increased [^2723f761] [^861b1676] [^4e68e144].

> Let me consider the balance of benefits and risks. DHE can be effective in refractory migraine and may reduce recurrence compared with triptans, but in a patient with Raynaud's, the risk of precipitating severe vasospasm, digital ischemia, or worsening Raynaud's attacks outweighs the potential benefit; safer alternatives exist that do not carry the same vasoconstrictive liability, so the risk-benefit calculus favors avoidance of DHE here [^506b0c38] [^2723f761] [^861b1676].

> I should double-check alternatives. Non-vasoconstrictive options such as CGRP receptor antagonists (gepants like ubrogepant or rimegepant) or the 5‑HT1F agonist lasmiditan are appropriate next-line acute therapies when triptans fail, and they do not cause peripheral vasoconstriction; additionally, antiemetics and NSAIDs can be combined as part of a migraine cocktail in the ED setting, and these strategies align with contemporary guidelines and evidence syntheses [^04308b13] [^506b0c38] [^a7e2a5ea].

> But wait, what if the team insists on DHE despite risks? If, after shared decision-making, DHE is still pursued, I need to ensure strict precautions: obtain baseline ECG, monitor vitals during infusion, premedicate aggressively for nausea, and instruct the patient to report immediately any chest pain, dyspnea, or change in digit color or temperature; if any ischemic symptoms occur, stop the infusion and evaluate promptly, recognizing that this mitigation does not eliminate risk in someone with Raynaud's [^ac8d2f44] [^982b634c] [^2723f761].

> Final decision: I should confirm that DHE is contraindicated in this context. Given intermittent Raynaud's phenomenon and the well-documented risk of peripheral vasospasm and ischemia with DHE, the safest, evidence-aligned course is to decline IV DHE and choose a non-vasoconstrictive alternative such as a gepant or lasmiditan, with supportive antiemetics and NSAIDs as indicated, while arranging close follow-up for migraine management and reassessing acute options if symptoms persist [^2723f761] [^861b1676] [^04308b13] [^506b0c38].

---

Do not start IV DHE in this patient. Raynaud's phenomenon is a **contraindication to DHE** because of the risk of severe peripheral vasoconstriction and ischemia [^2723f761] [^861b1676]. Even with a normal exam and stable vitals, DHE can precipitate digital ischemia or gangrene in patients with Raynaud's. Use **non-vasoconstrictive alternatives** such as gepants (ubrogepant, rimegepant) or lasmiditan, and consider NSAIDs or antiemetics as adjuncts [^04308b13] [^506b0c38]. If DHE is considered despite the risk, obtain cardiology consultation and monitor closely for ischemic symptoms, but it should generally be avoided.

---

## Pharmacological considerations of DHE

DHE is an ergot alkaloid with potent vasoconstrictive properties, acting as a 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist and alpha-adrenergic agonist [^800587ee]. These mechanisms underlie its efficacy in migraine but also its **vasoconstrictive risks**, including peripheral ischemia and Raynaud's exacerbation [^2723f761] [^861b1676].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines regarding DHE use in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon

Multiple FDA labels explicitly contraindicate DHE in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon due to the risk of severe vasoconstriction and ischemia [^2723f761] [^861b1676]. The labels warn that DHE can cause muscle pains, numbness, coldness, pallor, cyanosis of the digits, and, in compromised circulation, persistent vasospasm leading to gangrene or death [^2723f761] [^861b1676]. Although specific incidence data are lacking, the risk is clinically significant and well recognized.

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks associated with DHE administration in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon

In patients with Raynaud's, DHE can precipitate severe vasospasm, digital ischemia, and even gangrene. Case reports document vasospastic angina and ischemic complications with DHE, even in patients without overt coronary disease [^4e68e144]. Given this risk profile, **the potential harm outweighs any benefit** in this setting.

---

## Alternative acute migraine treatments suitable for patients with Raynaud's phenomenon

Given the contraindication to DHE, **consider the following alternatives**:

- **Gepants**: Ubrogepant or rimegepant are non-vasoconstrictive CGRP receptor antagonists suitable for acute treatment [^04308b13] [^506b0c38].
- **Lasmiditan**: A 5-HT1F agonist without vasoconstrictive effects, appropriate for patients with vascular risk factors [^notfound].
- **NSAIDs and antiemetics**: Ketorolac, metoclopramide, or prochlorperazine can be used as adjuncts or alternatives depending on clinical context [^6bec3378].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus advise against DHE in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. The FDA labeling is the most authoritative source, and headache guidelines emphasize selecting therapies without vasoconstrictive properties in patients with peripheral vascular disease or Raynaud's [^2723f761] [^861b1676].

---

## Monitoring and precautions if DHE is administered despite contraindications

If DHE is administered despite the risk, **take the following precautions**:

- **Baseline ECG**: Recommended to assess cardiovascular risk [^ac8d2f44].
- **Continuous monitoring**: Watch for ischemic symptoms, blood pressure changes, and cardiac events [^2723f761].
- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop infusion if any ischemic symptoms occur [^2723f761].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's Raynaud's phenomenon, **IV DHE is contraindicated** due to the risk of severe vasoconstriction and ischemia. Use non-vasoconstrictive alternatives such as gepants or lasmiditan, with NSAIDs or antiemetics as appropriate. If DHE is considered despite the risk, obtain cardiology input and monitor closely, but it should generally be avoided.

Summary

DHE is an older drug with an interesting history, yet it is still clinically useful today for patients with migraine attacks not responsive to triptans, who have a greater burden from migraine, and in refractory migraine. Currently, it is administered as a liquid nasal spray or by injection, though oral formulations have been used historically, and an intranasal powder is in development. DHE can be used at home, in the clinic, and in the hospital with good results in select patients. All providers who care for patients with migraine should be familiar with its properties and precautions.

Introduction

Migraine is an under-recognized and undertreated neurologic condition that can be significantly costly and disabling. Migraine has been found to be the second leading cause of disability in the United States when it comes to "impaired quality of life, substantial lost productivity, and high economic costs". Several theories behind the etiology of migraine have been put forth over centuries, including both vascular and neuronal, until ultimately in 2002, Goadsby, Lipton, and Ferrari described migraine as a neurovascular condition. Treatments for migraine include preventive and acute, and in one way or another, they address certain aspects of migraine pathophysiology. With respect to acute therapy, there has been an evolution from treatments that are non-specific (ie, they target aspects not unique to migraine) to the more specific (ie, they target the unique aspects) driven by the need for more effective and better tolerated approaches. One of the first synthesized migraine-specific treatments is dihydroergotamine (DHE). Here we discuss the coming of age of DHE through its prototype, its pharmacology, and its pharmacokinetics, and more importantly, the special considerations – who should use it, under what circumstances, and when to use with caution.

Patient Selection and Clinical Use

Guidelines in the United States and France recommend migraine-specific therapies like triptans and DHE as first-line treatment for moderate to severe attacks.DHE is considered generally beneficial in difficult to treat cases, for example, those with menstrual migraine, rebound headache, migraine recurrence, status migrainosus, or chronic daily headache. A typical intranasal dose consists of one spray (0.5 mg) into each nostril then repeated after 15 minutes. A typical injectable dose is 0.5 to 1 mg. It is generally recommended to limit dosing to 3 mg per 24 hours and to 6 mg per week, though it has been established safe and effective to give up to 3 mg per day for up to 7 days in a controlled setting.

Both triptans and DHE act on 5HT-1B and −1D receptors but have different pharmacodynamics. Both can be useful in the treatment of moderate to severe migraine attacks, with sumatriptan providing more rapid relief and DHE being more effective in reducing recurrence. Often DHE is reserved as an option for patients whom triptans have failed but has value also in difficult to treat headaches and those complicated with medication overuse.

Transient headache exacerbation during IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) therapy of migraine may prompt clinicians to prematurely discontinue DHE therapy, potentially depriving patients of the full benefit of DHE infusion.

It was not until 1943 that DHE was first developed as a derivative of ergotamine. DHE, when compared to ergotamine, demonstrates greater alpha-adrenergic antagonist activity, lower arterial vasoconstriction, less dopaminergic agonism, and lower emetic potential.

DHE was largely used and studied as an acute treatment for migraine at first. It was later found that DHE, while effective in acute treatment, required higher doses for the same effects when compared to ergotamine. Because of its weaker vasoconstrictive properties, later studies supported the notion that DHE might be used as a prophylactic treatment. Currently, it is used in some countries under this indication, but not in the USA.

For years, ergotamine and DHE were the only migraine-specific treatment options until the era of the triptans. Now many guidelines list triptans and DHE as first-line therapies for moderate to severe migraine attacks. DHE has been found to be helpful with menstrual migraine, status migrainosus, rebound headache, and chronic daily headache.DHE has also been found to be effective in triptan non-responders.

Emergency Departments and Urgent Care Centers

Patients who do not have adequate at-home treatment options lack access to outpatient infusion centers, or who have intractable nausea and vomiting may present to an emergency department (ED) or urgent care center (UCC) for treatment. There have been few strong studies of DHE use in the EDand none in the UCC setting. In one class 3 study in the ED, patients were randomized to DHE 1 mg SC or sumatriptan 5 mg SC. The outcome favored sumatriptan at 1 and 2 hours though not at 3 hours, suggesting a more durable effect of DHE at aborting a migraine attack. Due to the lack of rigorous studies, however, the use of IV DHE in the ED setting does not garner a strong recommendation. Despite this, it is used commonly in many EDs and UCCs, often as part of a "migraine cocktail" incorporating antiemetic and anti-inflammatory drugs. Further study is warranted to establish best practices with DHE under these circumstances.

Inpatient

Certain populations of patients benefit from inpatient admission for the management of migraine. Among them include patients with status migrainosus, dehydration or intractable nausea/vomiting, dependence on opioids or barbiturates requiring detoxification, medical disease requiring careful observation, outpatient treatment failure, frequent ED visits, and those requiring comprehensive medical or psychiatric co-management.

For patients with a longstanding history of refractory migraine, inpatient treatment improves pain and disability and reduces analgesic overuse. Multiple drugs can be used in the inpatient setting along with DHE to enhance its effects, manage other symptoms of migraine, and mitigate adverse events. Inpatient use was first described by Raskin, in which 55 patients with continuous headache, most of whom were overusing acute medications, received IV DHE at a dose between 0.3 mg and 1 mg every 8 hours for 2 days. At the end of treatment, 89% of patients were headache-free with most reporting lasting benefit.

### Diagnosis and management of the primary headache disorders in the emergency department setting [^6bec3378]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Headache continues to be a frequent cause of emergency department (ED) use, accounting for 2% of all visits. Most of these headaches prove to be benign but painful exacerbations of chronic headache disorders, such as migraine, tension-type, and cluster. The goal of ED management is to provide rapid and quick relief of benign headache, without causing undue side effects, and to recognize headaches with malignant course. Although these headaches have distinct epidemiologies and clinical phenotypes, there is overlapping response to therapy; nonsteroidals, triptans, dihydroergotamine, and the antiemetic dopamine antagonists may play a therapeutic role for each of these acute headaches. This article reviews the diagnostic criteria and management strategies for the primary headache disorders.

Formulations

DHE can be delivered via several different routes including IV, intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), intranasal (IN), oral, and orally inhaled (although the latter two are not available in the USA and the last remains experimental only). Pharmacokinetics, and thus efficacy and tolerability, vary with each route of administration.

Oral DHE was first formulated in 1943. It was not until much later that the IV formulation (in 1987) and the IM formulation (in 2001) of DHE were studied formally and shown to be effective in the treatment of migraine.

An extensive literature review written by Silberstein and Kori revealed the following when comparing each of the different formulations: 1) DHE, in general, is more effective than placebo but less effective than sumatriptan; 2) orally inhaled DHE likewise is more effective than placebo, though no comparative studies with sumatriptan had been done; 3) SC sumatriptan provides more rapid relief than DHE, but DHE results in less headache recurrence compared to sumatriptan; 4) among parenteral formulations of DHE (including SC, IM, IV, and IN), efficacy is superior with injectables, though adverse effects, including nausea, are worse with this dosing.

IN dosing carries advantages in that it is a convenient method of delivery with broad patient acceptability. Nasal sprays are more accessible while in the workplace and more acceptable to those with needle phobia; thus, non-injectable formulations are important options for outpatient management.

### Updated evaluation of IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) for refractory migraine: patient selection and special considerations [^7a3ed97b]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

DHE has low oral bioavailability and is subject to substantial (greater than 90%) first-pass metabolism. However, the metabolites of DHE have actions similar to those of the parent drug, which leads to potentiation of effect. In addition, oral DHE has incomplete and inconsistent drug passage across the gastrointestinal mucosa, making it suboptimal for clinical use. The absolute bioavailability of SC/IM/IV DHE is 100%, and for intranasal administration, it is approximately 40%. Peak plasma levels occur approximately 1 to 2 minutes after IV administration, 24 minutes after IM administration, and 30 to 60 minutes after intranasal administration. Parenteral administration of DHE avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism and delivers adequate plasma concentrations of the drug.DHE is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver with only about 6–7% excreted in the urine. The major route of elimination is the feces following biliary excretion of unchanged drug and metabolites.DHE has many metabolites, but only the ones that contain the ergoline ring structure of ergot alkaloids are active in migraine. The major metabolite is 8-OH DHE, which attains a concentration 5–7 times greater than that of DHE itself, with pharmacological effects qualitatively similar to those of the parent compound. The elimination half-life of DHE is biphasic, with peaks at approximately 0.7 to 1 hour and then 10 to 13 hours.

Pharmacology

DHE is one of the derivatives of ergot alkaloids, which come from the fungus Claviceps purpurea that grows in the ears of rye. The chemical structure of all ergot alkaloids includes the ergoline ring.DHE is a semisynthetic, hydrogenated ergot alkaloid synthesized by reducing an unsaturated bond in ergotamine. This chemical modification results in an ergot derivative with greater alpha-adrenergic antagonist activity and reduced vasoconstrictor and emetic potential.DHE is structurally similar to lysergic acid diethylamide (aka LSD); however, it does not carry hallucinogenic properties.DHE also has structural similarities to serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, therefore its purported mechanism of action is by acting on various catecholamine receptors.

The exact mechanism of action is not known; however, it is proposed to include inhibition of neurogenic inflammation, blockade of transmission in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, and possibly, vasoactive effects (eg, constriction of large capacitance arteries, closure of arteriovenous anastomoses). It is believed that these effects are due to its potent agonist activity at 5HT-1B, −1D, and −1F receptors. The most common adverse effects seen with DHE include nausea, vasoconstriction, and dizziness, suggesting that DHE indeed acts also on dopaminergic, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors.

History of Dihydroergotamine

Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is an ergot alkaloid borne from the discovery of ergots, substances produced by rye fungus and recognized to have interesting biologic properties centuries ago. The first ergot used in modern medicine is ergotamine, which was isolated from its ergot predecessor in 1918. Ergotamine was initially used for its uterotonic effects in the field of gynecology and obstetrics under the name Gynergen (ergotamine tartrate) in 1921. Ergotamine was first used for the treatment of migraine in 1925 by Maier in Switzerland, when it was originally postulated that migraine was caused by increased sympathetic activity and that ergotamine could reverse that effect based on its properties. Not long after, Graham and Wolff showed a parallel decrease in temporal pulsations and headache after the use of intravenous (IV) ergotamine, inspiring the Vascular Theory of Wolff. This theory stated that an initial cerebral vasoconstriction would be followed by vasodilation and could explain symptoms of migraine such as aura (linked to vasoconstriction) and throbbing pain (caused by pulsating dilated arteries). Although today this theory is no longer considered valid, the supposition was that a vasoconstrictor such as an ergot could reverse the vasodilation and thus the pain of migraine. Ergotamine was introduced to the USA in 1934 following several European studies demonstrating its successful use in migraine treatment.

Abstract

Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is an ergot alkaloid derivative of substances produced by rye fungus. Ergotamine was first used in the field of gynecology and obstetrics, then used for migraine treatment a few years later. DHE was developed as a derivative of ergotamine. DHE, when compared to ergotamine, demonstrates greater alpha-adrenergic antagonist activity, lower arterial vasoconstriction, less dopaminergic agonism, and lower emetic potential. DHE can be delivered via several routes including intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), intranasal (IN), oral, and orally inhaled (although the latter two are not available in the USA and the last remains experimental only). DHE can be used in an outpatient basis in infusion centers, emergency departments, and urgent care centers, as well as inpatient treatment for admitted patients. There are protocols for adults as well as pediatric migraine treatment. DHE and other ergot alkaloids are considered contraindicated in pregnant women as ﻿they decrease uterine blood flow and increase uterine muscle contractility predisposing to spontaneous abortion. DHE during lactation is also not recommended as it can lead to gastrointestinal distress and weakness in infants; it can also suppress milk production. Caution should be taken before administering DHE in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. DHE is an older drug with an interesting history, yet it is still clinically useful today for patients with migraine attacks not responsive to triptans, who have a greater burden from migraine, and in refractory migraine.

Patients with Cardiovascular Risk Factors

Given the potential for vasoconstriction, caution should be exercised in all patients. DHE, in contrast to ergotamine and triptans, has a less vasoconstrictive effect on peripheral arteries and a more pronounced effect on the veins. Hence, IV DHE was used at one time with heparin, even in elderly patients, for the prophylactic treatment of postoperative thrombophlebitisand in orthostatic hypotension. Still, use in patients who already have a predisposition for vasoconstriction, active or unstable vascular disease, or high vascular risk burden is contraindicated. It is also worth noting that the vasoconstrictive effects of DHE are more prominent in the meningeal arteries than coronary arteries. Baseline EKG is often recommended prior to inpatient IV DHE administration, and a more complete vascular risk assessment is often undertaken in the predisposed based on comorbidities or age.

A common side effect of IV DHE is chest pain. In a retrospective review in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 24% of patients admitted for IV DHE developed chest pain. Among them, 20% had EKG abnormalities, but none were deemed clinically significant, and no elevations in cardiac enzymes were seen. Most of the time therapy could be restarted safely and effectively, however precautions are still warranted when patients complain of chest pain, regardless of their risk profile, and evaluation with EKG and cardiac enzymes should be undertaken when chest pain occurs.

In a publication by Silberstein and colleagues, long-term prognosis was evaluated in 50 patients admitted for inpatient management of chronic daily headache and medication overuse. They found that 87% of patients who were detoxified from acute drug overuse and treated with repetitive IV DHE continued to have an improvement for up to 2 years. In their experience, IV DHE is effective in rapidly controlling intractable headache, with most patients achieving improvement in 2 to 3 days. Other studies also support the effectiveness of IV DHE in reducing headache frequency and severity. This includes a study by Nagy et al who evaluated 114 patients with chronic migraine treated with IV DHE; 67% of patients reported headache freedom at discharge, and 75% reported headache freedom 1 month after treatment.

Protocols of administrating DHE vary from center to center. The University of California San Francisco Headache Center administers DHE every 8 hours with an initial dose of 0.5 mg escalated to 1 mg as tolerated. In pediatric patients, the dose is adjusted for weight in patients under 50 kg.

Special considerations to take with IV DHE revolve around its potential adverse events and contraindications. The most common side effect is nausea. Many patients require a concomitant antiemetic. A more recent adverse event has become apparent with the increasing use of DHE in the inpatient setting in patients with difficult IV access. In a retrospective review of patients admitted to the inpatient headache unit at University of California San Francisco Headache Center, patients undergoing DHE infusion who had a mid-line or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) had a higher risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) than patients undergoing treatment without DHE or with only peripheral access. Of 263 admissions for IV DHE treatment given trough PICC or midline, 19 had PE, DVT, or superficial vein thrombosis. Of the 10 adults with DVT or PE, all required anticoagulation; 1 pediatric patient needed anticoagulation. This suggests that the venoconstrictive effect of DHE around a longer foreign surface (PICC line or mid-line) increases the risk of thrombus formation. Given that no thrombotic effect was associated with peripheral IV access, the authors recommend the use of peripheral IV lines for administrating IV DHE whenever possible.

Long-term success depends not only on providing aggressive IV treatment for migraine but also on optimizing preventive medication, addressing psychological comorbidities and providing adequate follow-up post hospital.

Outpatient Infusion Centers

Raskin developed the original repetitive dose IV DHE protocol to treat refractory migraine in 1986. This became the foundation for inpatient and in-clinic treatments administered over a number of days. The original protocol called for IV DHE 0.3–1 mg every 8 hours with IV metoclopramide 10 mg for 2–3 days. Raskin's original protocol has been studied against various other treatments over the years, including IV meperidine and IV promethazine, in which it resulted in similar efficacy yet significantly fewer adverse effects, and IV ketorolac, in which it demonstrated a greater degree of improvement. In the outpatient infusion setting, a modification of this protocol is typically undertaken to allow for up to 2 mg of DHE in divided doses (and other medications as necessary) to be delivered over several hours and repeated on consecutive days. Continuous intravenous DHE administration in an outpatient home-based setting is also another option for patients. Charles et al conducted a prospective study to treat patients with a daily intractable headache by administering intravenous DHE infusion at their home. They were administered a total of 7.5 mg IV DHE over ﻿three consecutive days under the care of a registered nurse. Thirty-five patients were treated, 33% became headache-free and 64% had a reduction in their headache at the end of 3 days. It is a cost-effective treatment option for patients and avoids hospitalization for migraine treatment.

A favorable adverse event profile, high degree of efficacy, and lack of need for close laboratory or telemetry monitoring make treatment with IV DHE an attractive option in the outpatient setting. The benefits of outpatient IV DHE infusion also include less time commitment, less cost to both the patient and the healthcare system, and no exposure to noisy, brightly lit emergency departments.

### Exacerbation of headache during dihydroergotamine for chronic migraine does not alter outcome [^8d57821e]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether headache exacerbation associated with IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) infusion predicts medium-term headache outcome in patients with chronic migraine.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review study of the UCSF Headache Center's use of IV DHE for chronic migraine from 2008 to 2012. Medium-term headache outcome was assessed at 6-week follow-up. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess for predictors of outcome.

Results

Patients with chronic migraine (n = 274) were treated with a course of IV DHE. Of 214 with 6-week follow-up, 78% had medium-term headache benefit. In a univariate logistic regression model, headache exacerbation with DHE was associated with lower odds of a positive medium-term headache outcome (odds ratio [OR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20–0.91). However, in the multivariate logistic regression model, headache exacerbation was no longer an independent predictor of treatment outcome (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.28–1.51). Factors that independently predicted outcome were nausea (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02–1.00, p = 0.05), age (OR 1.68 for each decade increase in age, 95% CI 1.24–2.28), and medication overuse (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18–0.97).

Conclusions

After controlling for nausea and other factors, headache exacerbation with DHE infusions is not an independent predictor of poor headache outcome and clinicians should not interpret its presence as a reason to stop treatment. The focus of management should be on controlling nausea as it is the most important modifiable factor in achieving a good headache outcome with an inpatient course of IV DHE for chronic migraine.

### Intravenous dihydroergotamine therapy for pediatric abdominal migraines [^1a4aecf3]. Clinical Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal migraines present with debilitating symptoms in adolescence. At our institution, the gastroenterology, neurology, and autonomic departments collaborated in treating patients with such presentations. This case series describes 6 patients who were given intravenous dihydroergotamine (DHE) for presumed abdominal migraines. DHE was only used when other agents like amitriptyline, verapamil, topiramate, or depakote had proved ineffective. DHE was started at 0.5 mg dose and on average 7 to 9 mg were given on each hospitalization. Patient ages ranged from 13 to 19 years with the majority being female. One patient did not respond to treatment. One patient was admitted 4 times for symptoms of abdominal migraines resolving with DHE. The average time between symptom relapse was about 5 to 12 months. Five of our 6 patients responded to the infusion without significant side effects. Based on these case series, DHE may be a treatment option in children with intractable abdominal migraine.

### Aprepitant for the management of nausea with inpatient IV dihydroergotamine [^5a6a05e4]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Seventy-four cases were identified (figure) with admission diagnoses, made by the authors and all checked by the senior author, of chronic migraine with or without aura, with or without medication overuse, or new daily persistent headache of a migrainous type.

Figure
Flowchart of cases

DHE = dihydroergotamine; PRN = as-needed.

Timing of use and concomitant antiemetics.

In 57 of these cases, aprepitant was administered midway through the IV DHE protocol for nausea that was refractory to other standing premedication antiemetics, including IV ondansetron, granisetron, oral domperidone, or IV promethazine. In the remaining 17 cases, aprepitant was initiated on admission because of the presence of severe nausea at baseline or known history of severe nausea with prior DHE treatment. Inpatient diaries recording hourly nausea scores were available for review in 24 of the first 57 cases.

Daily diary outcomes.

Mean or peak daily nausea scores, or both, were reduced following administration of aprepitant in 21 of the 24 patients (88%) whose diaries were available for review. Vomiting occurred in 12 patients before receiving aprepitant and ceased in all 12 cases post aprepitant. One patient developed emesis only after aprepitant was added.

Aprepitant outcome when added during admission.

Among 36 of the 57 patients (63%) who received aprepitant midway through hospitalization, there was a ≥ 50% reduction in the average daily number of as-needed antinausea medications post aprepitant. Finally, 52 of the 57 patients (91%) reported subjective improvement of their nausea following the addition of aprepitant. Two reported no benefit and data were unavailable for the remaining 3 patients.

Aprepitant at the onset of DHE.

Among the patients who received aprepitant at the onset of the DHE protocol (n = 17), 6 patients (35%) did not require any as-needed antinausea medications throughout the entire 5-day hospitalization. In these cases, other standing premedication nausea treatments given in addition to aprepitant on admission included ondansetron with domperidone (n = 4) or granisetron with domperidone (n = 1). Aprepitant was the sole premedication agent given in 1 of the 6 cases not requiring additional as-needed medications.

5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions and Fatalities

The potential for adverse cerebrovascular adverse reactions exists with ATZUMI treatment. Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with dihydroergotamine; and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the dihydroergotamine having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack).

Discontinue ATZUMI if a cerebrovascular event is suspected.

5.4 Other Vasospasm Related Adverse Reactions

ATZUMI, like other ergot alkaloids, may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Myocardial, peripheral vascular, and colonic ischemia have been reported with dihydroergotamine.

Dihydroergotamine associated vasospastic phenomena may also cause muscle pains, numbness, coldness, pallor, and cyanosis of the digits. In patients with compromised circulation, persistent vasospasm may result in gangrene or death. ATZUMI should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of vasoconstriction develop.

Patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud's syndrome, following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, including ATZUMI, should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.

5.5 Increase in Blood Pressure

Significant elevation in blood pressure has been reported on rare occasions in patients with and without a history of hypertension treated with dihydroergotamine. ATZUMI is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension [see Contraindications (4)].

An 18% increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure was seen following dosing with another 5-HT1agonist in a study evaluating subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization.

### Aprepitant for the management of nausea with inpatient IV dihydroergotamine [^f7085bd1]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

We conducted a retrospective review of patients with migrainous disorders who were admitted to the University of California, San Francisco Headache Center for a 5-day course of IV DHE (cumulative dose of 11.25 mg) from June 1, 2011, through April 17, 2015, and received oral aprepitant as antiemetic therapy due to refractory nausea, either at the onset of DHE administration or later during their treatment course. The primary research question was whether aprepitant reduced nausea in patients receiving DHE for the treatment of medically refractory migraine. Aprepitant was given as a loading dose of 125 mg on day 1 and thereafter at 80 mg daily 30 minutes before the first daily dose of DHE.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.

The review was approved by the institutional review board of the University of California, San Francisco (12–09318).

Data collection.

Peak and average daily nausea scores were determined before and after aprepitant administration from patients' hourly diaries, whereby headache and nausea were rated on an 11-point visual analog graph, or with daily progress notes, or both. Daily medication administration records were reviewed for other concurrent antiemetic medications given either as standing premedications or as-needed doses for breakthrough nausea.

Efficacy assessment.

The efficacy of aprepitant was assessed by determining reduction (> 50%) in either average or peak daily nausea score (1 point), cessation of emesis following administration of aprepitant, and ≥ 50% reduction in the average daily number of as-needed antinausea medications. In addition, patients were surveyed for their subjective impression regarding the effectiveness of aprepitant in controlling nausea, vomiting, or both with an open-ended question.

Tolerability and adverse events.

Patient daily notes and diaries were reviewed for an assessment of any adverse events and to determine tolerability during inpatient use.

Data collection and analysis.

Data were abstracted from patient hourly diaries or medical records into a summary spreadsheet (Excel; Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Summary data are presented as proportions observed. Given the exploratory nature of the work, the add-on nature of the treatment, and the absence of a suitable control, we did not have a formal aim for hypothesis testing.

5.3 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions and Fatalities

The potential for adverse cerebrovascular adverse reactions exists with TRUDHESA treatment. Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with dihydroergotamine mesylate; and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the dihydroergotamine mesylate having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack). Discontinue TRUDHESA if a cerebrovascular event is suspected.

5.4 Other Vasospasm Related Adverse Reactions

TRUDHESA, like other ergot alkaloids, may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Myocardial, peripheral vascular, and colonic ischemia have been reported with dihydroergotamine mesylate.

Dihydroergotamine mesylate associated vasospastic phenomena may also cause muscle pains, numbness, coldness, pallor, and cyanosis of the digits.

### Safety of domperidone in treating nausea associated with dihydroergotamine infusion and headache [^8d680e1f]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Migraine is the sixth leading cause of years of life lost to disability worldwide. Patients with chronic migraine can benefit from inpatient treatment to reduce the severity and frequency of headache. For refractory migraine, IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) has been a cornerstone of treatment for over 2 decades. Nausea is a common side effect of DHE administration and can be severe and dose-limiting.

Previously we showed that nausea control is central to maximizing DHE dosing and improving headache control. Nausea treatment often relies on antidopaminergic agents such as metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, and prochlorperazine, but these medications can cause serious side effects such as akathisia, sedation, extrapyramidal disorders including acute dystonic reactions, corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation, and torsade de pointes.

Domperidone is a less expensive alternative that, in our clinical experience, is often more easily tolerated. In our headache practice, we routinely premedicate patients admitted for IV DHE with domperidone in order to prevent nausea. Domperidone is a peripherally acting dopamine antagonist widely used for decades to treat gastric motility disorders and nausea. Despite its ascribed peripheral mechanism of action, high-quality studies have shown that domperidone is safe and efficacious in treating migraine. It is not approved in the United States, however, due to concerns for cardiac arrhythmogenicity stemming from preclinical data, case reports, and retrospective epidemiologic studies. Deaths have been restricted to those patients receiving high IV doses, those with exacerbating conditions such as hypokalemia, or those taking other medications that prolong QTc or interfere with metabolism. Prospective trials have not found a clinically significant risk of death. Supporting domperidone's safety, millions of prescriptions have been written in Canada and only 18 possible cardiac events have been reported, and no deaths.

In the current study, we review our experience using domperidone at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Headache Center. Our primary objective was to assess the safety of domperidone in the inpatient treatment of headache and DHE-associated nausea, with a focus on common and dangerous side effects including cardiac arrhythmias.

### Intravenous dihydroergotamine for inpatient management of refractory primary headaches [^296f21f7]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine dosing and side effects of dihydroergotamine as they affect outcomes in primary headache disorders.

Methods

We audited our use of dihydroergotamine for inpatient management of disabling primary headache, focusing on the commonly treated problems.

Results

Of patients interviewed, 114 had chronic migraine, 38 had cluster headache, and 11 had new daily persistent headache (NDPH). The mean time to follow-up for the entire cohort was 11 months. The data suggest that IV dihydroergotamine given over 5 days produces improvement in headache and disability in patients with migraine more than shorter courses. It does so with a cumulative effect after discharge up to a month. Giving more dihydroergotamine predicts a greater pain-free rate. Patients with cluster headache benefit from IV dihydroergotamine. In patients with NDPH, only those with migrainous symptoms responded and in that group the response was less robust compared with that seen in the chronic migraine cohort.

Conclusions

Intravenous dihydroergotamine is well-tolerated, and longer treatments produce a better outcome. Nausea is the most common adverse effect, and its control is associated with a better outcome.

### Sumatriptan succinate, camphor, menthol (migranow) [^fef1f5dc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

Chest discomfort and jaw or neck tightness have been reported following use of sumatriptan tablets and have also been reported infrequently following administration of sumatriptan succinate Nasal Spray. Chest, jaw, or neck tightness is relatively common after administration of sumatriptan succinate injection. Only rarely have these symptoms been associated with ischemic ECG changes. However, because sumatriptan may cause coronary artery vasospasm, patients who experience signs or symptoms suggestive of angina following sumatriptan should be evaluated for the presence of CAD or a predisposition to Prinzmetal variant angina before receiving additional doses of sumatriptan, and should be monitored electrocardiographically if dosing is resumed and similar symptoms recur. Similarly, patients who experience other symptoms or signs suggestive of decreased arterial flow, such as ischemic bowel syndrome or Raynaud syndrome following sumatriptan should be evaluated for atherosclerosis or predisposition to vasospasm (see WARNINGS).

Sumatriptan should also be administered with caution to patients with diseases that may alter the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of drugs, such as impaired hepatic or renal function.

There have been rare reports of seizure following administration of sumatriptan. Sumatriptan should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold.

Care should be taken to exclude other potentially serious neurologic conditions before treating headache in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine headache or who experience a headache that is atypical for them. There have been rare reports where patients received sumatriptan for severe headaches that were subsequently shown to have been secondary to an evolving neurologic lesion (see WARNINGS).

For a given attack, if a patient does not respond to the first dose of sumatriptan, the diagnosis of migraine should be reconsidered before administration of a second dose.

Overuse:

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or a combination of drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches, or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused drugs, and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary. Migraine patients should be informed about the risks of medication overuse, and encouraged to record headache frequency and drug use.

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

Currently available data have not demonstrated drug abuse or psychological dependence with dihydroergotamine. However, cases of drug abuse and psychological dependence in patients on other forms of ergot therapy have been reported. Thus, due to the chronicity of vascular headaches, it is imperative that patients be advised not to exceed recommended dosages.

Considerations in Special Populations

Pregnant or Lactating Women

As a group, ergots are associated with increased sympathetic activity and vasoconstriction. Use in pregnancy has been associated with decreased uterine blood flow and increased uterine muscle contractility, predisposing to spontaneous abortion. Therefore, its use in pregnancy is not recommended,–and DHE and other ergot alkaloids are considered contraindicated in the USA.

There are no studies prospectively evaluating adverse events and outcomes of DHE use in pregnant women. The available data come mainly from registries and animal studies. In a pregnancy registry done in Quebec, evaluating 53 pregnant women exposed to DHE, the use of DHE in pregnancy was associated with a fourfold increase risk of prematurity. In one animal study, DHE did not demonstrate teratogenic effects, but in another, a dose of 617 mg/kg produced 50% embryonic mortality in rats, and with lower doses, congenital malformations were observed including cleft palate, bilateral limb defects, and lens opacity.

The use of DHE during lactation also is not recommended. Under Hale's lactation risk, it is classified as L4 (potentially hazardous) due to reported cases of gastrointestinal distress and weakness in infants. In addition, it can suppress milk production.

Pediatric Use

Despite its utility, relatively little has been written about DHE in this population, and therefore, its use has been limited mostly to specialists in pediatric migraine who are familiar with its effects. Intranasal DHE has been used successfully in children and adolescents who do not respond to intranasal triptans. IV DHE has been shown to be effective in status migrainosus in children and adolescents.–There are two inpatient dosing schedules for pediatric patients described in the literature, based on weight, age, and tolerability. A lower dose protocol calls for 0.1–0.2 mg/dose (based on age) along with a neuroleptic (eg, metoclopramide) administered every 6 hours for a maximum of 16 doses or until headache freedom is achieved. A higher dose protocol (for patients with inadequate response to lower doses, or who are deemed unlikely to respond to a lower dose but likely to tolerate a higher dose) utilizes 0.5–1 mg/dose (based on age and weight) administered with a neuroleptic (eg, prochlorperazine) every 8 hours for a maximum of 20 doses. Two retrospective studies of these dosing regimens revealed that 74–80% of patients have an excellent response.

### Safety of domperidone in treating nausea associated with dihydroergotamine infusion and headache [^ffc394be]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective:

To determine the safety of domperidone in the treatment of nausea associated with dihydroergotamine (DHE) infusion and headache.

Methods:

We audited our use of domperidone for the inpatient management of nausea, focusing on known safety concerns, particularly potential cardiac arrhythmias.

Results:

We reviewed 103 consecutive admissions of 90 patients admitted for IV DHE by infusion. Most admissions were to treat chronic migraine with (n = 53) or without (n = 46) aura. Domperidone was administered in 85 of 103 encounters and was well-tolerated at doses up to 80 mg/d. A significant side effect, akathisia, was observed in one patient. Baseline ECG with corrected QT interval (QTc) was obtained on all patients. Repeat ECG after domperidone was obtained in 21 patients, whose baseline characteristics did not differ from the group as a whole. ECG was interpreted blindly by a cardiac electrophysiologist. QTc did not differ before and after domperidone administration (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, median [interquartile range] 435.0 [410.5–453.0] at admission and 427.0 [399.0–452.5] after domperidone; p = 0.15). In combination with other antiemetics, domperidone was effective in treating nausea such that no patients had refractory nausea severe enough to limit DHE dose.

Conclusions:

This retrospective audit demonstrates that domperidone is safe in the treatment of nausea associated with inpatient DHE infusion and headache. While larger prospective trials are necessary to confirm these results and assess efficacy, current evidence and clinical experience suggests that domperidone is safe and useful for nausea and headache management.

Classification of evidence:

This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with headache undergoing DHE infusion, domperidone is safe and effective in the treatment of nausea.

### Exacerbation of SUNCT and SUNA syndromes during intravenous dihydroergotamine treatment: a case series [^b6ba296c]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The management of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) and with short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with autonomic symptoms (SUNA) remains challenging in view of the limited understanding of their pathophysiological mechanisms.

Methods

An initial observation that patients with both chronic migraine (CM) or cluster headache (CH) and SUNCT/SUNA receiving intravenous dihydroergotamine (IV DHE) had complained of dramatic worsening of the latter led to review of the case notes of patients with CM or CH and co-existent SUNCT/SUNA seen between 2008 and 2013 and who had a trial of IV DHE.

Results

Twenty-four patients were identified. IV DHE was ineffective for SUNCT/SUNA in 16 patients, while one patient reported a marginal improvement. Five patients reported dramatic worsening of the SUNCT/SUNA. Moreover, two patients developed new-onset SUNA during their first IV DHE infusion. Out of these seven patients, those requiring repeated courses of IV DHE consistently experienced exacerbations of SUNCT/SUNA which were suppressed with IV lidocaine.

Conclusions

DHE is an ineffective treatment option for SUNCT and SUNA. Physicians who intend to offer IV DHE to CH or CM patients should warn them that IV DHE could exacerbate and possibly even lead to a de novo onset of SUNCT/SUNA. In view of the reported worsening or new onset of SUNCT/SUNA in patients using dopamine agonists for the treatment of pituitary prolactinomas, we speculate that DHE might worsen or induce SUNCT and SUNA, at least in a sub-group of patients, through a perturbation in the dopaminergic system.

### Aprepitant for the management of nausea with inpatient IV dihydroergotamine [^ee9889dc]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of oral aprepitant, a substance P/neurokinin A receptor antagonist, in controlling nausea associated with IV dihydroergotamine (DHE) administered for medically refractory migrainous headache in patients not responding to standard antiemetics or with a history of uncontrolled nausea with DHE.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of prospectively collected hourly diary data and clinical notes of patients hospitalized between 2011 and 2015 for inpatient treatment with DHE. Patients were classified using the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version). Peak and average daily nausea scores from hourly diaries, or daily entries of notes, and concurrent antiemetic use were collected and tabulated.

Results

Seventy-four patients, of whom 24 had daily diaries, with chronic migraine with or without aura, with or without medication overuse, or new daily persistent headache of a migrainous type, were identified. In 36 of 57 cases in which aprepitant was administered during hospitalization, there was a 50% reduction in the average daily number of as-needed antinausea medications. Of 57 patients, 52 reported that the addition of aprepitant improved nausea. Among 21 of 24 patients with hourly diary data, nausea scores were reduced and in all 12 with vomiting there was cessation of emesis after aprepitant was added. Aprepitant was well tolerated with no treatment emergent adverse events.

Conclusions

Aprepitant can be effective in the treatment of refractory DHE-induced nausea and emesis. Given the broader issue of troublesome nausea and vomiting in acute presentations of migraine, general neurologists may consider what place aprepitant has in the management of such patients.

Classification Of Evidence

This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with medically refractory migraine receiving IV DHE, oral aprepitant reduces nausea.

### Safety of domperidone in treating nausea associated with dihydroergotamine infusion and headache [^97f5ae6c]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

METHODS

The experience of adults admitted for IV DHE treatment to the UCSF Headache Center between July 2012 and May 2015 was audited. Treatment was at the discretion of the attending neurologist. In our practice, we routinely use domperidone 10 mg orally prior to DHE infusion, with increased dosing as needed for persistent nausea. All patients who received at least one dose of domperidone were included. Patients with at least one ECG after exposure to domperidone were included in the analysis of cardiac safety.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.

This study was approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research. Patient consent was waived for this retrospective audit.

Nausea severity.

Nausea severity was defined as absent (no as-needed antiemetics), mild (some as-needed antiemetics but no increase in scheduled dosing), moderate (aprepitant added or increased, or additional antiemetics required despite maximum aprepitant), severe (DHE infusion slowed despite maximum antiemetics), or refractory (DHE stopped due to nausea).

QT interval measurement.

Admission ECG QT and QTc were interpreted automatically at the time of the admission. All ECGs for patients included in the QTc analyses were also manually interpreted in a blinded fashion by 2 cardiac electrophysiologists (M.M.S. H. I.). If patients had multiple ECGs on domperidone, QTc was averaged for comparison.

Statistical methods.

All tests were done with IBM (Armonk, NY) SPSS Statistics v22. We compared manually interpreted QTc before and after domperidone administration using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with 2-tailed significance. A drug-induced QTc prolongation of ≥ 30 ms has been proposed as the cutoff for defining a clinically significant change. To increase sensitivity for detecting safety concerns, we used a postdomperidone increase of ≥ 10 ms. Assuming a 10-ms difference and a common SD of 15 ms, we calculated that 26 patients would be required to achieve adequate power. We compared groups using Pearson χ 2, Mann-Whitney U, or Fisher exact test as appropriate.

5.4	Cerebrovascular Events

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5-HT1agonists, and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the 5-HT1agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not.

Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed as migraineurs, and in migraineurs who present with symptoms atypical of migraine, other potentially serious neurological conditions need to be excluded. RELPAX is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [see Contraindications (4)].

5.5	Other Vasospasm Reactions

RELPAX may cause non-coronary vasospastic reactions, such as peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction (presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea), and Raynaud's syndrome. In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasospastic reaction following the use of any 5-HT1agonist, rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional RELPAX doses [see Contraindications (4)].

5.6	Medication Overuse Headache

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamine, triptans, opioids, or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients, including withdrawal of the overused acute migraine drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.

Treatments with no recommendations — evidence synthesis indicates that the CGC found comparative evidence inconclusive to inform recommendations for monotherapy with a CGRP antagonist-gepant, dihydroergotamine, or lasmiditan, although these three options compared with placebo were efficacious; monotherapy with a CGRP antagonist-gepant may have a lower likelihood of pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours, as well as sustained pain freedom up to 48 hours, than the combination of a triptan and an NSAID (low-certainty evidence); compared with triptan monotherapy, dihydroergotamine may not differ in pain relief at 2 hours (low-certainty evidence), whereas triptan monotherapy probably had a higher likelihood of freedom from nausea and vomiting at 2 hours (200 and 400 more events per 1000 people).

### Ictal lack of binding to brain parenchyma suggests integrity of the blood-brain barrier for 11C-dihydroergotamine during glyceryl trinitrate-induced migraine [^81f9a6ce]. Brain (2016). Low credibility.

Experimental design

Given the excellent binding characteristics of DHE and our ability to make a high specific activity ligand of not less than 11.7 Ci/nmol measured during quality control, we decided on a qualitative approach to detect a disruption of the blood–brain barrier for DHE in each of six migraineurs and six control subjects. Patients were healthy except for a history of migraine with or without aura. Exclusion criteria were comorbid conditions or the intake of any regular medication. Migraineurs and control subjects were further recruited based on their history of episodic migraine and response to GTN trigger: migraineurs were eligible for the PET scanning part of the study when they developed a migraine attack following GTN; and control subjects when they remained headache-free. The GTN trigger was done as previously described and validated: subjects received an intravenous infusion of 0.5 µg kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ GTN over 20 min, and clinical characteristics as well as vital signs were recorded during infusion and afterwards for at least 4 h. Of 24 migraineurs recruited, we could not trigger acute migraine attacks in 13 patients, and five withdrew for personal reasons; of 10 control subjects, two reported headache during or after GTN-infusion, one developed significant nausea during the GTN infusion resulting in discontinuation of the study, and one withdrew for personal reasons. Therefore, six migraineurs [two male, four female, mean age ± standard deviation (SD): 33 ± 7 years, two with history of migraine with aura; demographics and medical history shown in Table 1] and six control subjects (two male, four female, 32 ± 9 years) underwent a baseline ¹¹C-DHE PET scan, followed by GTN-infusion and a second ¹¹C-DHE PET scan after 3 h (Fig. 1). Each subject also had an interictal high-resolution T 1 -weighted anatomical MRI (magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient sequence) on a General Electric Signa HDxT 3.0 T scanner (GE Healthcare). During the entire second scan, all migraineurs experienced headache fulfilling the criteria for migraine without aura according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition-beta (ICHD-3beta,) (Table 1), and all controls remained pain-free. One patient (Patient M4) went into a migraine attack immediately at the end of the GTN-infusion, i.e. ∼3 h prior to the beginning of the second scan.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse Reactions in Placebo-Controlled Trials with Dihydroergotamine (DHE) Mesylate Nasal Spray [see Clinical Studies (14)]

Of the 1,796 patients and subjects treated with DHE nasal spray doses 2 mg or less in U.S. and foreign clinical studies, 26 (1.4%) discontinued because of adverse events. The adverse events associated with discontinuation were, in decreasing order of frequency: rhinitis (13), dizziness (2), facial edema (2), and one patient each due to cold sweats, accidental trauma, depression, elective surgery, somnolence, allergy, vomiting, hypotension, and paraesthesia.

Table 1 summarizes the incidence rates of adverse reactions reported by at least 1% of patients who received DHE nasal spray for the treatment of migraine during placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical studies and were more frequent than in those patients receiving placebo. The most commonly reported adverse reactions (greater than 1% of patients who received DHE nasal spray) were rhinitis, nausea, altered sense of taste, application site reactions, dizziness, vomiting, somnolence, pharyngitis, and diarrhea. In most instances these events were transient and self-limited and did not result in patient discontinuation from a study.

Clinical Trials

The efficacy of dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray for the acute treatment of migraine headaches was evaluated in four randomized, double blind, placebo controlled studies in the U.S. The patient population for the trials was predominantly female (87%) and Caucasian (95%) with a mean age of 39 years (range 18 to 65 years). Patients treated a single moderate to severe migraine headache with a single dose of study medication and assessed pain severity over the 24 hours following treatment.

Headache response was determined 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after dosing and was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain. In studies 1 and 2, a four-point pain intensity scale was utilized; in studies 3 and 4, a five-point scale was used that included both pain response and restoration of function for "severe" or "incapacitating" pain, a less clear endpoint. Although rescue medication was allowed in all four studies, patients were instructed not to use them during the four hour observation period. In studies 3 and 4, a total dose of 2 mg was compared to placebo. In studies 1 and 2, doses of 2 and 3 mg were evaluated, and showed no advantage of the higher dose for a single treatment. In all studies, patients received a regimen consisting of 0.5 mg in each nostril, repeated in 15 minutes (and again in another 15 minutes for the 3 mg dose in studies 1 and 2).

### EFNS guideline on the drug treatment of migraine – revised report of an EFNS task force [^1ae71ec2]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is one of the most frequent disabling neurological conditions with a major impact on the patients' quality of life.

Objectives

To give evidence-based or expert recommendations for the different drug treatment procedures in the particular migraine syndromes based on a literature search and the consensus of an expert panel.

Methods

All available medical reference systems were screened for the range of clinical studies on migraine with and without aura and on migraine-like syndromes. The findings in these studies were evaluated according to the recommendations of the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) resulting in level A, B, or C recommendations and good practice points.

Recommendations

For the acute treatment of migraine attacks, oral non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) and triptans are recommended. The administration should follow the concept of stratified treatment. Before intake of NSAID and triptans, oral metoclopramide or domperidone is recommended. In very severe attacks, intravenous acetylsalicylic acid or subcutaneous sumatriptan are drugs of first choice. Status migrainosus can be treated by cortoicosteroids, although this is not universally held to be helpful, or dihydroergotamine. For the prophylaxis of migraine, betablockers (propranolol and metoprolol) flunarizine, valproic acid, and topiramate are drugs of first choice. Drugs of second choice for migraine prophylaxis include amitriptyline, naproxen, petasites, and bisoprolol.

### Raynaud's phenomenon [^2c478036]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is characterised by episodic vasospasm of the fingers and toes typically precipitated by exposure to cold. Mild Raynaud's is common and is not usually a harbinger of clinically important disability; its onset, however, can be startling and uncomfortable for patients, and the well recognised association in some cases with systemic rheumatic conditions often precipitates aggressive assessments for underlying diseases. Advances in vascular physiology have shed light on the role of the endothelium as well as endothelium-independent mechanisms in the altered vasoregulation of Raynaud's. We review clinical aspects of the disorder and new insights with respect to pathophysiology, and we discuss potential new therapeutics based on the disease mechanism, such as prostacyclin analogues, serotonin antagonists, and calcitonin gene-related peptides.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of treatments for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^02381234]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Background

Several pharmacological treatments are available for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, but there is uncertainty regarding the best options. We aimed to assess and compare the benefits and harms of treatments available for secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Method

We did a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological treatments. We searched for systematic reviews published in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews up to Jan 31, 2017, and for RCTs published from inception to Sept 24, 2019 in MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included double-blind RCTs (parallel or crossover) that compared two or more pharmacological treatments or placebo in patients with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Individual patient data were obtained for one unpublished RCT. Three researchers independently screened the texts and extracted the data. Efficacy outcomes included severity (on a ten-point scale), daily frequency, and mean duration of Raynaud's phenomenon attacks. We also examined tolerability and acceptability. Pairwise meta-analyses and Bayesian random-effects network meta-analyses were used to synthesise data. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017057518).

Findings

We included 58 RCTs in the analysis, comprising 3867 patients (3540 [91·5%] with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon) and 15 classes of drugs. Phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors were more effective than placebo for frequency (mean difference -0·36 [95% credibility interval -0·69 to -0·04]), severity (-0·34 [-0·66 to -0·03]), and duration (-3·42 [-6·62 to -0·29]) of attacks (low to moderate level of evidence). Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were superior to placebo for frequency (-0·35 [-0·67 to -0·02]) and severity (-0·84 [-1·25 to -0·45]) of attacks (low level of evidence). For severity of attacks, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (-1·54 [-2·68 to -0·41]; very low level of evidence) and oral prostacyclin receptor agonists (-0·48 [-0·80 to -0·16]; low level of evidence) were superior to placebo. No other drug classes were significantly superior to placebo with regard to efficacy outcomes. Compared with placebo, tolerability was lower for PDE5 inhibitors (incidence rate ratio for serious adverse events or early study exit due to adverse events 3·30 [95% CrI 1·49 to 7·55]) and CCBs (3·13 [1·33 to 7·04]). For all outcomes, global heterogeneity and between-study variance ranged from low (I² = 0% and τ² = 0·0 for attack severity and duration) to moderate (I² = 41% and τ² = 0·2 for tolerability). The overall risk of bias was judged to be low in 22 (38%), high in ten (17%), and unclear in 26 (45%) RCTs.

Interpretation

PDE5 inhibitors and CCBs are the most effective pharmacological options, albeit with moderate efficacy and a low level of evidence. Current evidence does not support the use of any other drug in secondary Raynaud's phenomenon.

Funding

None.

5.6 Medication Overuse Headache

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamines, triptans, opioids, or a combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (i.e., medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients including withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.

5.7 Preterm Labor

Based on the mechanism of action of dihydroergotamine and findings from the published literature, TRUDHESA may cause preterm labor. Avoid use of TRUDHESA during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.8 Fibrotic Complications

The potential for fibrotic complications exists with TRUDHESA treatment. There have been reports of pleural and retroperitoneal fibrosis in patients following prolonged daily use of dihydroergotamine mesylate. Rarely, prolonged daily use of other ergot alkaloid drugs has been associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis. Rare cases have also been reported in association with the use of dihydroergotamine mesylate; however, in those cases, patients also received drugs known to be associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis.

Administration of TRUDHESA should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.4	Raynaud's Phenomenon

Development of Raynaud's phenomenon and recurrence or worsening of pre-existing Raynaud's phenomenon have been reported in the postmarketing setting following the use of CGRP antagonists, including AIMOVIG. In reported cases with monoclonal antibody CGRP antagonists, symptom onset occurred a median of 71 days following dosing. Many of the cases reported serious outcomes, including hospitalizations and disability, generally related to debilitating pain. In most reported cases, discontinuation of the CGRP antagonist resulted in resolution of symptoms.

AIMOVIG should be discontinued if signs or symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon develop, and patients should be evaluated by a healthcare provider if symptoms do not resolve. Patients with a history of Raynaud's phenomenon should be monitored for, and informed about the possibility of, worsening or recurrence of signs and symptoms.

Case Summary

A 49-year-old woman with relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis was admitted for severe headache and pain crisis. She received a single dose of intravenous dihydroergotamine and, within 30 minutes, experienced chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. No changes on electrocardiogram were noted, but cardiac enzyme levels were elevated. Brief episodes of chest pain persisted for several days and resolved spontaneously before the woman's discharge. She had several cardiac risk factors, including cigarette smoking, hypertension, and a family history of coronary artery disease, but cardiac catheterization on hospital day 5 revealed no underlying coronary artery disease.

Discussion

Although cardiovascular adverse reactions have been reported with ergotamine tartrate, dihydroergotamine has rarely been linked with such reactions, including coronary vasospasm and myocardial infarction. Prescribing information for dihydroergotamine cautions against its use in patients with coronary artery disease or risk factors for underlying coronary artery disease without a cardiac workup before initiation of therapy. This patient had several cardiac risk factors, but cardiac catheterization revealed no underlying coronary artery disease. Concomitant verapamil therapy for hypertension did not prevent the vasospastic effects of dihydroergotamine. The Naranjo probability scale revealed a probable adverse reaction of vasospastic angina associated with dihydroergotamine.

Conclusions

Health-care professionals should be aware of the possibility for vasospastic angina in patients receiving dihydroergotamine who have no underlying coronary artery disease. Prescribing information should be closely followed.

### Evaluation of the safety of calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists for migraine treatment among adults with Raynaud phenomenon [^a474c73d]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In patients with Raynaud phenomenon, what is the microvascular complication risk of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist use?

Findings

In this cohort study of 169 adults with Raynaud phenomenon, 9 patients had microvascular complications after CGRP antagonist use. Two of the 9 patients had severe adverse events, including digital autonecrosis that required distal amputation.

Meaning

This study suggests that microvascular complications are uncommon in patients with Raynaud phenomenon who are taking CGRP antagonists; however, the incidence of adverse microvascular events with high morbidity warrants caution in prescribing CGRP antagonists in these patients.

### Treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon [^5adf19c3]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Raynaud's phenomenon is an episodic vasospasm of the peripheral arteries, causing pallor followed by cyanosis and redness with pain and sometimes paraesthesia, and, rarely, ulceration of the fingers and toes. Primary or idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's disease) occurs without an underlying disease. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon (Raynaud's syndrome) occurs in association with an underlying disease. Initially conservative, non-pharmacologic approach is important for these patients, although pharmacologic therapy may ultimately be necessary. Advances in vascular physiology have showed the role of the endothelium as well as endothelium-independent mechanisms in the altered vasoregulation of Raynaud's phenomenon. This has opened promising therapeutic avenues, and it is likely that therapies targeted towards specific pathophysiologic steps become available in the near future.

Headache response was based on pain intensity as interpreted by the patient using a four-point pain intensity scale.

✱ p value < 0.01

p value < 0.001

Table 2: Studies 3 and 4: Percentage of Patients with Headache Response 2 and 4 Hours Following a Single Treatment of Study Medication [Dihydroergotamine Mesylate Nasal Spray or Placebo]

aHeadache response was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain.

Headache response was evaluated on a five-point scale that included both pain response and restoration of function for "severe" or "incapacitating" pain.

✱ p value < 0.01

Comparisons of drug performance based upon results obtained in different clinical trials are never reliable. Because studies are conducted at different times, with different samples of patients, by different investigators, employing different criteria and/or different interpretations of the same criteria, under different conditions (dose, dosing regimen, etc.), quantitative estimates of treatment response and the timing of response may be expected to vary considerably from study to study.

### Acute treatments for episodic migraine in adults-JAMA network… [^506b0c38]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis that included 15 systematic reviews and 115 randomized clinical trials of 28 803 participants with migraine headache, multiple acute interventions, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, 5-HT1F receptor agonist, dihydroergotamine, acetaminophen, and remote electrical neuromodulation, were associated with improvements in short-term pain outcomes, with moderate to high strength of evidence. The evidence for these end points regarding opioids and other interventions was low or insufficient.

Compared with placebo, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists, lasmiditan, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine plus caffeine, acetaminophen, antiemetics, butorphanol, and tramadol in combination with acetaminophen were significantly associated with pain reduction and increase in mild adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance There are several acute treatments for migraine, with varying strength of supporting evidence. Use of triptans, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, dihydroergotamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists, lasmiditan, and some nonpharmacologic treatments was associated with improved pain and function. The evidence for many other interventions, including opioids, was limited.

Compared with placebo, dihydroergotamine was associated with significantly more pain freedom and pain relief at 2 hours, 1 day, and 1 week, sustained pain freedom and pain relief at 1 day and 1 week, and gastrointestinal adverse events. Meperidine, morphine, and hydromorphone failed to show superiority over various comparators regarding pain and function outcomes. There were increased numbers of adverse events associated with these medications.

### WITHDRAWN: oral sumatriptan for acute migraine [^4e0eff82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common neurovascular disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of disabling headache, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and, in some patients, neurological aura symptoms. Sumatriptan is one of a class of selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1B/1D) agonists (triptans) thought to relieve migraine attacks by several mechanisms, including cranial vasoconstriction and peripheral and central neural inhibition.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy and tolerability of oral sumatriptan for the treatment of a single acute attack of migraine in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001), MEDLINE (1966 through November 2001), and reference lists of articles and books.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind RCTs comparing oral sumatriptan (100 mg, 50 mg, 25 mg) with placebo, no intervention, other drug treatments, behavioral therapy, or physical therapy for the treatment of an acute attack of migraine in adults. Trials comparing different doses of sumatriptan or dosing regimens were also included. Outcomes considered were: 2-hour pain-free response, headache relief/headache intensity, and functional disability; headache recurrence; and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were abstracted by one reviewer and over-read by the other. The two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Information on adverse events was collected from trial reports.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials involving 16,200 participants were included. Methodological quality was generally good. Sixteen trials were placebo comparisons and showed that sumatriptan in doses of 100 mg (14 trials), 50 mg (five trials), and 25 mg (three trials) provided significantly better pain-free response (100 mg and 25 mg only), headache relief, and relief of disability at 2 hours. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNTs) for pain-free response at 2 hours were 5.1 (3.9 to 7.1) for the 100-mg dose (n = 2221) and 7.5 (2.7 to 142) for the 25-mg dose (n = 131); there was no significant difference between the 50-mg dose and placebo for this outcome (n = 127). For headache relief at 2 hours, NNTs were 3.4 (3.0 to 4.0), 3.2 (2.4 to 5.1), and 3.4 (2.3 to 6.6) for sumatriptan 100 mg (n = 2940), 50 mg (n = 420), and 25 mg (n = 226), respectively. Precise estimates of the efficacy of the 50- and 25-mg doses relative to the 100-mg dose could not be obtained. Adverse events were more common with sumatriptan 100 mg than with placebo (risk difference [RD] = 0.14 [0.09 to 0.20]; number-needed-to-harm [NNH] = 7.1 [5.0 to 11.1]; n = 3172). RDs for the 50- and 25-mg vs. placebo comparisons were not statistically significant.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral sumatriptan has been shown to be an effective drug for the treatment of a single acute attack of migraine. It is well tolerated, though minor adverse events were not uncommon in the included trials. Other triptans were generally similar in efficacy and adverse events. Among non-triptan drugs, ergotamine + caffeine was significantly less effective than sumatriptan, and other drugs have been insufficiently studied to draw firm conclusions.

### Part II: the treatment of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon [^e0b60ebf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Raynaud phenomenon (RP) presents with either primary or secondary disease, and both have the potential to negatively impact patient quality of life. First-line management of RP should include lifestyle modifications in all patients. Some patients with primary RP and most with secondary RP require pharmacologic therapies, which may include calcium channel blockers, topical nitrates, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists. Additional approaches to treatment for those with signs of critical ischemia or those who fail pharmacologic therapy include botulinum toxin injection and digital sympathectomy. Herein, we describe in detail the treatment options for patients with RP as well as provide treatment algorithms for each RP subtype.

Safety and side effects

We find the triptans to be well tolerated overall. The reported incidence of minor adverse effects does not differ markedly between the triptans, but depends on speed of onset of action; people taking subcutaneous sumatriptan report more adverse effects than those taking oral sumatriptan. The triptans with a longer half-life and slower onset of action, such as naratriptan and frovatriptan, have fewer side effects. The adverse effects of the oral triptans are similar, although dizziness and sedation occur more with rizatriptan and zolmitriptan than with sumatriptan and naratriptan.

There are cardiovascular safety concerns associated with triptan use due to the presence of 5HT 1B receptors on vascular smooth muscle. We avoid triptans in people with uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular disease. However, in clinical trials, cardiovascular complications were fewer than one per million exposed, and a recent systematic review of cardiovascular safety data identified no strong cardiovascular safety issues. Triptan sensations such as burning or tingling in the chest or limbs are relatively common (7%), but clinicians can reassure patients that this is not associated with cardiac ischaemia.

In 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified the potential for developing a serotonin syndrome when taking triptans together with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, on further evaluation only 10 of the original 36 cases identified were actually serotonin syndrome and it was concluded that triptan use did not need to be restricted in patients on SSRIs or SNRIs. We use triptans in these patients where indicated but counsel patients to be aware of the features of serotonin syndrome (agitation, nausea, palpitation and sweating). Triptans should not be co-prescribed with ergotamine (within 24 h) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (within 2 weeks).

Drug-Associated Cerebrovascular Events and Fatalities

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and other cerebrovascular events have been reported in patients treated with D.H.E. 45 Injection; and some have resulted in fatalities. In a number of cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, the D.H.E. 45 Injection having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine, when they were not. It should be noted that patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack).

Other Vasospasm Related Events

Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray, like other ergot alkaloids, may cause vasospastic reactions other than coronary artery vasospasm. Myocardial and peripheral vascular ischemia have been reported with dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray.

Dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray associated vasospastic phenomena may also cause muscle pains, numbness, coldness, pallor, and cyanosis of the digits. In patients with compromised circulation, persistent vasospasm may result in gangrene or death, dihydroergotamine mesylate nasal spray should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of vasoconstriction develop.

- **Cerebrovascular events**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events, including cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke.
- **Chest tightness, chest pain, neck pain, jaw pain**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-cardiac chest pain and related symptoms.
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as eletriptan has been associated with an increased risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema and anaphylaxis.
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of significant BP elevations, including hypertensive crisis.
- **Medication overuse headache**: use caution in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: use caution in patients taking SSRIs, SNRIs, or TCAs.
- **Vasospastic reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as 5-HT1 agonists have been associated with an increased risk of non-coronary vasospastic reactions, including peripheral vascular ischemia, gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction, splenic infarction, and Raynaud's syndrome.

5.6 Medication Overuse Headache

Overuse of acute migraine drugs (e.g., ergotamines, triptans, opioids, or a combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month) may lead to exacerbation of headache (i.e., medication overuse headache). Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like daily headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks. Detoxification of patients including withdrawal of the overused drugs and treatment of withdrawal symptoms (which often includes a transient worsening of headache) may be necessary.

5.7 Preterm Labor

Based on the mechanism of action of dihydroergotamine and findings from the published literature, ATZUMI may cause preterm labor. Avoid use of ATZUMI during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.8 Fibrotic Complications

The potential for fibrotic complications exists with ATZUMI treatment. There have been reports of pleural and retroperitoneal fibrosis in patients following prolonged daily use of dihydroergotamine. Rarely, prolonged daily use of other ergot alkaloid drugs has been associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis. Rare cases have also been reported in association with the use of dihydroergotamine; however, in those cases, patients also received drugs known to be associated with cardiac valvular fibrosis.

Administration of ATZUMI should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
