## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about infections in hospitalized patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the scope and definitions to anchor the analysis. Then, I should quantify the burden and epidemiology across major infection types. Next, I will examine risk factors and special populations, followed by outcomes and costs. After that, I need to appraise prevention strategies and their evidence base. Finally, I will translate this into practical clinical recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps, making sure I verify key figures and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the scope and definitions so I don't misclassify infections. Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are those occurring 48 hours or more after admission and not incubating at admission, with major categories including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, and Clostridioides difficile infection, among others [^4e8664a7] [^bbaf6d78]. I should distinguish ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) from nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP), and I need to remember that hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 is now tracked as a healthcare-associated infection in many systems, which can confound temporal attribution if testing practices vary [^8b52d780].

> Next, I should review the overall burden. Wait, let me verify the most reliable estimates. The CDC's 2015 point-prevalence survey found HAIs in 3.2% of hospitalized patients, down from 4.0% in 2011, with pneumonia, gastrointestinal infections (mostly C. difficile), and surgical site infections the most common, indicating real progress but persistent risk [^4e8664a7]. Globally, WHO estimates suggest hospital-wide HAI prevalence around 5.7–19.1%, with substantial regional variation, and ICU-acquired infections remain disproportionately high, reflecting severity and device use [^227055b3]. I should also note that contemporary ICU data show suspected or proven infection in 54% of ICU patients, with ICU-acquired infection in 22%, underscoring the ICU as a high-risk setting [^d5c55355].

> I will now examine pneumonia, since it is the most common HAI and has the most complex subtypes. Let me think about incidence and attribution. HAP occurs in roughly 1 in 100 hospitalized patients overall, and up to 1 in 10 ventilated patients, with VAP attributable mortality around 10% and VAEs associated with about 50% higher mortality than VAP, while NV-HAP doubles time to discharge and increases mortality compared with patients without NV-HAP [^c0a726d7] [^b955397d]. Hold on, I should verify NV-HAP incidence estimates; a large U.S. cohort using electronic surveillance found NV-HAP in 0.12–2.28 per 1,000 patient-days across hospitals, with most cases outside the ICU, which aligns with underrecognition and underprevention in general wards [^d67d9333] [^51904133].

> For bloodstream infections, I need to check both central line-associated BSIs and ICU-acquired BSIs. CLABSIs occur at approximately 0.8–1.2 per 1,000 catheter-days in U.S. ICUs, with substantial attributable mortality and cost, and ICU-acquired BSIs complicate about 1.2–6.7% of ICU admissions, with incidence densities around 5–19 per 1,000 patient-days in longer-stay patients [^59dcd462]. But wait, what if I'm conflating different denominators? I should confirm that these figures reflect per-patient-day or per-device-day metrics and interpret them accordingly to avoid overestimation in shorter stays [^59dcd462].

> Urinary tract infections are common yet often preventable. Let me verify the magnitude. CAUTIs remain among the most frequent HAIs, with CDC data showing declines over time but persistent burden, and multifaceted interventions consistently reduce CAUTI rates by roughly 35–55% in meta-analyses, reinforcing the value of device stewardship and care bundles [^edeaa931]. I should double-check that these reductions are independent of economic setting, which the meta-analysis reports, supporting broad applicability with local adaptation [^edeaa931].

> Surgical site infections are a major driver of morbidity and cost. I should confirm variability by procedure. Risk-adjusted SSI incidence ranges from about 0.28% in radical mastectomy to 6.15% in femoropopliteal bypass in surveillance cohorts, and SSIs are a key target for prevention bundles and antimicrobial prophylaxis optimization [^28fdc748]. Hold on, I should verify that these figures reflect in-hospital detection and may underestimate true incidence if post-discharge surveillance is limited, which is a known limitation in many systems [^28fdc748].

> Clostridioides difficile infection deserves separate attention because it is often healthcare-associated and has unique prevention needs. Let me verify epidemiology and prevention levers. CDI accounts for a large share of gastrointestinal HAIs, with both hospital- and community-onset cases rising historically, and prevention hinges on antibiotic stewardship, environmental cleaning, and contact precautions, with ongoing research into probiotics and other adjuncts [^4e8664a7] [^d61e5079]. I should confirm that community-onset CDI is substantial, around 41% in population-based data, which complicates attribution and underscores the need for comprehensive stewardship across settings [^9b19e924].

> Now, I need to consider special populations and risk modifiers. COVID-19 inpatients experienced markedly higher HAI rates during the pandemic, with CLABSI, CAUTI, and MRSA bacteremia rates 2.7–4-fold higher than in non-COVID inpatients, and hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 occurred in about 0.2–0.4% of hospitalizations, with testing intensity influencing observed rates and classification accuracy [^8da1feeb] [^8b52d780]. Patients with spinal cord injury have uniquely high HAI rates, around 35 per 1,000 patient-days, driven by urinary and respiratory infections and prolonged lengths of stay, highlighting the need for targeted prevention in rehabilitation settings [^6b31b01c]. Neonates and children also have distinct risks, with viral nosocomial infections peaking in infants and seasonal patterns that justify proactive infection control on pediatric wards [^72bf5de5].

> Next, I should review outcomes and costs to frame the clinical and economic impact. ICU-acquired infection independently increases mortality compared with community-acquired infection, with particularly high risks for resistant organisms such as VRE, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella, and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter, and HAIs prolong length of stay and increase costs substantially, for example, VAP adding roughly $77,657 in median total hospital costs in U.S. cohorts [^d5c55355] [^0aaceee7]. I should confirm that these cost figures reflect total hospitalization costs rather than incremental costs, which they do, and note that non-responding pneumonia carries mortality exceeding 40% in some series, underscoring the urgency of reassessment and optimization when patients fail to improve [^c87ec50a].

> I will now examine prevention strategies and their evidence base. Multifaceted infection control interventions reduce CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and SSI by about 35–55% on average, and these effects appear robust across economic settings, though many studies have high risk of bias and heterogeneity, so local implementation and measurement are critical [^edeaa931]. For VAP specifically, head-of-bed elevation, oral care protocols, and ventilator bundles reduce incidence, and for NV-HAP, attention to oral hygiene, mobility, and viral transmission controls is recommended, though evidence quality varies and ongoing evaluation is needed [^e3dd4e0d] [^ead59992]. MRSA prevention benefits from contact precautions, with national declines in hospital-onset MRSA bacteremia over time, and chlorhexidine bathing in ICUs reduces bloodstream infections including candidemia in high-risk settings, supporting selective implementation where baseline rates are elevated [^812f9cf0] [^a6327a2f].

> Let me translate this into practical clinical recommendations, and I should double-check guideline concordance. For suspected HAP/VAP, obtain lower respiratory cultures before antibiotics when feasible, apply local antibiograms to guide empiric therapy, and include MRSA coverage when risk factors are present or local prevalence exceeds 20%, with prompt de-escalation based on cultures and clinical response; treat for 7 days in most cases, extending only if response is slow or complications arise [^cfe8f94c] [^43a75725] [^895cc90b]. For non-responding pneumonia after 48–72 hours, I need to ensure a structured reassessment for resistant or atypical pathogens, complications like empyema or abscess, and noninfectious mimics, using CT, bronchoscopy, or repeat sampling as indicated, because treatment failure is common and mortality is high if not corrected [^c87ec50a] [^0967dbb5]. For device-associated infections, prioritize removal or exchange of the device when possible, and embed prevention bundles into daily workflows to sustain gains [^edeaa931].

> But wait, what about antimicrobial resistance and special pathogens. I should confirm that empiric regimens account for local resistance patterns, especially for gram-negatives like Pseudomonas and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, and that definitive therapy be adjusted to susceptibilities to limit collateral damage and resistance amplification [^7ecf4ff3]. National surveillance shows persistent hospital-onset resistance burdens, with regional variation, reinforcing the need for institutional antibiograms and stewardship oversight to guide empiric choices and track trends [^af7c784d].

> Finally, I need to identify knowledge gaps and future directions. There is a need for better diagnostics to distinguish colonization from infection, particularly in VAP and in COVID-19–associated secondary infections, and for standardized definitions to improve comparability across studies and sites [^6ec98f71] [^c9aa7c28]. We also lack high-quality data on optimal management of non-responding pneumonia, the effectiveness of emerging prevention technologies, and the cost-effectiveness of intensified interventions in resource-limited settings, all of which should be prioritized in research and quality improvement agendas [^c87ec50a] [^b34a61d2].

In hospitalized patients, **healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are common and preventable** [^4e8664a7], with a U.S. prevalence of 3.2% and a global burden of 7–10% of admissions [^4e8664a7] [^227055b3]. The most frequent HAIs are pneumonia, bloodstream, urinary tract, and surgical site infections [^4e8664a7], with pneumonia — especially ventilator-associated — carrying the highest mortality and cost [^b955397d] [^0aaceee7]. Risk rises with devices, ICU care, immunocompromise, and prolonged stay [^d5c55355] [^6b31b01c]; **multifaceted prevention bundles reduce HAIs by 30–55%** [^edeaa931], and early, appropriate antibiotics improve outcomes [^5fd75c27]. HAIs prolong stay, increase costs, and drive antimicrobial resistance, making prevention and stewardship essential [^4e8664a7] [^af7c784d].

---

## Epidemiology and burden

- **Prevalence**: HAIs affect ~3.2% of hospitalized patients in the U.S. (2015) [^4e8664a7], down from 4.0% in 2011, with global estimates of 7–10% of admissions [^notfound].
- **Incidence**: ~1 in 31 U.S. inpatients has an HAI on any given day [^b34a61d2].
- **Common sites**: pneumonia, bloodstream, urinary tract, and surgical site infections predominate [^4e8664a7] [^bbaf6d78].
- **ICU impact**: ICU patients have 2–5× higher infection risk than general wards [^045093a1].

---

## Types of infections and causative pathogens

| **Infection type** | **Common pathogens** |
|-|-|
| Pneumonia (HAP/VAP) | - Gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae) [^562d38bf] <br/> - MRSA [^0c2fe32c] |
| Bloodstream infection (CLABSI) | - Coagulase-negative staphylococci <br/> - Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA) <br/> - Candida spp. [^notfound] |
| Urinary tract infection (CAUTI) | - Escherichia coli <br/> - Proteus <br/> - Klebsiella <br/> - Candida spp. [^notfound] |
| Surgical site infection (SSI) | - S. aureus (MRSA/MSSA) <br/> - Gram-negative bacilli <br/> - Anaerobes [^notfound] |

---

## Risk factors

- **Patient-related**: age, immunocompromise, chronic disease, malnutrition, prolonged stay [^6b31b01c].
- **Device-related**: central lines, urinary catheters, mechanical ventilation [^6b31b01c].
- **Environmental**: ICU care, high workload, poor hand hygiene, inadequate disinfection [^4e76ced0].
- **COVID-19**: higher HAI risk, especially CLABSI, CAUTI, and MRSA [^8da1feeb].

---

## Clinical outcomes and impact

- **Mortality**: HAIs increase mortality; VAP attributable mortality ~10% [^b955397d], with ICU-acquired infection independently associated with higher death risk [^d5c55355].
- **Morbidity**: Longer stay, higher costs, and functional decline are common [^b955397d] [^0aaceee7].
- **Resistance**: HAIs drive antimicrobial resistance, complicating therapy and worsening outcomes [^d5c55355] [^af7c784d].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Bundles**: Multifaceted interventions reduce CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and SSI by 30–55% [^edeaa931].
- **Hand hygiene**: Consistent adherence is foundational [^notfound].
- **Device stewardship**: Minimize use and ensure timely removal [^notfound].
- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Early, appropriate therapy with de-escalation [^060ceb25] [^5fd75c27].
- **Environmental controls**: Cleaning, ventilation, and COVID-19 precautions reduce transmission [^ead59992].

---

## Clinical management principles

Early recognition and **prompt empiric therapy** aligned to local antibiograms improve outcomes [^5fd75c27] [^08bccc15]. Definitive therapy should be **tailored to cultures**, with **duration minimized** (e.g. 7 days for HAP/VAP) when clinically appropriate [^895cc90b] [^438c2597]. Multidisciplinary care and **infection control** are essential to limit spread and resistance [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

During the COVID-19 pandemic, **HAI rates rose**, largely due to infections in COVID-19 patients, underscoring the need for enhanced prevention in this group [^8da1feeb] [^6e425d8d]. In resource-limited settings, **HAI burden is higher**, with ICU-acquired infections and resistance particularly concerning, requiring adapted prevention and stewardship strategies [^b34a61d2] [^d996902c].

---

Healthcare-associated infections are a major, preventable burden in hospitalized patients, with **pneumonia, bloodstream, urinary tract, and surgical site infections** leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost. Prevention through bundles, hand hygiene, device stewardship, and antibiotic stewardship, plus early, appropriate therapy, are key to reducing harm [^4e8664a7] [^edeaa931].

### Hospital-acquired pneumonia: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^5fd75c27]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most common causes of nosocomial infection, morbidity, and mortality in hospitalized patients. Many patient- and disease-specific factors contribute to the pathophysiology of HAP, particularly in the surgical population. Risk-factor modification and inpatient prevention strategies can have a significant impact on the incidence of HAP. While the best diagnostic strategy remains a subject of some debate, prompt and appropriate antimicrobial therapy in patients suspected of having HAP has been shown to significantly decrease mortality. Because the pathogens responsible for HAP are frequently more virulent and have greater resistance to commonly used antimicrobials than other pathogens, clinicians must have knowledge of the resistance patterns at their institutions to choose appropriate therapy.

### Incidence and risk factors for clinically confirmed secondary bacterial infections in patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^c9aa7c28]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced significant global morbidity and mortality. Illness and severity can vary from mild cases to severe respiratory failure manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The disease course can also be complicated by diverse types of secondary infections ranging from bacterial pneumonia to opportunistic fungal infections. However, the incidence and prognosis of secondary infections in COVID-19 are poorly understood. Community-onset infections have been reported at overall low incidence ranging from 1.18% to 3.5%. In contrast, hospital-acquired secondary infections have been reported at higher incidence, ranging from 11.9% up to 53%. Meta-analyses have reported a pooled incidence of community-onset secondary infections following COVID-19 at 19% and hospital-acquired infections at 24%, where others report relatively lower incidence of secondary infection of 8.6%. The considerable heterogeneity among studies is likely due to variability in setting, testing methods, and case definitions, which frequently include only culture based or molecular testing as their definition for secondary infection without clinical criteria. In addition, there are significant challenges in distinguishing secondary bacterial infections from severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Secondary infections are reported in a small proportion of COVID-19 infections; however, earlier studies have reported up to 98% of patients received antibiotics. –, In this study, we measured the incidence of secondary infections among hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and identify independent risk factors for secondary infections.

### Acquired bloodstream infection in the intensive care unit: incidence and attributable mortality [^59dcd462]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) is a serious and potentially preventable complication of hospitalization and has been estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death in the USA. Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, which are two to seven times more common in the ICU [-] and can account for approximately half of all hospital-acquired BSI.

ICU-acquired BSI has been estimated to complicate between 1.2% and 6.7% of all ICU admissions [-], 4.4% to 6.8% of admissions of longer than 48 to 72 hours in duration [-] and have an incidence of between 5 and 19 per 1,000 patient days. These infections have been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and health care expenses [,-]. As a consequence, considerable clinical and research activity has been focused on attempts to improve patient outcome by their prevention.

BSI is more common in patients who have surgery, are immunocompromised, develop multiorgan dysfunction, require mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy, and have greater illness severity on ICU admission. Some critically ill patients may be genetically predisposed to both developing BSI and dying in hospital. Thus BSI may be a marker of illness severity and pre-morbid condition as well as a direct contributor to adverse outcome. As a consequence, our ability to demonstrate the survival benefit of any intervention to prevent BSI will be dependent on the baseline incidence of BSI, the mortality rate of patients who develop it, and, crucially, on its true independent influence on outcome once correction has been made for other markers of illness severity.

Accordingly, we performed an observational study in a large cohort of critically ill patients and sought to estimate the incidence of BSI, the mortality rate of patients who acquire BSI, and its independent influence of mortality.

### The prevalence and estimates of the cumulative incidence of hospital-acquired infections among patients admitted to auckland district health board hospitals in New Zealand [^628afdc3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report the pooled results of seven prevalence surveys of hospital-acquired infections conducted between November 1996 and November 1999, and to use the data to predict the cumulative incidence of hospital-acquired infections in the same patient group.

Design

The summary and modeling of data gathered from the routine surveillance of the point prevalence of hospital-acquired infections.

Setting

Auckland District Health Board Hospitals (Auckland DHBH), the largest publicly funded hospital group in New Zealand supplying secondary and tertiary services.

Patients

All inpatients.

Method

Point-prevalence surveys were conducted including all patients in Auckland DHBH. Standard definitions of hospital-acquired infection were used. The data from the seven surveys were pooled and used in a modeling exercise to predict the cumulative incidence of hospital-acquired infection. An existing method for the conversion of prevalence to cumulative incidence was applied. Results are presented for all patients and stratified by clinical service and site of hospital-acquired infection.

Results

The underlying patterns of hospital-acquired infection by site and service were stable during the seven time periods. The prevalence rate for all patients was 9.5%, with 553 patients identified with one or more hospital-acquired infections from a population of 5,819. The predicted cumulative incidence for all patients was 6.33% (95% confidence interval, 6.20% to 6.46%).

Conclusions

The prevalence and the predicted cumulative incidence are similar to rates reported in the international literature. The validity of the predicted cumulative incidence derived here is not known. If it were accurate, then the application of this method would represent a cost-effective alternative to incidence studies.

### Surveillance for hospital-acquired infections on surgical wards in a Dutch university hospital [^a041b9e8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine incidence rates of hospital-acquired infections and to develop preventive measures to reduce the risk of hospital-acquired infections.

Methods

Prospective surveillance for hospital-acquired infections was performed during a 5-year period in the wards housing general and vascular, thoracic, orthopedic, and general gynecologic and gynecologic-oncologic surgery of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. Data were collected from patients with and without infections, using criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Results

The infection control team recorded 648 hospital-acquired infections affecting 550 (14%) of 3,845 patients. The incidence density was 17.8 per 1,000 patient-days. Patients with hospital-acquired infections were hospitalized for 19.8 days versus 7.7 days for patients without hospital-acquired infections. Prolongation of stay among patients with hospital-acquired infections may have resulted in 664 fewer admissions due to unavailable beds. Different specialties were associated with different infection rates at different sites, requiring a tailor-made approach. Interventions were recommended for respiratory tract infections in the thoracic surgery ward and for surgical-site infections in the orthopedic and gynecologic surgery wards.

Conclusions

Surveillance in four surgical wards showed that each had its own prominent infection, risk factors, and indications for specific recommendations. Because prospective surveillance requires extensive resources, we considered a modified approach based on a half-yearly point-prevalence survey of hospital-acquired infections in all wards of our hospital. Such surveillance can be extended with procedure-specific prospective surveillance when indicated.

### Health care-associated infections among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, March 2020-March 2022 [^8da1feeb]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The reported incidence of many health care-associated infections (HAIs) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, it is unclear whether this is due to increased patient risk or to increased pressure on the health care system.

Objective

To assess HAI occurrence among patients admitted to hospitals with and without COVID-19.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A cross-sectional retrospective analysis of inpatients discharged both with and without laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection was conducted. Data were obtained between January 1, 2019, and March 31, 2022, from community hospitals affiliated with a large health care system in the US.

Exposure

COVID-19 infection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Occurrence of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, and Clostridioides difficile infection as reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network.

Results

Among nearly 5 million hospitalizations in 182 hospitals between 2020 and 2022, the occurrence of health care-associated infections (HAIs) was high among the 313 200 COVID-19 inpatients (median [SD] age, 57 [27.3] years; 56.0% women). Incidence per 100 000 patient-days showed higher HAIs among those with COVID-19 compared with those without. For CLABSI, the incidence for the full 9 quarters of the study was nearly 4-fold higher among the COVID-19 population than the non-COVID-19 population (25.4 vs 6.9). For CAUTI, the incidence in the COVID-19 population was 2.7-fold higher in the COVID-19 population (16.5 vs 6.1), and for MRSA, 3.0-fold higher (11.2 vs 3.7). Quarterly trends were compared with the same quarter in 2019. The greatest increase in the incidence of HAI in comparison with the same quarter in 2019 for the entire population occurred in quarter 3 of 2020 for CLABSI (11.0 vs 7.3), quarter 4 of 2021 for CAUTI (7.8 vs 6.8), and quarter 3 of 2021 for MRSA (5.2 vs 3.9). When limited to the non-COVID-19 population, the increase in CLABSI incidence vs the 2019 incidence was eliminated, and the quarterly rates of MRSA and CAUTI were lower vs the prepandemic 2019 comparator quarter.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of hospitals during the pandemic, HAI occurrence among inpatients without COVID-19 was similar to that during 2019 despite additional pressures for infection control and health care professionals. The findings suggest that patients with COVID-19 may be more susceptible to HAIs and may require additional prevention measures.

### Accelerated subtyping of influenza A in hospitalized patients (...) [^320768c1]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinicians and laboratorians are reminded to test for influenza in patients with suspected influenza and, going forward, to now expedite the subtyping of influenza A-positive specimens from hospitalized patients, particularly those in an intensive care unit. This approach can help prevent delays in identifying human infections with avian influenza A viruses, supporting optimal patient care and timely infection control and case investigation. CDC has routinely recommended influenza testing for hospitalized patients with suspected influenza. In light of the ongoing avian influenza A virus animal outbreak in the United States, CDC now recommends subtyping of all influenza A virus-positive specimens from hospitalized patients on an accelerated basis. This accelerated subtyping is part of a comprehensive strategy to identify severe human infections with avian influenza A viruses, in addition to characterizing seasonal influenza viruses in a timely fashion.

Subtyping is especially important in people who have a history of relevant exposure to wild or domestic animals infected or possibly infected with avian influenza A viruses. CDC still considers the risk from avian influenza A viruses to the public to be low but is closely monitoring this dynamic situation. At this time, while seasonal influenza levels are high nationally, nearly all people who are currently hospitalized with influenza A virus infections probably have seasonal influenza.

Recommendations for Testing of Hospitalized Patients In addition to jurisdiction-specific instructions for sending specimens for subtyping, CDC now recommends that all influenza A positive respiratory specimens from hospitalized patients, especially from those in an ICU, be subtyped for seasonal influenza A viruses as soon as possible following admission—ideally within 24 hours—to support optimal patient care and proper infection prevention and control measures and to facilitate rapid public health investigation and action. Implement appropriate infection control measures when influenza is suspected.
- If avian influenza A virus infection is suspected, probable, or confirmed in a hospitalized patient, place the patient in an airborne infection isolation room with negative pressure with implementation by caregivers of standard, contact, and airborne precautions with eye protection.

Any hospitalized patients, especially those in an ICU, with suspected seasonal influenza or avian influenza A should be started on antiviral treatment with oseltamivir as soon as possible without waiting for the results of influenza testing.
- Consider combination antiviral treatment for hospitalized patients with avian influenza A virus infection.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^6ec98f71]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 1: Rationale and statements of concern

Hospitalized patients are at high risk for pneumonia and other pulmonary complications, particularly patients on mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is the most common nosocomial infection.It affects ~1 in 100 patients overall and up to 1 in 10 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. The true incidence of nosocomial pneumonia is difficult to discern, however, because diagnostic criteria vary widely, correlate poorly with histology, are often subjective, and are applied differently by different surveyors. – Many hospitals have reported dramatic decreases in VAP rates over the past 20 years, but the extent to which these declines reflect better care versus stricter application of subjective surveillance criteria remains unclear. Clinical surveys suggest that 5%–10% of ventilated patients continue to be treated for VAP, – and an independent audit conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that VAP rates were stable between 2005 and 2013. Patients on mechanical ventilation are at risk for a variety of serious complications in addition to pneumonia. Examples include acute respiratory distress syndrome, fluid overload, atelectasis, pneumothorax, barotrauma, and pulmonary embolism. The CDC created VAE definitions to better capture the breadth of serious complications associated with mechanical ventilation.Approximately 5%–10% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAEs. – The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with an increase in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia due to hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and hospital-acquired bacterial superinfections in patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. – Differentiating superinfection from underlying COVID-19 pneumonia and COVID-19–related ARDS is challenging due to considerable overlap in clinical signs.
VAP, VAE, and NV-HAP are detrimental to patients and increase costs. The attributable mortality of VAP is estimated to be ~10% but varies considerably by type and severity of underlying illness. – VAP and VAE extend duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, prolong intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and increase mortality risk.–,,, They are also associated with greater use of antimicrobials and higher costs. Patients with VAEs are ~50% more likely to die compared to similar patients with VAP.NV-HAP is associated with a doubling of the length of time until discharge and substantially higher mortality rates compared to similar patients without NV-HAP.

### Hospital-acquired coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among patients of two acute-care hospitals: implications for surveillance [^533101e5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We quantified hospital-acquired coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the early phases of the pandemic, and we evaluated solely temporal determinations of hospital acquisition.

Design

Retrospective observational study during early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, March 1-November 30, 2020. We identified laboratory-detected severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from 30 days before admission through discharge. All cases detected after hospital day 5 were categorized by chart review as community or unlikely hospital-acquired cases, or possible or probable hospital-acquired cases.

Setting

The study was conducted in 2 acute-care hospitals in Chicago, Illinois.

Patients

The study included all hospitalized patients including an inpatient rehabilitation unit.

Interventions

Each hospital implemented infection-control precautions soon after identifying COVID-19 cases, including patient and staff cohort protocols, universal masking, and restricted visitation policies.

Results

Among 2,667 patients with SARS-CoV-2, detection before hospital day 6 was most common (n = 2,612; 98%); detection during hospital days 6-14 was uncommon (n = 43; 1.6%); and detection after hospital day 14 was rare (n = 16; 0.6%). By chart review, most cases after day 5 were categorized as community acquired, usually because SARS-CoV-2 had been detected at a prior healthcare facility (68% of cases on days 6-14 and 53% of cases after day 14). The incidence rates of possible and probable hospital-acquired cases per 10,000 patient days were similar for ICU- and non-ICU patients at hospital A (1.2 vs 1.3 difference, 0.1; 95% CI, -2.8 to 3.0) and hospital B (2.8 vs 1.2 difference, 1.6; 95% CI, -0.1 to 4.0).

Conclusions

Most patients were protected by early and sustained application of infection-control precautions modified to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Using solely temporal criteria to discriminate hospital versus community acquisition would have misclassified many "late onset" SARS-CoV-2-positive cases.

In a multicenter cohort of 963 adults hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 5% had a proven hospital-acquired infection (HAI) and 21% had a proven, probable, or possible HAI. Risk factors for proven or probable HAIs included intensive care unit admission, dexamethasone use, severe COVID-19, heart failure, and antibiotic exposure upon admission.

### Incidence and risk factors for clinically confirmed secondary bacterial infections in patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^02fa6738]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we observed an overall incidence of proven or possible secondary bacterial infections at 26.3% identified at various stages of hospitalization for COVID-19. Proven (ie, culture-confirmed) secondary infections were often hospital acquired (87.5%), with an incidence of 13.6%. In comparison, possible secondary infections were mostly community acquired (80%), with a similar incidence of 12.7%. Similar to other reports, culture-confirmed secondary bacterial infections with community onset were quite rare (2 of 118, 1.7%), and the majority of such infections were identified at later stages of hospitalization. –, We observed that clinically significant respiratory cultures occurred in patients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation; all of the specimens from proven secondary bacterial pneumonias were obtained from endotracheal aspirate or BAL. Such findings suggest that cases with severe COVID-19 are more susceptible to developing secondary bacterial pneumonia.

Severely ill COVID-19 patients are subjected to a high degree of intervention, placing them at risk for hospital-acquired bacteremia. Similar to other reports, bacteremia represented an overall minority of secondary bacterial infections among hospitalized patients (5 of 118, 4.3%) but results in significant morbidity and mortality.The higher mortality in patients with secondary infections (11 of 31, 35.5%) compared to those with no identified secondary infection (4 of 87, 4.6%) in this cohort was consistent with numerous prior studies.,,,,

Similar to other studies, we observed a high proportion of individuals that received empiric antibiotics on admission. –, At the onset of the of the COVID-19 pandemic, providers’ experiences with influenza, coupled with a lack of available COVID-19 therapeutics, informed the decision to initiate antibiotics in patients with severe or worsening clinical status. Further studies are needed to evaluate antibiotic appropriateness to best inform antimicrobial stewardship and patient-level outcomes associated with antibiotic overuse.

### Epidemiology of sepsis and infection in ICU patients from an international multicentre cohort study [^3b8c9a0c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the incidence of infections and to describe them and their outcome in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.

Design and Setting

International prospective cohort study in which all patients admitted to the 28 participating units in eight countries between May 1997 and May 1998 were followed until hospital discharge.

Patients

A total of 14,364 patients were admitted to the ICUs, 6011 of whom stayed less than 24 h and 8353 more than 24 h.

Results

Overall 3034 infectious episodes were recorded at ICU admission (crude incidence: 21.1%). In ICU patients hospitalised longer than 24 h there were 1581 infectious episodes (crude incidence: 18.9%) including 713 (45%) in patients already infected at ICU admission. These rates varied between ICUs. Respiratory, digestive, urinary tracts, and primary bloodstream infections represented about 80% of all sites. Hospital-acquired and ICU-acquired infections were documented more frequently microbiologically than community-acquired infections (71% and 86%, respectively vs. 55%). About 28% of infections were associated with sepsis, 24% with severe sepsis and 30% with septic shock, and 18% were not classified. Crude hospital mortality rates ranged from 16.9% in non-infected patients to 53.6% in patients with hospital-acquired infections at the time of ICU admission and acquiring infection during the ICU stay.

Conclusions

The crude incidence of ICU infections remains high, although the rate varies between ICUs and patient subsets, illustrating the added burden of nosocomial infections in the use of ICU resources.

### Hospital acquired pneumonia prevention initiative-2: incidence of nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in the United States [^d67d9333]. American Journal of Infection Control (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Because nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP) is understudied, our purpose was to determine the incidence, overall burden, and level of documented pneumonia preventive interventions of NV-HAP in 24 U.S. hospitals.

Methods

This retrospective chart review extracted NV-HAP cases as per the 2014 ICD-9-CM codes for pneumonia not present on admission and the 2013 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition. Patient demographic data, outcomes, and documented preventive interventions were also collected.

Results

We found 1,300 NV-HAP patients who acquired NV-HAP (rate, 0.12-2.28 per 1,000 patient days) across the 21 hospitals that completed the data collection. Most NV-HAP infections (70.8%) were acquired outside of intensive care units (ICUs); 18.8% required transfer into the ICU. In the 24 hours prior to diagnosis, most of the patients did not have fundamental hospital care associated with pneumonia prevention.

Conclusions

This multicenter, nationwide study highlights the significant burden of NV-HAP in the U.S. acute care hospital setting. We found that NV-HAP occurred on every hospital unit, including in younger, healthy patients. This indicates that although some patients are clearly at higher risk, all patients carry some NV-HAP risk. Therapeutic interventions aimed at NV-HAP prevention are frequently not provided for patients in acute care hospitals.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^c0a726d7]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and ventilator-associated events (VAE)—burden and incidence highlight that hospitalized patients are at high risk for pneumonia and other pulmonary complications, particularly patients on mechanical ventilation; hospital-acquired pneumonia is the most common nosocomial infection and affects ~1 in 100 patients overall and up to 1 in 10 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation; clinical surveys suggest that 5%–10% of ventilated patients continue to be treated for VAP, and an independent audit reported that VAP rates were stable between 2005 and 2013; and approximately 5%–10% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAEs.

### Recommendations for treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: review of recent international guidelines [^060ceb25]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Recently published guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia are reviewed for recommendations regarding diagnosis and antimicrobial therapy to assess the implications for development of future clinical trials. Despite some differences (mostly related to likely pathogens), there is a general agreement about the recommended approach to management. All of the reviewed guidelines invariably recommend early, appropriate antimicrobial therapy and avoidance of excessive antimicrobials by deescalation of therapy on the basis of microbiological culture results and the clinical response of the patient. Developers of future clinical trials will need to be mindful of these recommendations to maintain best practice care for each investigator.

### Incidence of hospital-acquired infections due to carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in critically ill patients in Italy: a multicentre prospective cohort study [^8b1221d1]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Study design

This prospective, multicenter, non-interventional cohort study aimed to estimate the annual incidence of CRE and CRPA infections in 20 Italian ICUs. Adult patients diagnosed with hospital-acquired CRE or CRPA infections and receiving treatment in these ICUs were eligible. Hospital-acquired infection was defined as an infection occurring in any body site after ≥ 48 h following hospital admission, including those acquired both during ICU stay and prior to ICU admission. To be included in the study, the patient had to meet the criteria for any of the following microbiologically documented infections: bloodstream infections (BSI), urinary tract infections (UTI), hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP), intra-abdominal complicated or uncomplicated infection (IAI), or other infections (e.g. meningitis, endocarditis, or skin/skin structure infections). Infection definitions are reported in the Supplementary Materials. Pregnant or lactating women and patients included in any interventional study at the time of enrollment were not eligible.

Therapeutic strategies adopted by clinicians were based on routine clinical practice or standard practice guidelines for each ICU.

Participating investigators were asked to include all consecutive patients with CRE or CRPA infections attending the ICU, who were followed until one of the following end-of-study criteria occurred: death, discharge from ICU, infection resolution, a 30-day ICU stay, or consent withdrawal, whichever occurred first. The study period spanned one year from the initiation date at each site.

Primary endpoints

The primary endpoint was to determine the one-year incidence of CRE/CRPA infections in Italian ICUs, calculated as the total number of CRE/CRPA infections divided by the total number of patient days in each ICU over one year. Moreover, the incidence risk per ICU admission was calculated as the total number of CRE/CRPA infections divided by the total number of ICU admissions recorded during the one-year period from the start of the study.

### Epidemiology and burden of sepsis acquired in hospitals and intensive care units: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^63160b62]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Definitions used in this study

For the purpose of this study, “hospital-acquired” is defined as a case of infection/sepsis acquired in the hospital, including ICUs, while “ICU-acquired” denotes a subset of hospital-acquired infections/sepsis and comprises all cases of infection/sepsis acquired during ICU stay. Any reported timescale of “hospital-acquired” was accepted. In the included studies, “hospital-acquired” and “ICU-acquired” were usually defined as disease onset occurring 48–72 h after hospital and ICU admission, respectively.

In this study, “sepsis” is an umbrella term for cases of sepsis, sepsis with organ dysfunction and septic shock. Similarly, “sepsis with organ dysfunction” is an umbrella term for cases of sepsis with organ dysfunction and septic shock. Importantly, cases of “severe sepsis” defined here by sepsis-1 and sepsis-2 definitions were termed “sepsis with organ dysfunction”. As the current sepsis-3 definition includes organ dysfunction as part of its sepsis case definition, “sepsis” cases in these studies were designated as “sepsis with organ dysfunction” cases.

Study outcomes

Primary outcomes were population and/or hospital-wide/ICU incidence, incidence density and/or prevalence of HA sepsis; proportion of HA sepsis (1) among all sepsis patients (both of community and hospital origin) or (2) among all patients with HAIs. Secondary outcomes were (1) attributable and crude mortality; (2) length of stay; (3) microbiological data, including data on AMR of microorganisms isolated from sepsis patients.

Data extraction and risk of bias assessment

From eligible studies, at least two independent reviewers (RM, TH, HS, ST) extracted data on the primary and secondary outcomes and the following study characteristics using standardized forms: study location (including WHO region and income level according to the World Bank ; study design; study period; patient inclusion and exclusion criteria; age group; sepsis case definition used; study sponsorship; conflict of interests; infection origin (i.e. hospital-acquired or ICU-acquired); and blood culture status (studies in NICUs). The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the tool developed by Hoy et al. After the initial PROSPERO registration, we modified the protocol and decided not to use the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of evidence because of methodological uncertainties in the application of GRADE to incidence and prevalence studies.

### Health care-associated infections among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, March 2020-March 2022 [^3383f478]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cross-sectional study of a large, diverse group of hospitals, we observed an increase in HAIs coincident with the increase in the volume of patients with COVID-19, and further observed that the increase may be explained by the high proportion of HAIs in the COVID-19 population specifically. Our findings suggest that, despite the unquestionable stressors that hospitals experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, key safety processes appear to have been maintained, and HAI increases may be associated with the unique risks and intensive needs of patients with COVID-19. This analysis suggests that the greatest opportunity to improve outcomes may involve targeting additional resources to provide even greater attention to the hospitalized COVID-19 population.

### Hospital acquired infections in surgical patients: impact of COVID-19-related infection prevention measures [^619b7b8a]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospital acquired infections are common, costly, and potentially preventable adverse events. This study aimed to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic-related escalation in infection prevention and control measures on the incidence of hospital acquired infection in surgical patients in a low COVID-19 environment in Australia.

Method

This was a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary institution. All patients undergoing a surgical procedure from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic period) were compared to patients pre-pandemic (1 April 2019–30 June 2019). The primary outcome investigated was odds of overall hospital acquired infection. The secondary outcome was patterns of involved microorganisms. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess odds of hospital acquired infection.

Results

There were 5945 admission episodes included in this study, 224 (6.6%) episodes had hospital acquired infections in 2019 and 179 (7.1%) in 2020. Univariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated no evidence of change in odds of having a hospital acquired infection between cohorts (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.88–1.33, P = 0.434). The multivariable regression analysis adjusting for potentially confounding co-variables also demonstrated no evidence of change in odds of hospital acquired infection (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.74–1.16, P = 0.530).

Conclusion

Increased infection prevention and control measures did not affect the incidence of hospital acquired infection in surgical patients in our institution, suggesting that there may be a plateau effect with these measures in a system with a pre-existing high baseline of practice.

### The burden of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b34a61d2]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globallyand are mainly attributable to central-line–associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and surgical site infections (SSIs).Hospital-acquired infections are acquired by patients after 48 hours of admission to a hospitaland were neither present nor incubating at the time of admission. Hospital-acquired infections develop in approximately 1 in 31 hospital patientswith the intensive care units contributing 9–20% of these infections.

Pooled data estimates that the burden of HAI in the African region is twice that of developed settings.In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), 22.1% of HAI have been reported among neonatal populations.There is a dearth of HAI data involving adult populations in SSA. In South Africa, the impact of HAI within the public health system and across different patient populations has not been well quantified.Hospital-acquired infections contribute significantly to hospital morbidity and mortality, cost of healthcare, and reduce health-related quality of life.

Although a few systematic reviews reporting on the burden of HAI have been conducted in Africa,, no systematic review extensively interrogating HAI in SSA and its subregions has been performed. In addition, no systematic review has quantified the burden of HAI in neonatal and paediatric populations, as well as temporal HAI trends in SSA. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to estimate the current regional and subregional prevalence of HAI in the overall in-patient population, as well as among ICU patients, adults, paediatric, and neonatal admissions in SSA. We further estimated the prevalence of major HAI and associated mortality in SSA between 2014 and 2023 since comprehensive data for this region and its subregions were lacking.

In summary, our study provides the first comprehensive summary of published evidence on the burden of HA sepsis including ICU-acquired sepsis. Our findings emphasize the public health importance of HA sepsis among hospitalized patients, with particular focus on ICUs, and the urgent need to improve the implementation of global and local IPC strategies to reduce the burden of HAIs, as well as approaches for their early diagnosis and adequate treatment to prevent a progression to sepsis complications. Further research is required to close major knowledge and methodological gaps identified by our study.

### Epidemiology and burden of sepsis acquired in hospitals and intensive care units: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d996902c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Sepsis is recognized as a global public health problem, but the proportion due to hospital-acquired infections remains unclear. We aimed to summarize the epidemiological evidence related to the burden of hospital-acquired (HA) and ICU-acquired (ICU-A) sepsis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase and the Global Index Medicus from 01/2000 to 03/2018. We included studies conducted hospital-wide or in intensive care units (ICUs), including neonatal units (NICUs), with data on the incidence/prevalence of HA and ICU-A sepsis and the proportion of community and hospital/ICU origin. We did random-effects meta-analyses to obtain pooled estimates; inter-study heterogeneity and risk of bias were assessed.

Results

Of the 13,239 studies identified, 51 met the inclusion criteria; 22 were from low- and middle-income countries. Twenty-eight studies were conducted in ICUs, 13 in NICUs, and ten hospital-wide. The proportion of HA sepsis among all hospital-treated sepsis cases was 23.6% (95% CI 17-31.8%, range 16-36.4%). In the ICU, 24.4% (95% CI 16.7-34.2%, range 10.3-42.5%) of cases of sepsis with organ dysfunction were acquired during ICU stay and 48.7% (95% CI 38.3-59.3%, range 18.7-69.4%) had a hospital origin. The pooled hospital incidence of HA sepsis with organ dysfunction per 1000 patients was 9.3 (95% CI 7.3-11.9, range 2-20.6)). In the ICU, the pooled incidence of HA sepsis with organ dysfunction per 1000 patients was 56.5 (95% CI 35-90.2, range 9.2-254.4) and it was particularly high in NICUs. Mortality of ICU patients with HA sepsis with organ dysfunction was 52.3% (95% CI 43.4-61.1%, range 30.1-64.6%). There was a significant inter-study heterogeneity. Risk of bias was low to moderate in ICU-based studies and moderate to high in hospital-wide and NICU studies.

Conclusion

HA sepsis is of major public health importance, and the burden is particularly high in ICUs. There is an urgent need to improve the implementation of global and local infection prevention and management strategies to reduce its high burden among hospitalized patients.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances.These guidelines are intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, critical care, and surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for hospitalized patients with nosocomial pneumonia. The panel's recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews.

The incidence of community-associated, healthcare-associated, and hospital-acquired sterile-site infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates and the susceptibility of the isolates to non- beta -lactam antibiotics were evaluated for 549 hospitalized patients during a 3-year period. The incidence of community-associated MRSA infection increased significantly. The annual percentage of MRSA isolates from cases of healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired infection that were susceptible to 3 or more non- beta -lactam antibiotics increased significantly.

### Intensive care acquired infection is an independent risk factor for hospital mortality: a prospective cohort study [^487710ee]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

• ICU-acquired infection was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality even after adjustment for APACHE II or SOFA scores and age.

• The impact of an ICU infection on hospital mortality was highest among the patients without infection on ICU admission.

• ICU-acquired infection increased resource use and the length of hospital treatment among the patients with infection on admission.

- prior IV antibiotic use within 90 days

- hospitalization in a unit where > 20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin-resistant

- hospitalization in a unit where the prevalence of MRSA is not known.

### The epidemiology of community-acquired Clostridium difficile infection: a population-based study [^9b19e924]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a common hospital-acquired infection with increasing incidence, severity, recurrence, and associated morbidity and mortality. There are emerging data on the occurrence of CDI in nonhospitalized patients. However, there is a relative lack of community-based CDI studies, as most of the existing studies are hospital based, potentially influencing the results by referral or hospitalization bias by missing cases of community-acquired CDI.

Methods

To better understand the epidemiology of community-acquired C. difficile infection, a population-based study was conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota, using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project. Data regarding severity, treatment response, and outcomes were compared in community-acquired vs. hospital-acquired cohorts, and changes in these parameters, as well as in incidence, were assessed over the study period.

Results

Community-acquired CDI cases accounted for 41% of 385 definite CDI cases. The incidence of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired CDI increased significantly over the study period. Compared with those with hospital-acquired infection, patients with community-acquired infection were younger (median age 50 years compared with 72 years), more likely to be female (76% vs. 60%), had lower comorbidity scores, and were less likely to have severe infection (20% vs. 31%) or have been exposed to antibiotics (78% vs. 94%). There were no differences in the rates of complicated or recurrent infection in patients with community-acquired compared with hospital-acquired infection.

Conclusions

In this population-based cohort, a significant proportion of cases of CDI occurred in the community. These patients were younger and had less severe infection than those with hospital-acquired infection. Thus, reports of CDI in hospitalized patients likely underestimate the burden of disease and overestimate severity.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^c87ec50a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia constitutes one of the most frequent causes of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and it is the most frequent infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions.

After the administration of supportive care and antibiotic therapy, the clinical response of pneumonia is not immediate. Clinicians recognize that the first 48–72h of treatment are crucial for determining the course of the illness. Most hospitalized patients with pneumonia recover with timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy and generally follow an uncomplicated course. However, a sizable proportion of patients may experience non-response and treatment failure, leading to an increased risk of mortality, which can be greater than 40%. There is a lack of epidemiologic data on non-responders and little to no evidence concerning the best clinical approach for this situation. Currently available guidelines do not provide recommendations on how to manage these patients.

There are numerous arbitrary definitions for the critically ill patient with severe pneumonia who is not improving or who is deteriorating despite receiving presumed appropriate antibiotic therapy. The nuances associated with the definitions of “not resolving”, “non-responding”, or “progressive” pneumonia along with “treatment failure”, are largely inconsequential to the clinician who is taking care of a critically ill patient with a diagnosis of pneumonia who is not improving or worsening.

This narrative review aims to give to the clinicians a structured approach on the management of non-responding pneumonia, namely the criteria to define a non-responder and its expected frequency, the differential diagnosis, the optimal diagnostic steps and treatment strategies.

### Epidemiology and burden of sepsis acquired in hospitals and intensive care units: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^227055b3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening syndrome associated with physiological, pathological and biological abnormalities caused by a dysregulated host response to infections. It is a global public health concern due to its high mortality and morbidity, and substantial economic burden. Rudd and colleagues recently reported the shocking global estimates of 48.9 million cases of sepsis in 2017 and 11.0 million sepsis-related deaths. According to a systematic review published in 2016 and based on studies from high-income countries, more than 30 million cases of hospital-treated sepsis are estimated to occur every year worldwide, with 5.3 million patients dying from sepsis.

Sepsis is also of great significance in the intensive care unit (ICU), where it affects approximately 30% of patients, with large variations between different geographical regions. A study based in the USA with more than 170,000 sepsis cases reported that 55% of all sepsis cases required ICU admission. Although it occurs across all age groups, the burden of sepsis is especially high among neonates.

Sepsis can occur as a complication of infections acquired in the community, which is reported to represent up to 70% of all sepsis cases according to Reinhart and colleagues. It can also develop from healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) that are mostly preventable by appropriate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. According to a 2011 global report by the World Health Organization (WHO), HAIs prevalence varies between 5.7 and 19.1% hospital-wide. More recent data show that in Europe and the USA hospital-wide prevalence of HAIs is 6.5% and 3.2%, respectively. A multicentre prospective study in ICUs in Brazil showed that 60% of sepsis cases were from HAIs, suggesting that HAIs relatively play a more significant role in epidemiological burden in low- and middle-income countries.

Importantly, recent data showed that up to 55% of all HAIs can be prevented by the implementation of multifaceted IPC interventions, which would ultimately result in a significant reduction in hospital-acquired sepsis (HA sepsis) cases. However, most sepsis studies lack the differentiation between community-acquired and HA sepsis, and no systematic review on the global burden of HA sepsis has been conducted yet, including in the ICU setting.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence, incidence, patient length of stay and mortality of HA sepsis worldwide and to describe causative organisms, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns.

### Community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia [^562d38bf]. The Medical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hospital-acquired pneumonia: 
- Definition: HAP (nosocomial pneumonia) is a lower respiratory infection occurring in patients at least 48 hours after admission to the hospital, or within 14 days after discharge from the hospital.
- Pathophysiology: The three main infection routes include inhalation (most common), aspiration and hematogenous dissemination (rare). HAP is most frequently caused by S. aureus (especially, MRSA), Pseudomonas species (especially P. aeruginosa), Acinetobacter species, E. coli, and Klebsiella species (including extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing and extensively drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae). Other pathogens include S. maltophilia, Chryseobacterium species, E. meningoseptica.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of HAP (HAP) in the US is estimated at 363 per 100,000 patient-days.
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations of HAP are similar to community-acquired pneumonia. Typical pneumonia is characterized by severe malaise, fever, chills, productive cough with purulent sputum (yellow-greenish), dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain associated with rales and increased tactile fremitus. Atypical HAP presents with extrapulmonary manifestations (eg. myalgia, nervous system impairment, and gastrointestinal symptoms).
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Prognosis of HAP is highly dependent on risk factors and comorbidities. However, multidrug-resistant HAP is associated with higher mortality.

### Can we predict septic shock in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia? [^9b6eb01e]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication, with reported pneumonia-attributable mortality rates as high as 50%. Rapid diagnosis and immediate institution of adequate empirical antimicrobial treatment are of paramount importance in patient management. Nevertheless, some patients deteriorate and develop respiratory insufficiency, septic shock and a multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Early recognition of these patients might help in reducing morbidity and mortality. Elevated systemic levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10) at the time of diagnosis of hospital-acquired pneumonia appear to be indicative of subsequent progression to septic shock. Should this now become a part of patient management?

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^8d887f20]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### The preventable proportion of healthcare-associated infections 2005-2016: systematic review and meta-analysis [^edeaa931]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The preventable proportion of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) may decrease over time as standards of care improve. We aimed to assess the proportion of HAIs prevented by multifaceted infection control interventions in different economic settings.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched OVID Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed, and The Cochrane Library for studies published between 2005 and 2016 assessing multifaceted interventions to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), surgical site infections (SSIs), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hospital-acquired pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation (HAP) in acute-care or long-term care settings. For studies reporting raw rates, we extracted data and calculated the natural log of the risk ratio and variance to obtain pooled risk ratio estimates.

Results

Of the 5,226 articles identified by our search, 144 studies were included in the final analysis. Pooled incidence rate ratios associated with multifaceted interventions were 0.543 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.445-0.662) for CAUTI, 0.459 (95% CI, 0.381-0.554) for CLABSI, and 0.553 (95% CI, 0.465-0.657) for VAP. The pooled rate ratio was 0.461 (95% CI, 0.389-0.546) for interventions aiming at SSI reduction, and for VAP reduction initiatives, the pooled rate ratios were 0.611 (95% CI, 0.414-0.900) for before-and-after studies and 0.509 (95% CI, 0.277-0.937) for randomized controlled trials. Reductions in infection rates were independent of the economic status of the study country. The risk of bias was high in 143 of 144 studies (99.3%).

Conclusions

Published evidence suggests a sustained potential for the significant reduction of HAI rates in the range of 35%-55% associated with multifaceted interventions irrespective of a country's income level.

### Health care-associated infections among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, March 2020-March 2022 [^6e425d8d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In our analysis of a large multistate population of inpatients, our findings are consistent with previous reports that the occurrence of HAIs increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, reversing a multiyear national trend of improving performance regarding hospital infection.However, our subanalysis revealed that this increase in the overall infection rate appeared to be entirely due to the occurrence of HAIs in the COVID-19 population. Patients without COVID-19 had rates of HAIs that would be expected based on the incidence observed before the pandemic. The differences in HAI rates between the COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 populations for CLABSI, MRSA, and CAUTI were all significant during every year since the beginning of the pandemic.

A study of HAIs during the COVID-19 pandemic in facilities within our HCA system confirmed that the relative rates of CLABSI, CAUTI, and MRSA bacteremia were associated with increasing monthly COVID-19 discharges.Between March and September 2020, there were 43% to 60% more of these infections than expected. Furthermore, clusters of hospital-onset pathogens also increased during COVID-19 surges, suggesting possible increased transmission. That study temporally linked increased HAI rates with increases in the number of patients with COVID-19 but did not distinguish among which patients (those with or without COVID-19) the HAIs were more likely to occur. Given this, that study, and others that were similar, could not discount disruptions in routine infection prevention practice as a mechanism for increased HAIs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Incidence and outcomes of hospitalization for community-acquired, ventilator-associated and non-ventilator hospital-acquired pneumonias in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Spain [^3162e9b3]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia is a major global health problem and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.Several studies have found that the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is increasing and is highly influenced by age and comorbidities.Quan et al in Oxfordshire, UK, found that from 2009 to 2014, the number of hospital admissions of patients with CAP increased by ≈9% per year.Among infections acquired during hospitalization, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the most frequent, accounting for an estimated 16.6% of all hospital infections.

The investigations over the last years have been mainly centered on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and this has resulted in improved methods for prevention and management, which has reduced the incidence, mortality and morbidity caused by this infection.However, some hospitalized patients develop non-ventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP). Giuliano et al analyzed the US National Inpatient Sample dataset and described that NV-HAP causes an increase in the costs, length of hospital stays and mortality of hospitalized patients.

### SHEA / IDSA / APIC practice recommendation: strategies to prevent methicillin-resistanttransmission and infection in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^812f9cf0]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

MRSA prevention—contact precautions: Use contact precautions for MRSA-colonized and MRSA-infected patients (Quality of evidence: MODERATE), and facilities that choose or have already chosen to modify this practice should conduct a MRSA-specific risk assessment to evaluate transmission risks and the effectiveness of other MRSA risk mitigation strategies. Evidence cited includes that HCP interacting with MRSA-colonized or MRSA-infected patients often become contaminated, environmental surfaces frequently and quickly become contaminated, and placing patients under contact precautions may help reduce patient-to-patient spread. Observational and modeling data report declines and estimated effects: from 2005 to 2016, the incidence of hospital-onset MRSA bloodstream infections in the United States declined 74%; by 2017 in VA hospitals, hospital-onset MRSA infections had declined 66% compared to baseline while MSSA declined only 19%; a VA modeling study estimated contact precautions alone reduced MRSA transmission by 47%; and in an ICU cluster-randomized trial, mathematical models estimated universal glove and gown use reduced transmission by 44%–56%. The CDC continues to recommend contact precautions for MRSA-colonized or infected patients. During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital-onset MRSA bloodstream infections increased nationally, but whether declining use of contact precautions contributed remains unknown, and the appropriate duration of contact precautions for patients with MRSA remains an unresolved issue.

### Antimicrobial-resistant infections in hospitalized patients (...) [^af7c784d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Exposure Inpatient hospitalizations with a discharge date in an included hospital month. Main Outcomes and Measures National annual antimicrobial-resistant cases per 10 000 hospitalizations were obtained using weights based on facility-level characteristics. Cases were defined as community-onset if collected on or before day 3 of hospitalization and hospital-onset if obtained on day 4 or later. Results. We calculated annual pooled rates using weighted estimates and hospitalizations. Percentage resistant was calculated as the weighted resistant cases divided by the weighted cases tested for resistance. To obtain total resistant cases, we summed the resistant cases across all 6 pathogens. Because the same isolate could potentially count as a case for CRE and ESCR-EK phenotypes, we deduplicated cases prior to estimating the total national burden. Weighted national total resistant cases and 95% CIs were calculated using this deduplicated sum.

US hospitalizations decreased from 2020 to 2022, but the annual average number of patient-days per hospitalization in the study cohort increased from a low of 4. 3 in 2017 to
4. 9 in 2022. The overall resistant cases per 10 000 hospitalizations decreased from 2012 to
2016. Rates of resistant blood, urine, and respiratory cases varied by pathogen. Hospital-onset CRE rates decreased in the Northeast US census region with stable or increased rates in other regions.

Rates of hospital-onset MRSA, CRE, CRAsp, and MDR P aeruginosa were higher among males and all hospital-onset resistant case rates were higher in the subpopulations aged 55 to 64 years and 65 to 74 years compared with younger patients.

### Risk factors of health care-associated infection in elderly patients: a retrospective cohort study performed at a tertiary hospital in China [^b585a9c4]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Health-care associated infections (HAIs) which occur in patients under medical care in hospital or other health care facility is a notable public health concern. They place an enormous burden on poor prognosis, increased mortality, prolong hospitalization, and increased health-care costs. Every day, roughly one in 25 patients in the USA contracts at least one infection during their hospital care—an alarming statistic that is unacceptable in view of the fact that health care-associated infections (HAIs) are mostly preventable. However, HAIs are preventable with adoption of recognized preventive measures. Over the past decade, a downward trend in health care-associated infections has occurred. A Survey of a total 12,299 patients in 199 hospitals showed that fewer patients had health care-associated infections in 2015 (394 patients [3.2%; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.9 to 3.5]) than in 2011 (452 [4.0%; 95% CI, 3.7 to 4.4]) (P < 0.001), largely owing to reductions in the prevalence of surgical-site and urinary tract infections.

### Assessment of hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and testing practices in the US, 2020-2022 [^8b52d780]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, we identified hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infections in 0.2% of all hospitalizations in our study period, which nearly doubled to 0.4% of all hospitalizations in peak months. The proportion of hospitalizations with hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection is comparable to point prevalence estimates of several other health care-associated infections, including urinary tract infections (0.3% of all patients) and bloodstream infections (0.4%).Preventing morbidity and mortality from health care-associated infections is a top priority for the US Department of Health and Human Services and is included among the objectives for Healthy People 2030.The frequency of hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infections emphasizes the need for continued surveillance and attention to infection prevention practices related to SARS-CoV-2 transmission within a hospital setting.

Hospital-level testing practices were associated with the observed rates of community-onset and hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infections. Hospital-level SARS-CoV-2 admission testing rates were positively associated with postadmission SARS-CoV-2 testing rates, even during periods of high community incidence, meaning that hospitals that were less likely to test at admission were also less likely to test for SARS-CoV-2 throughout the hospitalization stay. Hospitals with less frequent testing after admission may have had artificially lower observed hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection rates due to poor data capture because of undertesting. Multivariable adjusted models that excluded hospital-months with the lowest levels of admission testing and accounted for pandemic period and community-onset infection rates suggested that the highest levels of admission testing were associated with lower rates of hospital-onset SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may be because admission testing might minimize misclassification of community-onset cases as hospital-onset cases. Alternatively, admission testing might serve as an infection control strategy to prevent hospital-onset infections by identifying potentially contagious patients upon arrival. Additionally, high rates of admission testing could be a proxy indicator for more intense infection-control programs that include additional interventions to prevent hospital-onset cases, such as better adherence to universal masking, more attention to ventilation, and increased use of respirators for both health care worker protection and source control. Furthermore, comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection rates without accounting for variable testing density and practices between facilities and over time may be inappropriate.

### Prevalence and outcomes of infection among patients in intensive care units in 2017 [^d5c55355]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Infection is frequent among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Contemporary information about the types of infections, causative pathogens, and outcomes can aid the development of policies for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and resource allocation and may assist in the design of interventional studies.

Objective

To provide information about the prevalence and outcomes of infection and the available resources in ICUs worldwide.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Observational 24-hour point prevalence study with longitudinal follow-up at 1150 centers in 88 countries. All adult patients (aged ≥18 years) treated at a participating ICU during a 24-hour period commencing at 08:00 on September 13, 2017, were included. The final follow-up date was November 13, 2017.

Exposures

Infection diagnosis and receipt of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence of infection and antibiotic exposure (cross-sectional design) and all-cause in-hospital mortality (longitudinal design).

Results

Among 15 202 included patients (mean age, 61.1 years [SD, 17.3 years]; 9181 were men [60.4%]), infection data were available for 15 165 (99.8%); 8135 (54%) had suspected or proven infection, including 1760 (22%) with ICU-acquired infection. A total of 10 640 patients (70%) received at least 1 antibiotic. The proportion of patients with suspected or proven infection ranged from 43% (141/328) in Australasia to 60% (1892/3150) in Asia and the Middle East. Among the 8135 patients with suspected or proven infection, 5259 (65%) had at least 1 positive microbiological culture; gram-negative microorganisms were identified in 67% of these patients (n=3540), gram-positive microorganisms in 37% (n=1946), and fungal microorganisms in 16% (n=864). The in-hospital mortality rate was 30% (2404/7936) in patients with suspected or proven infection. In a multilevel analysis, ICU-acquired infection was independently associated with higher risk of mortality compared with community-acquired infection (odds ratio [OR], 1.32 [95% CI, 1.10-1.60]; P=.003). Among antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, infection with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (OR, 2.41 [95% CI, 1.43-4.06]; P=.001), Klebsiella resistant to β-lactam antibiotics, including third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems (OR, 1.29 [95% CI, 1.02-1.63]; P=.03), or carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter species (OR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.08-1.81]; P=.01) was independently associated with a higher risk of death vs infection with another microorganism.

Conclusions and Relevance

In a worldwide sample of patients admitted to ICUs in September 2017, the prevalence of suspected or proven infection was high, with a substantial risk of in-hospital mortality.

Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) to guide discontinuation of antibiotics in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)—evidence summary: A systematic review identified 3 studies, with evidence predominantly from VAP so recommendations for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) are mostly based on VAP studies. In one study of 81 intensive care unit patients with pulmonary infiltrates, patients were randomly assigned and standard therapy patients were more likely to receive ≥3 days of antibiotics (90% vs 28%; P = .0001), while the CPIS group had shorter antibiotic duration (3.0 days vs 9.8 days; P = .0001), lower cost ($259 vs $640; P = .0001), and fewer resistance/superinfections (14% vs 38%; RR, 0.36; 95% CI, .14–.89). In a second study of 289 VAP patients assigned to an antibiotic discontinuation policy versus conventional judgment, duration was reduced (6 days vs 8 days; P = .001) with no differences in mortality, ICU length of stay, development of resistance, or incidence of superinfections. An observational study of 102 VAP patients found shorter antibiotic duration (8.6 days vs 14.8 days; P < .001) and less recurrent VAP (7.7% vs 24%; RR, 0.32; 95% CI, .11–.93) following guideline implementation. Taken together, the evidence is inconsistent and the panel had low confidence due to inconsistency and indirectness.

P070 Incidence of developing repeated hospital acquired infection in intensive care unit; an emerging challenge in resource limited settings

E Shimber

Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, Hawassa, Ethiopia

Introduction: Repeated incidence of acquiring infection in Critical care unit of a hospital is one of the burdens for the countries’ health system. Despite various researches have been done regarding hospital acquired infections, developing repeated attack still needs further investigation. This research tries to magnify the threats and suggest a way forward.

Methods: A retrospective survey was conducted on all patients admitted to an ICU of Hawassa University Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from July 2018 to October 2018. Repeated ICU-acquired infections were defined as reinfection with different strain of organism or relapse of previous infection with the same pathogen during patient’s stay in ICU after being admitted for more than 48 hours and being treated for initial infection appropriately. Infection diagnosis was made based on Centers for Disease Control criteria. Multivariate analysis was used. Finally, ICU-mortality rate was tasted among patients who developed the repeated ICU-acquired infection.

Results: A total of ninety-four patients were admitted to ICU. The rate of developing ICU acquired infection was 22% with repeated rate of infection being 8.5%. Overall mortality rate was 44%. Out of these, patients with ICU acquired repeated infection took only 4% of the proportion. Those of who stayed more than two weeks develop repeated attack at a rate of 87.5%. All Patients were having indwelling device. 50 % of them had chronic co morbid medical disease. Duration of ICU stay and indwelling device use had positive association with a strong Pearson correlation of 1. Drug sensitivity test revealed around 62.5% of them have developed resistance or intermediate sensitivity for initial antibiotics of choice.

Conclusions: Despite the low rate of repeated infection, multi-drug resistance pattern is high. The research reveals the need for proper antibiotic stewardship and application of standard infection control measures in ICUs.

### Efficacy and safety of unrestricted visiting policy for critically ill patients: a meta-analysis [^045093a1]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of infections acquired in intensive care units (ICUs) is 2–5 times that in general wards. They complicate the regular hospitalization process, and are a major therapeutic issue that can compromise patients’ medical conditions (sometimes resulting in mortality), prolong treatment periods, and increase hospitalization costs. Ventilator‑associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSIs), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are the most frequent ICU‑acquired infections. The estimated rate of mortality attributable to VAP is approximately 10%, with higher mortality rates in surgical ICU patients and patients with mid‑range severity scores at admission. Restricted visiting policies (RVPs) may reduce the risk of infection in the vulnerable population of ICU patients. Most ICUs have RVPs that define the number of visitors, visiting times, and other factors based on a unified hospital management policy and their ICU’s characteristics. As more hospitals consider the benefits of family involvement in ICU holistic patient care, however, more ICUs are beginning to explore the advantages and disadvantages of adopting an unrestricted visiting policy (UVP). Growing evidence suggests that UVP implementation has positive effects on critical patient outcomes. Specifically, it can reduce the incidences of delirium, anxiety, and depression, and improve the satisfaction of patients and their families, without increasing the incidences of ICU-related infections or mortality. Internationally restrictions on visitation in adult ICUs are common, with wide variability of reported policies.

### Surveillance of healthcare-acquired infections in queensland, Australia: data and lessons from the first 5 years [^28fdc748]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To present healthcare-acquired infection surveillance data for 2001-2005 in Queensland, Australia.

Design

Observational prospective cohort study.

Setting

Twenty-three public hospitals in Queensland.

Methods

We used computer-assisted surveillance to identify episodes of surgical site infection (SSI) in surgical patients. The risk-adjusted incidence of SSI was calculated by means of a risk-adjustment score modified from that of the US National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, and the incidence of inpatient bloodstream infection (BSI) was adjusted for risk on the basis of hospital level (level 1, tertiary referral center; level 2, large general hospital; level 3, small general hospital). Funnel and Bayesian shrinkage plots were used for between-hospital comparisons.

Patients

A total of 49,804 surgical patients and 4,663 patients who experienced healthcare-associated BSI.

Results

The overall cumulative incidence of in-hospital SSI ranged from 0.28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-1.54%) for radical mastectomies to 6.15% (95% CI, 3.22%-10.50%) for femoropopliteal bypass procedures. The incidence of inpatient BSI was 0.80, 0.28, and 0.22 episodes per 1,000 occupied bed-days in level 1, 2, and 3 hospitals, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated microorganism for SSI and BSI. Funnel and shrinkage plots showed at least 1 hospital with a signal indicating a possible higher-than-expected rate of S. aureus-associated BSI.

Conclusions

Comparisons between hospitals should be viewed with caution because of imperfect risk adjustment. It is our view that the data should be used to improve healthcare-acquired infection control practices using evidence-based systems rather than to judge institutions.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^9acf3b46]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This manuscript brings to light an understudied, underrecognized, and underappreciated clinical challenge: the hospitalized patient with severe pneumonia who is not responding to initial treatment. Clinical studies are needed to bring more robust evidence and to hopefully identify different non-response phenotypes.

We propose a common criterion that spans from sCAP to HAP/VAP, identify the most relevant risk factors, and provide a clinical pathway to investigate these patients in a timely manner to facilitate optimizing care.

The decision-making process consists of two key-components: the comprehensive search for an accurate diagnosis and treatment modification as needed to match the revised diagnosis. The former will ensure that clinicians are not missing an important diagnosis responsible for the initial treatment failure, and the later will offer a concrete approach to make the treatment successful.

In summary, there is an urgent need for better data on the epidemiology of pneumonia non-responders and how best to optimize the therapeutic approach in order to secure the best outcomes for all patients.

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Among 17,819 patients who met enrollment criteria, 26.5% had nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, 25.6% vHAPB, and 47.9% ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia predominated in the Northeastern United States and in large urban teaching hospitals. Patients with nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia were oldest (mean 66.7 ± 15.1 yr) and most likely White (76.9%), whereas those with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia were youngest (59.7 ± 16.6 yr) and least likely White (70.3%). Ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia was associated with the highest comorbidity burden (mean Charlson score 4.1 ± 2.8) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia with the lowest (3.2 ± 2.5). Similarly, hospital mortality was highest among patients with ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (29.2%) and lowest in nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (11.7%), with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in-between (21.3%). Among survivors, 24.5% of nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia required a rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge, compared with 22.5% among ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and 18.8% ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Unadjusted hospital length of stay after infection onset was longest among ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and shortest among nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia patients. Median total hospital costs mirrored length of stay: ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia $77,657, ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia $62,464, and nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia $39,911.

Conclusions

Both hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia remain associated with significant mortality and cost in the United States. Our analyses confirm that of all three conditions, ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia carries the highest risk of death. In contrast, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia remains most costly. Nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia survivors were most likely to require a readmission within 30 days of discharge.

Infection of the lower respiratory tract is a potentially severe or life-threatening illness. Taking the right steps to recognize, identify, and treat pneumonia is critical to improving patient outcomes. An awareness of the diversity of potential infectious causes, the local endemic flora and resistance patterns, as well as testing strategies to differentiate causes of pneumonia is essential to providing the best patient outcomes. Understanding surveillance definitions allow intensivists to become partners in reducing hospital-associated infections and improving quality of care.

### Epidemiology of hospital-acquired infections in veterans with spinal cord injury and disorder [^6b31b01c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the epidemiology of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in veterans with spinal cord injury and disorder (SCI&D).

Design

Retrospective medical record review.

Setting

Midwestern Department of Veterans Affairs spinal cord injury center.

Participants

A total of 226 patients with SCI&D hospitalized at least once during a 2-year period (October 1, 2001, through September 30, 2003).

Results

A total of 549 hospitalizations were included in the analysis (mean duration of hospitalization, 33.7 days); an HAI occurred during 182 (33.2%) of these hospitalizations. A total of 657 HAIs occurred during 18,517 patient-days in the hospital (incidence rate, 35.5 HAIs per 1,000 patient-days). Almost half of the 226 patients had at least 1 HAI; the mean number of HAIs among these patients was 6.0 HAIs per patient. The most common HAIs were urinary tract infection (164 [25.0%] of the 657 HAIs; incidence rate, 8.9 cases per 1,000 patient-days), bloodstream infection (111 [16.9%]; incidence rate, 6.0 cases per 1,000 patient-days), and bone and joint infection (103 [15.7%]; incidence rate, 5.6 cases per 1,000 patient-days). The most common culture isolates were gram-positive bacteria (1,082 [45.6%] of 2,307 isolates), including Staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative bacteria (1,033 [43.6%] of isolates), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Multivariable regression demonstrated that predictors of HAI were longer length of hospital stay (P=.002), community-acquired infection (P=.007), and use of a urinary invasive device (P=.01) or respiratory invasive device (P=.04).

Conclusions

The overall incidence of HAIs in persons with SCI&D was higher than that reported for other populations, confirming the increased risk of HAI in persons with spinal cord injury. The increased risk associated with longer length of stay and with community-acquired infection suggests that strategies are needed to reduce the duration of hospitalization and to effectively treat community-acquired infection, to decrease infection rates. There is significant room for improvement in reducing the incidence of HAIs in this population.

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) prevention research questions focus on strategies to reduce CDI incidence, risk stratification, prophylaxis, and infection control. Topics include effectiveness of probiotics or biotherapeutics, antibiotic stewardship, and transmission prevention measures such as environmental management and isolation. The section asks about a core bundle usable across facilities, potential for vaccination and its composition/route, predictive systemic or mucosal serologic markers, secondary prevention in patients subsequently receiving antibiotics (including drugs, dosages, and duration), and the impact of admission screening for carriage with isolation of carriers on hospital-acquired CDI.

### Tardive dyskinesia-reversible and persistent (...) [^ed218ccb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

• Twenty-one hospitalized patients over 50 years of age who had tardive dyskinesia were studied for 13 months. After withdrawal of neuroleptics and antidepressants for three months, dyskinetic symptoms abated in 12 patients and persisted in nine. Discriminant function analysis showed that the persistent and reversible dyskinesia groups could be clearly separated and that the best discriminator was the number of drug-free intervals. The persistent dyskinesia group had had significantly longer neuroleptic treatment and a greater number of drug interruptions of at least two months' duration each than did the reversible dyskinesia group. Our finding, as well as the literature reviewed, does not support the commonly held notion that frequent lengthy interruptions of long-term drug treatment reduce the incidence of persistent dyskinesia, at least in patients who are otherwise predisposed to the development of tardive dyskinesia.

### Descriptive epidemiology and outcomes of nonventilated hospital-acquired, ventilated hospital-acquired, and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in the United States, 2012-2019 [^0aaceee7]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

Multiple randomized controlled trials exploring the outcomes of patients with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia have noted that hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia patients who require subsequent ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia suffered higher mortality than either those who did not (nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia) or had ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. We examined the epidemiology and outcomes of all three conditions in a large U.S. database.

DESIGN:

Retrospective cohort.

SETTING:

Two hundred fifty-three acute-care hospitals, United States, contributing data (including microbiology) to Premier database, 2012–2019.

PATIENTS:

Patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia identified based on a slightly modified previously published International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition/ International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition-Clinical Modification algorithm.

INTERVENTIONS:

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:

Among 17,819 patients who met enrollment criteria, 26.5% had nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, 25.6% vHAPB, and 47.9% ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia predominated in the Northeastern United States and in large urban teaching hospitals.

### Prospective surveillance of nosocomial viral infections during and after hospitalization at a university children's hospital [^72bf5de5]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In Switzerland 5% to 10% of hospitalized adults acquire nosocomial infections (NI) but few data are available in children. Most former studies on NI in hospitalized children analyzed specific units or pathogens and neglected the postdischarge period. We aimed to prospectively assess viral NI occurring during and shortly after hospitalization in children.

Methods

Prospective surveillance was performed during a 24-month period. Electronic standardized questionnaires were completed for each patient by physicians during hospital stay. On a ward-based rotational schedule, follow-up information was obtained from a subset of patients 1 week after hospital discharge. NI were defined using CDC recommendations.

Results

Overall, 6250 patients (34,608 patient hospitalization days, PHD) were enrolled and 1272 patients were recruited for postdischarge surveillance. Mean hospitalization duration was 5 days. Fifty-two (0.8%) patients acquired 54 viral NI during hospitalization and 12 patients (1.1%) acquired 12 viral NI after hospital discharge (NI incidence: 1.9 per 1000 PHD including follow-up period). NI rate in infants was higher compared with children >12 months old (2.0% vs. 0.8%; P 0.05) and the infant ward also had the highest incidence (4.0 NI per 1000 PHD). Most NI were gastrointestinal tract infections with 55% caused by rotavirus infection. NI rates were highest between November and March.

Conclusions

A significant part of NI will only be detected if surveillance includes the immediate postdischarge period. Given the strong seasonality of pediatric NI, intensifying hygiene measurements particularly on infant wards and prior to the cold season would be beneficial in reducing NI incidence.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis with a significant impact on healthcare management around the world, with the highest morbidity and mortality of all of the forms of community-acquired pneumonia. Patients with severe pneumonia usually require intensive care unit management, including vasopressors or mechanical ventilation. Early clinical suspicion and prompt empiric antimicrobial therapies are mandatory in patients with severe pneumonia. A number of recent studies and guidelines addressing these issues have been published, and they will be reviewed in this article.

### Recent advances in community-acquired pneumonia: inpatient and outpatient [^664f75a5]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness, with the majority of patients treated out of the hospital, yet the greatest burden of the cost of care comes from inpatient management. In the past several years, the management of these patients has advanced, with new information about the natural history and prognosis of illness, the utility of serum markers to guide management, the use of appropriate clinical tools to guide the site-of-care decision, and the finding that guidelines can be developed in a way that improves patient outcome. The challenges to patient management include the emergence of new pathogens and the progression of antibiotic resistance in some of the common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Few new antimicrobial treatment options are available, and the utility of some new therapies has been limited by drug-related toxicity. Ancillary care for severe pneumonia with activated protein C and corticosteroids is being studied, but recently, inpatient care has been most affected by the development of evidence-based "core measures" for management that have been promoted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which form the basis for the public reporting of hospital performance in CAP care.

### Changes in prevalence of health care-associated infections in U.S. hospitals [^4e8664a7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

A point-prevalence survey that was conducted in the United States in 2011 showed that 4% of hospitalized patients had a health care-associated infection. We repeated the survey in 2015 to assess changes in the prevalence of health care-associated infections during a period of national attention to the prevention of such infections.

Methods

At Emerging Infections Program sites in 10 states, we recruited up to 25 hospitals in each site area, prioritizing hospitals that had participated in the 2011 survey. Each hospital selected 1 day on which a random sample of patients was identified for assessment. Trained staff reviewed medical records using the 2011 definitions of health care-associated infections. We compared the percentages of patients with health care-associated infections and performed multivariable log-binomial regression modeling to evaluate the association of survey year with the risk of health care-associated infections.

Results

In 2015, a total of 12,299 patients in 199 hospitals were surveyed, as compared with 11,282 patients in 183 hospitals in 2011. Fewer patients had health care-associated infections in 2015 (394 patients [3.2%; 95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.9 to 3.5]) than in 2011 (452 [4.0%; 95% CI, 3.7 to 4.4]) (P<0.001), largely owing to reductions in the prevalence of surgical-site and urinary tract infections. Pneumonia, gastrointestinal infections (most of which were due to Clostridium difficile [now Clostridioides difficile]), and surgical-site infections were the most common health care-associated infections. Patients' risk of having a health care-associated infection was 16% lower in 2015 than in 2011 (risk ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.95; P=0.005), after adjustment for age, presence of devices, days from admission to survey, and status of being in a large hospital.

Conclusions

The prevalence of health care-associated infections was lower in 2015 than in 2011. To continue to make progress in the prevention of such infections, prevention strategies against C. difficile infection and pneumonia should be augmented.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^a7aefc5a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2016 aspergillosis guidelines—surveillance and nosocomial detection—state that leukemia and transplant centers should perform regular surveillance of cases of invasive mold infection, and an increase in incidence over baseline or the occurrence of invasive mold infections in patients who are not at high risk for such infections should prompt evaluation for a hospital source (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). As a quality control measure, leukemia and transplant centers should perform regular surveillance (eg, every 3 months) documenting the number of invasive mold infections within their institution. In the absence of an outbreak with an identified environmental source or molecular analysis that demonstrates clustering of fungal isolates, it is not possible to reliably distinguish community-acquired from nosocomial aspergillosis, and cases of invasive mold disease with onset of symptoms ≥7 days after hospital admission are more likely to be nosocomial. Environmental surveillance can provide important insight about sources of aspergillosis, including the spread of azole-resistant strains, but in the absence of an outbreak, there is insufficient evidence that environmental sampling of fungal spores is of value.

### Blood cultures for community-acquired pneumonia: are they worthy of two quality measures? A systematic review [^3a1d9525]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Obtaining blood cultures (BCs) for patients hospitalized with community-acquired-pneumonia (CAP) has been recommended by experts and used as a measure of quality of care. However, BCs are infrequently positive in these patients and their effect on clinical management has been questioned.

Purpose

We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the impact of BCs on clinical management in CAP requiring hospitalization and thus its appropriateness as a quality measure.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, and the Cochrane databases for English-language studies that reported the effect of BCs on management of adults hospitalized with CAP. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and background articles and asked experts to review our list for completeness.

Study Selection

Studies were chosen if they included adults admitted to the hospital with CAP, BCs were obtained at admission, and BC-directed management changes were reported.

Data Extraction

We abstracted study design, BC positivity, and frequency of BC-directed management changes.

Data Synthesis

Fifteen studies, all with observational cohort design, were identified and reviewed. Two included only patients with BCs positive for pneumococcus, yielding 13 studies for the primary analysis. BCs were true-positive in 0% to 14% of cases. They led to antibiotic narrowing in 0% to 3% of patients and to antibiotic broadening ultimately associated with a resistant organism in 0% to 1% of patients.

Conclusions

BCs have very limited utility in immunocompetent patients hospitalized with CAP. Pneumonia quality measures that include BCs should be reassessed.

### Hospital acquired infections in surgical patients: impact of COVID-19-related infection prevention measures [^5e983714]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

There are studies reporting the effect of enhanced IPC measures on HAI in hospital populations overall, rather than just surgical patients, with variable impact on HAI and MDRO. A Taiwanese study conducted in a low COVID-19 environment found no overall change in incidence density (incidence per 1000 patient days) of HAI. Although there was a reduction in incidence of Vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), no change in incidence was found for MRSA. A study from a 1,785-bed hospital in Singapore found a decrease in hospital-acquired respiratory viral illnesses as well as decreased MRSA acquisition rates despite increased usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, this study was performed in a moderately high COVID-19 environment without adjustments for patient demographics and other potentially confounding variables.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^a6327a2f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Intensive care unit candidemia prevention—prophylaxis thresholds and chlorhexidine bathing: For ICUs that show very high rates of invasive candidiasis, in excess of the expected rates of <5% of patients, antifungal prophylaxis may be warranted in selected patients who are at high risk. A Cochrane analysis noted that the number needed to treat to prevent one case of invasive candidiasis in the ICU setting varied from 9 in high-risk patients to 188 in low-risk patients. Daily bathing of ICU (intensive care unit) patients with chlorhexidine, which has been shown to decrease the incidence of bloodstream infections including candidemia, could be considered (weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Supporting data indicate that several multicenter randomized clinical trials have shown that daily chlorhexidine bathing decreases the incidence of both catheter-associated and non-catheter-associated hospital-acquired bloodstream infections; at least one trial found a significant reduction in catheter-associated bloodstream infections due to Candida species, and among 12 studies performed in an ICU setting only one was a randomized controlled trial, with the conclusion that chlorhexidine bathing reduced the incidence of bloodstream infections.

### Impact of contact and droplet precautions on the incidence of hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection [^f0fd58f5]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of contact and droplet precautions in reducing the incidence of hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections.

Design

Before-after study.Setting. A 439-bed, university-affiliated community hospital.

Methods

To identify inpatients infected or colonized with MRSA, we conducted surveillance of S. aureus isolates recovered from clinical culture and processed by the hospital's clinical microbiology laboratory. We then reviewed patient records for all individuals from whom MRSA was recovered. The rates of hospital-acquired MRSA infection were tabulated for each area where patients received nursing care. After a baseline period, contact and droplet precautions were implemented in all intensive care units (ICUs). Reductions in the incidence of hospital-acquired MRSA infection in ICUs led to the implementation of contact precautions in non-ICU patient care areas (hereafter, "non-ICU areas"), as well. Droplet precautions were discontinued. An analysis comparing the rates of hospital-acquired MRSA infection during different intervention periods was performed.

Results

The combined baseline rate of hospital-acquired MRSA infection was 10.0 infections per 1,000 patient-days in the medical ICU (MICU) and surgical ICU (SICU) and 0.7 infections per 1,000 patient-days in other ICUs. Following the implementation of contact and droplet precautions, combined rates of hospital-acquired MRSA infection in the MICU and SICU decreased to 4.3 infections per 1,000 patient-days (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.97; P=.03). There was no significant change in hospital-acquired MRSA infection rates in other ICUs. After the discontinuation of droplet precautions, the combined rate in the MICU and SICU decreased further to 2.5 infections per 1,000 patient-days. This finding was not significant (P=.43). In the non-ICU areas that had a high incidence of hospital-acquired MRSA infection, the rate prior to implementation of contact precautions was 1.3 infections per 1,000 patient-days. After the implementation of contact precautions, the rate in these areas decreased to 0.9 infections per 1,000 patient-days (95% CI, 0.47-0.94; P=.02).

Conclusion

The implementation of contact precautions significantly decreased the rate of hospital-acquired MRSA infection, and discontinuation of droplet precautions in the ICUs led to a further reduction. Additional studies evaluating specific infection control strategies are needed.

Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) scope decision—panel rationale and conclusion: The panel notes that patients with HCAP were thought to be at high risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms due to healthcare contact, but reports that the rationales for including HCAP with the hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) recommendations have come into question, with increasing evidence that many HCAP patients are not at high risk for MDR pathogens and that underlying patient characteristics are also important independent determinants of risk. Consequently, the panel unanimously decided that HCAP should not be included in the HAP/VAP guidelines, anticipating that recommendations for community-dwelling patients would likely be based on validated risk factors for MDR pathogens and not solely on previous healthcare contact.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^0967dbb5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is a frequent cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is the most common infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions. It takes 48-72h for most patients to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Non-response is typically defined as the persistence/worsening of clinical signs—such as fever, respiratory distress, impaired oxygenation and/or radiographic abnormalities—with rates ranging 20–30%. Several factors can contribute to non-response. Host factors, including immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or ongoing aspiration, may impair resolution. Additionally, incorrect antibiotic dosing, atypical or resistant pathogens (such as multidrug-resistant bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or fungal infections) may be responsible, requiring alternative antimicrobial strategies. A septic complication related to pneumonia (e.g. empyema) or not (e.g. acalculous cholecystitis) may need to be excluded. Finally, non-infectious conditions (e.g. pulmonary embolism, malignancy, secondary ARDS or vasculitis) that can mimic or potentiate pneumonia must be considered. Although non-responding pneumonia is frequent, its management lacks strong evidence, and its approach is based mostly on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. Clinicians should continuously reassess the medical history and physical exam, review microbiological data, and consider imaging such as chest CT. Bronchoscopy or repeat sputum sampling may aid in identifying alternative pathogens or non-infectious causes. The management of a non-responding pneumonia depends on the findings of a structured reassessment. Herein, we provide guidance on how to identify and manage non-responding pneumonia. Ultimately, addressing pneumonia that does not respond to antibiotics is crucial for preventing complications, optimizing antimicrobial stewardship, and improving patient outcomes.

### Mortality attributable to hospital-acquired infections among surgical patients [^41d29afa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2008). Low credibility.

We performed a multicenter prospective matched cohort study to evaluate the mortality attributable to hospital-acquired infections among 12,791 patients admitted to surgical departments. We were able to match 731 patients with 1 or more hospital-acquired infections (ie, case patients) with 731 patients without a hospital-acquired infection (ie, control patients) at a 1:1 ratio. Of the 731 case patients, 42 (5.7%) died; of the 731 control patients, 23 (3.1%) died--a significant difference of 2.6%.

Recommendation strength interpretation—strong versus weak (conditional): For a strong recommendation, most individuals should receive the intervention and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. For a weak (conditional) recommendation, recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^b955397d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-associated events (VAE), and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP) are detrimental to patients and increase costs. The attributable mortality of VAP is estimated to be ~10% but varies considerably by type and severity of underlying illness. VAP and VAE extend duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, prolong intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and increase mortality risk, and they are also associated with greater use of antimicrobials and higher costs. Patients with VAEs are ~50% more likely to die compared to similar patients with VAP, and NV-HAP is associated with a doubling of the length of time until discharge and substantially higher mortality rates compared to similar patients without NV-HAP.

### Pneumonia in hospitalized children [^f942e5e2]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common infections in the pediatric age group and one of the leading diagnoses that results in overnight hospital admission for children. Various micro-organisms can cause pneumonia, and etiologies differ by age. Clinical manifestations vary, and diagnostic testing is frequently not standardized. Hospital management should emphasize timely diagnosis and prompt initiation of antimicrobial therapy when appropriate. Issues of particular relevance to inpatient management are emphasized in this article.

### Which patients with lower respiratory tract infections need inpatient treatment? Perceptions of physicians, nurses, patients and relatives [^a35cf2b5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), including community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute bronchitis and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ECOPD) are the most prevalent, the most frequently fatal and the most expensive infectious diseases in western countries [-]. Inpatient management is approximately 8 to 20 times more expensive than outpatient treatment, but is preferred by many patients and physicians [-]. Hence, safely reducing the number of inpatient days and encouraging outpatient treatment improves the quality of care and is cost-effective. Current guidelines recommend to hospitalize patients with an increased risk for adverse medical outcome and to discharge patients as soon as clinical stabilization is documented [-]. For this purpose, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) is a well validated prediction tool based on age and medical factors to identify patients at low risk for 30-day mortality and thus suitable for outpatient management. However, despite recommendation of this prediction tool by professional organizations, in daily practice low risk patients are often treated as inpatients. Obviously, other factors than evidence-based medical parameters embedded in the PSI - such as nursing and organizational factors, preferences and beliefs of patients and their relatives - strongly influence the rate of hospital admissions and the duration of hospital stays. Smaller, previous studies have shown that patients' and relatives' preferences for site of care are important and are influenced by beliefs about safety (fear of rapid deterioration at home or acquiring an infection in hospital), family burden, access to support, or confidence in home-care services [-]. Still, the complex interplay of different perceptions towards outpatient management and the impact on site-of-care decisions and length of hospital stay remains largely unknown.

To better understand perceptions of physicians, nurses, patients and relatives about the need for inpatient management of different types and severities of LRTIs, we conducted a prospective survey in patients enrolled in the multi-center ProHOSP trial about the perceived necessity for inpatient management and necessary length of hospital stay.

### Changes in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient characteristics and resource use in a system of community hospitals in the United States [^d656edd9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there are observable changes in the patient population affected, hospitalization and resource use, and mortality rate. Using data from COVID-19 patients admitted to community hospitals across the United States during nonsurge conditions, we showed that although patient age and other characteristics changed over time, outcomes are improving for all patients. This finding suggests that knowledge gained from early experiences with this disease is allowing providers to better care for patients with COVID-19.

### Comprehensive risk assessment for hospital-acquired pneumonia: sociodemographic, clinical, and hospital environmental factors associated with the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia [^4e76ced0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In this study, the incidence of HAP in tertiary hospitals was 3.5%, whereas that in general hospitals was 5.7%. Similarly, the incidence of HAP in hospitals in Seoul was 4.2%; however, the incidence of HAP in the province was 6.1%. This difference could be due to differences in health resource access and quality of patient care. Tertiary hospitals would have a better hygiene environment and better trained healthcare professionals associated with better quality care than those of general hospitals. Additionally, the bed-to-nurse ratio, which is one of the quality indicators for nursing care, was associated with the incidence of HAP. Patients who stayed in hospitals with grade 4 and 5 bed-to-nurse ratios had a 1.4-fold higher risk of HAP than those in the hospital with a grade 1 bed-to-nurse ratio. According to the literature, nursing quality and time have a direct impact on patient outcomes and the incidence of hospital-acquired infection. A study found that a higher proportion of total hours of nursing care provided by registered nurses was 0.59 times lower than the incidence of HAP in medical patients. Nurses would be able to spend more time and effort with fewer patients when they had to care less patients.

### BTS clinical statement on aspiration pneumonia [^30f5d82f]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hospital-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to patients with aspiration pneumonia (maintenance of oral health), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to perform oral examination in all hospitalized patients at risk of aspiration pneumonia or with suspected aspiration pneumonia, and at least weekly in care home residents, checking for infection (such as candidiasis), quality of dentition, food residue, and cleanliness of mucosal surfaces. Treat any abnormalities.

### Hospitalized infections in giant cell arteritis: a population-based retrospective cohort study [^1ec3ae80]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the occurrence of infections requiring or acquired during hospitalization in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed a population-based incidence cohort of patients with GCA diagnosed between 1950 and 2009 and compared this cohort with a non-GCA one matched for age, sex, and calendar year from the same population.

Results

We identified 245 patients in the GCA cohort and 245 patients in the non-GCA cohort. Seventy-four GCA subjects (134 episodes) and 79 non-GCA (153 episodes) had infections requiring or acquired during hospitalization [rate ratio (RR) 0.94; 95% CI 0.74, 1.18]. Sixty-seven subjects (107 episodes) in the GCA cohort and 63 subjects (110 episodes) in non-GCA cohort required hospitalization secondary to an infection (RR 1.04; CI 0.80, 1.36). Pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTI), skin and soft tissue infections accounted for the majority of infections requiring hospitalization and had similar occurrence in both cohorts. UTI accounted for the majority of infections requiring hospitalization in the first 6 months after GCA incidence (RR 3.93; CI 0.85, 56.52). No difference between the 2 cohorts was noted in overall infections acquired during hospitalization (RR 0.68; CI 0.41, 1.08).

Conclusion

There is no overall increased risk of infections requiring or acquired during hospitalization in patients with GCA who are taking glucocorticoid therapy. There may be an increased risk of infections requiring hospitalization, especially of the urinary tract, in the first 6 months after GCA incidence, although this did not achieve statistical significance in our study.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: a practical approach to management for the hospitalist [^33eae90e]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is common, and inpatient physicians should be familiar with the most current evidence about and guidelines for CAP management. Our conclusions and recommendations include: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common identified cause of CAP requiring hospitalization, whereas Legionella pneumophila is a common cause of severe CAP. The chest radiograph remains an essential initial test in the diagnosis of CAP and should be supplemented by blood cultures sampled prior to antibiotic therapy and sputum for gram stain and culture if a high-quality specimen can be rapidly processed. Once the diagnosis is made, the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) should be used to optimize the location of treatment and to provide prognostic information. Absent other mitigating factors, patients in PSI risk classes I, II, and III can safely be treated as outpatients. Hospitalized patients with CAP should be treated promptly with empiric antibiotics. Nonsevere pneumonia should be treated with a parenteral beta-lactam plus either doxycycline or a macrolide. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit should be treated with a beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone as well as be evaluated for pseudomonal risk factors. Most patients with nonsevere CAP reach clinical stability in 2-3 days and should be considered for a switch to oral therapy and discharge shortly thereafter. Patients should receive pneumococcal vaccination, influenza vaccination, and tobacco cessation counseling prior to discharge if eligible. Multiple quality indicators are measured and publicly reported in the management of CAP, which provides hospitals with an opportunity to improve care processes and patient outcomes.

### Pneumonia in adults: the practical emergency department perspective [^5ac7de9c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

In those patients who are hospitalized with pneumonia, mortality is 15%. Close to 90% of deaths attributed to pneumonia are in patients older than 65 years. This article provides the emergency physician with an understanding of how to make the diagnosis, initiate early and appropriate antibiotic therapy, risk stratify patients with respect to the severity of illness, and recognize indications for admission. The discussion is balanced with an emphasis on cost-effective management, an understanding of the changing spectrum of pathogenesis, and a cognizance toward variable and less common presentations.
