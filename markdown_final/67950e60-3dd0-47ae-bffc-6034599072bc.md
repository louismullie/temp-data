## Question

Can hydroxyzine be used concurrently with Risperdal and lithium?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydroxyzine can be used concurrently with risperidone (Risperdal) and lithium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and core adverse effect profiles of each agent. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions, especially around CNS depression and QT prolongation. Next, I will assess rare but serious syndromes reported with lithium plus antipsychotics. After that, I should outline patient-specific risk factors and a monitoring plan. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable recommendation with dose and counseling considerations.

> Let me first confirm the key properties and risks of each medication. Hydroxyzine is a first-generation antihistamine with anxiolytic, sedative properties and clear cautions for CNS depression and postmarketing reports of QT prolongation/TdP, especially in those with cardiac or electrolyte risk factors [^113NsSyY]. Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic with primary CNS effects, potential hypotension, and recognized cardiac risk considerations across the class, including QTc prolongation in some agents; labels advise caution when combined with other centrally acting drugs [^1122kRKf] [^115q4rEg]. Lithium is a renally cleared mood stabilizer with a narrow therapeutic index and potential cardiac effects (e.g. T-wave changes), requiring routine serum level monitoring for safety [^116SffNV] [^115q4rEg].

> I should confirm pharmacokinetic interactions next. Hold on, I should verify whether risperidone affects lithium exposure. The risperidone label states repeated oral doses did not affect lithium AUC or Cmax; dose adjustment for lithium is not recommended, and this is corroborated across multiple risperidone formulations relying on oral data, supporting no clinically meaningful PK interaction between risperidone and lithium [^1122kRKf] [^115C7kTb] [^1143DEnA]. For hydroxyzine, there is no signal of it altering lithium renal clearance or competing for risperidone's major CYP pathways in a way that necessitates routine dose changes, although hydroxyzine's labeling focuses more on pharmacodynamic cautions than on specific CYP interactions, aligning with its typical use profile [^113NsSyY].

> Now, pharmacodynamics: Wait, let me verify the additive CNS and cardiac effects. Hydroxyzine and risperidone both cause CNS depression, so concomitant use can increase sedation, psychomotor impairment, and hypotension risk, with risperidone's label advising caution with centrally acting drugs and hydroxyzine's label warning to avoid other CNS depressants or alcohol and to counsel on driving impairment [^1122kRKf] [^113NsSyY]. Hmm, wait a minute — at first glance I thought hydroxyzine's cardiac risk might be minimal, but postmarketing data clearly report QT prolongation and TdP, making additive QT risk with antipsychotics a meaningful concern in susceptible patients, especially with other risk factors or QT-prolonging co-meds [^113NsSyY] [^115q4rEg].

> But wait, what about rare syndromes when combining lithium with antipsychotics? I need to check whether encephalopathic or NMS-like reactions have been described. While the clearest FDA labeling signal comes from phenothiazines, an encephalopathic syndrome (overlapping with NMS features) has been reported with lithium plus antipsychotics, prompting close neurologic monitoring whenever such combinations are used, and this caution reasonably extends to risperidone co-therapy with lithium despite the differing antipsychotic class [^1141B9w2]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — this reaction is rare, but I should emphasize vigilance for rigidity, fever, autonomic instability, and altered mental status with any lithium–antipsychotic regimen [^1141B9w2].

> Next, I will examine patient factors that heighten risk with the triple combination. High-risk features include baseline cardiac disease, bradyarrhythmias, recent MI, electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia/hypomagnesemia), concomitant QT-prolonging drugs, advanced age (falls, orthostasis), and renal impairment, where hydroxyzine dosing should be reduced for CrCl < 50 mL/min to mitigate accumulation and sedation burden [^113NsSyY] [^115q4rEg] [^116nC3Bh]. I need to ensure we also factor in polypharmacy and phenoconversion risks that can unpredictably shift exposure and tolerability when multiple agents are layered, warranting conservative dosing and reassessment when new drugs are added [^112WFCB7].

> Let me outline a monitoring plan to manage foreseeable risks. I should confirm that baseline and periodic ECGs are appropriate when combining a QT-risk agent (hydroxyzine) with an antipsychotic, especially in patients with cardiac or electrolyte risk factors, alongside correction of K+ and Mg2+ abnormalities before and during therapy [^113NsSyY] [^115q4rEg]. I need to check that lithium monitoring proceeds per standard practice: trough levels at steady state, after dose changes, and periodically thereafter, recognizing toxicity is closely tied to serum levels and clinical status, particularly if dehydration, renal changes, or intercurrent illness occur [^116SffNV]. Routine vitals with orthostatic blood pressures, assessment of daytime sedation and falls, and counseling to avoid alcohol and other CNS depressants are also necessary given additive CNS effects [^1122kRKf] [^113NsSyY].

> For dosing and mitigation strategies, I should double-check whether "lowest effective dose" principles apply across the board. Using the minimal effective hydroxyzine dose, preferentially scheduled at bedtime to reduce daytime impairment, and renally reducing by 50% when CrCl < 50 mL/min are prudent steps; keep risperidone and lithium at the lowest doses that sustain symptom control and avoid adding other QT-prolonging or sedating agents when possible [^116nC3Bh] [^1122kRKf]. Let me reconsider the role of risperidone with lithium: adjunctive antipsychotic plus mood stabilizer is an evidence-based approach for acute mania and maintenance in selected patients, supporting the safety of that pair under monitoring, which helps isolate hydroxyzine as the main "third drug" risk driver here [^113CYxbC] [^1145zQsf] [^111i2q4o].

> I will now synthesize the risk–benefit. Conclusion: Yes, hydroxyzine can be used concurrently with risperidone and lithium when clinically indicated, but the combination requires significant caution due to additive CNS depression, orthostasis, and a potentially additive QT-prolongation signal — risks that increase with patient factors and co-meds; there is no clinically meaningful PK interaction between risperidone and lithium, and no clear PK interaction mandate involving hydroxyzine, so the primary concern is pharmacodynamic and patient selection/monitoring dependent [^1122kRKf] [^115C7kTb] [^113NsSyY]. I should confirm that alternatives with less sedation/QT liability (or nonpharmacologic strategies for anxiety/insomnia) are considered first in high-risk patients, reserving hydroxyzine for short-term or targeted use with close follow-up and ECG/electrolyte oversight when risk factors are present [^113NsSyY] [^115q4rEg].

> Practical checklist to proceed safely: 1) Screen for cardiac history, baseline ECG, and electrolytes; 2) Review the full med list for QT-prolonging and sedative co-meds and deprescribe when possible; 3) Start hydroxyzine low, favor bedtime dosing, and renally adjust; 4) Educate on drowsiness, driving impairment, and avoiding alcohol/CNS depressants; 5) Continue lithium level monitoring and watch for signs of neurologic toxicity/NMS-like features; 6) Reassess benefit–risk within days to weeks, with ECG repetition if symptoms (palpitations, syncope) or dose changes occur [^113NsSyY] [^116SffNV] [^1122kRKf]. Hold on, I should verify one last time — if new serotonergic or CYP2D6-inhibiting agents are introduced (e.g., paroxetine/fluoxetine), risperidone exposure can rise, which could indirectly increase sedation or QT risk, reinforcing the need for ongoing medication reconciliation and dose reevaluation under this triple regimen [^111YvpQq] [^112kFoaX].

---

Yes, hydroxyzine can be coadministered with risperidone and lithium, but requires **cautious monitoring** for additive sedation [^113NsSyY], QT prolongation [^115q4rEg], and neurotoxicity. Although there are **no direct pharmacokinetic interactions** [^1122kRKf], the combination increases the risk of CNS depression [^113NsSyY], cardiac arrhythmias, and rare lithium–antipsychotic neurotoxicity [^1141B9w2]. Use the lowest effective doses, monitor ECG and electrolytes [^113NsSyY], and watch for neurologic symptoms.

## Pharmacological considerations

### Pharmacokinetic interactions

- **Hydroxyzine and risperidone**: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction; hydroxyzine is not a CYP inhibitor/inducer, and risperidone is a weak CYP2D6 inhibitor.

- **Hydroxyzine and lithium**: No known pharmacokinetic interaction; hydroxyzine does not affect lithium clearance.

- **Risperidone and lithium**: No significant pharmacokinetic interaction; risperidone does not alter lithium exposure or peak levels [^1122kRKf] [^115C7kTb].

---

### Pharmacodynamic interactions

- **CNS depression**: Hydroxyzine and risperidone both cause sedation [^113NsSyY]; combined use increases CNS depression and impairment risk [^112y8GBn].

- **QT prolongation**: Hydroxyzine and risperidone can prolong QT [^115q4rEg]; combined use increases arrhythmia risk, especially with other risk factors [^113NsSyY].

- **Neurotoxicity**: Lithium plus antipsychotics can cause rare encephalopathic syndromes (weakness, lethargy, tremor, confusion, EPS, leukocytosis, elevated enzymes) that may be irreversible; monitor closely and stop if signs appear [^1141B9w2].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Evidence and guidelines indicate that risperidone plus lithium is **effective for acute mania and maintenance** in bipolar disorder [^113CYxbC] [^111i2q4o] [^1145zQsf] [^1124XbHA]. Hydroxyzine is used for **anxiety, pruritus, and sedation** [^113xd2R8]; use caution when it is combined with CNS depressants or other QT-prolonging drugs [^113NsSyY]. Guidelines support risperidone with lithium for acute mania [^111i2q4o], whereas **hydroxyzine is not specifically addressed** and should be used cautiously because of sedation and QT risk [^113NsSyY] [^1122kRKf].

## Potential risks and adverse effects

| **Adverse effect** | **Hydroxyzine** | **Risperidone** | **Lithium** | **Combined risk** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Sedation | Yes [^113NsSyY] | Yes [^112y8GBn] | No | Increased |
| QT prolongation | Yes [^113NsSyY] | Yes [^115q4rEg] | No | Increased |
| Neurotoxicity | No | Rare [^1141B9w2] | Yes [^116SffNV] | Increased |
| Extrapyramidal symptoms | No | Yes [^112y8GBn] | No | Increased |
| Hyperprolactinemia | No | Yes [^114PPDwg] | No | Increased |
| Metabolic syndrome | No | Yes [^112yUEVY] | No | Increased |
| Lithium toxicity | No | No | Yes [^116SffNV] | Increased |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain ECG [^113NsSyY], electrolytes, renal and thyroid function, and lithium level [^116SffNV] before starting combination therapy.

- **Dose adjustments**: Use the lowest effective doses; reduce hydroxyzine if sedation occurs [^113NsSyY].

- **Regular monitoring**: Check lithium levels [^116SffNV], renal and thyroid function, and ECG periodically [^113NsSyY]; monitor for neurotoxicity and QT prolongation [^115q4rEg].

- **Patient education**: Counsel on sedation, arrhythmia, and neurotoxicity symptoms [^1141B9w2]; advise against alcohol and other CNS depressants [^113NsSyY].

---

## Clinical scenarios and patient populations

In clinical practice, **Appropriate use** includes considering this approach for severe anxiety or pruritus requiring sedation [^113NsSyY], with careful monitoring [^1124XbHA]. Caution or avoidance is advised for patients with **QT risk factors [^113NsSyY], renal impairment [^116nC3Bh], or a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome** [^113K229s].

---

Hydroxyzine may be combined with risperidone and lithium when clinically indicated, but requires **careful monitoring** for sedation, QT prolongation, and neurotoxicity. Use the lowest effective doses, monitor ECG and electrolytes, and educate patients about warning symptoms.

### Hydroxyzine pamoate [^113NsSyY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Precautions**: The potentiating action of hydroxyzine must be considered when the drug is used in conjunction with central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as narcotics, non-narcotic analgesics, and barbiturates. Therefore, when CNS depressants are administered concomitantly with hydroxyzine, their dosage should be reduced. Since drowsiness may occur with the use of the drug, patients should be warned of this possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery while taking hydroxyzine pamoate. Patients should be advised against the simultaneous use of other CNS depressant drugs and cautioned that the effect of alcohol may be increased.

- **QT prolongation/Torsade de Pointes (TdP)**: Cases of QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes have been reported during postmarketing use of hydroxyzine. The majority of reports occurred in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation/TdP, such as pre-existing heart disease, electrolyte imbalances, or concomitant arrhythmogenic drug use. Therefore, hydroxyzine should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, a family history of long QT syndrome, other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, as well as recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, and bradyarrhythmias.

Caution is recommended during the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval. These include Class 1A (e.g. quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, and certain antipsychotics.

### Prochlorperazine edisylate [^1141B9w2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

An encephalopathic syndrome, characterized by weakness, lethargy, fever, tremulousness, and confusion, coupled with extrapyramidal symptoms, leukocytosis, elevated serum enzymes, BUN, and FBS, has been observed in a few patients treated with both lithium and an antipsychotic. In some cases, the syndrome was followed by irreversible brain damage. Due to a possible causal relationship between these events and the concurrent administration of lithium and antipsychotics, patients on combined therapy should be closely monitored for early signs of neurologic toxicity. Treatment should be promptly discontinued if such signs appear. This encephalopathic syndrome may be similar to or the same as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

Patients with bone marrow depression or those who have previously demonstrated a hypersensitivity reaction, such as blood dyscrasias or jaundice, to a phenothiazine should not receive any phenothiazine, including prochlorperazine, unless the physician determines that the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the possible risks.

Prochlorperazine may impair mental and/or physical abilities, particularly during the first few days of therapy. Patients should be cautioned regarding activities that require alertness, such as operating vehicles or machinery.

Phenothiazines may intensify or prolong the effects of central nervous system depressants, including alcohol, anesthetics, and narcotics.

- **Pregnancy**: Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms.

### Risperdal [^1122kRKf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Pharmacokinetic-related interactions**: The dose of Risperdal should be adjusted when used in combination with CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine, and paroxetine) and enzyme inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) [see Table 18 and Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Dose adjustment is not recommended for Risperdal when co-administered with ranitidine, cimetidine, amitriptyline, or erythromycin [see Table 18].

- **Effect of risperidone on other drugs**:
	- **Lithium**: Repeated oral doses of Risperdal (3 mg twice daily) did not affect the exposure (AUC) or peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of lithium (n = 13). Dose adjustment for lithium is not recommended.
	- **Valproate**: Repeated oral doses of Risperdal (4 mg once daily) did not affect the pre-dose or average plasma concentrations and exposure (AUC) of valproate (1000 mg/day in three divided doses) compared to placebo (n = 21). However, there was a 20% increase in valproate peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after concomitant administration of Risperdal. Dose adjustment for valproate is not recommended.
	- **Digoxin**: Risperdal (0.25 mg twice daily) did not show a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Dose adjustment for digoxin is not recommended.

- **Pharmacodynamic-related interactions**:
	- **Centrally acting drugs and alcohol**: Given the primary CNS effects of risperidone, caution should be used when Risperdal is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.
	- **Drugs with hypotensive effects**: Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, Risperdal may enhance the hypotensive effects of other therapeutic agents.

### High dose antipsychotic polypharmacy and dopamine partial agonists - time to rethink guidelines [^117FpApx]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

Combination of two antipsychotic agents in this way may exceed the high dose threshold. Such cumulative doses are perceived as high risk and understandably may require explicit justification for their prescription. The British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines indicate that antipsychotic augmentation to address inadequate symptom response should only be considered after other treatment options have been exhausted, including "several, adequate, sequential trials of antipsychotic monotherapy". This both reflects and guides UK practice where switching is generally preferred to augmentation with another antipsychotic drug, despite the acknowledged paucity of supportive evidence. This often means that drug combinations are avoided, with alternative, but perhaps sub-optimal, strategies being employed.

The pharmacological basis for this high dose risk is clear; additional blockade of D2 receptors above what is necessary for an antipsychotic response will increase the liability for dopaminergic side effects such as EPS and prolactin secretion without increasing efficacy. Furthermore, depending on the particular drugs being combined, other receptor-mediated side effects are likely to increase, some of which, such as metabolic effects and QT prolongation, may contribute to increased mortality. However, this pharmacological argument does not consistently hold up for the combination of partial agonists with antagonists. In terms of the main antipsychotic mechanism, drug action at the dopamine D2 receptor, the dopamine D2 partial agonists should be considered in this context.

### Chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for schizophrenia [^113N2YfU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

The efficacy of chlorpromazine, a benchmark antipsychotic, has not been fully assessed in direct comparison with different individual antipsychotics. Penfluridol is another old antipsychotic with a long half-life, so one oral dose may last up to one week. This could confer an advantage.

- **Objectives**: To assess the clinical effects of chlorpromazine compared with penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: On 31 March 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for the inclusion of records in the register.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomised clinical trials focusing on chlorpromazine versus penfluridol for adults with schizophrenia or related disorders. Outcomes of interest were death, service utilisation, global state, mental state, adverse effects, and leaving the study early. We included trials meeting our selection criteria and reporting usable data.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we planned to estimate the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.

### SPL drug information for hydroxyzine pamoate [^113xd2R8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Hydroxyzine pamoate, also known as Vistaril, is a medication used for its antihistamine and anxiolytic properties. It is commonly prescribed to alleviate symptoms of anxiety, pruritus, and as a preoperative sedative. Hydroxyzine works by blocking histamine receptors in the body, thus reducing allergic reactions and helping to calm the central nervous system.

### Rykindo extended-release microspheres [^1143DEnA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, can increase the plasma concentration of risperidone. Conversely, strong CYP3A4 inducers like carbamazepine can decrease risperidone plasma concentrations.

- **Drugs having clinically significant interactions with Rykindo**: The interactions of Rykindo with the co-administration of other drugs have not been directly studied; the data originates from studies with oral risperidone. Clinically significant drug interactions with Rykindo are listed in Table 7.

- **Drugs having no clinically important interactions with Rykindo**: Based on pharmacokinetic studies with oral risperidone, no dosage adjustment of Rykindo is required when administered alongside amitriptyline, cimetidine, ranitidine, clozapine, topiramate, or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors like erythromycin. Additionally, no adjustment is necessary for lithium, valproate, topiramate, digoxin, and CYP2D6 substrates such as donepezil and galantamine when co-administered with Rykindo.

### Risperidone alone or in combination for acute mania [^111vprtX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic, is used to treat mania both alone and in combination with other medicines.

- **Objectives**: To review the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone as treatment for mania.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies December 2004), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched in December 2004. Reference lists and English language textbooks were searched; researchers in the field and Janssen-Cilag were contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing risperidone with placebo or other drugs in acute manic or mixed episodes.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted data from trial reports. Janssen-Cilag was asked to provide missing information.

- **Quality assessment**: As in other trials of treatment for mania, the high proportion of imputed efficacy data resulting from rates of failure to complete treatment of between 12% and 62% may have biased the results.

- **Main results**: Six trials (1343 participants) of risperidone as monotherapy or as adjunctive treatment to lithium, or an anticonvulsant, were identified. Permitted doses were consistent with those recommended by the manufacturers of Haldol (haloperidol) and Risperdal (risperidone) for treatment of mania, and trials involving haloperidol allowed antiparkinsonian treatment. Risperidone monotherapy was more effective than placebo in reducing manic symptoms, using the Young Mania Rating Scale.

- **Step 4: Add on or switch therapy (second-line agents)**: Although olanzapine (level 1) is effective in preventing any mood, manic, or depressive episode, it is considered second-line treatment because of safety issues such as metabolic syndrome. Biweekly long-acting injectable risperidone monotherapy (level 1) or adjunctive therapy (level 2) has demonstrated efficacy in preventing any mood or manic episode but had no clear efficacy in depressive episode prevention in these trials. Furthermore, there was a trend for superiority of oral risperidone adjunctive therapy at 6 months in preventing any mood episode and in preventing mania but not depression. Carbamazepine (level 2) has not been assessed in any large placebo-controlled trials, but active comparator trials support its efficacy. Paliperidone (level 2) was more effective than placebo in preventing any mood or manic episode but less effective than olanzapine.

Ziprasidone oral adjunctive therapy (level 2) has been shown to be effective in preventing any mood or manic episode, although there are conflicting (positive and negative) data for acute treatment (see Sections 3 and 4). There was a trend for superiority of lurasidone adjunctive therapy in preventing any mood episode (but not manic or depressive episodes individually) in a controlled trial with significant separation from placebo in preventing mood episodes in those with an index depressive episode. Thus, lurasidone adjunctive therapy may be appropriate for those who responded to this medication during an index depressive episode.

### Safety and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder: Prevalence, monitoring and management [^112yUEVY]. Bipolar Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Atypical antipsychotics are associated with fewer movement disorders and a lower risk of tardive dyskinesia than conventional antipsychotics, but they are not without side effects. Metabolic side effects associated with some atypical antipsychotics are a concern for both clinicians and patients. Adverse events related to central nervous system effects, weight gain, and alterations in glucose, lipid, and prolactin levels in patients with depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders have been reported. Balancing the significant benefits of treatment with these agents against the potential risks of metabolic disturbances and other adverse effects is crucial.

Emerging data make it possible to determine the risk-benefit analysis for specific atypical antipsychotics in individual patients and allow for targeted selection of treatment. A new concept of effectiveness is emerging, which attempts to balance the adverse effects of treatment with patient quality of life.

- **Monitoring**: Patients treated with atypical antipsychotics should have their weight, waist circumference, glucose, and lipids monitored on a regular basis. Monitoring of prolactin levels is not suggested; however, a baseline measurement before initiating treatment can be useful, with subsequent assessment only if a patient demonstrates symptoms.

- **Prevention of weight gain**: Diet and exercise should be considered for prevention and management. The use of pharmacologic strategies should be approached with caution in patients with mood disorders. If a patient is at high risk of developing diabetes, certain pharmacologic agents may be considered.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) collaborative update of CANMAT guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: update 2013 [^111p1MiM]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments published guidelines for the management of bipolar disorder in 2005, with updates in 2007 and 2009. This third update, in conjunction with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders, reviews new evidence and is designed to be used in conjunction with the previous publications. The recommendations for the management of acute mania remain largely unchanged. Lithium, valproate, and several atypical antipsychotic agents continue to be first-line treatments for acute mania. Monotherapy with asenapine, paliperidone extended release (ER), and divalproex ER, as well as adjunctive asenapine, have been added as first-line options.

For the management of bipolar depression, lithium, lamotrigine, and quetiapine monotherapy, as well as olanzapine plus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and lithium or divalproex plus SSRI/bupropion remain first-line options. Lurasidone monotherapy and the combination of lurasidone or lamotrigine plus lithium or divalproex have been added as second-line options. Ziprasidone alone or as adjunctive therapy, and adjunctive levetiracetam have been added as not-recommended options for the treatment of bipolar depression.

Lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone long-acting injection, and adjunctive ziprasidone continue to be first-line options for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Asenapine alone or as adjunctive therapy have been added as third-line options.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of women with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^114PPDwg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). High credibility.

Many antipsychotics cause a sustained increase in prolactin secretion. Hyperprolactinemia is more common in women, with prevalence rates ranging from 42% to 93%, compared to 18% to 72% in men. High prolactin levels inhibit estrogen production, leading to adverse sexual, somatic, and mental health effects such as menstrual cycle irregularities, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, menopausal complaints, depressed mood, and increased risks for cardiovascular diseases and breast cancer. For example, 48% of women receiving antipsychotic treatment report menstrual irregularities, and 32% of women treated with prolactin-raising antipsychotics for over 10 years have reduced bone mineral density. Women who used prolactin-raising antipsychotics for more than 5 years have a 150% increased risk for breast cancer, which is especially concerning since female SSD patients are already at increased genetic risk for this disease.

Lowering the dose of prolactin-enhancing agents increases relapse risk and has not been consistently demonstrated to be effective, as prolactin levels can already be raised when using a low dose of certain antipsychotics. Preventing or correcting antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia is an important goal in the pharmacotherapy of women with SSD. Several strategies have been described, such as switching to a prolactin-sparing antipsychotic or adding a component like aripiprazole or vitamin B6.

In sum, pharmacological treatment for women with SSD may benefit from a sex-sensitive perspective, which can only be constructed if we know how to approach these considerations.

### Efficacy and tolerability of combination treatments for major depression: Antidepressants plus second-generation antipsychotics vs. esketamine vs. lithium [^114QrHg2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

- **NNT values**: NNT values for response among individual drugs or types did not differ significantly, as their confidence intervals overlapped, but tended to be lower (more favorable) with lithium (NNT = 5 [4–10]) than with esketamine (NNT = 7 [5–10]) or SGAs overall (NNT = 11 [9–15]). The NNT among particular SGAs ranked as follows: risperidone (NNT = 6 [3–13]), olanzapine/fluoxetine (which includes an antidepressant; NNT = 6 [4–19]), ziprasidone (NNT = 7 [3–∞]), aripiprazole (NNT = 9 [5–24]), and cariprazine (NNT = 16 [8–52]) or brexpiprazole (NNT = 16 [10–34]).

- **Resonder rates**: Based on responder rates, lithium was significantly superior to SGAs (χ² = 19.6, p < 0.0001), as was esketamine (χ² = 30.9, p < 0.0001), whereas lithium and esketamine did not differ significantly (χ² = 0.340, p = 0.561).

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: Recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^113K229s]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for catatonia, specifically with respect to antipsychotics, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend prescribing antipsychotic medications with caution. This should be considered only if indicated, following an evaluation of the potential benefits and risks, including the risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in patients with an underlying psychotic disorder. Exercise additional caution if there is low serum iron or a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Initiate second-generation antipsychotics with gradual titration and consider co-administering a benzodiazepine.

### Drug interactions of lithium and other antimanic/mood-stabilizing medications [^112bVaCU]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Treatments for bipolar disorder often consist of a combination of two or more medications that have mood-stabilizing properties. Lithium is the only agent that has shown efficacy for the treatment of acute mania and acute depression, as well as for the prevention of recurrence of mania and depression in patients with bipolar disorder. Other agents frequently used as mood stabilizers in monotherapy and in combination with lithium are valproate and carbamazepine. Several other drugs that have mood-stabilizing properties are used in various combinations to effectively manage the spectrum of symptoms of bipolar disorder throughout the acute and maintenance phases.

However, side effects and drug-interaction precautions accompany all agents used to treat bipolar disorder, and it can often be difficult to determine whether a patient is suffering from side effects of treatment or symptoms of the illness itself. It is important to use the lowest effective dose of any treatment medication, to monitor laboratory values closely, and to be familiar with the side effects and interaction precautions of each medication that a patient is taking. Successful management of medications for patients with bipolar disorder is a challenge, but increased effort and vigilance by clinicians can reduce the risk of hospitalization and decrease the frequency of office visits for patients.

### VA/DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^1124XbHA]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of bipolar disorder, particularly in the context of maintenance therapy, the 2023 DoD/VA guidelines recommend considering the offer of oral olanzapine, oral paliperidone, or risperidone long-acting injectable for the prevention of mania recurrence. These options should be considered if lithium and quetiapine are not used, based on patient preference and characteristics.

### Rykindo extended-release microspheres [^1145zQsf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Bipolar disorder - adjunctive therapy**: The effectiveness of RYKINDO as an adjunct to treatment with lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder is based on an adequate and well-controlled study of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular). The results of the adequate and well-controlled study are presented below.

The efficacy of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) was established in a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adult patients who met DSM-IV criteria for Bipolar Disorder Type I and who experienced at least four episodes of mood disorder requiring psychiatric/clinical intervention in the previous 12 months, including at least two episodes in the six months prior to the start of the study.

A total of 240 patients were treated during a 16-week open-label period with risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) (starting dose of 25 mg, and titrated, if deemed clinically desirable, to 37.5 mg or 50 mg), as adjunctive therapy in addition to continuing their usual treatment for bipolar disorder, which consisted of mood stabilizers (primarily lithium and valproate), antidepressants, and/or anxiolytics. All oral antipsychotics were discontinued after the first three weeks following the initial injection of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular). In the open-label phase, 124 patients (51.7%) were judged to be stable for at least the last four weeks and were randomized to double-blind treatment with either the same dose of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) or placebo.

Effects of other drugs on risperidone, 9-hydroxy risperidone, and total active moiety pharmacokinetics

- **Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine and paroxetine)**: Fluoxetine (20 mg once daily) and paroxetine (20 mg once daily), potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, have been shown to increase the plasma concentration of risperidone by 2.5- to 2.8-fold and 3- to 9-fold, respectively. Fluoxetine did not affect the plasma concentration of 9-hydroxy risperidone. Paroxetine lowered the concentration of 9-hydroxy risperidone by about 10%. The effects of discontinuation of concomitant fluoxetine or paroxetine therapy on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxy risperidone have not been studied [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (erythromycin)**: There was no significant interaction between oral risperidone and erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.

- **Strong CYP3A4 inducer (carbamazepine)**: Carbamazepine co-administration with oral risperidone decreased the steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxy risperidone by about 50%. Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine were not affected. Co-administration of other known CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause similar decreases in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxy risperidone, which could lead to decreased efficacy of Rykindo treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Effect of antipsychotics and mood stabilisers on metabolism in bipolar disorder: A network meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials [^115nojPs]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

As for the between-subgroup difference of age, quetiapine, divalproex, and lithium ranked differently among adults and youth, possibly due to differences in metabolism and hormone levels. Irritability and hyperactivity occur more in adolescent bipolar mania, and adolescent patients with bipolar disorder show a higher rate of co-morbid psychiatric disorders than adult patients, which might explain the difference.

It was estimated that children and adolescents receiving antipsychotics are at a higher risk of developing extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, and metabolic syndrome, which raises concerns about the safety of pharmacotherapy among the youth. According to existing policies, quetiapine is recommended by the Food and Drug Administration of the US for patients aged 10 years or older with acute bipolar mania or mixed state, while valproic acid has not been approved for adolescent bipolar disorder pharmacotherapy.

Second-generation antipsychotics, including risperidone and olanzapine, have been approved for adolescent acute bipolar mania, although evidence suggests that they are more likely to cause metabolic disturbance among the youth than adults. Previous studies showed that children might be more sensitive to drug-induced weight gain, or increase in BMI and waist circumference, rather than a disturbance of glucose and lipid metabolism, which might be due to differences in the gut microbiome.

Moreover, little evidence was found among senior patients, which might be due to the relatively low prevalence rate.

### Monotherapy versus combined treatment with second-generation antipsychotics in bipolar disorder [^1174gqH7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The American Psychiatric Association guidelines for treating bipolar disorder recommend combination therapies to treat patients experiencing severe acute manic or mixed episodes and breakthrough manic or mixed episodes during maintenance therapy. Combination therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute manic states include the use of second-generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, in combination with lithium or divalproex; for the treatment of acute bipolar depression, the olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination; and for maintenance treatment, quetiapine combined with lithium or valproate.

When combining medications for the management of patients with bipolar disorders, physicians face a potentially complex treatment strategy. Available agents have different mechanisms of action, routes of metabolism and excretion, therapeutic effects, and side effects. Combining treatments can be advantageous owing to therapeutic synergy; however, the liability is an increased possibility of adverse effects. The decision to use a combination therapy should be made on the basis of the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of each medication and their specific combination for individual patients.

### Rykindo extended-release microspheres [^115C7kTb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Effects of oral risperidone on pharmacokinetics of other drugs:

- **Lithium**: Repeated doses of oral risperidone (3 mg twice daily) did not affect the exposure (AUC) or peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of lithium (n = 13).

- **Valproate**: Repeated doses of oral risperidone (4 mg once daily) did not affect the pre-dose or average plasma concentrations and exposure (AUC) of valproate (1000 mg/day in three divided doses) compared to placebo (n = 21). However, there was a 20% increase in valproate peak plasma concentration (Cmax) after concomitant administration of oral risperidone.

- **Topiramate**: Oral risperidone administered at doses from 1 to 6 mg/day concomitantly with topiramate 400 mg/day resulted in a 23% decrease in risperidone Cmax and a 33% decrease in risperidone AUC0–12 hour at steady state. Minimal reductions in exposure to risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined, and no change for 9-hydroxyrisperidone were observed. This interaction is unlikely to be of clinical significance. There was no clinically relevant effect of oral risperidone on the pharmacokinetics of topiramate.

- **Digoxin**: Oral risperidone (0.25 mg twice daily) did not show a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin.

- **Drugs metabolized by CYP2D6**: In vitro studies indicate that risperidone is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, RYKINDO® is not expected to substantially inhibit the clearance of drugs that are metabolized by this enzymatic pathway. In drug interaction studies, oral risperidone did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of donepezil and galantamine.

### Prozac [^11698vag]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When using Prozac and olanzapine in combination, also refer to the contraindications section of the package insert for Symbyax.

- **Serotonin syndrome and MAOIs**: Do not use MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with Prozac or within 5 weeks of stopping treatment with Prozac. Do not use Prozac within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders. In addition, do not start Prozac in a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue.

- **Pimozide**: Do not use. Risk of QT prolongation and drug interaction.

- **Thioridazine**: Do not use. Risk of QT interval prolongation and elevated thioridazine plasma levels. Do not use thioridazine within 5 weeks of discontinuing Prozac.

4.1 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)

Use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with Prozac or within 5 weeks of stopping treatment with Prozac is contraindicated due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of Prozac within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.9) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Starting Prozac in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of risperidone for acute treatment of bipolar anxiety [^114Jixu1]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

The treatment of bipolar disorder is often complicated by the presence of a co-occurring anxiety disorder. Although second-generation antipsychotics are being used with increasing frequency in bipolar patients, their anxiolytic effects have not been well studied in this population.

- **Methods**: The anxiolytic effect of risperidone 0.5–4 mg/day was tested in an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in 111 patients with bipolar disorder and a co-occurring panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The primary outcome measure was the Clinician Global Improvement-21 Anxiety scale (CGI-21 Anxiety). Secondary measures included the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) and the Sheehan Panic Disorder Scale.

- **Results**: On the last-observation-carried-forward analysis of repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), risperidone was not more effective than placebo for the CGI-21 Anxiety score or the other anxiety outcome measures. Risperidone was well tolerated, with only two patients withdrawing because of adverse events.

- **Limitations**: The risperidone-treated group had more patients with mixed states and lifetime panic disorder at randomization than the placebo group. The study was limited to 8 weeks and to individuals with bipolar and comorbid panic disorder or GAD. The results may not be applicable to risperidone as an add-on treatment to mood stabilizers or to bipolar disorder comorbid with anxiety disorders other than panic disorder or GAD.

- **Conclusions**: Risperidone monotherapy was not an effective anxiolytic for bipolar patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders in this study.

### Employing pharmacologic treatment of bipolar disorder to greatest effect [^114RZZv3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of action, onset and duration of action, and interactions with other medications — all these pharmacokinetic properties of pharmacologic agents affect the efficacy and safety of therapeutic regimens for bipolar disorder. For example, antiglutamatergic agents such as lamotrigine may relieve depression but have no impact on mania. Atypical antipsychotics with the dual effect of blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain decrease psychosis and mania, and according to some preliminary indications, possibly depression. The impact of these properties has been borne out in clinical studies. Mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate stabilize mood by significantly decreasing the manic and hypomanic symptoms of bipolar disorder, although they can have effects on depressive symptoms too. Lamotrigine stabilizes mood by reducing depression. The atypical antipsychotics have been shown to be effective either as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilizers.

### Combination of a mood stabilizer with risperidone or haloperidol for treatment of acute mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of efficacy and safety [^113CYxbC]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The study assessed the efficacy and safety of risperidone as an adjunctive agent to mood stabilizers in the treatment of acute mania.

- **Method**: This 3-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study included 156 bipolar disorder patients experiencing a manic or mixed episode. Participants received a mood stabilizer (lithium or divalproex) and either a placebo, risperidone, or haloperidol. The primary efficacy measure was the Young Mania Rating Scale. Other assessments included the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression scale, and safety measures.

- **Results**: The trial was discontinued by 25 (49%) of the 51 placebo group patients, 18 (35%) of the 52 risperidone group patients, and 28 (53%) of the 53 haloperidol group patients. Mean modal doses were 3.8 mg/day (SD = 1.8) of risperidone and 6.2 mg/day (SD = 2.9) of haloperidol. Significantly greater reductions in Young Mania Rating Scale scores at endpoint and over time were seen in the risperidone group and in the haloperidol group, compared with the placebo group. Young Mania Rating Scale total scores improved with risperidone and haloperidol in patients with psychotic features and in those without psychotic features at baseline. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale total scores were significantly higher at endpoint in the haloperidol patients compared to the placebo patients. Antiparkinsonian medications were received by 8%, 17%, and 38% of patients in the placebo, risperidone, and haloperidol groups, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Risperidone plus a mood stabilizer was more efficacious than a mood stabilizer alone.

- **Haematological effects**: Carbamazepine may be a risk factor for leucopenia, although this finding is not robust. This side effect is generally reversible with dose reduction or discontinuation. There is also some concern about rapidly developing bone marrow suppression resulting from hypersensitivity, particularly in older patients. Clozapine carries the greatest risk for drug-induced changes in white blood cell counts, with approximately 0.18% of patients experiencing changes rated as probably or definitely drug-induced. All patients started on clozapine should have a baseline haematological profile established and be enrolled in the clozapine monitoring programme, which requires regular monitoring of haematological parameters: weekly at first and then every 2–4 weeks later in the course of treatment.

- **Cardiovascular effects**: Lithium can increase the risk of abnormal QT prolongation or T-wave abnormalities, an impact more pronounced with age, as almost 60% of older patients on lithium maintenance therapy have ECG abnormalities. Several antipsychotics, including risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and asenapine, are also associated with arrhythmias, QTc prolongation, and other cardiovascular adverse events. Clozapine may increase the risk of several rare but serious events such as dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Of the antipsychotics, lurasidone and aripiprazole are considered safe from a cardiac perspective, although aripiprazole may increase the risk for hypotension.

### Pharmacological interventions for acute bipolar mania: A systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^116UV5AK]. Bipolar Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials in acute bipolar mania to summarize available data on drug treatment of mania.

- **Methods**: We included trials of medications licensed in the United States or UK for the treatment of any phase of bipolar disorder. Outcomes investigated were changes in mania scores, attrition, extrapyramidal effects, and weight change. Data were combined through meta-analyses.

- **Results**: We included 13 studies (involving 3,089 subjects) and identified 2 studies for each of the following medications: carbamazepine, haloperidol, lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, valproate semisodium, and aripiprazole. All drugs showed significant benefit compared with placebo for reduction in mania scores. For all antipsychotics pooled, response to treatment (≥ 50% reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale scores) was increased more than 1.7 times [relative risk (RR) = 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.54, 1.96]; for all mood stabilizers pooled, response to treatment was doubled (RR 2.01, 95% CI = 1.66, 2.43). Overall withdrawals were 34% fewer (24–43%) with antipsychotics, and 26% fewer (10–39%) with mood stabilizers. However, for carbamazepine, aripiprazole, and lithium, an increase in the risk of withdrawal could not be excluded. Small but significant increases in extrapyramidal side effects occurred with risperidone and aripiprazole.

Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers are significantly more effective than placebo for the treatment of acute mania.

### Clinical effects of CYP2D6 phenoconversion in patients with psychosis [^112WFCB7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Low credibility.

Our findings may have several implications for clinical practice. The GROUP cohort is a well-characterized real-world sample of patients with a psychotic disorder, unconstrained by the inclusion criteria often specified for randomized clinical trials. This provides a more generalizable sample for clinical practice. It should be noted, however, that these patients do not represent severely ill and uncooperative patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The study also demonstrates another important part of clinical reality that is often ignored in pharmacogenetic studies: the potential impact of polypharmacy and phenoconversion. This information is commonly ignored or included as a confounding variable only. Yet, in our sample and practice, a large proportion of psychiatric patients are prescribed multiple medications.

We have also demonstrated that polypharmacy leads to phenoconversion in a significant number of patients, which may affect treatment outcomes under certain conditions. The results also indicate a limited role of CYP2D6 activity in treatment outcome. Although CYP2D6 genotyping is not yet standardized in clinical practice, we suggest that consideration of drug–drug interactions should be integral for patient treatment when pharmacogenetic information is available. Genotyping patients for relevant pharmacogenes should be supplemented by an indexation of concomitant medications possibly interfering with enzyme activity. Polypharmacy itself should be carefully considered, especially when new medications are added to the treatment regime.

### Loxapine [^111fTC1T]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Information for patients: Given the likelihood that some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients for whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided.

- **Drug interactions**: There have been rare reports of significant respiratory depression, stupor, and/or hypotension with the concomitant use of loxapine and lorazepam. The risk of using loxapine in combination with CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of loxapine and CNS-active drugs is required.

- **Pregnancy**:
	- **Non-teratogenic effects**: Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress, and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases, neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization.

	- Loxapine succinate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Safe use of loxapine during pregnancy or lactation has not been established; therefore, its use in pregnancy is not recommended.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115DJ5iq]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

There are insufficient data to make a recommendation regarding the use of aspirin (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), celecoxib (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), gabapentin (monotherapy) (level 3 negative), levetiracetam (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), lisdexamfetamine (adjunctive) (level 3 negative), memantine (adjunctive) (level 3), pioglitazone (adjunctive) (level 3), riluzole (level 4 negative), and risperidone (adjunctive) (level 3). Although adjunctive therapy with pregnenolone separated from placebo at week 6, the change in depressive symptoms was not significantly different from week 8 to week 12 between the two groups (level 2).

- **Clinical features that help direct treatment choices**: There are limited data on predictors of treatment response in bipolar depression. However, clinical features of a depressive episode including DSM‐5 specifiers may assist clinicians in choosing among recommended treatment options.

- **Need for rapid response**: Amongst the first-line options recommended, quetiapine and lurasidone have separated from placebo in clinical trials as early as week 1. Thus, these medications may be preferable when a rapid response is required, for example, in patients who are at increased risk of suicide or who have medical complications, including dehydration. While ECT is recommended as a second-line option, this may also be used earlier when a rapid response is imperative.

### Perseris [^112kFoaX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Effects of other drugs on risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone and total active moiety pharmacokinetics include the following:

- **Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine and paroxetine)**: Fluoxetine (20 mg once daily) and paroxetine (20 mg once daily), potent CYP2D6 inhibitors, have been shown to increase the plasma concentration of risperidone by 2.5 to 2.8 folds and 3 to 9 folds, respectively. Fluoxetine did not affect the plasma concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone, whereas paroxetine lowered the concentration of 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 10%. The effects of discontinuation of concomitant fluoxetine or paroxetine therapy on the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone have not been studied.

- **Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor (erythromycin)**: There were no significant interactions between oral risperidone and erythromycin, a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.

- **Strong CYP3A4 inducer (carbamazepine)**: Carbamazepine co-administration with oral risperidone decreased the steady-state plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone by about 50%. Plasma concentrations of carbamazepine did not appear to be affected. Co-administration of other known CYP3A4 enzyme inducers (e.g. phenytoin, rifampin, and phenobarbital) with risperidone may cause similar decreases in the combined plasma concentrations of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone, which could lead to decreased efficacy of Perseris.

- **Amitriptyline, cimetidine, ranitidine, clozapine, topiramate**: Clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic interaction between Perseris and other drugs, such as amitriptyline, cimetidine, ranitidine, and clozapine, is not evident.

### High dose antipsychotic polypharmacy and dopamine partial agonists - time to rethink guidelines [^117FQmoJ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

The dopamine D2 antagonists used as antipsychotic treatments are invaluable for many people with schizophrenia but can be limited by a range of adverse effects. These depend on the pharmacological profile of the antipsychotic drug used, as well as on genetic and other individual features of the patient, and include, inter alia, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), elevated prolactin, sedation, postural hypotension, weight gain, and QT interval prolongation. The underlying receptor mechanisms relate to antagonism at, respectively but not exclusively, striatal and pituitary D2 receptors, histamine H1, alpha1 adrenergic, H1 and 5-HT2C receptors, and hERG ion channels.

In general, these side effects are dose-dependent, a consideration which has prompted the introduction of guidelines aimed at avoiding excessively high doses of antipsychotic drugs. Furthermore, it has been established that for most dopamine D2 antagonists, a D2 receptor blockade of approximately 60%–70% is adequate for an antipsychotic action and that drug doses above those required to achieve this threshold are likely to increase side effects without a concomitant increase in efficacy.

This argument is also true for combinations of D2 antagonist drugs; the UK consensus guidelines indicate that the 'high dose' threshold is reached when the sum of the percentage of the maximum recommended dose for each antipsychotic drug exceeds 100%. The rationale is clear: combining two D2 antagonists at half maximum dose should approximate to the effects of one drug at maximum dose, although it is limited by inconsistencies in deter.

### Combination therapy versus monotherapy in bipolar disorder [^114vSSs2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Patients experiencing breakthrough manic or mixed episodes during maintenance therapy for bipolar disorder should first be assessed to ensure they are receiving an optimal dose of the first-line medication. If further intervention is needed, one option is to combine an atypical antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. The decision to use a particular combination should be based on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of each medication for individual patients. Psychosocial therapy as an adjunct to medication is also useful in delaying relapse.

### Clinical pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of antimanic and mood-stabilizing medications [^113LYopB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

A number of medications are now available or are in development as antimanic and/or mood-stabilizing agents. We reviewed the clinical pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of these agents to provide a summary of these properties relevant to clinical practice.

- **Method**: We conducted a MEDLINE search augmented by a manual search of bibliographies and a review of textbooks to identify articles regarding the clinical pharmacology of lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, quetiapine, lamotrigine, and topiramate.

- **Results**: Not surprisingly, there are a number of clinically relevant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among these medications, and these differences are discussed.

- **Conclusion**: Knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of established and putative antimanic and mood-stabilizing medications is important in administering these agents safely and effectively.

### Acute treatment of mania: an update on new medications [^111bWgC1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Acute mania is frequently a medical emergency requiring hospitalization for behavioral control, rapid resolution of irritability, agitation, de-escalation of mood, and decreasing risk-taking behavior. Lithium's efficacy in the management of acute mania was first reported in 1949 and it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1970. Chlorpromazine, from the class of typical antipsychotics, was approved for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 1973. For the next two decades, typical antipsychotics were frequently used alone and as adjuncts in the treatment of bipolar mania.

Divalproex was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute mania in 1994. Since the approval of olanzapine in 2000, all five atypical antipsychotics have been approved by the FDA for the management of acute mania:

- **Risperidone**: Approved in 2003
- **Quetiapine**: Approved in 2004
- **Ziprasidone**: Approved in 2004
- **Aripiprazole**: Approved in 2004

Clozapine is the only atypical antipsychotic not FDA-approved for any phase of bipolar disorder. This article systematically reviews major studies, including randomized controlled monotherapy and adjunct therapy trials, involving five atypical antipsychotics and newer anticonvulsants for the treatment of acute bipolar mania.

### Benefits and harms of risperidone and paliperidone for treatment of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder: a meta-analysis involving individual participant data and clinical study reports [^117Y47TH]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are highly prevalent and debilitating severe mental illnesses worldwide. Patients often experience both simultaneously because they share a similar causative process of diagnoses.

Risperidone is a leading second-generation antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults and adolescents and for the short-term treatment of manic or mixed episodes of bipolar disorder. It is indexed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines. However, the manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, has been involved in over 13,500 legal cases due to their failure to disclose that risperidone may cause hormonal imbalances that could lead to breast tissue development (gynecomastia) and increased blood prolactin levels (galactorrhoea hyperprolactinaemia) in boys and girls. There have also been black box warnings about misleading marketing of the drug for off-label uses in children and adolescents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and in elderly patients with dementia. Moreover, the clinical benefit of risperidone is questionable when compared to other antipsychotics and was recently found to be only the sixth-best treatment option for overall change in symptoms of schizophrenia.

Paliperidone is another second-generation antipsychotic drug, also manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, and is used to treat schizophrenia. As both risperidone and paliperidone act via the same pathways in the body, research has suggested strong links to drug-induced hormonal imbalances.

### Variability and efficacy in treatment effects on manic symptoms with lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics in acute bipolar mania: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SSFdq]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

Acute mania is a psychiatric emergency requiring rapid management. However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown considerable individual differences in treatment effects on manic symptoms with antimanic drugs.

We searched the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs without language restrictions from inception to April 19, 2022. We included double-blind RCTs of oral antimanic monotherapy versus placebo in adult patients. The primary outcome was variability in improvement of manic symptoms, assessed using the coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). The secondary outcomes were overall improvement of manic symptoms and acceptability, i.e. discontinuation for any reason. The pooled effects of outcomes were calculated by random-effects meta-analyses using restricted maximum likelihood methods. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) Assessment Tool. This study was registered with OSF (DOI: 10.17605/OSF. IO/G4JNY

We included 39 RCTs (N = 12150; mean age = 39.9 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 38.7–41.1; mean proportion of female = 48.6%, IQR = 42.3%-52.3%) and investigated 14 antimanic drugs. We found that eight antimanic drugs compared to placebo were associated with lower CVRs (95% confidence interval [CI]; I ²). This includes risperidone (0.51; 0.37–0.70; 0%), haloperidol (0.54; 0.44–0.67; 4%), olanzapine (0.59; 0.44–0.79; 47%), ziprasidone (0.61; 0.53–0.71; 0%), lithium (0.63; 0.52–0.76; 0%), quetiapine (0.65; 0.48–0.87; 2%), and aripiprazole (0.68; 0.56–0.84).

### What is a mood stabilizer [^1177veiK]. Psychological Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The concept of mood stability is attractive to both patients and clinicians alike, and hence the term "mood stabilizer" has widespread currency. However, its worldwide acceptance and use in clinical practice is at odds with the absence of official recognition by regulatory authorities. The ideal mood stabilizer is said to have efficacy in the treatment of acute manic and depressive episodes and also be effective in the prevention of recurrences. However, in reality, few drugs, with perhaps the exception of lithium, come close to this gold standard; yet many agents aspire to the title, and some have arguably achieved it prematurely.

It is, therefore, important to reconsider the definition of a mood stabilizer and critically review which agents, if any, satisfy the necessary eligibility requirements by reference to reasonable criteria and comparator data. The term "mood stabilizer" is an important label. It needs to be applied judiciously because it confers clinical credibility and qualifies long-term use in maintenance and prophylaxis. It is also important with respect to developing guidelines for treatment and the further development of novel agents. Most importantly, however, it is a term that is innately appealing because of what it promises; for this reason alone, it should encompass only those agents that can deliver.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia: A multiple-treatments meta-analysis [^112y8GBn]. Lancet (2013). Low credibility.

The question of which antipsychotic drug should be preferred for the treatment of schizophrenia is controversial, and conventional pairwise meta-analyses cannot provide a hierarchy based on the randomised evidence. We aimed to integrate the available evidence to create hierarchies of the comparative efficacy, risk of all-cause discontinuation, and major side effects of antipsychotic drugs.

- **Methods**: We conducted a Bayesian-framework, multiple-treatments meta-analysis, which uses both direct and indirect comparisons of randomised controlled trials to compare 15 antipsychotic drugs and placebo in the acute treatment of schizophrenia. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for reports published up to Sept 1, 2012. Search results were supplemented by reports from the US Food and Drug Administration website and by data requested from pharmaceutical companies. Blinded, randomised controlled trials of patients with schizophrenia or related disorders were eligible. We excluded trials conducted on patients with predominant negative symptoms, concomitant medical illness, treatment resistance, or those in stable patients. Data for seven outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers. The primary outcome was efficacy, as measured by mean overall change in symptoms. We also examined all-cause discontinuation, weight gain, extrapyramidal side effects, prolactin increase, QTc prolongation, and sedation.

- **Findings**: We identified 212 suitable trials.

### Risperidone-induced leukopenia: A case report and brief review of literature [^112JzF1N]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

A Caucasian male young adult with agitated depression and suicidal ideation received lithium and oral olanzapine. His white blood cell count was normal at that time. Due to an unsatisfactory response, he was administered 4 mg/day of risperidone. While his symptoms improved, leukopenia emerged, specifically affecting neutrophils. Upon discontinuation of risperidone, his white blood cell count returned to reference values within one week. As symptom control was satisfactory, no risperidone rechallenge was attempted. Accurate blood testing must accompany atypical antipsychotic drug administration since blood dyscrasias are always possible with these drugs.

### Risperidone versus typical antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia [^112Thj2z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Risperidone is one of the 'new generation' antipsychotics. It is reputed to cause fewer movement disorders than older drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol. Additionally, it is claimed that risperidone may improve negative symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of risperidone for schizophrenia in comparison to 'conventional' neuroleptic drugs.

- **Search strategy**: The original electronic searches of Biological Abstracts (1980–1997), Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (1997), The Cochrane Library (1997, Issue 1), EMBASE (1980–1997), MEDLINE (1966–1997), PsycLIT (1974–1997), and SCISEARCH (1997) were updated with a new electronic search of the same databases in 2002. The search term used in the update was identical to that used in 1997. Any new studies or relevant references were added to the review. In addition, references of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations. Pharmaceutical companies and authors of trials were also contacted.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials comparing risperidone to any 'conventional' neuroleptic treatment for people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Citations and, where possible, abstracts were independently inspected by reviewers. Papers were ordered, re-inspected, and quality assessed. Data were also independently extracted. Where possible, sensitivity analyses on the dose of risperidone, haloperidol and duration of illness were undertaken for the primary outcomes of clinical improvement and side effects (movement disorders).

### Variability and efficacy in treatment effects on manic symptoms with lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics in acute bipolar mania: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112eYC8j]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

The study assessed the variability and efficacy in the improvement of manic symptoms for individuals presenting with acute bipolar mania across RCTs who were receiving oral antimanic monotherapy options.

- **Main findings**: The main findings of this study are as follows: first, eight antimanic drugs, compared to placebo, were associated with significantly lower variability in the improvement of manic symptoms, namely (ordered from lower to higher CVR): risperidone, haloperidol, olanzapine, ziprasidone, lithium, quetiapine, aripiprazole, and cariprazine. Second, nine antimanic drugs, compared to placebo, were associated with better efficacy in the improvement of manic symptoms, namely (ordered from larger to smaller SMD): risperidone, haloperidol, cariprazine, olanzapine, lithium, ziprasidone, quetiapine, asenapine, and aripiprazole. Third, most of the investigated antimanic drugs were not associated with worse acceptability than placebo, while ziprasidone and olanzapine were associated with better acceptability than placebo.

Our study suggests that antimanic drugs with lower variability and greater efficacy in the improvement of manic symptoms may show promising outcomes in patients with acute mania. Among the 14 antimanic drugs, eight were associated with both lower variability and better efficacy than placebo in antimanic outcomes. Patients with acute mania may respond more homogeneously to the eight antimanic drugs irrespective of individual baseline differences in clinical or biological factors. The most recent CANMAT guidelines recommend risperidone, lithium, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.

### Efficacy and tolerability of combination treatments for major depression: antidepressants plus second-generation antipsychotics vs. esketamine vs. lithium [^112jjp4b]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Aims and eligibility criteria**: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis and prepared this report adhering to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). We limited inclusion to peer-reviewed reports of randomized, nominally double-blinded, short-term (≤ 12 weeks), placebo-controlled trials of selected agents of interest, including SGAs (those encountered were: aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, olanzapine+fluoxetine, risperidone, quetiapine, or ziprasidone — all inhibitors of serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D2 receptors), or intranasal esketamine, for comparison with lithium (usually as the carbonate), all combined with standard antidepressants to treat mainly unipolar major depressive episodes in adults diagnosed by modern criteria. We excluded reports involving special populations, such as juveniles, the elderly, or persons with major general medical or neurological illnesses.

- **Information sources and search**: We systematically searched research literature in three electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Medline) through October 2020 with combinations of the search terms: "major depression", "controlled", "randomized", "clinical trial", and "efficacy" (Appendix 1). We also examined previously published, partially relevant, systematic reviews and references identified in them.

Of 4631 initially identified potential studies based on review of titles and abstracts, 124 required more detailed examination by two coauthors (GHV and RJB), resulting in 43 trials (with 49 drug-placebo pairs) meeting study criteria.

### SPL drug information for risperidone [^113iqRsq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Labeled indications for risperidone (also known as Risperdal) include treatment of schizophrenia in adults, treatment of bipolar disorder in adults (manic or mixed episodes), and treatment of irritability in children aged 5–17 years with autism spectrum disorder. It is also indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in children aged 13–17 years, and the treatment of bipolar disorder in children aged 10–17 years (manic or mixed episodes).

- **Off-label indications for risperidone (also known as Risperdal) include**:
	- Prevention of delirium in adults before cardiopulmonary bypass
	- Treatment of Tourette's syndrome in adults
	- Treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults
	- Treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^113Nt11X]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Step 3: Add on or switch therapy (alternate first-line agents)**: If therapy with one or a combination of the first-line agents (lithium, divalproex, and/or an atypical antipsychotic) at optimal doses is inadequate or not tolerated, the next step is to switch to or add on an alternate first-line agent. An exception is that, despite level 1 evidence for monotherapy with paliperidone and ziprasidone, we do not recommend combination therapy with these agents due to lack of evidence for additional efficacy (see "No specific recommendation/agents that require further study" below). Because there are multiple first-line agents with substantial efficacy data and relative safety and tolerability, the use of second- and third-line agents is only recommended after unsuccessful trials of multiple first-line strategies.

- **Step 4: Add on or switch therapy (second-line agents)**: In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, second-line choices include monotherapy with olanzapine (level 1), carbamazepine (level 1), ziprasidone (level 1), and haloperidol (level 1) or combination therapy with olanzapine plus lithium or divalproex (level 1). While each of these strategies has strong support for their efficacy, as indicated above, safety and tolerability concerns relegate them to second-line options. Although widely used in clinical practice, the combination of lithium and divalproex is also recommended as a second-line choice, as evidence supporting its efficacy is limited to uncontrolled trials (level 3).

ECT is also recommended.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111i2q4o]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). High credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments previously published treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder in 2005, with international commentaries and subsequent updates in 2007, 2009, and 2013. The last two updates were published in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders.

These 2018 Bipolar Treatment Guidelines represent significant advances in the field since the last full edition was published in 2005, including updates to diagnosis and management as well as new research into pharmacological and psychological treatments. These advances have been translated into clear and easy-to-use recommendations for first, second, and third-line treatments. Consideration was given to levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and treatment-emergent switch risk.

New to these guidelines are hierarchical rankings for first and second-line treatments recommended for acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder. Created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness, this hierarchy will assist clinicians in making evidence-based treatment decisions. Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, asenapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and cariprazine alone or in combination are recommended as first-line treatments for acute mania. First-line options for bipolar I depression include quetiapine, lurasidone plus lithium or divalproex, lithium, lamotrigine, lurasidone, or adjunctive lamotrigine.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^112ufPqE]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

For several decades, lithium has been, and remains, the "gold standard" first-line treatment for patients living with BP-I, followed by other oral medications such as olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone orally disintegrating tablet. Despite declining prescription rates during the past decade due to the adverse-event and toxicity burden, lithium is used because of its effectiveness in both BP-I and BP-II, including for the prevention of suicidal behavior. In recent years, long-acting injectables (LAIs) such as aripiprazole and risperidone have emerged as potential maintenance treatment options for patients living with BP-I, including early in the course of the illness. At present, aripiprazole and risperidone are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration; however, the use of LAIs for bipolar disorder is currently off-label in Europe according to European Medicines Agency recommendations. Compared to oral antipsychotics that are shorter acting and must be taken more frequently, LAIs are designed to provide relief of symptoms by slowly releasing the drug over an extended period (weeks to months). Studies in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder suggest that LAIs may provide additional benefits over oral antipsychotics by reducing the rates of re-hospitalization and risk of relapse, improving overall quality of life, and improving adherence to treatment. However, LAIs are not routinely offered to patients living with BP-I, for reasons that will be explored in this expert consensus report.

The main objectives of this article are to highlight the potential benefits of LAIs in the management of BP-I.

### Chlorpromazine versus atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia [^117QTV6j]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Chlorpromazine is an aliphatic phenothiazine, one of the widely used typical antipsychotic drugs. It is known for its efficacy and is one of the most tested first-generation antipsychotic drugs. Chlorpromazine has been used as a 'gold standard' to compare the efficacy of older and newer antipsychotic drugs. Although expensive new generation drugs are heavily marketed worldwide as better treatments for schizophrenia, this may not always be the case and could lead to an unnecessary drain on limited resources.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of chlorpromazine with atypical or second-generation antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of people with schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register up to 23 September 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared chlorpromazine with any other atypical antipsychotic drugs for treating people with schizophrenia. Adults (as defined in each trial) diagnosed with schizophrenia, including schizophreniform, schizoaffective, and delusional disorders, were included in this review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened the articles identified in the literature search against the inclusion criteria and extracted data from included trials. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous data, we determined the mean difference (MD) values and 95% CIs. We assessed the risk of bias in included studies and rated the quality of the evidence.

### Safety of psychotropic medications in people with COVID-19: Evidence review and practical recommendations [^116RU2Tj]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Based on the considerations reported above and after collegial discussion, and taking into consideration values, feasibility, resource use, and certainty of the evidence according to the Evidence-to-Decision framework (see Additional File 1: Table S9), the following practical recommendations were formulated:

- **Drug–drug interactions**: The risk and severity of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between COVID-19 medical treatments and psychotropic medications should always be assessed, taking into account the additional vulnerability related to the underlying medical condition, such as cardiovascular conditions increasing the risk of QTc prolongation. In cases of high-risk interactions, the combination should be avoided if possible. For moderate-risk interactions, dose adjustments, psychotropic medication withdrawal, or switching to a safer medication should be considered. In cases of low-risk interactions, regular monitoring should be provided, with dose adjustments as clinically appropriate. For very low-risk interactions, regular monitoring is suggested (see Table 2 and Additional File 1: Table S8).

- **Respiratory depression**: An estimation of the psychotropic-related risk of respiratory depression should systematically consider the following: (a) the intrinsic sedative properties of psychotropic medications, their half-life (higher risk for longer half-life), the dose, and the occurrence of other aspects possibly impairing respiration, such as reduced motility and sialorrhea; (b) pharmacokinetic interactions raising plasma levels of sedative medication.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^111Vz1W6]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In patients who are inadequately responsive to first-line agents, monotherapy with divalproex (level 2) is included as a second-line option.

- **Adjunctive use of antidepressant therapy**: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or bupropion with lithium/divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic may also be considered as a second-line add-on treatment. While some individual studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of adjunctive antidepressant therapy, a recent meta-analysis (level 1) supports efficacy, albeit with a small effect size.

This is a key aspect of decision-making regarding antidepressants, since historically much of the focus has been on the risk of manic switch or rapid cycling, with an underappreciation of the relatively weak efficacy data. This new appreciation, exemplified by the small benefit seen in the above meta-analysis, led to the change from the last CANMAT guidelines, which previously gave add-on SSRI/bupropion antidepressants a first-line recommendation. As per the ISBD Antidepressant Task Force recommendations, antidepressants should ideally be avoided, or used cautiously if necessary, in patients with a history of antidepressant-induced mania or hypomania, predominant mixed features, or recent rapid cycling.

Patients and caregivers (as appropriate) should receive education regarding early warning symptoms of mood switching or cycle acceleration, and antidepressants should be discontinued if these emerge. Antidepressant monotherapy should not be used for the treatment of bipolar disorder I (BDI) depression.

- **ECT (level 3)**: Considered as an option for treatment-resistant cases.
