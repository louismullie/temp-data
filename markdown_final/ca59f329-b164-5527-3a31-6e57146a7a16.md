## Question

Hyponatremia management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hyponatremia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and excluding pseudohyponatremia. Then, I should classify severity and acuity and assess symptoms. Next, I will determine volume status and likely etiology. After that, I will outline emergency therapy for severe symptoms, followed by cause-specific management for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic cases. I will then set correction limits and monitoring cadence, including what to do if overcorrection occurs. Finally, I will consider special populations and close with a concise algorithmic summary, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and key reviews.

> Let me first confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia and exclude pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic states, because management hinges on this distinction. I need to check serum osmolality; if it is normal or high, I should consider hyperglycemia, mannitol, or paraproteinemia rather than true hyponatremia, and if osmolality is low, I can proceed with hypotonic hyponatremia management pathways [^114hmeK4] [^111WyraN].

> Next, I should review severity and acuity and correlate with symptoms. Severe hyponatremia is typically less than 125 mEq/L, and acute is often defined as less than 48 hours, though I should double-check that the exact cut-off varies across guidelines; importantly, symptom severity scales with rapidity and magnitude of decline, ranging from nausea and headache to seizures, coma, and respiratory arrest, so I need to act urgently when severe neurologic symptoms are present [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm] [^111y8Lh6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify volume status because it drives therapy. Hypovolemic hyponatremia suggests renal or extrarenal losses and typically shows low urine sodium, euvolemic points toward SIADH or endocrine causes with inappropriately concentrated urine, and hypervolemic reflects edematous states like heart failure or cirrhosis; I need to ensure I integrate urine sodium, urine osmolality, and clinical exam rather than relying on a single parameter [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm] [^111y8Lh6].

> For severely symptomatic hyponatremia, I will now examine emergency therapy. Bolus hypertonic saline is first-line to rapidly raise sodium by about 4–6 mEq/L within 1–2 hours to reverse cerebral edema; 100 mL of 3% saline over 10 minutes, repeatable up to three times, is a pragmatic approach, with some guidelines recommending 150 mL over 20 minutes, and I should recheck sodium about 20 minutes after each bolus and stop once symptoms improve or a total 10 mEq/L rise is achieved in 24 hours to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm] [^111bC6Vc] [^115WbE1C] [^1132UNHS].

> Wait, let me verify correction limits and monitoring cadence so I do not overcorrect. In chronic hyponatremia or those at high risk of osmotic demyelination, I should limit the rise to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours; in patients without risk factors, up to 12 mEq/L in 24 hours and 18 mEq/L in 48 hours is acceptable, and I should monitor sodium every 4–6 hours initially, then space out as stable; if overcorrection occurs, I should promptly relower sodium with desmopressin and electrolyte-free water, and discontinue active sodium-raising therapies [^114mqwBU] [^111czwib] [^1114uqkz] [^114oqYXZ].

> For hypovolemic hyponatremia, I need to ensure isotonic saline is used to restore effective arterial blood volume and suppress vasopressin; I should correct volume first and worry less about a modest rise in sodium during resuscitation, because restoring perfusion takes precedence, and I will reassess sodium frequently as volume repletes [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm] [^112NDPcb].

> For euvolemic hyponatremia, let me consider SIADH as the most common cause. Fluid restriction to about 800–1,000 mL/day is first-line, but I should double-check for predictors of poor response such as high urine osmolality above 500 mOsm/kg and high urine sodium above 100 mmol/L; if restriction fails or is not tolerated, urea at 0.25–0.5 g/kg/day or a vaptan can be used, with vaptans carrying a risk of overcorrection and needing close monitoring, and I should also treat the underlying driver of SIADH whenever possible [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm] [^111bC6Vc] [^1175CAmS].

> For hypervolemic hyponatremia, I should confirm that the priority is treating the underlying edematous disease and restricting free water. In cirrhosis, I need to be cautious with hypertonic saline and reserve it for life-threatening encephalopathy or imminent transplant, and otherwise use fluid restriction around 1,000 mL/day and optimize disease-directed therapy; in heart failure, loop diuretics with salt restriction are foundational, and vaptans may be considered selectively if hyponatremia persists despite optimized therapy [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm] [^112vKGeP] [^112UXSyW] [^116GwdrP].

> But wait, what if the patient has exercise-associated hyponatremia in the field. I should avoid hypotonic or isotonic fluids early because they can worsen cerebral edema; instead, I will give 100 mL of 3% saline boluses, up to three doses at 10-minute intervals, or use hypertonic oral solutions if available, and only consider isotonic fluids later if true hypovolemia is confirmed after sodium correction has begun [^111Qzmkn] [^117RWnJQ].

> I should also consider special populations and contexts. In liver disease, slow correction with a hard cap of 8 mmol/L per day is emphasized to avoid osmotic demyelination, and hypertonic saline is reserved for exceptional circumstances; in cancer, SIADH is common and management aligns with SIADH principles while addressing oncologic drivers; in pediatrics, the same framework applies but I need to ensure weight-based dosing and heightened vigilance for neurologic complications [^112vKGeP] [^112UXSyW] [^1135vqck].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Confirm true hypotonic hyponatremia, classify severity and acuity, assess symptoms, determine volume status, treat severe symptoms immediately with hypertonic saline while respecting correction limits, and then pivot to cause-specific therapy with fluid restriction, isotonic saline, or disease-directed measures, all under close monitoring with a plan to rescue overcorrection; this approach balances the competing risks of untreated cerebral edema against iatrogenic demyelination and is supported by contemporary guidelines and reviews [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm] [^111y8Lh6].

---

Hyponatremia management centers on **rapid correction for severe symptoms** and **slow, controlled correction for chronic cases** to avoid osmotic demyelination [^114hmeK4]. For severe symptoms (seizures, coma), give **3% hypertonic saline 100 mL IV boluses** [^1175CAmS] repeated up to three times to raise sodium by 4–6 mmol/L rapidly, then stop and monitor closely [^1132UNHS]. For chronic hyponatremia, limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours (≤ 12 mmol/L if low risk) [^114mqwBU] and treat based on volume status: fluid restriction for euvolemic/SIADH [^112MGZPb], isotonic saline for hypovolemic [^111bC6Vc], and fluid restriction plus disease-specific therapy for hypervolemic cases [^114SfmaG]. Monitor sodium every 4–6 hours initially [^111czwib] [^114jzD4z] [^116VvNY1] [^113PyTGH] [^1175CAmS]; if overcorrection occurs, administer desmopressin and give electrolyte-free water to safely relower sodium [^1175CAmS].

## Classification and clinical significance

Hyponatremia is defined as serum sodium **< 135 mmol/L** [^114hmeK4] and is classified by severity and chronicity:

| **Severity** | **Serum sodium (mmol/l)** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 130–134 | Often asymptomatic; associated with increased falls, fractures, and cognitive impairment [^114hmeK4] [^115bV1Sk] |
| Moderate | 125–129 | Increased risk of neurologic symptoms, hospitalization, and mortality [^114hmeK4] [^115bV1Sk] |
| Severe | < 125 | High risk of seizures, coma, and death; requires urgent intervention [^114hmeK4] [^115bV1Sk] |

---

Chronicity is defined as **acute (< 48 hours)** or **chronic (> 48 hours)** [^114CwAdv], which guides correction targets and monitoring.

---

## General principles of management

- **Treat the underlying cause**: Address the etiology (e.g. SIADH, heart failure, cirrhosis, medications) [^114hmeK4] [^114Mg1Pm].
- **Balance risks**: Weigh cerebral edema from untreated hyponatremia against osmotic demyelination from rapid correction [^114hmeK4] [^111V9Y4A].
- **Monitor closely**: Frequent sodium checks and clinical assessment are essential [^111czwib] [^114jzD4z].

---

## Management of acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia

Acute severe hyponatremia with seizures, coma, or respiratory arrest requires **immediate correction** to prevent brain herniation [^114hmeK4].

---

### Hypertonic saline therapy

- **Initial therapy**: 3% hypertonic saline 100 mL IV bolus over 10 minutes [^116Rry73]; repeat up to two additional times if symptoms persist (total 300 mL) [^notfound].
- **Target rise**: 4–6 mmol/L rapidly to reverse encephalopathy [^114hmeK4].
- **Limit total correction**: ≤ 10 mmol/L in 24 hours to avoid osmotic demyelination [^114hmeK4] [^114C7k4P].
- **Monitoring**: Check sodium every 4–6 hours initially; adjust therapy to stay within safe limits [^111czwib] [^114jzD4z].

---

## Management of chronic hyponatremia

Chronic hyponatremia requires **slow, controlled correction** to minimize osmotic demyelination risk [^114hmeK4].

---

### Correction limits

Limit correction to **≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours** in high-risk patients (alcoholism, malnutrition, liver disease, hypokalemia) [^114mqwBU] and **≤ 12 mmol/L in 24 hours** in low-risk patients [^114mqwBU].

---

### Volume status-based management

| **Volume status** | **Recommended therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Hypovolemic | Isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) | Restores effective arterial volume, suppresses vasopressin, and promotes free water excretion [^111bC6Vc] |
| Euvolemic (SIADH) | Fluid restriction (800–1,000 mL/day); consider urea or vasopressin antagonists if restriction fails | Reduces free water intake; urea/vaptans increase free water excretion [^112MGZPb] [^1114uqkz] |
| Hypervolemic (heart failure, cirrhosis) | Fluid restriction; treat underlying disease; consider vasopressin antagonists | Reduces fluid overload; vaptans promote aquaresis [^114SfmaG] [^112UGAbo] |

---

### Monitoring and adjustment

Check sodium **every 4–6 hours initially**, then daily once stable [^notfound]. If overcorrection occurs, administer desmopressin and give electrolyte-free water to safely relower sodium [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Exercise-associated hyponatremia**: Treat with hypertonic saline; avoid hypotonic or isotonic fluids early [^111Qzmkn] [^117RWnJQ].
- **Liver disease**: Use hypertonic saline only for life-threatening symptoms; correct slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L/day) [^112vKGeP] [^116aRe3m].
- **Cancer-related SIADH**: Fluid restriction and vaptans are effective; monitor closely for overcorrection [^1135vqck] [^11621W7x].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Severe symptoms**: 3% hypertonic saline 100 mL IV bolus, repeat up to two times; limit total correction to ≤ 10 mmol/L in 24 hours [^116Rry73] [^114hmeK4].
- **Chronic hyponatremia**: Correct ≤ 8 mmol/L in 24 hours (≤ 12 mmol/L if low risk); tailor therapy to volume status [^114mqwBU] [^114Mg1Pm].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent sodium checks and clinical assessment; reverse overcorrection with desmopressin and electrolyte-free water [^111czwib] [^116VvNY1].

---

Effective hyponatremia management requires **rapid correction for severe symptoms** and **slow, controlled correction for chronic cases**, with therapy individualized to volume status and close monitoring to prevent complications.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^116yEj9k]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Managing hyponatremia in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^115JmoqJ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This review will address the management of hyponatremia caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in hospitalized patients. To do so requires an understanding of the pathogenesis and diagnosis of SIADH, as well as currently available treatment options. The review will be structured as responses to a series of questions, followed by a presentation of an algorithm for determining the most appropriate treatments for individual patients with SIADH based on their presenting symptoms.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to help evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and the most appropriate treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. To be reliable, these recommendations must be based on a systematic review of the evidence, and have a transparent and multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards and can only add to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^115evmgn]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Approach to the patient: hyponatremia and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^115bV1Sk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance seen in clinical practice, affecting up to 30% of acute hospital admissions, and is associated with significant adverse clinical outcomes. Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia carries a high risk of neurological morbidity and mortality. In contrast, chronic hyponatremia is associated with significant morbidity including increased risk of falls, osteoporosis, fractures, gait instability, and cognitive decline; prolonged hospital admissions; and etiology-specific increase in mortality. In this Approach to the Patient, we review and compare the current recommendations, guidelines, and literature for diagnosis and treatment options for both acute and chronic hyponatremia, illustrated by 2 case studies. Particular focus is concentrated on the diagnosis and management of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis. An understanding of the pathophysiology of hyponatremia, along with a synthesis of the duration of hyponatremia, biochemical severity, symptomatology, and blood volume status, forms the structure to guide the appropriate and timely management of hyponatremia. We present 2 illustrative cases that represent common presentations with hyponatremia and discuss the approach to management of these and other causes of hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^116Dh6zX]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder in clinical medicine; it represents an excess of water relative to total body solute. Hyponatremia usually results from the intake and subsequent retention of electrolyte-free water in response to true hypovolemia due to gastrointestinal solute loss or malnutrition; decreased effective circulating volume due to heart failure or liver cirrhosis; or non-osmotic vasopressin activity due to malignancies, infections, medications, pain, or stress. When defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/L, hyponatremia occurs in up to 8% of the general population and in up to 60% of hospitalized patients. Acute profound hyponatremia can cause brain edema, but also chronic mild hyponatremia is associated with poor health outcomes. Even when comorbid conditions are taken into account, people with a mildly decreased serum sodium concentration have a 30% higher risk of death and are hospitalized 14% longer relative to those without hyponatremia.

Despite the frequency and severity of some of the associated complications, research suggests hyponatremia is often neglected by clinicians. If acquired in hospital, it may take days before the electrolyte disorder is investigated, potentially allowing a further decrease in serum sodium concentration and exposing patients to the dangers of profound hyponatremia. When efforts are made to explore the underlying cause, clinicians use widely different strategies for differential diagnosis, testing is often inadequate and misclassification of the hyponatremia frequently occurs.

Hyponatremia may be managed clinically by different specialists, such as endocrinologists, nephrologists, geriatricians, or intensivists, and, accordingly, management strategies often vary. Although probably related to variation in awareness, differences in expert opinion on whom and how to treat only add to the confusion over optimal management. For instance, although experts agree that acute symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated with hypertonic saline, the optimal concentrations and methods for determining initial infusion speeds are debated. In addition, the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome after rapid correction of hyponatremia has fuelled intense debate among experts on whether complications of untreated hyponatremia or complications of treatment pose the greatest risk. As different specialist physicians deal with hyponatremia, consultation of different information and guidance sources may add to the variability in treatment seen in clinical practice today.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116uPKAA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Causes and management of hyponatremia [^113xgAdy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review clinical information on the incidence and causes of hyponatremia (defined as a serum sodium level < 130 mEq/L), the most common electrolyte abnormality seen in general hospital patients, and to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia in relation to these factors.

Data Sources

Primary sources and review articles were identified via MEDLINE (1981-July 2003) for entries on hyponatremia. We limited the search to specific topics including incidence, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and clinical disorders and medications associated with hypotonic hyponatremia.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All of the articles identified were evaluated, and relevant and representative information was included in this review.

Data Synthesis

Hyponatremia can result from several disease states, injury, surgery, physical exercise, or the administration of certain drugs (e.g., antidepressants, antiepileptics) and is associated with advanced age. Drug-induced hyponatremia is often asymptomatic and usually resolves following water restriction and monitoring of medication. Symptoms of hyponatremia are primarily neurologic; the principal danger of hyponatremia relates to effects on central nervous system function due to changes in brain size.

Conclusions

Although hyponatremia can be a serious condition, appropriate measures for the management of at-risk and affected patients will lead to full recovery in most cases.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^114Mg1Pm]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, adequate response to initial management, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to decide on the next steps of the management of hypotonic hyponatremia (true hyponatremia) in the absence of severe hyponatremia based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^111V9Y4A]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^1174Gy8M]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^1114bcWT]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is defined by a serum or plasma sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol·L⁻¹ that occurs during or up to 24 h after prolonged physical activity. It is reported to occur in individual physical activities or during organized endurance events conducted in environments in which medical care is limited and often not available, and patient evacuation to definitive care is often greatly delayed. Rapid recognition and appropriate treatment are essential in the severe form to increase the likelihood of a positive outcome. To mitigate the risk of EAH mismanagement, care providers in the prehospital and in hospital settings must differentiate from other causes that present with similar signs and symptoms. EAH most commonly has overlapping signs and symptoms with heat exhaustion and exertional heat stroke. Failure in this regard is a recognized cause of worsened morbidity and mortality. In an effort to produce best practice guidelines for EAH management, the Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel in May 2018. The panel was charged with updating the WMS Practice Guidelines for Treatment of Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia published in 2014 using evidence-based guidelines for the prevention, recognition, and treatment of EAH. Recommendations are made based on presenting with symptomatic EAH, particularly when point-of-care blood sodium testing is unavailable in the field. These recommendations are graded on the basis of the quality of supporting evidence and balanced between the benefits and risks/burdens for each parameter according to the methodology stipulated by the American College of Chest Physicians.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^114hmeK4]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Management of chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting [^117F2NEf]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnostic evaluation and management of chronic hyponatremia in outpatients can be challenging for several reasons. First, chronic hyponatremia is often mild, leading to uncertainty about whether it is clinically significant and warrants further diagnostic evaluation and treatment. Second, if the initial diagnostic workup does not identify a clear cause, it becomes uncertain how much further investigation is required. Third, when no clear cause is found or the underlying condition cannot be treated, physicians may struggle to choose the most appropriate treatment approach. This review offers practical guidance to navigate these challenges in managing chronic hyponatremia in the outpatient setting.

Conclusions

Improving both the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriate management of hyponatraemia are important goals given the morbidity and mortality associated with this common electrolyte disorder. A greater consistency in future clinical practice guidelines would represent a significant educational achievement and, crucially, would help clinicians to pick the best options for patients with hyponatraemia.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^114bTxzD]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^115rvcWm]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

Methods

Criteria for selection of studies

We included evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia. We defined clinical practice guidelines as statements that included recommendations intended to optimize patient care informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options. We defined consensus statements as documents containing clinically relevant suggestions or recommendations based on the collective opinion of an expert panel. We included all publications independent of language. We excluded guidelines related to the prevention of hyponatremia as well as guidelines relevant to conditions associated with hyponatremia if they were not specifically designed to address hyponatremia. Hence, we excluded guidelines targeting treatment of heart failure, cirrhosis, and cancer unless they were developed with a focus on hyponatremia as a complication. Finally, we also excluded draft unpublished guidelines, conference or discussion papers, personal opinions, and obsolete guidelines replaced by updated recommendations from the same organization.

Search methods for guidelines and consensus statements

We searched MEDLINE (1946 to September Week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to September 2014), combining vocabulary terms and text words for hyponatremia with terms related to clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements. We also searched guideline databases and websites of organizations as well as of selected professional specialist societies in nephrology, endocrinology, and intensive care medicine. A list of the databases and websites along with the full search strategies are outlined in Additional file 1. EN and JV independently screened the titles and abstracts and discarded those that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Full texts for potentially relevant guidelines or consensus statements were retrieved and examined for eligibility. Both the initial screening and subsequent full-paper assessment stage were completed using Early Review Organizing Software.

Data collection process and data items

We developed a draft data extraction form which was piloted and modified as necessary. The extracted data included document characteristics (e.g. year of publication, country/region, development team, funding organization), recommendations related to the diagnosis and assessment of hyponatremia, and recommendations related to the treatment of hyponatremia. EN and JV extracted all data using the standardized data extraction form (Additional file 2) and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^111hiyrd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^1141Futk]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Six groups included healthcare professionals from different specialties. Multidisciplinary contribution serves to broaden the approach to health-care problems, increase the completeness of evidence-finding strategies, and help to identify hurdles to implementation. When reflecting on approaches to hyponatremia, bringing together several disciplines mirrors the clinical reality of multiple specialty areas dealing with the same problem but looking at it from a different angle. Only one of the development groups reported considering patients' views and experiences, but even then did so to a limited extent. Decisions on clinical care should factor in patient values and preferences. Interventions for chronic hyponatremia, such as fluid restriction, may affect quality of life and patient preference should influence the ultimate recommendations.

Low scores for applicability mostly reflect the absence of describing barriers to guideline implementation and failure to provide tools for putting the recommendations into practice. In part, guidelines are designed to deal with the challenges of increasing knowledge and time-pressure. They are designed to help make decisions at the point of care. However, being often lengthy publications without layered presentation of information, it is likely that the majority of the guidance documents may not reach their target audience or stimulate implementation. Four guidance documents provided algorithms for diagnosis or treatment; although these are likely to increase the utility of a guideline, it is unclear to what extent they truly improve implementation of the recommendations. How to best communicate evidence-based recommendations to the relevant stakeholders is a recent but active area of research lead by the DECIDE consortium. With results of their research expected, guideline developers will have additional targets for improving the applicability in the future.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) prevention and hydration guidance — Preventing EAH is the key factor in protecting participants in endurance events and other wilderness recreation activities. Currently, there is no single hydration recommendation that fits all individuals for fluid and salt consumption during all exercise scenarios. We recommend for the majority of participants a hydration strategy that relies on their innate thirst mechanism. Thirst is triggered by changes in serum osmolality and should prevent severe dehydration while minimizing the risk for overhydration and hyponatremia (especially if ADH is present). We recognize that there are situations in which body fluid losses may be excessive and rapid; in these circumstances, thirst may not keep up with body fluid losses, and other hydration strategies may be needed, and in these situations, participants should consider increasing their fluid intake to account for these excessive losses. The typical field response is to encourage oral hypotonic fluid intake or administer rapid isotonic IV fluids to endurance activity participants with the suspicion that they are dehydrated; however, such universal treatment may result in increased morbidity and mortality in the EAH patient.

Approaches to treatment for hyponatremia

Table 3 shows the recommendations for the medical management of hyponatremia. Guidance documents distinguished treatment scenarios based on whether patients had severe symptoms or whether the hyponatremia was acute (48 h) or chronic. All but one discussed treatment in the setting of severe symptoms and recommended infusion of hypertonic saline, usually specified as having a concentration of 3%. One suggested using a formula to guide the infusion speed of a continuous infusion, five others recommended giving a fixed dose, or a dose adjusted to body weight with repeated serum sodium concentration measurements to check progression.

Table 3
Summary of recommendations for approaches to treatments for hyponatremia by included guidance documents

NIV, Nederlandse Internisten Vereniging; NHS, National Health Service; GAIN, Guidelines and Audit Implementation Network; AEEH, La Asociación Española para el Estudio del Hígado; EHN, European Hyponatremia Network; ERBP, European Renal Best Practice; ESE, European Society of Endocrinology; ESICM, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine; UF, University of Florida; HEP, Hyponatremia Expert Panel; RCH Melbourne, the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; EAH-ICD, International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference.

Patients without symptoms of hyponatremia were assumed to have chronic onset hyponatremia, and treatment suggestions were mostly dependent on the classification hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Only three guidance documents specifically advised treating the underlying condition. Seven suggested 0.9% saline in hypovolemia, with infusion speeds calculated with Adrogué-Madias, until restoration of blood pressure or until nasogastric rehydration could start.

For euvolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, the majority recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment. Five guidance documents proposed a number of other interventions as second-line treatments including loop diuretics, demeclocycline, urea, vasopressin receptor antagonists, or lithium. One guideline specifically recommended against vasopressin receptor antagonists in case of a serum sodium concentration < 125 mmol/L.

Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status. For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects. Severely symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency.

US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4. 5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death. Conclusions and Relevance Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^111fLWER]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hyponatremia:

- **Definition**: Hyponatremia an electrolyte disorder characterized by low serum sodium concentration, and is typically defined as a serum sodium of < 135 mEq/L.
- **Pathophysiology**: Causes of hyponatremia include increased water intake (psychogenic polydipsia), low dietary solute intake (tea and toast diet), decreased water excretion secondary to elevated plasma ADH levels (volume depletion, SIADH, severe hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and expansion of plasma volume in the context of edematous states.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hyponatremia in the general population of the US is 1.72%.
- **Disease course**: Treatment of hyponatremia requires careful attention to avoid overly rapid correction of serum sodium, which can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome, permanent neurological impairment, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome recover fully, whereas 25% have persistent neurological deficits. Mortality associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome is approximately 6%.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: meeting goals and avoiding harm [^1175CAmS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use. Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion? What is the appropriate dose? Is a central venous line necessary? Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long? This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^116fNs9z]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In the "real world", the non-expert doctor who initially recognises and responds to severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 120 mmol/L) in a critically ill patient will often be a junior trainee working "out of routine office hours". In this emergency setting, the doctor may have limited immediate access to important additional diagnostic tests, e.g. serum and urine osmolality and urine electrolytes. Urgent treatment decisions may need to be taken to manage symptoms such as confusion and seizures, with incomplete patient history and diagnostic information. There is a general consensus that hypertonic saline is effective in the immediate management of acute symptomatic hyponatraemia but available guidelines differ on the volumes and rates of saline infusion. Ultimately, it is clinical judgement rather than adherence to a particular guideline that will determine an individual patient's treatment. Intuitive clinical algorithms, with proven efficacy, would help to encourage "best practice" in the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^111WyraN]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^1114uqkz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Hyponatremia in heart failure: revisiting pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies [^112UGAbo]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients with heart failure (HF), and its association with adverse outcomes is well-established in this population. While hyponatremia is an independent marker for severity of HF, it is not certain whether it has a causal impact on the progression of the disease. There are no universally accepted consensus guidelines regarding therapeutic strategies for HF-associated hyponatremia and volume overload; current societal guidelines do not address management of this complication. Whereas thiazide diuretics are known to induce or worsen hyponatremia in this setting through a number of mechanisms, loop diuretics can be considered a readily available first-line pharmacologic therapy. Consistent with pathophysiology of the disease and mechanisms of action of loop diuretics, available clinical evidence supports such an approach provided that patients can be closely monitored. Use of vasopressin receptor antagonists is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this setting, and the efficacy of these agents has so far been shown in a number of clinical studies. These agents can be reserved for patients with HF in whom initial appropriate loop diuretic therapy fails to improve serum sodium levels.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^117M8SDu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Hyponatremia, fluid-electrolyte disorders, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: diagnosis and treatment options [^114jmrgW]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the types and causes of hyponatremia and examine the various strategies for treatment of this disorder.

Methods

A systematic review of the current literature is provided, targeting endocrinology clinicians who consult with hospital medical and surgical staff when managing patients with hyponatremia. Treatment for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia with arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists is presented, which provides a new treatment option for patients with disorders of water metabolism.

Results

Hyponatremia is recognized as the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in the clinical setting and is associated with a variety of conditions including dilutional disorders, such as congestive heart failure and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, and depletional disorders, such as diarrhea and vomiting or blood loss. Most cases of mild hyponatremia can be treated effectively. Acute, severe hyponatremia that is untreated or treated ineffectively, however, can lead to serious neurologic outcomes or death. With the poor prognosis for morbidity and mortality in patients with severe hyponatremia, hospital-based clinicians must identify those at risk for hyponatremia and suggest appropriate treatment intervention. A new class of drugs, the arginine vasopressin receptor antagonists, targets receptors on collecting duct cells of the nephron and causes aquaresis, the excretion of free water. This therapy leads to the restoration of sodium-water homeostasis in patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Conclusion

With many hospitalized patients at risk for hyponatremia, especially elderly patients in critical care and postsurgical units, identification of involved patients, recommendation of appropriate treatment, and awareness of new therapeutic options are critical.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^116F8M1C]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### Management of hyponatremia [^111duo5q]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is an important electrolyte abnormality with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. Common causes include medications and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Hyponatremia can be classified according to the volume status of the patient as hypovolemic, hypervolemic, or euvolemic. Hypervolemic hyponatremia may be caused by congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and renal disease. Differentiating between euvolemia and hypovolemia can be clinically difficult, but a useful investigative aid is measurement of plasma osmolality. Hyponatremia with a high plasma osmolality is caused by hyperglycemia, while a normal plasma osmolality indicates pseudohyponatremia or the post-transurethral prostatic resection syndrome. The urinary sodium concentration helps in diagnosing patients with low plasma osmolality. High urinary sodium concentration in the presence of low plasma osmolality can be caused by renal disorders, endocrine deficiencies, reset osmostat syndrome, SIADH, and medications. Low urinary sodium concentration is caused by severe burns, gastrointestinal losses, and acute water overload. Management includes instituting immediate treatment in patients with acute severe hyponatremia because of the risk of cerebral edema and hyponatremic encephalopathy. In patients with chronic hyponatremia, fluid restriction is the mainstay of treatment, with demeclocycline therapy reserved for use in persistent cases. Rapid correction should be avoided to reduce the risk of central pontine myelinolysis. Loop diuretics are useful in managing edematous hyponatremic states and chronic SIADH. In all instances, identifying the cause of hyponatremia remains an integral part of the treatment plan.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^112ofLR1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia, defined as a serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/l, is the most common disorder of body fluid and electrolyte balance encountered in clinical practice. It can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, from subtle to severe or even life threatening, and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay in patients presenting with a range of conditions. Despite this, the management of patients remains problematic. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in widely different conditions and the fact that hyponatraemia is managed by clinicians with a broad variety of backgrounds have fostered diverse institution- and speciality-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment. To obtain a common and holistic view, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA), represented by European Renal Best Practice (ERBP), have developed the Clinical Practice Guideline on the diagnostic approach and treatment of hyponatraemia as a joint venture of three societies representing specialists with a natural interest in hyponatraemia. In addition to a rigorous approach to methodology and evaluation, we were keen to ensure that the document focused on patient-important outcomes and included utility for clinicians involved in everyday practice.

### Hyponatremia in the cancer patient [^1135vqck]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder observed in a wide variety of malignancies and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Newer cancer therapies have improved patient outcomes while contributing to new cases of hyponatremia. Patients should be monitored closely for the development of vasopressin- and non-vasopressin-mediated hyponatremia. Acute and symptomatic forms of hyponatremia require urgent intervention, and recent findings support the correction of chronic "asymptomatic" hyponatremia. Optimizing hyponatremia may reduce medical costs, and improve cancer survival likelihood and quality of life. In this article, we review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hyponatremia in the cancer patient.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for treatment of exercise-associated hyponatremia [^112cShEb]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) typically occurs during or up to 24 hours after prolonged physical activity, and is defined by a serum or plasma sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mEq/L. It is also reported to occur in individual physical activities or during organized endurance events conducted in austere environments in which medical care is limited or often not available, and patient evacuation to definitive care is often greatly delayed. Rapid recognition and appropriate treatment are essential in the severe form to ensure a positive outcome. Failure in this regard is a recognized cause of event-related fatality. In an effort to produce best practice guidelines for EAH in the austere environment, the Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel. The panel was charged with the development of evidence-based guidelines for management of EAH. Recommendations are made regarding the situations when sodium concentration can be assessed in the field and when these values are not known. These recommendations are graded based on the quality of supporting evidence and balance between the benefits and risks/burdens for each parameter according to the methodology stipulated by the American College of Chest Physicians.

### Hyponatremia: clinical diagnosis and management [^114nfxLE]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common clinical problem in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. It also may occur in healthy athletes after endurance exercise. The majority of patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic and do not require immediate correction of hyponatremia. Symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring rapid correction to prevent the worsening of brain edema. How fast we should increase the serum sodium levels depends on the onset of hyponatremia and still remains controversial. If the serum sodium levels are corrected too rapidly, patients may develop central pontine myelinolysis, but if they are corrected too slowly, patients may die of brain herniation. We review the epidemiology and mechanisms of hyponatremia, the sensitivity of women to hyponatremic injury, the adaptation and maladaptation of brain cells to hyponatremia and its correction, and the practical ways of managing hyponatremia. Because the majority of hyponatremia is caused by the non-osmotic release of vasopressin, the recent approval of the vasopressin receptor antagonist conivaptan for euvolemic hyponatremia may simplify hyponatremia management. However, physicians should be aware of the risk of rapid correction of hyponatremia, hypotension, and excessive fluid intake.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in cancer patients [^11621W7x]. The Oncologist (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, a common electrolyte abnormality in oncology practice, may be a negative prognostic factor in cancer patients based on a systematic analysis of published studies. The largest body of evidence comes from small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), for which hyponatremia was identified as an independent risk factor for poor outcome in six of 13 studies. Hyponatremia in the cancer patient is usually caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which develops more frequently with SCLC than with other malignancies. SIADH may be driven by ectopic production of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by tumors or by effects of anticancer and palliative medications on AVP production or action. Other factors may cause hypovolemic hyponatremia, including diarrhea and vomiting caused by cancer therapy. Hyponatremia may be detected on routine laboratory testing before or during cancer treatment or may be suggested by the presence of mostly neurological symptoms. Treatment depends on several factors, including symptom severity, onset timing, and extracellular volume status. Appropriate diagnosis is important because treatment differs by etiology, and choosing the wrong approach can worsen the electrolyte abnormality. When hyponatremia is caused by SIADH, hypertonic saline is indicated for acute, symptomatic cases, whereas fluid restriction is recommended to achieve a slower rate of correction for chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia. Pharmacological therapy may be necessary when fluid restriction is insufficient. The orally active, selective AVP receptor 2 (V(2))-receptor antagonist tolvaptan provides a mechanism-based option for correcting hyponatremia caused by SIADH or other conditions with inappropriate AVP elevations. By blocking AVP effects in the renal collecting duct, tolvaptan promotes aquaresis, leading to a controlled increase in serum sodium levels.
