## Question

Do babies get E. coli infection before, during, or after pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether babies get E. coli infection before, during, or after pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the timing of neonatal infection relative to birth, distinguishing early-onset sepsis (EOS) from late-onset sepsis (LOS). Then, I should verify the predominant sources and routes of transmission for EOS and LOS. Next, I will examine maternal colonization and intrapartum events that facilitate vertical transmission. After that, I need to check the evidence for in utero infection versus acquisition at birth. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note exceptions and risk modifiers like prematurity, mode of delivery, and antimicrobial exposure.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework. Neonatal E. coli infections are categorized as early-onset sepsis (EOS), typically defined as culture-proven infection within the first 72 hours of life, and late-onset sepsis (LOS), occurring after 72 hours, which frames the question of "before, during, or after pregnancy" into "before/during birth" versus "after birth" in practice.

> I will now examine EOS timing and sources. Wait, let me verify the dominant paradigm: EOS is classically due to maternal–fetal transmission, either in utero via ascending infection or intrapartum during passage through the birth canal, with E. coli now a leading EOS pathogen, especially in preterm infants, and with maternal colonization and peripartum risk factors (e.g., prolonged rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, intrapartum fever) increasing risk [^114niB9H] [^112xaFSe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "before pregnancy". I should confirm that "before pregnancy" in this context is not the relevant window for neonatal infection; the clinically meaningful exposures for EOS occur during late gestation and the intrapartum period, not prior to conception, so the correct phrasing is "before or during birth", not "before pregnancy" in the literal sense.

> Next, I should review LOS timing and sources. Let me think about this: LOS reflects postnatal acquisition from the environment (NICU, caregivers, community), with NICU exposures, indwelling devices, and community contacts as key sources; E. coli remains a common LOS pathogen in preterm infants, and molecular studies show invasive strains can be present in the gut prior to bloodstream invasion, supporting an environmental acquisition model for LOS [^117CnMhL] [^111js9bW] [^114niB9H].

> I need to check the evidence for vertical transmission and maternal reservoirs. High-quality cohorts demonstrate that maternal E. coli lineages frequently colonize neonates within days of life, particularly with vaginal delivery, indicating direct mother-to-infant transmission; maternal colonization with ESBL-producing E. coli and vaginal delivery are independent risk factors for neonatal colonization, and strain-level analyses confirm shared maternal–infant lineages in early life [^111E2RU7] [^111JonB7] [^111E2RU7].

> But wait, what if infection occurs in utero rather than solely at birth? Let me verify the evidence for ascending infection. Experimental models and clinical observations support that vaginal E. coli can ascend to the uterine cavity, precipitating preterm birth and neonatal inflammation, and case reports using molecular typing have documented maternal-to-neonate transmission of specific E. coli strains causing late-onset infection, reinforcing that vertical transmission can occur in utero or peripartum and manifest as EOS or, occasionally, LOS [^116cfH5u] [^113MV6NC].

> I should double-check the role of intrapartum antibiotics and resistance selection. Observational and surveillance data show that widespread intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS has coincided with a relative rise in E. coli EOS, with increased ampicillin resistance among E. coli isolates, particularly in preterm infants; this complicates empiric therapy and underscores that maternal antibiotic exposure can shape neonatal E. coli risk and resistance profiles [^115bzt3z] [^111F5VAk] [^113BCnjX].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. Babies acquire E. coli infection primarily during or immediately after birth via vertical transmission from maternal sources for EOS, and after birth from environmental sources for LOS; "before pregnancy" is not the operative window for neonatal infection risk, whereas "before or during birth" (ascending in utero or intrapartum) and "after birth" (nosocomial/community) are the clinically relevant periods [^114Tpy4T] [^111F5VAk] [^117CnMhL].

> Final answer: Babies get E. coli infection during or immediately after birth, not before pregnancy. Early-onset E. coli sepsis reflects vertical transmission from maternal colonization during late gestation and the intrapartum period, whereas late-onset E. coli sepsis reflects postnatal acquisition from the environment; in utero infection can occur via ascending pathways but remains encompassed within the perinatal window rather than a pre-pregnancy timeframe [^111F5VAk] [^111E2RU7] [^111js9bW] [^116cfH5u].

Babies acquire E. coli primarily during **birth** [^1114eKfj] via vertical transmission from maternal vaginal or gastrointestinal colonization, especially with vaginal delivery [^111JonB7] [^111E2RU7]. Early-onset E. coli infection (within 72 hours) is strongly linked to maternal colonization and intrapartum factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and maternal fever [^114niB9H] [^1161iHLy]. Late-onset infections (> 72 hours) are typically acquired postnatally from the environment, including hospital sources, caregivers, or contaminated equipment [^1162ZHDc] [^117PQzyi]. In utero transmission is rare but possible with ascending infection from the maternal genital tract [^116cfH5u]. Thus, most neonatal E. coli infections occur during or after birth, not before pregnancy [^114Tpy4T].

## Timing of E. coli infection in babies

Neonatal E. coli infections are classified by timing: **early-onset sepsis (EOS)** — occurring within 72 hours of birth — and **late-onset sepsis (LOS)** — occurring after 72 hours [^117CnMhL]. The timing reflects different transmission routes and risk factors [^114niB9H].

---

## Transmission of E. coli infection during pregnancy

E. coli is not typically transmitted to babies before pregnancy; however, **ascending infection** from the maternal genital tract into the uterus during pregnancy can lead to intrauterine infection, preterm labor, and neonatal infection [^116cfH5u]. This is more likely with prolonged rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, or maternal urinary tract infection [^114niB9H].

---

## Transmission of E. coli infection during birth

Most neonatal E. coli infections are acquired during birth through **vertical transmission** from maternal vaginal or gastrointestinal colonization [^1114eKfj]. Vaginal delivery significantly increases the risk compared with cesarean delivery [^111JonB7] [^116e2jee]. Early colonization often involves maternal strains, and early-onset infections are strongly associated with maternal colonization and intrapartum risk factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and maternal fever [^114niB9H] [^111E2RU7].

---

## Transmission of E. coli infection after birth

After birth, babies can acquire E. coli from the environment — including hospital sources, caregivers, or contaminated equipment — leading to **late-onset infections** [^111js9bW] [^117PQzyi]. NICU exposure, central venous catheters, mechanical ventilation, and prolonged hospitalization increase this risk [^1139tZSW].

---

## Summary of E. coli transmission timing

| **Timing** | **Transmission route** | **Risk factors** |
|-|-|-|
| During pregnancy | Ascending infection from maternal genital tract | - Prolonged rupture of membranes <br/> - Chorioamnionitis <br/> - Maternal UTI |
| During birth | Vertical transmission from maternal colonization | - Vaginal delivery <br/> - Maternal colonization <br/> - Prolonged rupture of membranes <br/> - Chorioamnionitis <br/> - Maternal fever |
| After birth | Environmental exposure (hospital, caregivers, equipment) | - NICU admission <br/> - Central venous catheters <br/> - Mechanical ventilation <br/> - Prolonged hospitalization |

---

## Clinical implications and prevention strategies

Understanding these transmission routes informs prevention: **intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis** for mothers with risk factors, strict infection control in NICUs, and early identification and treatment of maternal colonization or infection [^1153QCKX] [^111rvKv1]. Maternal vaccination against E. coli is under investigation and may reduce neonatal infections [^113sasy5] [^112KsuQX].

---

Babies acquire E. coli primarily during birth via maternal colonization, with additional risk from intrapartum factors; after birth, environmental exposure drives late-onset infections. In utero transmission is rare but possible with ascending maternal infection.

### Virulence potential of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolated during the perinatal period [^115LjynB]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The fecal screening for ESBL-producing E. coli conducted here revealed a relatively high perinatal colonization frequency, with 18% detected in mothers and 5% in newborns within days after delivery. The overall occurrence of virulence factors associated with extraintestinal infections was significantly lower in fecal isolates compared with those from extraintestinal sources. It is reassuring that the ESBL-producing E. coli from our study exhibit fewer virulence traits compared with invasive isolates. This is consistent with findings from Rottier et al, where the positive predictive value of fecal carriage of Enterobacteriaceae with ESBL to develop symptomatic infection was relatively low.

The establishment of serious invasive infections in neonates with the opportunistic pathogen E. coli is mainly caused by bacterial translocation from the intestine to the bloodstream. The prerequisites for this process are successful bacterial colonization of the gut and effective interaction of the bacteria with the host. Shortly after birth, a newborn rapidly acquires colonization, primarily from the mother's microbiome. Isolates from phylogroup non-B2 are less frequently associated with invasive infections and are often considered true commensals of the gut. In contrast, E. coli from phylogroup B2 not only possesses acquired virulence factors, providing them with the prerequisites for invasiveness but has also been linked to persistent colonization of the intestine and invasive infections.

Screening for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in neonatal intensive care units is commonly justified to increase awareness for outbreak-preventing strategies, given the catastrophic consequences of uncontrolled spread. Moreover, adequate treatment of ESBL-producing isolates in an individual can be life-saving when a symptomatic infection arises. However, the understanding of the risk of symptomatic infection attributable to intestinal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae remains limited. In recent years, it has been acknowledged that patients and their caregivers may undergo feelings of worry, anxiety, or stigma upon receiving positive test results and guidance from health care providers regarding the implications of ESBL colonization in the gut can facilitate coping.

### Whole-genome sequencing of invasive neonatal Escherichia coli from uppsala county, Sweden [^114niB9H]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Escherichia coli bloodstream infections present a substantial challenge within neonatal care and are acknowledged to be an important global public health concern. In particular, the incidence of early-onset infections — occurring within the first 72 hours after delivery — have risen among extremely premature infants born before 28 gestational weeks. Identified risk factors for early-onset E. coli infection in neonates are intrapartum fever, prolonged rupture of membranes, and chorioamnionitis, and it is associated with prematurity.

In contrast, late-onset infections, which manifest after 72 hours postnatally and are caused by invasive E. coli, are more often linked to compromised barrier defenses that lead to severe conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis or birth defects that contribute to infections in the urinary tract. Additionally, an extended stay in the intensive care unit heightens the risk for nosocomial infections due to gram-negative rods such as E. coli. The widely adopted prevention strategies for neonatal infections involve risk stratification and antibiotic treatment policies for both mother and child. However, these approaches pose challenges in balancing the risks associated with the spread of antimicrobial resistance and the prevention of infections in a vulnerable patient group.

E. coli is renowned for its highly adaptable pathogenic nature, and its pathovars are well-adapted to diverse ecological niches. Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) are responsible for infections in typically sterile body sites such as the bloodstream and urinary tract, or neonatal meningitis. These strains are disproportionately found in phylogenetic groups B2 and D. A multitude of virulence factors contribute to the pathogenicity of ExPEC isolates. Interestingly, when present in phylogroups A and B1, commonly associated with commensalism, these virulence factors can lead to lethal infection in mice.

This study sought to investigate associations between a broad spectrum of virulence factors and phylogeny in all neonatal E. coli bloodstream infections from patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Uppsala University Hospital between 2005 and 2020, and to examine relationships with neonatal characteristics.

Results

Non- E. coli infections

Neonates with infections of non- E. coli aetiology were characterised by better general condition at birth (Table 1) than neonates with E. coli infections. Significantly fewer infants had adverse perinatal outcomes, such as PROM or chorioamnionitis, while significantly more newborns were delivered by caesarean section. The fatality rate of newborns with non- E. coli infections was two times lower than in those with E. coli infections.

Escherichia coli infections

The incidence of E. coli infections was 5.4% and 2.0/1,000 patient-days. EOIs accounted for 12.2% of all infections and late-onset infections (LOIs) accounted for 10.5%. The incidence of EOIs was 1.7% and LOIs was 3.7%. The occurrence of E. coli infections (both EOI and LOI) depended significantly on the NICU (χ² = 73,836; p < 0.0001) and varied between 3.9% and 17.9%. The most common E. coli infection was pneumonia (53.1%) and bloodstream infection (40.6%). Escherichia coli infections were diagnosed at day 17 on average (median: 12 days).

The mean length of hospitalisation (from birth to discharge, or until a weight of 1.8 kg was reached) of newborns with non- E. coli infections was significantly shorter: 48 versus 55 days (infants with E. coli infection).

The gestational age and birth weight of newborns with E. coli infections were lower than in those without infection or with other infections (Table 1). The other risk factors of E. coli infections were: low Apgar 1 and Apgar 5 scores, total parenteral nutrition, chorioamnionitis, or PROM diagnosed during pregnancy or delivery (Table 1).

Caesarean section reduced the risk of E. coli infection, although perinatal antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) (no standardised protocol) did not reduce the risk of infection; that is, despite the use of PAP, E. coli infections were observed significantly more frequently (Table 1).

### Mode of delivery and other risk factors for Escherichia coli infections in very low birth weight infants [^112Dh9sk]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Infections in newborns, particularly those with very low birth weight of < 1.5 kg, remain one of the most significant problems in modern medicine. Escherichia coli is an important cause of neonatal bloodstream and respiratory tract infections and is associated with high mortality.

In late-onset infection, E. coli may be acquired from the mother or the environment and may enter the bloodstream from the urinary or gastrointestinal tract. Several studies have demonstrated a high rate of transmission of E. coli within families and households. Escherichia coli species comprise commensal strains, intestinal pathogenic strains and others that cause infections outside the gastrointestinal system, such as extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. Extra-intestinal infections due to E. coli are common in all age groups and include bacteremia, urinary tract infection, meningitis (mostly in neonates), nosocomial pneumonia and others.

Cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are widely used to treat infections caused by E. coli and resistance to these agents is responsible for treatment failure. The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) among E. coli isolates is also of concern.

Enterobacteriaceae-producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) have emerged as serious pathogens in hospitals and have been increasingly implicated in nosocomial outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). They have important therapeutic implications as they exhibit resistance to several antimicrobial agents, including third-generation cephalosporins, extended-spectrum penicillin and monobactam. Carbapenems and cephamycins represent the only classes of antibiotics active against ESBLs.

Escherichia coli has been reported as one of the major causes of neonatal infections that may cause high morbidity and mortality. Potential risk factors of E. coli neonatal infections have also been analysed.

Considering the increasing antimicrobial resistance and mortality in NICUs, there is an urgent need to understand the epidemiology and risk factors of E. coli infections. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the epidemiology of infections caused by E. coli in five Polish NICUs, resistance to antibiotics and potential risk factors that may contribute to such infections (E. coli infections were compared with infections caused by other bacteria). We also considered the possibility of using data on E. coli infection in assessing the quality of perinatal care. All these data may contribute to infection prevention and better control, and the routes of transmission of E. coli were also evaluated.

### Strong pathogen competition in neonatal gut colonisation [^1114eKfj]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Neonatal gut colonisation of E. coli adheres to the first-come, first-served principle

A more detailed analysis was carried out to scrutinise the possible variation across the time points the E. coli lineages appear to colonise the neonatal gut and to what degree they are inherited from the mother. In addition, we examined whether the lineages that are successful within the first 21 days persist in the infancy period sampling 4–12 months later. Examining the colonisation-time trajectories for each individual, we found the colonisation typically to already haven taken place at the very first sampling time at 4 days in the vaginal delivery cohort (Fig. 4a; 88 out of total 314 in the cohort were colonised at 4 days, 184 of whom were detected to carry E. coli at some point in the first 21 days). In the subsequent sampling point at 7 days after birth nearly all of the infants who had detectable amounts of E. coli at any time point were colonised (150 out of 184; Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2a) and 66 of the infants were carrying the lineage that was also observed at 4 days. In the remaining 22 individuals out of the total 88 carrying E. coli at 4 days, in 3 cases, the lineage identified at 4 days had been replaced by another lineage and in 19 cases, no E. coli was present in detectable amounts at 7 days.

### A live attenuated vaccine to prevent severe neonatal Escherichia coli K1 infections [^113sasy5]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Preterm birth is currently the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Genetic, immunological and infectious causes are suspected. Preterm infants have a higher risk of severe bacterial neonatal infections, most of which are caused by Escherichia coli an in particular E. coli K1strains. Women with history of preterm delivery have a high risk of recurrence and therefore constitute a target population for the development of vaccine against E. coli neonatal infections. Here, we characterize the immunological, microbiological and protective properties of a live attenuated vaccine candidate in adult female mice and their pups against after a challenge by K1 and non-K1 strains of E. coli. Our results show that the E. coli K1 E11 ∆aroA vaccine induces strong immunity, driven by polyclonal bactericidal antibodies. In our model of meningitis, mothers immunized prior to mating transfer maternal antibodies to pups, which protect newborn mice against various K1 and non-K1 strains of E. coli. Given the very high mortality rate and the neurological sequalae associated with neonatal E. coli K1 meningitis, our results constitute preclinical proof of concept for the development of a live attenuated vaccine against severe E. coli infections in women at risk of preterm delivery.

### Beyond early-and late-onset neonatal sepsis definitions: what are the current causes of neonatal sepsis globally? A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence [^114Tpy4T]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The global child mortality rate is declining, yet mortality remains high for the vulnerable neonatal population, with 47% of deaths in children under 5 occurring in the first 28 days of life. The third greatest contributor to neonatal mortality is neonatal infection, including sepsis and meningitis, resulting in up to 570,000 sepsis-attributable deaths each year.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals have called for the end of preventable child deaths by 2030. The success of this goal is highly dependent on the effective treatment and prevention of neonatal infections. In the context of burgeoning global antimicrobial resistance (AMR), understanding the evolving epidemiology and etiology of neonatal sepsis is paramount.

It has long been considered that early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) — that is, sepsis occurring within the first 72 hours after birth — is predominantly caused by vertical transmission of bacteria (typically Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli) from mother to infant, either in utero or during birth, Conversely, late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS), occurring at > 72 hours of life, is considered to be acquired by nosocomial or community sources of infection. However, recent studies have reported a potential epidemiological shift in the causative pathogens responsible for EOS, with an increase in the proportion of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria responsible for systemic neonatal infections evident from the first day of life, accompanied by concerning AMR profiles previously evident in infants with hospital-acquired LOS.

The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests the early administration of empirical antibiotics following a clinical diagnosis of neonatal sepsis, which is not defined in its timing of acquisition in their guidelines (by EOS or LOS), but rather recommends ampicillin/benzylpenicillin and gentamicin as first-line treatment regimens, and third-generation cephalosporins as an alternative agent, for treating neonatal sepsis. However, these empirical recommendations are based on data on the presumed causative pathogens of neonatal sepsis that are largely derived from high-income countries (HIC). However, with 98% of the neonatal sepsis mortality burden arising from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and with mounting evidence to suggest differing etiologies of the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal infection between high- and low-resourced healthcare settings, improving the understanding of the causative pathogens driving neonatal sepsis is essential.

### Predictors of mortality and severe illness from Escherichia coli sepsis in neonates [^112EwnGh]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

E. coli neonatal sepsis accounts for a more significant proportion of cases since the widespread adoption of GBS IAP prophylaxis and subsequent reduction in GBS EOS cases. This is reflected in our study, where the incidence rate of E. coli sepsis has increased almost three-fold from 2008–2012 to 2018–2022, despite a similar number of births throughout the entire period. We hypothesize this is predominantly attributable to a global increase in E. coli infection in the community, particularly resistant strains. This could potentially lead to increased maternal colonization, leading to more EOS cases, and increased nosocomial transmission, leading to more LOS cases. Although the mortality from E. coli disease did not increase in our cohort during this period, the increase in the number of cases is still of concern as the median duration of antibiotic use in infants who survived after E. coli sepsis was 21 days. On further chart review, a significant number of the cases where CSF studies could not be obtained due to infant instability were subjected to 21 days of antibiotics for possible meningitis. This is particularly concerning as recent epidemiologic studies have shown that every day of antibiotic exposure in neonates increases mortality and risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In addition, neonatal EOS and LOS may lead to long-term neurodevelopmental impairments in survivors, both in humans and in animal models of disease. This is one of the few studies to report the factors associated with the composite outcome of mortality or severe illness from E. coli sepsis.

### Can breastfeeding protect against antimicrobial resistance? [^111kdYbU]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacterial infections are becoming increasingly common across the globe. As many as 162,000 US adults currently die from multidrug-resistant bacterial infections each year, making resistant infections the third leading cause of death. A 2019 UN report described antimicrobial resistance as a global crisis, with potential for knock-on financial shocks due to increasing healthcare costs, poverty, and inequality comparable to those experienced during the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. Morbidity and mortality stemming from antimicrobial resistance are expected to be highest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where bacterial diseases like lower respiratory infections, diarrheal disease, and tuberculosis remain common.

Infants are particularly susceptible to the potential negative consequences of AMR infections. Evidence suggests that young children may be colonized or infected with enteric AMR pathogens early in life. Presence and elevated abundance of AMR pathogens in the intestinal tract are risk factors for transmission to non-enteric sites (e.g. blood, surgical sites), horizontal transfer to other individuals, and vertical transmission from mothers to their infants. Neonatal infections with highly resistant pathogens like extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, which are considered an urgent health threat by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have been documented across the globe and have become increasingly prevalent over the past decade. Children under two are also one of the likeliest age groups to receive antibiotics. Frequent antibiotic exposures may increase the relative abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) harbored by gut bacteria, and foster a gut environment supportive of their transfer to pathogens.

### A live attenuated vaccine to prevent severe neonatal Escherichia coli K1 infections [^112KsuQX]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

A limitation of our study is related to the transplacental transfer of IgG to the human fetus that occurs mainly during the last trimester of pregnancy and only reaches around 50% between 28- and 32 weeks' gestation. Therefore, while late preterm and at term neonates could potentially benefit greatly from the strategy described in this work, extremely preterm neonates born after < 28 weeks gestation would probably benefit only to a limited extent from these protective maternal antibodies.

Another limitation of our study is the lack of evidence that prematurely born mice would be adequately be protected against severe E. coli infections. Further follow-up studies in larger preterm mammals, beyond the scope of this current work, may be able to prove this concept in the future.

However, despite these limitations, our study provides an excellent preclinical proof of concept that maternal immunization with our attenuated live vaccine can protect neonates against severe E. coli infections.

Given the very high mortality rate and the neurological sequalae associated with neonatal E. coli K1 meningitis in preterm infants, our results constitute preclinical proof of concept for the development of a live attenuated vaccine against severe E. coli infections in women at risk of preterm delivery. The strategy we suggest, would be to vaccinate women at high risk of preterm delivery and more particularly those with a history of preterm delivery who envisage a new pregnancy. The benefits of such vaccination could be multiple. They mainly concern the newborns through passive protection against E. coli K1 infections, but potentially also by reducing preterm delivery related to maternal infection. Finally, our approach could also protect the mothers from E. coli sepsis during pregnancy.

Given that (i) women having already given birth prematurely have a very high risk of a subsequent preterm delivery (in turn associated with a greater risk of severe neonatal infections), (ii) the most common severe neonatal infection of this type is bacterial meningitis, and (iii) E. coli in general and E. coli K1 strains in particular constitute the most frequent cause of neonatal meningitis in this population, our results constitute strong preclinical proof-of-concept for the development of a preconceptionally administered attenuated vaccine in this target population.

### Predictors of mortality and severe illness from Escherichia coli sepsis in neonates [^117CnMhL]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal bacterial infections have significant morbidity and mortality, with an estimated annual 6.3 million cases and 230,000 deaths globally. In the United States, the incidence of neonatal bacterial sepsis varies between one and four per 1000 live births (LBs). Neonatal sepsis is categorized into early-onset (EOS, infants ≤ 72 h old) and late-onset sepsis (LOS, infants > 72 h). EOS classically represents maternal-to-fetal transmission, while most LOS are nosocomial or community-acquired. As antenatal Group B Streptococcus (GBS) screening and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) have led to significantly decreased GBS EOS, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is now one of the predominant organisms responsible for EOS. Within the National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network (NRN) neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), 36.6% of EOS cases are due to E. coli (0.4 per 1000 live births), compared to 30.2% from GBS. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Active Bacterial Core surveillance data from 2005 to 2014 reported that 24.8% of EOS (0.2 per 1000 live births) in the US were E. coli infections. The E. coli fraction of EOS cases increases to 58% (NRN) and 44% (CDC) for very low birth weight (VLBW, < 1500 g BW) infants. E. coli is also the leading Gram-negative organism in LOS (5–12%) in preterm infants in the US. E. coli sepsis in neonates is associated with substantial mortality, which is influenced by the gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), and immune status of the neonate.

### Early-onset infection caused by Escherichia coli sequence type 1193 in late preterm and full-term neonates [^112pSkTJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae are bacterial pathogens that commonly cause early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) in industrialized countries. EOS is confirmed by a blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture positive for the causative pathogen < 72 hours after birth. EOS incidence is ≈1/1,000 live births; 10% of cases are complicated by meningitis, which can lead to neurologic sequelae in up to 50% and death in 10% of cases in industrialized countries.

EOS caused by S. agalactiae can be prevented by peripartum antimicrobial prophylaxis but not EOS caused by E. coli. E. coli strains that cause neonatal meningitis have been well characterized, but E. coli strains that cause EOS less so. Neonatal meningitis E. coli strains belong mainly to phylogenetic group B2/sequence type complex (STc) 95 and are frequently O18:K1, O1:K1, O83:K1, or O45 S88 :K1 serotypes. Most STc95 strains are distributed worldwide and still largely susceptible to antimicrobials. However, other strains that can cause EOS, notably in preterm neonates, might be resistant to probabilistic antimicrobial therapy. In a recent study in Israel, maternal carriage rates of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing E. coli were 17.5% for mothers and 12.9% for preterm neonates; in China, ESBL accounted for up to 48% of E. coli infections in neonates.

### Mode of delivery and other risk factors for Escherichia coli infections in very low birth weight infants [^112mwWd7]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

The mode of delivery seems to be a protective factor against E. coli infections and also supports the hypothesis on maternal–neonatal transmission. About 17.9% of neonates without infections were born vaginally, compared with 35.4% of those with E. coli infection. The vagina is a significant reservoir of E. coli, which can be critical in vertical transmission of E. coli infection. Our results indicate that perinatal factors and vaginal transmission may also significantly affect the epidemiology of E. coli infection, including LOI, which could be important for control of hospital-acquired infections.

In our study, the fatality rate of E. coli infections was almost twice as high as that of infections of other aetiology. The reason for this was mainly the high pathogenicity of E. coli: the majority of tested strains belonged to one of two virulence groups (B2, 68.9%, or D, 17.8%). Isolates from the B2 group had significantly more virulence genes than isolates from other groups; in particular, fim H, sfa, ire A, fhu A, fyu A and fep A genes were more likely to occur. Similarly, 36.6% of strains belonged to the ST131 clone and showed a high level of virulence and resistance, which could play an important role in the epidemiological success of this sequence type. Clonal group ST131 contained slightly more than one-third of the studied isolates and had a link to ESBL production.

Among ESBL-positive isolates, which accounted for 27.7% of all isolates, higher levels of resistance to aminoglycosides and also ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were observed compared with non-ESBL isolates. The higher level of resistance may contribute to the fact that such resistance is localised mainly on plasmids and may be easily transferred not only among E. coli isolates, but also among isolates belonging to other species. Using of one of the antibiotics (β-lactam, aminoglycoside, or fluoroquinolones) may lead to the co-selection of fluoroquinolone resistance by β-lactams or aminoglycosides, and vice versa β-lactams or aminoglycoside resistance by fluoroquinolones.

### New and old lessons from a devastating case of neonatal E. coli meningitis [^1162ZHDc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal E coli sepsis results in high morbidity and mortality due to complex host and environmental factors, but early identification and appropriate treatment limits progression to meningitis and/or significant parenchymal damage (encephalitis). Recurrence or relapse of CNS infection is a well-recognized entity of neonatal E coli meningitis with increased risk associated with the K1 virulence factor and signs of complicated infection (abnormalities on brain imaging: ventriculitis, abscess or clinical signs of CNS infection: seizures or altered mental status). Therefore, repeat LP to document sterility prior to the end of antibiotics has been a longstanding recommendation.

Neonatal EOS presents within the first 72 h of life. Late onset sepsis (LOS) presents in the first 4 to 28 days of life. EOS pathogens colonize the infant as they pass through the vaginal canal. Risk of EOS increases with prolonged rupture of membranes and maternal fever or infection. Conversely, LOS pathogens are obtained from the neonates' environment with significantly increased risk of severe infection for very low birthweight premature infants. Group B Streptococcal (GBS) and E coli are the most common pathogens responsible for EOS, with E coli rates rising, while a variety of gram positive and negative species are responsible for LOS without a particular pathogen predominance. Empiric therapy for EOS is generally ampicillin and gentamicin. If meningitis is a concern, cefotaxime or cefepime are recommended with ampicillin; gentamicin has limited CNS penetration due to its large, hydrophilic nature. Consequently, aminoglycosides can be used as an adjunct but are not reliable as the primary treatment for meningitis. Recommendations for empiric antibiotic therapy for LOS now include a broad-spectrum 3rd or 4th generation cephalosporin ± vancomycin due to the wide range of causative bacterial organisms and concerns for highly pathogenic gram-negative organisms. However, recommendations for empiric therapy for EOS continue to be ampicillin and gentamicin.

### Mode of delivery and other risk factors for Escherichia coli infections in very low birth weight infants [^116wQX9Y]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study showed that there are some risk factors that should be considered during perinatal care. Routine screening of mothers and newborns for E. coli should be implemented in maternity care to decrease morbidity and mortality. Pre-partum hospitalisation for premature labour should be an indication for screening by rectal swabs, prenatally and on the day of birth. Unfortunately, the presented data indicate that PAP in the presence of symptoms such as chorioamnionitis and PROM did not help to reduce the risk of E. coli infections. Multivariate analysis demonstrated only one significant risk factor for E. coli infection among infants with a birth weight < 1.5 kg, namely, the impact of the NICU.

### Evidence for transmission of Escherichia coli from mother to child in late-onset neonatal infection [^113MV6NC]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Genetic characterization of non-K1 Escherichia coli strains isolated from a mother and her neonate allowed us to provide evidence of the maternal origin of a late-onset neonatal infection. The use of ante- and peripartum antimicrobial prophylaxis with amoxicillin may have promoted the vertical transmission of this amoxicillin-resistant E. coli from mother to newborn. It allowed us to clarify the natural history of the disease.

### Temporal dynamics and microbial interactions shaping the gut resistome in early infancy [^111E2RU7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Birth mode associated with absolute E. coli abundance in early life (Supplementary Fig. 6a), with a higher E. coli load in vaginally vs. caesarean section delivered infants at 2 months. Furthermore, among the vaginally delivered children, the absolute E. coli abundance was significantly higher at 3 weeks and 6 months of age in those born at home.

To investigate a potential direct transfer of E. coli from the mother during delivery, we performed a strain similarity analysis for the E. coli strains. The strain profile of each sample was defined based on single-nucleotide variants, and we deemed two samples to share identical E. coli strains when the population average nucleotide identity between their E. coli strains was higher than 99.999%. Low abundance of E. coli in some samples prohibited robust calling of the strain variant, and thus, it was not possible to compare strain similarity between all mother-infant dyads. We were able to compare 13 mother-infant pairs at, at least, one early life time point until 6 months. Six mother–infant pairs shared E. coli strains, including all four home deliveries (Fig. 4b). This indicates that vertical transfer of E. coli strains from the mother to the child is frequent during vaginal delivery, which is in line with previous findings.

### Early onset sepsis [^1136s7QM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Early onset sepsis (EOS) is a blood stream infection that occurs, by varying definitions, during a neonate's first 3 or 7 days of life. In the United States, Streptococcus agalactiae and Escherichia coli are the most common pathogens associated with EOS. Worldwide, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, and Staphylococcus aureus are also common etiologies. Early recognition of risk factors and clinical concerns for EOS facilitates timely treatment. Current research is focusing on ways to reduce unnecessary treatment of infants with risk factors for EOS without true infection, while still appropriately detecting and treating infants with EOS.

### Mode of delivery and other risk factors for Escherichia coli infections in very low birth weight infants [^116y56ea]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Infections in newborns remain one of the most significant problems in modern medicine. Escherichia coli is an important cause of neonatal bloodstream and respiratory tract infections and is associated with high mortality. The aim of our study was to investigate the epidemiology of E. coli infection in Polish neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and resistance to antibiotics, with particular reference to the safety of very low birth weight infants.

Methods

Continuous prospective infection surveillance was conducted in 2009–2012 in five NICUs, including 1,768 newborns whose birth weight was < 1.5 kg. Escherichia coli isolates from different diagnostic specimens including blood, tracheal/bronchial secretions and others were collected. All isolates were tested using disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility methods. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the possible horizontal transfer of E. coli among patients.

Results

The incidence of E. coli infections was 5.4% and 2.0/1,000 patient-days. The occurrence of E. coli infections depended significantly on the NICU and varied between 3.9% and 17.9%. Multivariate analysis that took into account the combined effect of demographic data (gender, gestational age and birth weight) and place of birth showed that only the place of hospitalisation had a significant effect on the E. coli infection risk. The highest levels of resistance among all E. coli isolates were observed against ampicillin (88.8%) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (62.2%). Among E. coli isolates, 17.7% were classified as multidrug resistant. Escherichia coli isolates showed different pulsotypes and dominant epidemic clones were not detected.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that antibiotic prophylaxis in the presence of symptoms such as chorioamnionitis and premature rupture of membranes did not help reduce the risk of E. coli infection. Multivariate analysis demonstrated only one significant risk factor for E. coli infection among infants with a birth weight < 1.5 kg, that is, the impact of the NICU, it means that both neonatal care and care during pregnancy and labour were found to be significant.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: the diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^112s7Yvq]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

AAP clinical practice guideline — Action Statement 3 (criteria to establish UTI): To establish the diagnosis of UTI, clinicians should require both urinalysis results that suggest infection (pyuria and/or bacteriuria) and the presence of at least 50 000 colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter of a uropathogen cultured from a urine specimen obtained through transurethral catheterization or SPA (evidence quality: C; recommendation). The comment emphasizes that the diagnosis of UTI in febrile infants is signaled by the presence of both bacteriuria and pyuria, that pyuria without bacteriuria is insufficient to make a diagnosis of UTI, and that bacteriuria without pyuria is attributable to contamination, asymptomatic bacteriuria, or very early infection; non-Escherichia coli isolates are less frequently associated with pyuria than E coli and non-E coli uropathogens are of concern because they are more likely to result in scarring than E coli, although animal studies indicate host inflammatory response drives scarring and the rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria can account for the lack of association with pyuria.

### Antibiotic susceptibility of Escherichia coli among infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units across the US from 2009 to 2017 [^113BCnjX]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Escherichia coli is a leading cause of serious infection among term and preterm newborn infants. Surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility patterns of E coli among infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units should inform empirical antibiotic administration.

Objective

To assess the epidemiologic characteristics and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of E coli in infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units in the US over time.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used the Premier Health Database, a comprehensive administrative database of inpatient encounters from academic and community hospitals across the US. Participants included newborn infants admitted to centers contributing microbiology data from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2017, with E coli isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine cultures. Data were collected and analyzed from December 1, 2018, to November 30, 2019.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Changes in annual antibiotic susceptibility of E coli during the study period. The proportion of infants with nonsusceptible organisms (resistant or intermediate susceptibility) in antibiotic categories by year, birth weight, infection source, and timing of infection and patient and center characteristics associated with neonatal E coli infection and antibiotic susceptibility were assessed.

Results

A total of 721 infants (434 male [60.2%]; median age at E coli infection, 14 days [interquartile range, 1–33 days]) from 69 centers had at least 1 episode of E coli infection and available susceptibility results. No significant changes were observed over time in the overall annual proportions of antibiotic nonsusceptibility to ampicillin (mean [SD], 66.8% [1.5%]; range, 63.3% to 68.6%; estimated yearly change, -0.28% [95% CI, -1.75% to 1.18%]), nonsusceptibility to aminoglycosides (mean [SD], 16.8% [4.5%]; range, 10.7% to 23.2%; estimated yearly change, -0.85% [95% CI, -1.93% to 0.23%]), or extended-spectrum β-lactamase phenotype (mean [SD], 5.0% [3.7%]; range, 0% to 11.1%; estimated yearly change, 0.46% [95% CI, -0.18% to 1.11%]). No isolates with nonsusceptibility to carbapenems were identified. Among 218 infants with early-onset infection, 22 (10.1%) had isolates with nonsusceptibility to both ampicillin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to newborns as empirical therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, nonsusceptibility to commonly administered antibiotics was found in substantial proportions of neonatal E coli isolates, with no significant change from 2009 to 2017. These findings may inform empirical antibiotic choices for newborn infants.

### Early-onset infection caused by Escherichia coli sequence type 1193 in late preterm and full-term neonates [^113asCgW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Characterizing E. coli strains that cause EOS would constitute a critical first step towards better understanding the pathophysiology of this condition and developing potential preventive strategies. We conducted a prospective study covering a large area in France to estimate annual incidence and pathogen distribution of EOS in neonates born at ≥ 34 weeks of gestation during 2019–2021. In total, we recorded 107 cases of bacteremia including 35 caused by E. coli, 15 (incidence 0.89/1,000 births) in late-preterm and 20 (0.06/1,000 births) in full-term infants. We prospectively recorded data on maternal and infant demographics, maternal antimicrobial therapy, peripartum antimicrobial prophylaxis, and outcomes. We aimed to use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize E. coli strains that caused EOS in cases from this prospective study and stratify results according to these data. In addition, we determined to compare those strains to E. coli strains obtained from cultures from vaginal swabs collected to screen for S. agalactiae carriage at 34–38 weeks of gestation from woman with newborns who had no history of EOS. The ethics committee institutional review board (Ramsay Santé Recherche & Enseignement, IRB00010835) authorized the study.

### Predictors of mortality and severe illness from Escherichia coli sepsis in neonates [^111ZzgDs]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Neonatal Escherichia coli (E. coli) sepsis is increasing. There is limited data on the factors contributing to increased mortality and severity of illness in neonatal E. coli sepsis. A retrospective review of neonates (< 30 days) admitted to a Level IV NICU in the United States from 2008 to 2022 diagnosed with E. coli bloodstream or cerebrospinal fluid infection was conducted. Primary outcome was defined as mortality from or severe illness during E. coli infection (defined as a need for inotropic support or metabolic acidosis). E. coli neonatal sepsis rate increased from 2008 to 2022 (average of 1.12 per 1000 live births). The primary outcome, which occurred in 57.4% of cases, was independently associated with prematurity, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Ampicillin resistance was not associated with the primary outcome. GA, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia but not ampicillin resistance, are associated with mortality or severe illness from E. coli sepsis.

### Prevalence and antibiotic resistance pattern of bacteria from sepsis suspected neonates at st. paul's hospital millennium medical college, addis ababa, Ethiopia [^116VgymH]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal sepsis is a bloodstream infection that occurs in infants less than 28 days of life. It is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality among neonates, especially in resource limited countries. Several literatures define neonatal sepsis as either early-onset or late-onset, depending on the symptoms occur before or after 72 h of life. Early onset sepsis (EOS) is defined as sepsis occurs less than or equal to three days of birth, and is caused by microorganisms occur in the maternal genital tract before or at the time of birth. Premature and low birth weight, infection during pregnancy, vaginal colonization with Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and lack of appropriate antenatal care are frequently reported risk factors of early-onset sepsis. Based on global report, the incidence rate of early-onset sepsis is almost three times that of late-onset sepsis, and 70% of the causative etiological agents are mainly GBs and E.coli. However, intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce significantly the incidence of GBS in newborns.

Late-onset sepsis (LOS) begins after three days of life, mainly due to bacteria carried from the hospital or the society at the time of delivery. It is usually associated with hospital and community acquired bacterial infections including intravenous catheterization. Most of these risk factors are preventable through early diagnosis and timely appropriate clinical management. The most common etiological agents are Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS), E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the distribution of bacteria causing neonatal sepsis varies from country to country and even with the same geographical locations. Globally, neonatal sepsis is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the first 4 weeks of life with an estimated annual death rate of 400,000 to 700,000, and accounts 15% of all neonatal deaths. Of these, around 42% of neonatal deaths occurred in the first week of life. It is also the third most common cause of neonatal mortality. In developing countries, nearly 50% of neonatal death is due to sepsis and the highest neonatal death rate has been reported from Sub-Saharan Africa with 27 deaths/1000 live births.

### Early-onset sepsis among very preterm infants [^112xaFSe]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the epidemiology and microbiology of early-onset sepsis (EOS) among very preterm infants using a nationally representative cohort from academic and community hospitals to inform empirical antibiotic guidance, highlight risk factors for infection, and aid in prognostication for infected infants.

Methods

Prospective observational study of very preterm infants born weighing 401 to 1500 g or at 22 to 29 weeks' gestational age from January 2018 to December 2019 in 753 Vermont Oxford Network centers. EOS was defined as a culture-confirmed bacterial infection of the blood or cerebrospinal fluid in the 3 days after birth. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were compared between infants with and without EOS.

Results

Of 84333 included infants, 1139 had EOS for an incidence rate of 13.5 per 1000 very preterm births (99% confidence interval [CI] 12.5–14.6). Escherichia coli (538 of 1158; 46.5%) and group B Streptococcus (218 of 1158; 18.8%) were the most common pathogens. Infected infants had longer lengths of stay (median 92 vs 66 days) and lower rates of survival (67.5% vs 90.4%; adjusted risk ratio 0.82 [95% CI 0.79–0.85]) and of survival without morbidity (26.1% vs 59.4%; adjusted risk ratio 0.66 [95% CI 0.60–0.72]).

Conclusions

In a nationally representative sample of very preterm infants with EOS from 2018 to 2019, approximately one-third of isolates were neither group B Streptococcus nor E coli. Three-quarters of all infected infants either died or survived with a major medical morbidity. The profoundly negative impact of EOS on very preterm infants highlights the need for novel preventive strategies.

### Whole-genome sequencing of invasive neonatal Escherichia coli from uppsala county, Sweden [^116743zL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patients

During the 15-year period (2005–2020), in 14 very premature neonates (gestational age 21.8–26.3 weeks), 10 premature neonates (28.3–35.8 weeks), and 8 full-term neonates (36.7–42 weeks) E. coli blood stream infections were identified. For all 32 neonates, information on gestational age, weight, and sex were accessible. The neonates were born at a median gestational age of 29.6 weeks (range, 21.8 to 42 weeks) with a medium weight of 1140 g (range, 417 to 4080 g) corresponding to 7 of 32 (22%) infants being small for gestational age (below −1.5 × standard deviation), 22 of 32 (69%) being appropriate for their gestational age, and 2 of 32 (6%) being large for their gestational age (above 1.5 × standard deviation). More neonates were male (22/32, 69%) than female (10/32, 31%).

For 1 patient, no record was accessible, thus information on mortality, symptoms, and other clinical conditions was available for 20 of 31 neonates (65%) that survived and 11 of 31 (35%) deceased neonates. A summary of the patient data and virulence factors is given in Table 2; no association between gestational age or mortality and chorioamnionitis or urinary tract infection was seen (Table 2).

General Comments on Bacterial Analysis

Bacteria

A total of 37 isolates were cultured from 32 neonates; 29 of 32 (91%) patients had 1 isolate, and in 3 of 32 (9%) neonates more than 1 isolate was detected. One patient had 3 bacteremic episodes and 1 simultaneous infection of cerebrospinal fluid during the second episode. The first bacteremic episode was at day 2 postnatally, the second 10 days later, and the last 6 weeks postnatally. One further patient had 2 bacteremic episodes with 12 days in between and 1 neonate had simultaneous bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid infections. The first cultured isolate per patient and corresponding parameters were included in the statistical analysis. High-quality reads were obtained for 37 isolates and species verification on sequence data confirmed the species identification as E. coli and the purity of the whole-genome extracts.

### Changes in pathogens causing early-onset sepsis in very-low-birth-weight infants [^115bzt3z]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

It is uncertain whether the rates and causes of early-onset sepsis (that occurring within 72 hours after birth) among very-low-birth-weight infants have changed in recent years, since antibiotics have begun to be used more widely during labor and delivery.

Methods

We studied 5447 very-low-birth-weight infants (those weighing between 401 and 1500 g) born at centers of the Neonatal Research Network of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development between 1998 and 2000 who had at least one blood culture in the first three days of life and compared them with 7606 very-low-birth-weight infants born at centers in the network between 1991 and 1993.

Results

Early-onset sepsis (as confirmed by positive blood cultures) was present in 84 infants in the more recent birth cohort (1.5 percent). As compared with the earlier birth cohort, there was a marked reduction in group B streptococcal sepsis (from 5.9 to 1.7 per 1000 live births of infants weighing 401 to 1500 g, P < 0.001) and an increase in Escherichia coli sepsis (from 3.2 to 6.8 per 1000 live births, P = 0.004); the overall rate of early-onset sepsis was not significantly changed. Most E. coli isolates from the recent birth cohort (85 percent) were resistant to ampicillin, and mothers of infants with ampicillin-resistant E. coli infections were more likely to have received intrapartum ampicillin than were those with ampicillin-sensitive strains (26 of 28 with sensitivity data vs. 1 of 5, P = 0.01). Infants with early-onset sepsis were more likely to die than uninfected infants (37 percent vs. 13 percent, P < 0.001), especially if they were infected with gram-negative organisms.

Conclusions

Early-onset sepsis remains an uncommon but potentially lethal problem among very-low-birth-weight infants. The change in pathogens over time from predominantly gram-positive to predominantly gram-negative requires confirmation by ongoing surveillance.

### Strong pathogen competition in neonatal gut colonisation [^115m9wbq]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Summary figure of E. coli gut colonisation.

The plot displays the numbers of E. coli lineages found at each of the five major sampling points (4, 7, and 21 days after birth, in the infancy period, and from the mothers in the maternity unit). The flows indicate the (possible) numbers of lineages that were transmitted between the sampling points, with the colours corresponding to the first time point the transmitted lineages were detected in. Flows that skip a sampling point (such as from 4 days to 21 days) indicate that a lineage returned to detectable levels after the skipped sampling point. a Displays the vaginal delivery cohort, and b the caesarean section cohort.

Conversely, in the caesarean section delivery cohort there were markedly fewer E. coli found overall in the early time points (21 carried E. coli at 4 days out of total 282 in the cohort, of whom 97 had detectable amounts of E. coli in the first 21 days), with some signs of the initial colonisation happening slightly later at 7 days (59 out of 97; Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Carriage of the same lineage persisted from 4 to 7 days in 11 infants out of the 21 who carried E. coli at 4 days, and in 23 infants from 4 or 7 days to 21 days.

Comparing lineages identified in the mothers to those identified in the infants either at the 4 or the 7 days time point in either cohort revealed 16 infants who shared the same lineage with their mothers (a total of 43 mothers out of the 175 in the full study cohort had detectable amounts of E. coli), indicating potential transmission. All of the 16 potential transmissions at 4 or 7 days happened in the vaginal delivery cohort. Transmission in the caesarean section cohort was only observed in the later time points (4 observed transmissions; Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Based on these results the majority of the initial colonisations in both cohorts appear to have been obtained from an unsampled source rather than transmitted directly from the mother, although we cannot exclude transmission of E. coli low-abundance (below the detection limit) lineages in the gut or from other body sites known to sometimes harbour E. coli, such as the vagina.

### A live attenuated vaccine to prevent severe neonatal Escherichia coli K1 infections [^1126aBTj]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Maternal antibodies can access fetal neural tissue through the developing blood-brain barrier and can thus prevent infection by vertically transmitted pathogens. Indeed, the K1 and non-K1 E. coli strains responsible for meningitis are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and multiply in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Vaccination before or during pregnancy is useful in protecting newborn babies and pregnant women from serious infections. The maternal antibodies induced by the vaccine can be transferred to the fetus and newborn via the placenta and breastfeeding, where they offer protection against specific micro-organisms. Maternal vaccination against the micro-organisms responsible for congenital and neonatal infections has therefore gain a major public health interest. Transplacental transfer of antibodies is a more natural, safer, more effective and less costly method of increasing neonatal antibody levels than administering immunoglobulin preparations to the infant. However, the nature of the antigens and the type of vaccine administered during pregnancy also influence the effectiveness of antibody transfer to the fetus or newborn. Higher antibody titers have been observed in infants born to mothers immunized with conjugate vaccines compared with polysaccharide vaccines during pregnancy.

It has also been shown that asymptomatic carriage of E. coli K1 strains in the maternal gut microbiota is positively correlated with the risk of vertical transmission to the infant at birth. Eliminating E. coli K1 strains from the maternal microbiota could also be a solution. Celine et al have shown that strains can be eliminated using specific phages. Since bacteremia is a primordial stage in the pathophysiology of E. coli K1 meningitis, maternal vaccination induced by the transfer of specific IgG to newborns would be an excellent strategy for protecting newborns against neonatal E. coli K1 meningitis. Maternal vaccination could be an excellent way of better protecting offspring against neonatal E. coli K1 meningitis.

Our study shows that preconceptional vaccination with the E. coli K1 E11 ∆aroA vaccine induces strong immunity, driven by polyclonal bactericidal antibodies and protects not only mothers from infections during pregnancy, but also protects their offspring through vertical transmission of maternal immune effectors. Maternal vaccination could be an excellent way of better protecting offspring against neonatal E. coli K1 infection and especially meningitis.

### Virulence potential of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolated during the perinatal period [^112VMr1R]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

All the above underscore the necessity for a deeper understanding of the implications of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization, particularly concerning antimicrobial treatment decisions. Uncertainty in risk assessment of carriage of resistant bacteria may result in unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and impact the intestinal microbiome.

### Mode of delivery and other risk factors for Escherichia coli infections in very low birth weight infants [^1154PLi4]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Infections in newborns, particularly those with very low and extremely low birth weights of < 1.5 kg, are a significant problem. Escherichia coli is responsible for a smaller fraction of neonatal infections than other microorganisms, but it is associated with the highest mortality.

Data collected by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network confirm that in Europe from 2002 to 2009 the occurrence of E. coli in bloodstream infections increased by more (71%) than Staphylococcus aureus (34%), which indicates the growing importance of E. coli in the epidemiology of infections and the need for detailed molecular studies of these strains. Our study was performed to characterise the population of E. coli isolated from neonatal infections; mainly from pneumonia and bloodstream infections from Polish NICUs.

According to other data, E. coli causes about 9% of infections or 5–13% of LOI in NICUs. Additionally, in Polish NICUs, E. coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen in early-onset PNSN infections. In recent years, E. coli infections in NICUs have become more prevalent, and it is believed that this is mainly owing to the implementation of PAP.

Other studies on E. coli have identified that low gestational age, duration of hospital stay and use of antibiotics are the risk factors of colonisation and infection among newborns. Our results support these data, and we hypothesise that another major risk factor may be maternal colonisation. According to Denkel et al. colonised mothers may be an important reservoir of E. coli and significant risk factors for E. coli colonisation, and consequently, E. coli infections of very low birth weight infants.

Unfortunately, screening of mothers was not performed in NICUs of PNSN, but our PFGE results support our hypothesis: the population of E. coli was divergent and no epidemic clones were identified. That is totally different than for other species such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

### Risk factors for invasive, early-onset Escherichia coli infections in the era of widespread intrapartum antibiotic use [^1161iHLy]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to evaluate risk factors for invasive Escherichia coli infections in the first week of life (early onset), focusing on the role of intrapartum antibiotic use.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective case-control study. Between 1997 and 2001, case infants, defined as infants < 7 days of age with E coli isolated from blood or cerebrospinal fluid, were identified in selected counties of California, Georgia, and Connecticut by the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance/Emerging Infections Program Network. Control infants (N = 1212) were identified from a labor and delivery record review of a stratified random sample of live births at the same hospitals in 1998 and 1999.

Results

Surveillance identified 132 E coli cases, including 68 ampicillin-resistant cases. The case fatality rate was 16% (21 of 132 cases). Two thirds of case infants were preterm, and 49% (64 of 132 infants) were born at ≤ 33 weeks of gestation. Fifty-three percent of case mothers (70 of 132 mothers) received intrapartum antibiotic therapy; 70% of those received ampicillin or penicillin. Low gestational age (≤ 33 weeks), intrapartum fever, and membrane rupture of ≥ 18 hours were associated with increased odds of early-onset E coli infection. Results were similar when case subjects were limited to those infected with ampicillin-resistant strains. Exposure to any intrapartum antibiotic treatment, beta-lactam antibiotic treatment, or ≥ 4 hours of intrapartum antibiotic therapy was associated with increased odds of E coli infection and ampicillin-resistant infection in univariate analyses. Among preterm infants, intrapartum antibiotic exposure did not remain associated with either outcome in multivariable models. Among term infants, exposure to ≥ 4 hours of intrapartum antibiotic therapy was associated with decreased odds of early-onset E coli infection.

Conclusions

Exposure to intrapartum antibiotic therapy did not increase the odds of invasive, early-onset E coli infection. Intrapartum antibiotic therapy was effective in preventing E coli infection only among term infants.

### Early-onset neonatal sepsis 2015 to 2017, the rise of Escherichia coli, and the need for novel prevention strategies [^111F5VAk]. JAMA Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Early-onset sepsis (EOS) remains a potentially fatal newborn condition. Ongoing surveillance is critical to optimize prevention and treatment strategies.

Objective

To describe the current incidence, microbiology, morbidity, and mortality of EOS among a cohort of term and preterm infants.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective surveillance study included a cohort of infants born at a gestational age (GA) of at least 22 weeks and birth weight of greater than 400 g from 18 centers of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network from April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from June 14, 2019, to January 28, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Early-onset sepsis defined by isolation of pathogenic species from blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture within 72 hours of birth and antibiotic treatment for at least 5 days or until death.

Results

A total of 235 EOS cases (127 male [54.0%]) were identified among 217 480 newborns (1.08 [95% CI, 0.95–1.23] cases per 1000 live births). Incidence varied significantly by GA and was highest among infants with a GA of 22 to 28 weeks (18.47 [95% CI, 14.57–23.38] cases per 1000). No significant differences in EOS incidence were observed by sex, race, or ethnicity. The most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli (86 [36.6%]) and group B streptococcus (GBS; 71 [30.2%]). E coli disease primarily occurred among preterm infants (68 of 131 [51.9%]); GBS disease primarily occurred among term infants (54 of 104 [51.9%]), with 24 of 45 GBS cases (53.3%) seen in infants born to mothers with negative GBS screening test results. Intrapartum antibiotics were administered to 162 mothers (68.9%; 110 of 131 [84.0%] preterm and 52 of 104 [50.0%] term), most commonly for suspected chorioamnionitis. Neonatal empirical antibiotic treatment most frequently included ampicillin and gentamicin. All GBS isolates were tested, but only 18 of 81 (22.2%) E coli isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin; 6 of 77 E coli isolates (7.8%) were resistant to both ampicillin and gentamicin. Nearly all newborns with EOS (220 of 235 [93.6%]) displayed signs of illness within 72 hours of birth. Death occurred in 38 of 131 infected infants with GA of less than 37 weeks (29.0%); no term infants died. Compared with earlier surveillance (2006–2009), the rate of E coli infection increased among very low-birth-weight (401–1500 g) infants (8.68 [95% CI, 6.50–11.60] vs 5.07 [95% CI, 3.93–6.53] per 1000 live births; p = 0.008).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, EOS incidence and associated mortality disproportionately occurred in preterm infants. Contemporary cases have demonstrated the limitations of current GBS prevention strategies. The increase in E coli infections among very low-birth-weight infants warrants continued study. Ampicillin and gentamicin remained effective antibiotics in most cases, but ongoing surveillance should monitor antibiotic susceptibilities of EOS pathogens.

### Predictors of mortality and severe illness from Escherichia coli sepsis in neonates [^115D4ccv]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of all neonates ≤ 30 days old with E. coli positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture admitted to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, a Level IV NICU in Cleveland, Ohio, from 01/01/2008 through 12/31/2022. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and informed consent was waived due to its retrospective nature. Information was collected on infant and maternal clinical and demographic variables. Infants with congenital anomalies and conditions that would predispose to infection, such as immunodeficiency syndromes, were excluded from statistical analysis. Microbiological information included hours of life at culture collection, source (blood vs CSF), time to positivity, and antibiotic resistance profile. Infant clinical characteristics included outcome (discharged home vs death due to E. coli infection), complete blood counts (CBC) during sepsis, duration of antibiotic therapy, presence of metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.20 or base deficit > 10 mEq/L without respiratory acidosis) and need for inotropic medication during the E. coli sepsis episode. Maternal characteristics included presence of intra-amniotic infection (IAI, defined as maternal peripartum fever 38–38.9 °C with signs of purulent cervical drainage, maternal leukocytosis, or fetal tachycardia, or isolated maternal fever ≥ 39 °C), E. coli infection in the mother at any time during pregnancy, and maternal intrapartum antibiotic therapy.

We defined our primary outcome as either death or severe illness from E. coli infection. Death was attributed to E. coli infection if it happened at any point from collection of the blood or CSF culture till the end of antibiotic treatment for that particular episode of infection. Severe illness was defined as the new need for inotropic medication or new development of metabolic acidosis, as described above, during the episode of E. coli infection. We specifically included only those infants in our primary outcome who had a new need for inotropic medication and had worsening or new metabolic acidosis at the time of blood or CSF culture at any time during the treatment of the infection as these clinical findings can exist in preterm neonates for reasons other than bacterial sepsis. The time of detection of sepsis, which was used to differentiate between EOS and LOS, was based on the time of collection of blood or CSF culture relative to the time of birth.

### Association of maternal infections, antibiotic use, and cesarean delivery with the risk of early-onset sepsis: a nationwide population-based study in full-term neonates [^115Ls54z]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since 2012, Taiwan has implemented a universal antenatal screening program alongside intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to reduce infections caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a strategy proven to lower the risk of neonatal sepsis in term infants born to GBS carriers in other countries. Additionally, empirical antibiotic treatment has been routinely provided to neonates identified as being at risk for early-onset sepsis (EOS). However, despite these proactive measures, there has been a reported rise in EOS cases linked to Escherichia coli (E. coli) and non-Enterococcal Group D Streptococcus among term infants. This trend raises concerns about the unintended consequences of extensive antibiotic use during the perinatal period. Research suggests that antibiotic exposure may impair immune cell function and further exacerbate the already immunocompromised state of neonates 2, potentially leading to a higher incidence of non-GBS infections. These observations highlight the pressing need to re-evaluate current EOS risk factors and to innovate more effective and targeted antibiotic stewardship and preventive strategies for neonatal care.

EOS and other infectious diseases continue to represent substantial causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality globally. According to national surveillance data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), collected between 2005 and 2014, the majority of EOS cases were reported in full-term newborns. More recently, global health statistics reveal that in 2021 alone, approximately 2.3 million infants died within the first month of life — equivalent to about 6,500 deaths per day. Among these, sepsis remains one of the most prevalent causes of neonatal mortality. These figures reinforce that neonatal sepsis remains a persistent global health challenge, consistently ranking as a leading cause of neonatal illness and death across diverse healthcare systems.

Neonatal sepsis (NS) is broadly defined as a systemic inflammatory response in neonates due to a suspected or confirmed infection. It can present in a variety of forms, including bloodstream infections, pneumonia, meningitis, arthritis, and osteomyelitis, among others. Unlike in older populations where sepsis is often diagnosed based on organ dysfunction, neonatal sepsis is typically identified through clinical symptoms, microbiological culture results, and laboratory markers. EOS, specifically, refers to a bacterial infection occurring within the first 72 h after birth. This study focuses exclusively on term neonates — defined as those born at or beyond 37 weeks' gestation — to avoid confounding effects associated with prematurity.

### Microbiota-targeted maternal antibodies protect neonates from enteric infection [^111MyHMw]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

Although maternal antibodies protect newborn babies from infection 1,2, little is known about how protective antibodies are induced without prior pathogen exposure. Here we show that neonatal mice that lack the capacity to produce IgG are protected from infection with the enteric pathogen enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by maternal natural IgG antibodies against the maternal microbiota when antibodies are delivered either across the placenta or through breast milk. By challenging pups that were fostered by either maternal antibody-sufficient or antibody-deficient dams, we found that IgG derived from breast milk was crucial for protection against mucosal disease induced by enterotoxigenic E. coli. IgG also provides protection against systemic infection by E. coli. Pups used the neonatal Fc receptor to transfer IgG from milk into serum. The maternal commensal microbiota can induce antibodies that recognize antigens expressed by enterotoxigenic E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae species. Induction of maternal antibodies against a commensal Pantoea species confers protection against enterotoxigenic E. coli in pups. This role of the microbiota in eliciting protective antibodies to a specific neonatal pathogen represents an important host defence mechanism against infection in neonates.

Urinary tract infections

UTIs are the most common bacterial infections among preterm and term infants, affecting approximately 3% of febrile infants. Common causative agents of UTI in this age group include E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Key risk factors include male sex, low GA, low birth weight, vaginal delivery, length of hospitalization, and circumcision status.

Generally, UTIs arise as a primary infection, where bacteria colonize the periurethral area, invade the urethra, and ascend through the urinary tract. While some UTIs may occur secondary to bacteremia via hematogenous seeding of the urinary tract (Fig. 2), most studies examining blood and urine culture concordance have not definitively established the direction of this association. In ~10%–15% of cases, UTIs may progress to more serious conditions, such as pyelonephritis or BSI.

Gut microbiome perturbations have been linked to UTI development in adults and older children. Due to the anatomical proximity of the urethra and anus, periurethral contamination by gut bacteria is believed to be a common cause of UTIs, especially in diapered infants. However, the nature of this association appears to vary depending on patient characteristics. Whether the infant gut microbiome serves as a reservoir for uropathogenic bacteria remains an open question, as does whether UTIs in this population result from gut-urethral migration of bacteria. To our knowledge, only four human cohort studies have examined gut microbiome dynamics in relation to UTIs in this age group. Two of these studies observed enrichment for uropathogens in the gut microbiomes of infants who later developed UTI with the same organism. In the third, the causative uropathogens were either of low abundance or absent from the gut in UTI cases. Recently, we found increased E. coli abundance of an identical strain in the urine to the gut at ER presentation for febrile term infants versus controls without UTI. Further investigation is needed to confirm the generalizability of these findings and to evaluate potential use of the gut microbiome in predicting UTI risk in the NICU.

### Serious bacterial infections in newborn infants in developing countries [^114CSCLJ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The overwhelming majority of the world's annual 4 million neonatal deaths occur in developing countries. This review therefore briefly addresses the burden, aetiology, prevention and management of serious neonatal bacterial infections in low-income settings.

Recent Findings

Bacterial infection is the biggest cause of neonatal admissions to hospitals, and probably the biggest cause of morbidity in the community, but its burden is unclear. The commonest serious infections involve bacteraemia, meningitis and respiratory infection, and case fatality rates may be as high as 45%. Key pathogens are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The incidence of neonatal infections with group B streptococcus is highly variable, as is the spectrum of antimicrobial resistance.

Summary

Current areas of research include the rectification of micronutrient deficiencies, neonatal skin care, appropriate breastfeeding recommendations, cleansing of the birth canal, and simplified methods of diagnosis of infection. Operational activities include the control of neonatal tetanus, the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, integrated strategies for improving pregnancy, childbirth and neonatal survival, community-based management of acute respiratory infections, and community-based management of neonatal sepsis.

### Neonatalinfection in twins: clinical spectrum and management dilemma [^114beR7T]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Escherichia coli infection is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in neonates, especially those born preterm. It is a major aetiology of a range of clinical presentations, including sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis, and skin and soft tissue infections. Early-onset sepsis (EOS), occurring in the first week of life, is an especially significant concern, with a mortality rate over 10%. In Canada, E. coli has surpassed group B Streptococcus (GBS) as the most common cause of EOS as screening and prophylactic intrapartum antibiotics have become the standard of care.

A number of risk factors for EOS have been identified, but the only recommendation is by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for asymptomatic siblings of a patient with EOS in a multigestational pregnancy is close observation, as EOS is usually caused by vertical transmission from the mother. In a small case series and literature review, Almidani et al found a wide variation in practice and no consensus on management in this situation.

Here we discuss a set of twins born prematurely, one with early respiratory distress and bacteraemia, and the other with a late presentation of scrotal abscess, both caused by the same organism, E. coli. This case highlights the clinical spectrum of neonatal E. coli infections, including the rare occurrence of scrotal abscess, as well as the potential need for treatment in twins when one twin has EOS.

### Vertical transmission of gut microbiome and antimicrobial resistance genes in infants exposed to antibiotics at birth [^116xGpyg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Perinatal antibiotics led to an increased environmental source in the newborn colonization process, which has clinical implications. In classic studies in the 1980s, Tullus et al showed that newborn infants treated in certain neonatal wards subsequently had a long-term increased risk of E. coli infections, most likely owing to the early acquisition of nosocomially spread E. coli clones in the gut microbiome. Exposure to perinatal antibiotics may thus result in an increased risk of infections due to strains acquired from the hospital environment instead of the maternal microbiome. Furthermore, prenatal consumption of probiotics has shown some promise in preventing long-term diseases in offspring. Prenatal interventions based on the vertical transmission of microbes from mothers to infants may fail, however, if perinatal antibiotics, interfering with the source of colonization, are used. Finally, nosocomial spread of AMR is a known threat in neonatal wards. The nosocomial acquisition of AMR from a hospital environment seems to be more likely in newborn infants exposed to antibiotics owing to the changed colonization process.

Our study is one of the first controlled studies that used metagenomic sequencing to investigate the impact of perinatal antibiotics on newborn microbiome transmission. One of its major strength is the controlled prospective cohort that was followed up for a year. Although our study cohort (n = 10 per group for each group) is not very large, it still enabled us to find significant differences in vertical microbiome transmission between the antibiotic-exposed group and the control group. Cohorts in other related studies, owing to different designs and configurations, are not as well suited to answer the question of how antibiotics affect vertical microbiome transmission, as we have been able to accomplish in our study. For example, although the large cohort by Shao et al included 596 subjects, they only had fecal samples for 5 mother-infant pairs in which both mothers and infants received antibiotic treatment and multiple samples were collected from infants, [supplementary table 1].

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^111nq1oU]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Changing bacteriology in young febrile infants is characterized by Escherichia coli now being the most common organism to cause bacteremia and "the leading or second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants 1 to 60 days of age", while "Infections with L monocytogenes are now rare in the United States". The "shift from Gram-positive to Gram-negative predominance" has implications for test interpretation and antimicrobial selection, and "Using the decision models of the 1980s today can lead to misclassification of bacterial meningitis in 23.3% to 32.1% of cases".

### Incidence of infant Gram-negative invasive bacterial infections in england, 2011–2019: an observational study using population-wide surveillance data [^114cgVa5]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Invasive bacterial infections account for an estimated 15% of infant deaths worldwide. We aimed to estimate the incidence and trends in invasive bacterial infections in infants caused by Gram-negative pathogens in England during 2011–2019.

Methods

Laboratory-confirmed invasive bacterial infections in infants (< 1year old) were identified in the UK Health Security Agency national laboratory surveillance data from April 2011 to March 2019. Polymicrobial infections were defined as two or more bacterial species from the same normally sterile sample site. Early-onset infections were defined as < 7days from birth and late-onset as ≥ 7days (neonates 7–28days; infants ≥ 29 days). Trend analyses were carried out using Poisson (for episodes/incidence) and beta (for proportions) regression.

Results

The annual incidence of invasive bacterial infections increased by 35.9%, from 189.8 to 258.0 cases per 100000 live births (p < 0.001). Late-onset infections in both neonates and infants increased substantially over the study period (p < 0.001), whereas early-onset infections increased slightly (p = 0.002). Escherichia coli was the most common Gram-negative pathogen isolated and accounted for 27.2% of the overall rise in Gram-negative infant disease incidence. Polymicrobial infections almost doubled, increasing from 29.2 to 57.7 per 100000 live births (p < 0.001), and mostly involved two species (81.3%, 1604/1974 episodes).

Conclusions

The incidence of Gram-negative invasive bacterial infections in infants increased between 2011/2012 and 2018/2019 in England, driven mainly by an increase in late-onset infections. Further work is required to elucidate the risk factors and drivers of this increased incidence so that opportunities for prevention can be identified.

### Ascending vaginal infection using bioluminescent bacteria evokes intrauterine inflammation, preterm birth, and neonatal brain injury in pregnant mice [^116cfH5u]. The American Journal of Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Preterm birth is a serious global health problem and the leading cause of infant death before 5 years of age. At least 40% of cases are associated with infection. The most common way for pathogens to access the uterine cavity is by ascending from the vagina. Bioluminescent pathogens have revolutionized the understanding of infectious diseases. We hypothesized that bioluminescent Escherichia coli can be used to track and monitor ascending vaginal infections. Two bioluminescent strains were studied: E. coli K12 MG1655-lux, a nonpathogenic laboratory strain, and E. coli K1 A192PP-lux2, a pathogenic strain capable of causing neonatal meningitis and sepsis in neonatal rats. On embryonic day 16, mice received intravaginal E. coli K12, E. coli K1, or phosphate-buffered saline followed by whole-body bioluminescent imaging. In both cases, intravaginal delivery of E. coli K12 or E. coli K1 led to bacterial ascension into the uterine cavity, but only E. coli K1 induced preterm parturition. Intravaginal administration of E. coli K1 significantly reduced the proportion of pups born alive compared with E. coli K12 and phosphate-buffered saline controls. However, in both groups of viable pups born after bacterial inoculation, there was evidence of comparable brain inflammation by postnatal day 6. This study ascribes specific mechanisms by which exposure to intrauterine bacteria leads to premature delivery and neurologic inflammation in neonates.

### The rising threat of antibiotic and multidrug resistance in neonatal urinary tract infections [^113N6eDo]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in neonates can be associated with sepsis and congenital anomalies of the urinary tract. Early recognition and treatment of UTIs are crucial in preventing the development of renal scarring later in life. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most prevalent pathogen in neonates, responsible for approximately 80% to 90% of infections in most large-scale studies. In premature infants, E. coli, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Klebsiella are the most commonly identified pathogens.

Antibiotics such as ampicillin, gentamicin, cefotaxime, amikacin, meropenem, and vancomycin are commonly used in the treatment of UTIs in neonates. Empirical therapy is typically initiated with a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin. The appropriate selection of antibiotics is crucial, as empirical treatment, initiated prior to obtaining culture results, has been shown to reduce both mortality and morbidity. However, AMR and the emergence of MDR strains are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide.

Therefore, regular monitoring of AMR is essential to minimize the use of inappropriate therapies in the treatment of UTIs. The existing literature on MDR UTIs in neonates is limited, with most studies being single-center investigations focused primarily on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales, particularly E. coli. Consequently, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and laboratory findings, the frequency of causative microorganisms, the presence of concomitant urinary tract anomalies, AMR and MDR status, as well as the factors influencing the development of MDR in neonates diagnosed with UTIs.

### Predictors of mortality and severe illness from Escherichia coli sepsis in neonates [^115t7fDo]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the evaluation of suspected EOS has changed over time, the first-line drugs still remain ampicillin and gentamicin. There has been growing concern regarding the emergence of multidrug-resistant E. coli strains and reports of increasing resistance to ampicillin and gentamicin. The rates of ampicillin and gentamicin resistance in E. coli isolates from US NICUs were between 66–80% and 8–17%, respectively. The use of ineffective empiric antibiotics due to resistance results in inadequate infection control and disease progression to severe illness or death

There are inconsistent reports of an association between the risk of death among infants with E. coli EOS and ampicillin resistance. It is critical to identify the risk factors associated with mortality and severe illness from E. coli sepsis so that antibiotic stewardship programs and aggressive antibiotic regimens for neonates at risk can coexist in the NICU. We determined specific risk factors associated with mortality or severe illness in E. coli neonatal sepsis.

### Prevalence and risk factor for antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli colonization at birth in premature infants: a prospective cohort study [^111JonB7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Escherichia coli causes neonatal early-onset sepsis (EOS) that is associated with high mortality and increasing antibiotic resistance. Thus, we estimated the prevalence, antibiotic susceptibility and risk factors for colonization of E. coli in premature infants at birth and characterized the pathogenicity of the isolates.

Methods

A prospective surveillance study was conducted at three Japanese perinatal centers between August 2014 and February 2017. Infants weighing < 2kg and/or at gestational age < 35 weeks at birth were enrolled. We screened the mothers and neonates for E. coli colonization. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to analyze the relatedness between the maternal and neonatal isolates. Virulence factors for the isolates were determined using polymerase chain reaction.

Results

We enrolled 421 premature infants born to 382 mothers. The rate of colonization in mothers was 47.6%, comprising 5.9% extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (ESBL-E) and 20.0% ampicillin-resistant strains. Ten (2.4%) infants exhibited colonization; ESBL-E and ampicillin-resistant strains colonized three and four infants, respectively. Three antibiotic-resistant, strain-positive infants developed EOS. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed vertical transmission of bacteria in four infants. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ESBL-E-positive mothers [odds ratio (OR), 19.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.5–145.7)] and vaginal delivery (OR, 9.4; 95% CI, 1.7–50.7) were risk factors for neonatal colonization. The infant isolates possessed numerous virulence factors.

Conclusions

Although the prevalence of E. coli-colonized premature infants at birth was low, the rate of antibiotic resistance and the attack rate for EOS were high. Infants with ESBL-E positive mothers should be closely monitored for EOS.

### Sepsis from the gut: the enteric habitat of bacteria that cause late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections [^111js9bW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Late-onset sepsis is a major problem in neonatology, but the habitat of the pathogens before bloodstream invasion occurs is not well established.

Methods

We examined prospectively collected stools from premature infants with sepsis to find pathogens that subsequently invaded their bloodstreams, and sought the same organisms in stools of infants without sepsis. Culture-based techniques were used to isolate stool bacteria that provisionally matched the bloodstream organisms, which were then genome sequenced to confirm or refute commonality.

Results

Of 11 children with late-onset neonatal bloodstream infections, 7 produced at least 1 stool that contained group B Streptococcus (GBS), Serratia marcescens, or Escherichia coli before their sepsis episode with provisionally matching organisms. Of 96 overlap comparison subjects without sepsis temporally associated with these cases, 4 were colonized with provisionally matching GBS or S. marcescens. Of 175 comparisons of stools from randomly selected infants without sepsis, 1 contained a GBS (this infant had also served as an overlap comparison subject and both specimens contained provisionally matching GBS). Genome sequencing confirmed common origin of provisionally matching fecal and blood isolates. The invasive E. coli were present in all presepticemic stools since birth, but gut colonization with GBS and S. marcescens occurred closer to time of bloodstream infection.

Conclusions

The neonatal gut harbors sepsis-causing pathogens, but such organisms are not inevitable members of the normal microbiota. Surveillance microbiology, decolonization, and augmented hygiene might prevent dissemination of invasive bacteria between and within premature infants.

### Bacterial etiologic agents causing neonatal sepsis and associated risk factors in gondar, northwest Ethiopia [^1126VBwM]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neonatal sepsis is a systemic infections of the newborn such as septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, and urinary tract infections. The clinical syndrome of the disease can be influenced by the virulence of the pathogen, the portal of entry, the susceptibility and response of the host, and the temporal evolution of the condition. Fever, temperature instability, vomiting, diarrhea, irritability, lethargy, breathing problem, low blood sugar, jaundice, reduced sucking and seizures are the most common symptoms of neonatal sepsis. Neonatal sepsis may be classified according to the time of onset of the disease: early onset and late onset. Early-onset of neonatal sepsis refers to the presence of a confirmed infection in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients younger than 3 days of life, and late-onset of neonatal sepsis refers to the onset of such infection between 3 and 28 days.

The distinction has clinical relevance, as early onset of neonatal sepsis disease is mainly occurred before and during delivery, whereas late onset of neonatal sepsis is possible due to bacteria acquired after delivery through hospital or community acquired source of infections. Organisms causing early onset of neonatal sepsis are typically colonizers of the maternal genitourinary tract, leading to contamination of the amniotic fluid, placenta, cervix, or vaginal canal. The pathogen may ascend when the amniotic membranes rupture or prior to the onset of labor, causing an intra-amniotic infection.

Bacteria, such as Streptococcus, L. monocytogenes, E. faecalis, E. faecium, group D Streptococci, α-hemolytic Streptococci and Staphylococci, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae type B, are recognized as the principal cause of early neonatal sepsis. Less commonly, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae have been also reported as a cause of neonatal septicemia and Gram-negative enteric organisms predominantly E. coli, Klebsiella species are included. On the other hand, late-onset sepsis is predominantly caused by Staphylococci species and E. coli and most frequently related with low birth weight of infants and use of intravascular catheters, endo-tracheal intubation, assisted ventilation, surgery, contact with hand of colonized personnel and contact with contaminated equipment as the main risk factors for late onset of neonatal sepsis. Sometimes E. cloacae or Citrobactor from blood or CSF may be due to contaminated feedings. Contaminated respiratory equipment is suspected in outbreaks of hospital-acquired P. aeroginosa pneumonia or sepsis.

### Stunted microbiota and opportunistic pathogen colonization in caesarean-section birth [^111ucBY8]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Immediately after birth, newborn babies experience rapid colonization by microorganisms from their mothers and the surrounding environment 1. Diseases in childhood and later in life are potentially mediated by the perturbation of the colonization of the infant gut microbiota 2. However, the effects of delivery via caesarean section on the earliest stages of the acquisition and development of the gut microbiota, during the neonatal period (≤ 1 month), remain controversial 3,4. Here we report the disrupted transmission of maternal Bacteroides strains, and high-level colonization by opportunistic pathogens associated with the hospital environment (including Enterococcus, Enterobacter and Klebsiella species), in babies delivered by caesarean section. These effects were also seen, to a lesser extent, in vaginally delivered babies whose mothers underwent antibiotic prophylaxis and in babies who were not breastfed during the neonatal period. We applied longitudinal sampling and whole-genome shotgun metagenomic analysis to 1,679 gut microbiota samples (taken at several time points during the neonatal period, and in infancy) from 596 full-term babies born in UK hospitals; for a subset of these babies, we collected additional matched samples from mothers (175 mothers paired with 178 babies). This analysis demonstrates that the mode of delivery is a significant factor that affects the composition of the gut microbiota throughout the neonatal period, and into infancy. Matched large-scale culturing and whole-genome sequencing of over 800 bacterial strains from these babies identified virulence factors and clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance in opportunistic pathogens that may predispose individuals to opportunistic infections. Our findings highlight the critical role of the local environment in establishing the gut microbiota in very early life, and identify colonization with antimicrobial-resistance-containing opportunistic pathogens as a previously underappreciated risk factor in hospital births.

### Early onset neonatal sepsis: the burden of group B streptococcal and E. coli disease continues [^116YSfYo]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for prevention of group B streptococcal (GBS) infection have successfully reduced early onset (EO) GBS disease. Study results suggest that Escherichia coli is an important EO pathogen.

Objective

To determine EO infection rates, pathogens, morbidity, and mortality in a national network of neonatal centers.

Methods

Infants with EO infection were identified by prospective surveillance at Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Network centers. Infection was defined by positive culture results for blood and cerebrospinal fluid obtained from infants aged ≤ 72 hours plus treatment with antibiotic therapy for ≥ 5 days. Mother and infant characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were studied. Numbers of cases and total live births (LBs) were used to calculate incidence.

Results

Among 396 586 LBs (2006–2009), 389 infants developed EO infection (0.98 cases per 1000 LBs). Infection rates increased with decreasing birth weight. GBS (43%, 0.41 per 1000 LBs) and E coli (29%, 0.28 per 1000 LBs) were most frequently isolated. Most infants with GBS were term (73%); 81% with E coli were preterm. Mothers of 67% of infected term and 58% of infected preterm infants were screened for GBS, and results were positive for 25% of those mothers. Only 76% of mothers with GBS colonization received intrapartum chemoprophylaxis. Although 77% of infected infants required intensive care, 20% of term infants were treated in the normal newborn nursery. Sixteen percent of infected infants died, most commonly with E coli infection (33%).

Conclusion

In the era of intrapartum chemoprophylaxis to reduce GBS, rates of EO infection have declined but reflect a continued burden of disease. GBS remains the most frequent pathogen in term infants, and E coli the most significant pathogen in preterm infants. Missed opportunities for GBS prevention continue. Prevention of E coli sepsis, especially among preterm infants, remains a challenge.

### Virulence potential of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolated during the perinatal period [^111SJFbe]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli is a recognized public health threat, where it can lead to potentially life-threatening bloodstream infections. Escherichia coli bloodstream infections present a substantial challenge within neonatal care and are acknowledged as an important global public health concern. Maternal transmission has been recognized as a significant source of neonatal colonization with E. coli, and extended stay in the intensive care unit increases the risk of nosocomial infections due to gram-negative rods such as E. coli. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of ESBL-producing E. coli in an obstetric ward in Changchun City, China, a country where a previously reported high prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae has reached up to 58%. The occurrence of virulence factors linked to invasive disease was examined in all ESBL-producing E. coli using a recently established virulence database.

### Strong pathogen competition in neonatal gut colonisation [^114qPcNw]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Examining the overall course from the first days to the final samplings at 21 days and in the infancy period revealed that, in both cohorts, the E. coli lineage that initially colonised the gut at the 4 or 7 days time point either persisted into the final day 21 sampling point or vanished completely (65 colonisations out of total 84 in the 21 day sampling point were already detected at 4 or 7 days in the vaginal delivery cohort; 23 out of 63 in caesarean delivery). Transitions to another lineage within the first 21 days of life were uncommon; only 4 such transitions were observed. When transitions happened, they primarily occurred between the last time point in the first 21 days time series, where E. coli was detected, and the infancy period sampling, where a longer period of time had passed (27 such transitions; Supplementary Fig. 2).

Finally, investigation of the samples which were observed to contain multiple E. coli lineages (75 in the vaginal delivery cohort and 47 in caesarean, including samples from the mothers) showed that co-colonisation seldom occurred within the first 21 days with only 37 infants being co-colonized at any time point (27 in the vaginal delivery cohort and 10 in the caesarean). In the infancy period the numbers of co-colonised infants increased to 66 (35 vaginal, 31 caesarean). Co-colonisation was also somewhat more frequent in the established microbiomes of the mothers (17 mothers were co-colonised out of the 76 mothers identified carrying E. coli). Similar analyses were carried out for the Klebsiella species (Supplementary Fig. 3) but they were often detectable only in a single time point despite them being commonly found in the caesarean section cohort (Fig. 2), hindering further efforts to characterise Klebsiella persistence. Taken together with the findings from the individual colonisation-time trajectories, these results indicate a substantial competitive advantage for the first strain to colonise the gut which lasts at least through the neonatal period (< 1 months of age).

### Neonatal early onset Escherichia coli sepsis: trends in incidence and antimicrobial resistance in the era of intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis [^112JsTmS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis has lowered the incidence of early onset group B Streptococcus (GBS) sepsis, there are concerns that the increased use of antibiotics may raise the incidence of non-GBS antimicrobial-resistant infections. The objective of this study was to determine trends in the incidence and antimicrobial resistance of early onset sepsis caused by Escherichia coli in the era of antimicrobial prophylaxis.

Methods

All neonates with early onset E. coli infection who were born at La Paz Hospital, Madrid, from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2002, were identified from a microbiologic register of all neonatal infections. To evaluate the effect of the guidelines for GBS prevention, data were pooled and compared for: 1992 through 1995 (Period 1); 1996 through 1998 (Period 2); and 1999 through 2002 (Period 3).

Results

Early onset E. coli infection was diagnosed in 41 of 84 612 live births. The infection rate did not change significantly during the 3 time periods (0.56, 0.24 and 0.55 per 1000 during Periods 1, 2 and 3, respectively; P = 0.936, linear-by-linear association). The proportion of E. coli infections that were resistant to ampicillin increased significantly among preterm infants, from 25% (1 of 4) in Period 1, to 100% (2 of 2) in Period 2 and to 91% (10 of 11) in Period 3 (P = 0.017, linear-by-linear association), but not among term infants, with 67% (8 of 12) in Period 1, 50% (1 of 2) in Period 2 and 44% (4 of 5) in Period 3 (P = 0.317, linear-by-linear association).

Conclusions

Although the incidence of early onset sepsis caused by E. coli remained stable during the study period, antibiotic-resistant E. coli infections increased among preterm infants. On the whole these trends are reassuring with respect to GBS prophylaxis. However, the increase in the proportion of ampicillin-resistant infections in preterm infants suggests that continuing evaluation of the risks and benefits of prophylaxis in this group is critical.

### Hospital-acquired neonatal infections in developing countries [^117PQzyi]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Hospital-born babies in developing countries are at increased risk of neonatal infections because of poor intrapartum and postnatal infection-control practices. We reviewed data from developing countries on rates of neonatal infections among hospital-born babies, range of pathogens, antimicrobial resistance, and infection-control interventions. Reported rates of neonatal infections were 3–20 times higher than those reported for hospital-born babies in industrialised countries. Klebsiella pneumoniae, other gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp, Acinetobacter spp), and Staphylococcus aureus were the major pathogens among 11,471 bloodstream isolates reported. These infections can often present soon after birth. About 70% would not be covered by an empiric regimen of ampicillin and gentamicin, and many might be untreatable in resource-constrained environments. The associated morbidity, mortality, costs, and adverse effect on future health-seeking behaviour by communities pose barriers to improvement of neonatal outcomes in developing countries. Low-cost, "bundled" interventions using systems quality improvement approaches for improved infection control are possible, but should be supported by evidence in developing country settings.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^117TD9Hh]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Initial treatment — KAS 5: Clinicians Should Initiate Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (Evidence Quality: A; Strong Recommendation) — is presented with epidemiology in infants < 90 days and de-escalation when enterovirus is identified. Gram-negative organisms have been responsible for the majority of infections (60% to 80%), and E coli has been the most common pathogen detected, with a prevalence of 70% to 90% of UTIs, 30% to 60% of bacteremia infections, and 15% to 30% of bacterial meningitis; GBS remains present in > 20% of febrile infants with bacteremia after the first week, and L monocytogenes is rarely encountered. Enteroviral testing of CSF has been shown to shorten length of stay and duration of antimicrobial use, and if CSF is positive for enterovirus, antimicrobial agents should be discontinued (or withheld) because concomitant enteroviral and bacterial meningitis is rare.

### Early-onset infection caused by Escherichia coli sequence type 1193 in late preterm and full-term neonates [^112EEqBr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Using whole-genome sequencing, we characterized Escherichia coli strains causing early-onset sepsis (EOS) in 32 neonatal cases from a 2019–2021 prospective multicenter study in France and compared them to E. coli strains collected from vaginal swab specimens from women in third-trimester gestation. We observed no major differences in phylogenetic groups or virulence profiles between the 2 collections. However, sequence type (ST) analysis showed the presence of 6/32 (19%) ST1193 strains causing EOS, the same frequency as in the highly virulent clonal group ST95. Three ST1193 strains caused meningitis, and 3 harbored extended-spectrum β-lactamase. No ST1193 strains were isolated from vaginal swab specimens. Emerging ST1193 appears to be highly prevalent, virulent, and antimicrobial resistant in neonates. However, the physiopathology of EOS caused by ST1193 has not yet been elucidated. Clinicians should be aware of the possible presence of E. coli ST1193 in prenatal and neonatal contexts and provide appropriate monitoring and treatment.

### Strong pathogen competition in neonatal gut colonisation [^112jprvG]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Opportunistic bacterial pathogen species and their strains that colonise the human gut are generally understood to compete against both each other and the commensal species colonising this ecosystem. Currently we are lacking a population-wide quantification of strain-level colonisation dynamics and the relationship of colonisation potential to prevalence in disease, and how ecological factors might be modulating these. Here, using a combination of latest high-resolution metagenomics and strain-level genomic epidemiology methods we performed a characterisation of the competition and colonisation dynamics for a longitudinal cohort of neonatal gut microbiomes. We found strong inter- and intra-species competition dynamics in the gut colonisation process, but also a number of synergistic relationships among several species belonging to genus Klebsiella, which includes the prominent human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. No evidence of preferential colonisation by hospital-adapted pathogen lineages in either vaginal or caesarean section birth groups was detected. Our analysis further enabled unbiased assessment of strain-level colonisation potential of extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) in comparison with their propensity to cause bloodstream infections. Our study highlights the importance of systematic surveillance of bacterial gut pathogens, not only from disease but also from carriage state, to better inform therapies and preventive medicine in the future.

### Major gut microbiota perturbations in firstborn infants compared to those with older siblings soon after delivery [^112yPLp5]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the present study, we analysed data from 65 infants followed from 3 days to 18 months of age with regular sampling of the fecal microbiota to determine whether being firstborn, delivered by cesarean section or indirectly exposed to antibiotics via the mother during delivery, were associated with deviations in gut microbiota development. These three "exposures" were highly interrelated – firstborn infants were more likely to have been delivered by cesarean section than infants with older siblings, while being firstborn or cesarean delivered were both associated with exposure to antibiotics during delivery. However, adjustment for these factors, and for breastfeeding and the infant's sex, enabled us to assess the effects of these three exposures independent of one another.

In accordance with many previous studies, we demonstrated that cesarean delivered infants were colonized less often by E. coli, but more often by other Enterobacteriaceae and clostridia, than vaginally delivered infants. The latter bacterial groups may be regarded as "opportunistic" early colonizers, which readily establish in a poorly developed gut microbiota where competition is low. We also noted delayed acquisition of Bacteroides in cesarean-delivered infants, in agreement with numerous studies, but significance was lost in the analysis adjusted for exposure to antibiotics during delivery; it is well known that acquisition of these bacteria is severely affected by intrapartum antibiotic exposure.

Interestingly, similar deviations as noted for cesarean-delivered infants characterized the microbiota of firstborn infants compared to those with older siblings; reduced acquisition of E. coli but increased colonization with other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family and with clostridial species. This largely agrees with our findings from a larger birth cohort, although we did not observe reduced colonization by E. coli in firstborn infants in this previous study. Increased levels of clostridial species in firstborn infants have also been reported by others.

A complex, mature microbiota suppresses the bacterial population numbers of facultative bacterial species. In line with firstborn infants having a less mature microbiota, they displayed considerably increased population counts of several facultative bacteria, including E. coli, other enterobacteria and enterococci. In fact, the enterococcal population levels were more than 100-fold higher in firstborn infants than in infants with older siblings during the first month of life. To the best of our knowledge, increased population counts of facultative bacteria in the first month of life in firstborn infants have not been reported previously.

### Early-onset neonatal sepsis in the paris area: a population-based surveillance study from 2019 to 2021 [^116nkcXs]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) has a low incidence in developed countries but has potentially serious consequences. The incidence of EOS within 72 hours after birth regardless of term was estimated between 0.7 and 1.1 per 1000 live births in the United States. Mortality varies according to the gestational age of the newborn, from 2% to 3% in term infants to more than 20% in preterm infants, and is even higher in cases of meningitis, at 10% and 26%, respectively. In developed countries, EOS in term and near-term infants is mainly due to group B Streptococcus (GBS) (40%–50% of cases) and Escherichia coli (10%–20%). Although GBS is the most common pathogen, mortality is most frequently due to E. coli.

There is no national EOS register in France. Since 2011, only the incidence of early neonatal GBS infections has been reported and was estimated to be ~0.20 per 1000 live births by the French network EPIBAC. Proven EOS is rare, but suspicion of EOS is fairly common in daily practice. Previous studies showed that more than half of neonates in France had a gastric aspirate at birth, which may have led to unnecessary complementary examinations, and 4% of infants received antibiotic treatment for suspected EOS. The French Society of Neonatology and the French Society of Pediatrics have updated in 2017 the guidelines for EOS in neonates ≥ 34 weeks of gestation (WG). Briefly, symptomatic newborns are treated empirically with antibiotics, and for asymptomatic newborns a categorical approach based on peripartum risk factors and intrapartum antibiotics identifies those who require serial clinical monitoring every 4 hours through 48 hours of age. Two years after the release of the new recommendations, the creation of an observatory in the Paris area appeared necessary. The primary objective was to estimate the annual incidence and pathogen distribution in EOS. The secondary objective was to describe the clinical characteristics of mothers and infants and their management.

Results

Bacterial Collection and Demographic and Clinical Features of Patients

We studied 82 E. coli isolates. Birth locations of the neonates within Ile de France were diverse (30 different locations among 32 EOS case-patients). Babies were delivered at full term (≥ 37 weeks of gestation) in 59% (19/32) and preterm (< 37 weeks of gestation) in 41% (13/32) of cases. In 6 (31%) cases from the full-term group and 7 cases (54%) from the preterm group, mothers received antimicrobial treatment < 3 days before labor. We observed 6 cases of meningitis, 3 each from the full-term and preterm neonate groups (Table 1).

### Strong pathogen competition in neonatal gut colonisation [^115KpPXB]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The study cohort in the previously published studyconsisted of 596 healthy babies from full-term pregnancies, delivered either via vaginal birth (314 babies) or caesarean section (282 babies). All 596 babies provided faecal samples at least once during their first month of life (see Table 1 for details), and 302 babies were resampled once between ages 7–11 months (142 caesarean section and 160 vaginal deliveries). Faecal samples were also available from 175 mothers (65 from the caesarean section cohort and 110 the vaginal delivery cohort), collected before or after delivery in the maternity unit and paired with 178 babies. Since the 175 samples from mothers were not available in a systematic fashion in the original study, we excluded a comparative analysis of the mother vs infant pairs of strains. Further, the isolated genome data (805 samples) from the original study were not included in the analysis of the within-sample variation to avoid biasing our conclusions. This is due to the fact that isolates were cultured in a highly uneven manner, such that a majority of them represented Enterococcus (451 out of 805), followed by Klebsiella spp. (235/805), while a very small fraction was available for the Escherichia spp (41/805). As E. coli was found to be the most dominant species in many samples by the metagenomic analysis, the isolate data would not have covered samples systematically. Although more isolates were available for the Enterococci, it was necessary to treat all species in the same manner in our analysis.

### Urinary tract infection epidemiology in NICUs in the United States [^114g7WQu]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to characterize the incidence, associated clinical factors, timing of infection, microbiology, and incidence of concordant blood culture of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in very low birth weight (VLBW < 1,500g) infants.

Study Design

Multicenter observational cohort study of VLBW infants with gestational age (GA) ≤ 32 weeks, still hospitalized on postnatal day 7, and discharged 2010 to 2018 from Pediatrix Medical Group neonatal intensive care units. Demographic and clinical characteristics of infants with and without UTI were compared. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated adjusted odds of UTI diagnosis.

Results

Of 86,492 included infants, 5,988 (7%) had a UTI. The most common pathogen was Enterococcus spp. (20%), followed by Escherichia coli (19%) and Klebsiella spp. (18%). Candida spp. (6%) was the most common nonbacterial pathogen. Concordant-positive blood culture was present in 8% of infants with UTI diagnoses. UTI was associated with lower GA, male sex, vaginal delivery, prenatal steroid exposure, and longer duration of hospitalization.

Conclusion

UTI is a common cause of infection in VLBW infants, especially among the smallest, most premature, male infants, and those with a longer duration of hospitalization. Neonatal clinicians should consider obtaining urine culture in the setting of late-onset sepsis evaluations in VLBW infants.

Key Points

· UTI is a common cause of LOS in VLBW infants. · The most common pathogens are Enterococcus spp. and E. coli. · UTI risk varies among different VLBW infant populations. · Next steps should include evaluation of preventative measures.

### Predictors of mortality and severe illness from Escherichia coli sepsis in neonates [^113UqMou]. Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

A major strength of this study is the extended study period. The incidence of E. coli neonatal sepsis is relatively low at any major US NICU. Most studies include NRN, CDC, or VON datasets, which do not account for geographic variations in E. coli pathogenicity patterns. We also use a composite outcome of death or severe illness to identify infant and maternal risk factors. As neonatal care becomes better at reducing the outcome of death, there is an increased burden of morbidities in the survivors, and it is critical to include this in studies on sepsis. It is reassuring that ampicillin or gentamicin resistance was not associated with the primary outcome in our study. The rates of ampicillin and gentamicin resistance seen in our population are similar to the rates reported by the recent NRN study, and this rate was similar across EOS and LOS cases as well in VLBW infants who were at the highest risk of death or severe illness. Although this is from a single center, these data suggest that ampicillin and gentamicin remain effective empiric antibiotics for neonatal sepsis.

The main drawback of this study is that this is a single-center experience; thus, the number of E. coli cases is insufficient to draw conclusions that can be applied to other centers. We were also limited as to which clinical, demographic, and microbiological factors we could use for our analyses due to the retrospective nature of this study. The completeness of the documentation of these factors in the medical record primarily determined the factors we chose to study. We acknowledge that there are possibly multiple other complex mechanisms and factors that are associated with increased mortality or severity of illness in neonatal E. coli sepsis. Maternal factors that have been linked to neonatal death from sepsis are prolonged rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, preterm delivery, and cesarean delivery. Neonatal factors that have been consistently shown to be associated with increased odds of mortality are prematurity and low birth weight. Other clinical factors such as respiratory compromise, septic shock, Gram-negative infection, lactic acidosis, and thrombocytopenia have been frequently but not consistently implicated in neonatal sepsis-related mortality.

### Identification of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility of early-onset sepsis (EOS) among neonates in palestinian hospitals: a retrospective observational study [^116QczK7]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal sepsis refers to an infection involving bloodstream in newborn infants less than 28 days old. It is divided into early-onset sepsis (EOS) or late-onset sepsis (LOS) based on the age of presentation after birth with different experts using 72 h or seven days as the cutoff. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), four million newborns die each year globally during the first four weeks after birth. Of these, 75% die prematurely during the first week of life. The major causes of neonatal deaths globally are attributed to infections (neonatal sepsis, meningitis, and pneumonia) (35%), preterm births (28%), intrapartum-related complications (24%), and asphyxia (23%). EOS and LOS are the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality globally and are responsible for 30–50% of the total neonatal deaths each year in developing countries. Estimates of the incidence of EOS among neonates range from 0.54 to 1.19 per 1,000 live births or 9 to 12 per 1,000 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions.

Most EOS infections are a result of vertical transmission of bacteria from colonized mothers to neonates during the intrapartum period. Previously, the most common pathogen causing EOS in neonates was Streptococcus agalactiae also referred to as Group B Streptococcus (GBS). However, more recently, Escherichia coli (E. coli) has become the most common cause, followed by GBS. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance has become a global concern. Organizations worldwide have been collaborating for more than 20 years to provide recommendations for the use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to prevent EOS. A previous cohort study in Canada reported a significant decrease in GBS and revealed GBS was more common in term infants and E. coli was more common in preterm infants. These findings were in line with other studies in the United States and Italy, which also showed a trend of increased EOS caused by E. coli that was most pronounced in preterm neonates. Continued surveillance of EOS epidemiology is especially important in light of recent debate on the continued utility of ampicillin and gentamicin for empirical coverage. In previous studies, up to 1 in 10 E. coli isolates causing neonatal EOS were resistant to both ampicillin and gentamicin. Although the regimen provides adequate coverage for GBS, because this organism remains almost universally sensitive to ampicillin, there is concern about increasing prevalence of EOS infections due to organisms besides E. coli and GBS, including other multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

### Trends of neonatal sepsis and its etiology at hawassa, Ethiopia: a five year retrospective cross-sectional study [^113Hs1Vx]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal sepsis is a clinical condition characterized by multiple non-particular signs and symptoms. Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among neonates, especially in resource-limited countries. Sepsis can be classified as early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) or late-onset neonatal sepsis (LONS) based on the age it occurs.

Important methods to tackle neonatal sepsis include the immediate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, as sepsis can be very life-threatening. Diagnostic methods have advanced from traditional blood cultures to quicker molecular techniques that identify bacteria, allowing for prompt antibiotic treatment. Clinical guidelines and risk assessment tools assist healthcare providers in identifying newborns at higher risk for sepsis, enabling more focused care. Preventive measures, like improving maternal health and infection control in neonatal intensive care units, are also crucial for lowering sepsis rates. Combining these strategies is essential to improve outcomes for newborns at risk of sepsis.

Early-onset sepsis occurs within the first week of life, often manifesting within the first 48 h. Etiologies of EONS are acquired vertically during or before birth from mothers harboring the pathogen in the recto-vaginal compartment. early-onset neonatal sepsis can be prevented with the implementation of appropriate prevention strategies similar to those used for group B Streptococcus (GBS). late-onset neonatal sepsis occur after the first week to three months of life. Unlike EONS, LONS is acquired after birth from hospital setting, from family members, or anyone who comes in the contact with the newborns. Intrapartum Antibiotic Prophylaxis, while effective for preventing EONS, does not prevent LONS. However, vaccines have the potential to be effective for both EONS and LONS.

Globally, neonatal sepsis is the third major cause of mortality among neonates. Fifteen per cent of all neonatal deaths globally in 2018 were due to EONS and it is almost three times that of LONS. About 70% of the causative agents of early-onset sepsis are mainly GBS and Escherichia coli. Late-onset sepsis is often linked to hospital and community-acquired bacterial infections, including those associated with intravenous catheterization and the most common etiologies are Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CONS), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

### Consequences of host-microbiome interactions in preterm infants [^112VdEnx]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Maternal vaccination

Maternal vaccines aim to prevent early-life infections by enhancing the protective capability of passively transferred maternal antibodies. Infants receive maternal antibodies by transplacental delivery of serum IgG and by ingestion of breast milk sIgA and IgG. Passively transferred antibody titers correlate with protection against neonatal sepsis and other early-life infections. Specific transplacental serum IgG is associated with a reduced risk of GBS and K. pneumoniae neonatal sepsis, while milk IgA binding to Enterobacteriaceae in the infant gut protects against NEC.

A key limitation of maternal passive immunity is that the repertoire of transferred antibodies is shaped by the mother's previous antigenic exposures, which renders infants susceptible to pathogens if the mother does not produce sufficient antibodies against that pathogen. Maternal vaccines help overcome this limitation by inducing a specific anti-pathogen response in the mother, which is then transferred to the fetus or infant. Currently, Tdap is the only licensed antibacterial vaccine recommended for all pregnancies. However, several new maternal vaccines targeting bacterial agents are in development, including those for GBS and E. coli K1. These vaccines primarily seek to transfer protective serum IgG responses, but in murine models, maternal vaccines can also stimulate milk sIgA responses that reduce intestinal colonization of bacterial pathogens in the infant gut.

The development of new maternal vaccines against bacterial pathogens is projected to significantly improve neonatal outcomes. For instance, a maternal K. pneumoniae vaccine could prevent an estimated 400,000 cases of infant sepsis and 80,000 deaths annually worldwide. Overall, maternal vaccines hold significant potential, and continued advancements in this field may lead to the inclusion of new antibacterial vaccines in standard prenatal care.

### Management of neonates born at ≥ 35 0 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^111kup3D]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to neonates, management, AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to administer ampicillin plus gentamicin as the first choice for empirical therapy for early-onset sepsis, as this regimen is effective against group B streptococcus, most other streptococcal and enterococcal species, and L. monocytogenes. Recognize that although two-thirds of E. coli early-onset sepsis isolates and most other Gram-negative early-onset sepsis isolates are resistant to ampicillin, the majority remain sensitive to gentamicin. Consider administering additional broad-spectrum agents in term infants who are critically ill until appropriate culture results are known.

### Early-onset infection caused by Escherichia coli sequence type 1193 in late preterm and full-term neonates [^112puhSV]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

ST1193 was identified within STc14 approximately 25 years ago; its prevalence in extraintestinal infections could become a public health burden. One study observed an increased rate of ST1193 causing bloodstream infections, mostly in elderly patients in Canada during 2016–2018. In an analysis of the population structure of 218 ESBL–producing E. coli in urinary tract infections in febrile children in France during 2014–2017, we noted prevalence of ST1193 rose from 0% to 9%. Large epidemiologic studies of ST1193 prevalence in neonatal infection have only recently been conducted. In 2 studies, ST1193 was shown to be a major cause of neonatal sepsis; however, because the definition of EOS in those studies differed from ours, data are difficult to compare. The finding of a worrying percentage of ST1193 among EOS patients (19%) in our study population indicates that in the future that ST should be closely monitored using microbiologic detection.

### A live attenuated vaccine to prevent severe neonatal Escherichia coli K1 infections [^114aDbRB]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Live attenuated vaccines reportedly confer the high levels of rapid, sustained, full immunity required for protection of the mother and her infant. However, the use of these vaccines is not recommended in certain high-risk populations, such as pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. Nevertheless, the administration of a live vaccine is not contraindicated prior to pregnancy in women of childbearing age or in those at risk of preterm delivery –.

By using a combination of saturated transposon mutagenesis and high-throughput sequencing (TnSeq, a powerful tool to study host-pathogen interactions), we recently identified the aroA gene as a virulence factor in E. coli K1. aroA encodes 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase which is involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acidsand several iron capture systems. Therefore, we decided to build a ∆aro A E. coli K1 mutant and evaluate it potential as a live attenuated vaccine against severe neonatal infections caused by E. coli. Although our TnSeq experiments had revealed other E. coli K1 virulence factors, AroA was selected for live vaccine attenuation because deletion of the aro A gene have been shown to provide strong protection in other settings (such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Salmonella sp. Infections). Furthermore, it has also been reported that an E. coli O78 vaccine attenuated by deletion of the aro A gene was efficacious against avian diseases. One of the main reason aroA is a good mutated background for vaccine strains is that it makes strains auxotrophic for aromatic amino acids and so cannot replicate properly in certain niches in the host.

In the present study, we first confirmed the results of the Tnseq data experiments and showed that the virulence of E. coli K1 E11 ∆aroA was indeed attenuated both in vitro and in vivo probably through the significant decreased of the expression of the genes encoding for the type 1 fimbriae, a major E. coli K1 virulence factor, in the ∆aroA mutant strains. We then characterized the immunological and microbiological properties of a live attenuated E. coli K1 E11 ∆aroA vaccine candidate after injection into adult female mice. Lastly, we demonstrated the very strong degree of protection afforded to offspring born to mothers having received with the attenuated vaccine before mating. Our results constitute preclinical proof of concept of a new strategy for the development of a vaccine against E. coli K1 infections in women at risk of preterm delivery.

### Virulence potential of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolated during the perinatal period [^115yCsrX]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of the study was to investigate the virulence factors in Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) derived from the perinatal fecal colonization flora of mothers and their newborns in a Chinese obstetric ward. Rectal swabs were obtained from mothers prenatally and from their newborns postnatally, and analyzed for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. The isolates were then whole-genome sequenced. Maternal and neonatal colonization by ESBL-producing E. coli in a Chinese obstetric ward was 18% (31/177) and 5% (9/170), respectively. Fecal ESBL-producing isolates exhibited a significantly lower frequency of virulence factors compared with invasive E. coli. Providing balanced information on screening results is essential, along with conducting a risk assessment for antibiotic treatment strategies. · High ESBL E. coli colonization rates in mothers and neonates perinatally. · Fecal ESBL-producing E. coli showed fewer virulence traits. · ESBL-producing E. coli knowledge may prompt antibiotic overuse.

### Comparison of early-onset neonatal sepsis caused by Escherichia coli and group B. streptococcus [^112MALB5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare maternal characteristics and neonatal morbidity and mortality rates that are associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis that is caused by group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli.

Study Design

This was a retrospective review of newborn infants with a positive blood culture (and/or cerebrospinal fluid) that was positive for either E coli or group B Streptococcus during the first week of life. Data were abstracted from maternal and neonatal medical records.

Results

Among 28,659 deliveries during the study period, 102 episodes of early-onset neonatal sepsis were identified, 61 of which were caused by group B Streptococcus and 41 of which were caused by E coli. E coli sepsis cases had a lower birth weight, a higher percentage with 5-minute Apgar score < 7, and a longer stay in the hospital neonatal intensive care unit and required mechanical ventilation more frequently. Death after early-onset neonatal sepsis with E coli was also more frequent.

Conclusion

Early-onset sepsis with E coli is associated with more morbidity and a higher mortality rate compared with early-onset group B Streptococcus.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^111cqEBQ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are very common during pregnancy. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen isolated from pregnant women. Ampicillin should not be used because of its high resistance to Escherichia coli. Pyelonephritis can cause morbidity and can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Second and third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for treatment, administered initially intravenously during hospitalization. Cultures and the study of virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli are recommended for the adequate management of pyelonephritis. The lower genital tract infection associated with pyelonephritis is responsible for the failure of antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria can evolve into cystitis or pyelonephritis. All pregnant women should be routinely screened for bacteriuria using urine culture, and should be treated with nitrofurantoin, sulfixosazole or first-generation cephalosporins. Recurrent urinary infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics. Pregnant women who develop urinary tract infections with group B streptococcal infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics during labour to prevent neonatal sepsis. Preterm delivery is frequent. Evidence suggests that infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of preterm labour. Experimental models in pregnant mice support the theory that Escherichia coli propagated by the transplacental route, involving bacterial adhesins, induces preterm delivery, but this has not been demonstrated in humans. Ascending lower genital tract infections are the most probable cause of preterm delivery, but this remains to be proved.

### Exposure to prescribed medication in early life and impacts on gut microbiota and disease development [^111sRyvq]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics

Antibiotics are among the most frequently administered medications during early life. Whether it is a urinary tract infection in pregnant women or premature birth or sepsis in infants, early-life antibiotic use can have immediate benefits. Studies have identified that early-life antibiotics may result in microbiome dysregulation connected with poor health outcomes. Maternal antibiotic exposure during pregnancy has been found to result in the detection of more than a dozen antibiotics in neonatal meconium, with penicillin showing the highest concentration. The diversity and richness of gut microbiota were negatively associated with intrauterine penicillin. Administration of antibiotics during childbirth, a common practice, may change the pattern of gut microbiota in newborns, characterised by lower relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, and higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Two prospective cohort studies which respectively included 266 vaginally delivered mother-infant pairs and 83 mother-infant pairs had showed the similar conclusions. 1-year-old infants with intrapartum antibiotic exposure to penicillins or cephalosporins had a slower increase in Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli (E. coli), and a greater proportionate increase in Coprococcus. Direct postnatal antibiotic use was a significant source of early-life antibiotic exposure, which disrupted the maturation pattern of the gut microbiota. In comparison to near-term infants (born at 36–37 weeks gestational age) who did not receive antibiotics during early life, preterm infants (born at 25–27 weeks gestational age) with very low birth weights (less than 1000 g) and antibiotic exposure to extensive antibiotics had a lower abundance of Prevotellaceae and a higher colonisation of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae. Pre-school children who were exposed to antibiotics early in life exhibited a lower abundance of Actinobacteria (including Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, and unassigned Coriobacteriaceae), and a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes (including Bacteroides and Parabacteroides), Lactobacillales and Proteobacteria.

### Early-onset neonatal infections in Australia and new zealand, 2002–2012 [^116e1bQF]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The epidemiology of early-onset neonatal sepsis (EONS) varies over time, and requires regular surveillance.

Objective

To analyse data on EONS in Australia and New Zealand.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of data collected longitudinally from multiple neonatal units from 2002 to 2012.

Results

Of 386423 live births, 454 infants had EONS. The incidence rate of EONS was 1.20 per 1000 live births in 2002 and 0.83 in 2012, decreasing by 4% per year (95%CI 1% to 7%, p = 0.007). Group B streptococcus (GBS) (37%) and Escherichia coli (25%) were the most prevalent organisms. The early-onset GBS (EOGBS) incidence rate was 0.43/1000 live births, with no evidence of change over time (p = 0.3). Of EOGBS-infected babies, 62% were born at term compared with 8% with early-onset E. coli sepsis, p < 0.0001. The mortality of E. coli early-onset sepsis (EOS) (25%) was higher than GBS (11%), but this difference in mortality was no longer significant after adjusting for gestation and birth weight. Mortality from EOS fell significantly over the study period (17% per year, 95%CI 10 to 24, p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

GBS was the most common cause of early sepsis, but the incidence was lower than prior to the introduction of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and remained steady over time. The mortality of early-onset E. coli sepsis was significantly higher than GBS sepsis, but this may have been because almost all babies with E. coli were born preterm, rather than a difference in virulence.

### Epidemiology of early and late onset neonatal sepsis in very low birthweight infants: data from the German neonatal network [^1139tZSW]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a major cause of death in neonates. Knowledge about epidemiology, risk factors, causative pathogens and outcome of neonatal sepsis is important to improve neonatal care. For Germany, only few data on neonatal sepsis in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants exist.

Methods

Data from 14,926 preterm infants with birth weight < 1500g and gestational age between 22 0/7 weeks and 31 6/7 collected between January 2009 and December 2017 were analyzed for frequency of early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS) and for causative pathogens. Risk factors for the development of EOS and LOS and outcomes after EOS and LOS were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression models.

Results

EOS occurred in 1.1% of infants and LOS in 11.9%. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen in EOS, coagulase-negative staphylococci in LOS. Multidrug-resistant organisms were detected in 8.4% of EOS and 3.9% of LOS cases. Risk factors for EOS were lower gestational age, intra-amniotic infection and spontaneous delivery. Risk factors for LOS were lower gestational age, small for gestational age, central lines, endotracheal ventilation and history of EOS. Both EOS and LOS were independently associated with adverse neonatal outcome.

Conclusions

These data from a large German neonatal cohort confirm neonatal sepsis as the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in VLBW infants, as well as E. coli and coagulase-negative staphylococci as the most prevalent pathogens. Multidisciplinary approaches such as antibiotic stewardship, hygiene and feeding strategies are necessary to further reduce the burden of sepsis in VLBW infants.

### Incidence and aetiology of infant Gram-negative bacteraemia and meningitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cykUh]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

Our aetiological findings for LMIC are consistent with previous systematic reviews based only on studies from LMIC. Characterisation of neonatal infections is less complete in these settings than in HIC, where surveillance networks such as neonIN (UK), Neo-KISS (Germany)and NRN (USA)have quantified trends, risk factors, aetiologies, antimicrobial susceptibilities and outcomes. Although findings from these studies show some regional variation, consistent aspects of invasive bacterial infection in infants include E. coli being predominant among Gram-negatives in EOD (otherwise dominated by group B Streptococcus (GBS)), a more even distribution of Gram-negative species in LOD (for which prematurity/VLBW was the main risk factor), and higher case fatality associated with GNB. Definitions were equivalent across a sufficient number of studies in our review to support a separate meta-analysis for VLBW infants, showing a Gram-negative pathogen distribution similar to that for LOD in HIC, which is consistent with the high relative risk of invasive late-onset bacterial infection in VLBW infants.

Our review did not address AMR in Gram-negative neonatal infections, a topic that has been covered by recent systematic reviews of studies from LMIC, Middle Eastern countries, sub-Saharan African countriesand China, but not HIC. Primary concerns around Gram-negative AMR include neonatal infection by E. coli resistant to ampicillin, gentamicin or both (an estimated 8% of early-onset infections in the United States) and emerging threats posed by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing (ESBL) and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (CPGNB). In LMIC, where challenges to antimicrobial stewardship are far greater, non-susceptibility of neonatal invasive infection isolates to ampicillin (89% in sub-Saharan Africa) and gentamicin (66% of Klebsiella spp, 47% of E. coli) is higher, and ESBL and CPGNB are established. The risk of contributing to AMR presents a challenge to prevention interventions such as intrapartum antibiotics and prophylaxis to prevent catheter-related infection. Antimicrobial stewardship programmes within neonatal units, principally reducing the initiation and duration of antibiotics, are supported by a growing body of observational evidence.

### Escherichia coli meningitis features in 325 children from 2001 to 2013 in France [^117WkVA1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We aimed to describe features of Escherichia coli meningitis in a large population of children and the molecular characteristics of the involved strains to determine factors associated with severe disease or death.

Methods

Between 2001 and 2013, a prospective national survey collected data for 325 children hospitalized with E. coli meningitis. The national reference center genetically characterized 141 isolates.

Results

Among the 325 cases, 65.2% were term, 22.4% late preterm, and 12.5% very/extremely preterm infants. Escherichia coli meningitis was 7-fold more frequent in preterm than term infants. Median age at diagnosis was 14 days; 71.1% of infants were neonates, with 2 peaks of infection at age 0–3 days (mostly preterm neonates) and 11–15 days (mostly term neonates); 8.9% were > 89 days old. In total, 51.1% patients were considered to have severe disease, and 9.2% died. B2.1 phylogenetic subgroup (56%) and O1 serogroup (27.7%) were the most frequently identified. On multivariate analysis, death was associated with preterm birth (odds ratio [OR], 3.3 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.3–8.4], P = 0.015 for late preterm infants; OR, 7.3 [95% CI, 2.7–20.9], P < .001 for very/extremely preterm infants) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to blood glucose ratio < 0.10 (OR, 15.3 [95% CI, 1.8–128.3], P = 0.012). Death was associated with uncommon O serogroup strains (P = 0.014) and severe disease with O7 serogroup (P = 0.034) and PapGII adhesin (OR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.2–4.5], P = 0.015).

Conclusions

In this large study of 325 cases of E. coli meningitis, risk factors of severe disease or death were preterm birth, severe hypoglycorrhachia, CSF/blood glucose ratio < 0.10, and molecular characteristics of strains, which should help optimize therapeutic management.

### Early-onset neonatal sepsis in the paris area: a population-based surveillance study from 2019 to 2021 [^113imG8d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) is a rare condition but an important cause of severe morbidity and mortality in neonates.

Methods

This is a prospective observational study in neonates born at ≥ 34 weeks of gestation (WG). The primary endpoint was EOS, defined by isolation of pathogenic species from blood culture and/or cerebrospinal fluid culture within 72hours after birth. Data on EOS were collected exhaustively from all maternity wards in Paris area (April 2019-March 2021).

Results

108 EOS were recorded (annual incidence, 0.32 per 1000 live births; 95%CI 0.26 to 0.38). In term infants, the most frequent pathogens were group B Streptococcus (GBS) (n = 47) and Escherichia coli (n = 20); in late preterm infants, the most frequent pathogens were E. coli (n = 15) and GBS (n = 7). Fifteen meningitis cases were diagnosed. Five E. coli strains (14%) were resistant to both amoxicillin and gentamicin, which is an empiric treatment for EOS. Of the 54 infants with GBS infections, 35 were born from mothers with negative GBS prepartum screening test and 8 from mothers with no screening. Two deaths were reported, both in term infants (Proteus mirabilis and E. coli).

Conclusion

In neonates ≥ 34 WG born in the Paris area, GBS was twice as frequent as E. coli in term infants. EOS was six times more frequent in late preterm than in term infants and was due to E. coli in 60% of cases. Prevention of GBS EOS and empiric antibiotic treatment of EOS could be improved.

### Ascending vaginal infection in mice induces preterm birth and neonatal morbidity [^114m64zj]. The American Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Preterm birth (PTB; delivery before 37 weeks) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. This is a serious global health problem, affecting approximately 11% of all pregnancies and 15 million babies a year. Risk factors include extremes in maternal age, body mass index, socioeconomic disadvantage, smoking, multiple pregnancies, and a previous PTB.

Despite extensive research, treatment strategies have proved largely ineffective. This is likely because of the multifactorial nature of spontaneous PTB. The cervix, a physical and immunologic barrier containing immune cells and producing antimicrobial peptides, plays a key role in preventing bacterial invasion. However, at least 40% of spontaneous PTBs are associated with microbes, which are thought to ascend from the vagina into the uterus, via the cervix. The microorganisms commonly linked with PTB have relatively low pathogenicity, and cases of chorioamnionitis are mostly polymicrobial. Species of Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, Fusobacterium, and Streptococcus have been found in the amniotic fluid in those most at risk. Vaginal Lactobacillus iners dominance has been linked to PTB risk in a UK population, whereas Lactobacillus crispatus dominance has been associated with term delivery.

The fetal immune system is primed in utero through exposure of the placenta, lungs, gut, and skin to microbes, as well as the vertical transmission of maternal immune cells. When delivered, babies exposed to infection/inflammation have an increased risk of periventricular leukomalacia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and early-onset neonatal sepsis. These conditions increase the likelihood of long-term complications resulting in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as cerebral palsy, and respiratory-related conditions, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

PTB can be induced in mice by ascending vaginal infection with a pathogenic Escherichia coli strain associated with human neonatal meningitis. The proportion of pups born alive is reduced and, in surviving pups, there is evidence of neuroinflammation. This model was used to investigate a novel therapeutic, demonstrating that adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector gene therapy to increase levels of the antimicrobial peptide human β defensin 3 (HBD3) in the cervix can reduce ascending infection and improve pup survival.

Here, the fetal and neonatal outcomes following exposure to ascending vaginal infection were characterized, assessing the fetal lungs and gut, as well as further interrogating fetal and neonatal neuropathology. The impact of pre-treating dams with cervical HBD3 gene therapy on perinatal neuroinflammation was assessed.

### Neonatalinfection in twins: clinical spectrum and management dilemma [^112Z71JC]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

In the early neonatal period, less than 7 days of age, majority of E. coli infection presents as respiratory distress progressing to haemodynamic instability. However, in older neonates, it can cause isolated pneumonia, localised skin infection and abscess, asymptomatic bacteraemia and meningitis. Maternal risk factors for EOS caused by E. coli and GBS include positive GBS surveillance, GBS bacteriuria, previous infant with EOS, prolonged rupture of membranes and maternal fever. Risk factors specific to E. coli EOS include prematurity, low birth weight and maternal chorioamnionitis. Of these, the only present risk factor for either twin was prematurity. Also relevant to this case, the presence of a CPAM is an independent risk factor for neonatal respiratory distress and respiratory tract infection.

In our case, the signs of EOS in twin A was recognised early, and 7 days of intravenous antibiotic treatment was effective. It is important to note, however, that current guidelines recommend a course of intravenous antibiotics of 10–14 days for uncomplicated early-onset bacteraemia caused by E. coli. There was a management dilemma regarding his twin, who was asymptomatic. Transmission of bacteria causing EOS is usually vertical from the mother, so twin B was high risk but did not have the additional risk factors (eg, CPAM). The only guideline in this scenario is from the AAP, which recommends close observation of the asymptomatic sibling, with investigations and empiric treatment if symptoms occur. In one small case series of twins with one sibling being investigated for EOS from Canada, just over a third of asymptomatic neonates with risk factors were investigated and empirically treated. There have been no studies showing incidence of EOS in an asymptomatic twin of a patient with EOS, likely due to rarity.

### Mode of delivery and other risk factors for Escherichia coli infections in very low birth weight infants [^1127H9mu]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Multivariate analysis

Multivariate analysis that took into account the combined effect of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP), PROM, chorioamnionitis and delivery mode (caesarean section) showed no significant effect on the risk of E. coli infection for factors other than the mode of delivery. However, multivariate analysis that took into account the combined effect of demographic data (sex, gestational age and birth weight) and place of birth (NICU) showed that only the place of hospitalisation had a significant effect on E. coli infection risk.

Finally, a multivariate analysis of maternal influences on IAP, PROM, amniotic inflammation, type of labour, gestational age, NICU and the likelihood of specific E.coli infections (vs. other infections) showed a significant statistical relationship with the complete model.

Escherichia coli resistance and similarity of strains

Analysis of the isolates showed that the highest levels of resistance among all E. coli isolates were observed against ampicillin (88.8%) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (62.2%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (34.4%) and aztreonam (33.3%). The ESBL phenotype was found among 25 isolates (27.7%). Sixteen of the ESBL-positive strains (17.7%) were also reported as resistant to at least two other groups of antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides or trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole), which allows us to consider these strains as MDR organisms (Table 2).

### Very low birth weight preterm infants with early onset neonatal sepsis: the predominance of gram-negative infections continues in the national institute of child health and human development neonatal research network, 2002–2003 [^111XoUms]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Early onset neonatal sepsis (EOS, occurring in the first 72 hours of life) remains an important cause of illness and death among very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants. We previously reported a change in the distribution of pathogens associated with EOS from predominantly gram-positive to primarily gram-negative organisms.

Objective

To compare rates of EOS and pathogens associated with infection among VLBW infants born at centers of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network during 3 time periods: 1991–1993; 1998–2000; and 2002–2003.

Study Design

Prospectively collected data from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network VLBW registry were retrospectively reviewed. Rates of blood culture confirmed EOS, selected maternal and infant variables and pathogens associated with infection were compared between 2002–2003 and 2 previously published cohorts.

Results

During the past 13 years, overall rates of EOS have remained stable (15–19 per 1000 live births of infants 401–1500 g). More than one-half of early infections in the 2002–2003 cohort were caused by gram-negative organisms (53%), with Escherichia coli the most common organism (41%). Rates of group B streptococcal infections remain low (1.8 per 1000 live births). Between 1991–1993 and 1998–2000, there was a significant increase in rates of E. coli infections; but in 2002–2003, there was no significant change (7.0 per 1000 live births). Infants with EOS continue to be at significantly increased risk for death compared with uninfected infants.

Conclusion

EOS remains an uncommon but important cause of morbidity and mortality among VLBW infants. Gram-negative organisms continue to be the predominant pathogens associated with EOS.

### Assessing patient-level risk factors for evidence-based early diagnosis of maternal sepsis [^117UKxWn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global maternal mortality rate due to maternal sepsis and infections was estimated at 12.44 deaths per 100,000 livebirths (i.e. about 16,840 deaths) in 2019; about 4 in 5 of these deaths occurred in Low- and Middle-Income countries (LMICs). Maternal infection can seriously affect the health of women and neonates. During pregnancy, acute maternal infections can cause maternal morbidity and mortality and obstetric complications such as stillbirth, miscarriage, low birth weight and preterm labour. Annually, one million neonatal deaths are attributed to maternal infections or sepsis, which are preventable and treatable causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. However, according to findings from the WHO Global Maternal Sepsis Study Research Group, in 2017, around 70 out of every 1,000 live births involved pregnant or recently pregnant women requiring hospital care due to maternal infections; also, infections were associated with over half of the intrahospital maternal deaths in the same year. Despite the disproportionate burden of maternal sepsis in LMICs, the evidence base for its early detection remains limited. Gaps persist in understanding patient-level risk factors, such as health-seeking behaviour, and evaluating diagnostic and outcome-related parameters within LMIC settings.

According to the WHO, maternal sepsis is a life-threatening condition defined as organ dysfunction resulting from infection during pregnancy, childbirth, post-abortion, or postpartum period. Escherichia coli is consistently identified as the most common causative organism in cases of maternal sepsis; other frequently reported pathogens, in descending order of prevalence, include Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A, C, and G Streptococcus, Enterobacter species, and Chlamydia trachomatis. However, the relative frequency of these organisms may vary across different populations and clinical contexts, such as the mode of delivery or geographic setting. Some systemic infections are also more severe during pregnancy (e.g. malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, herpes).

Physiological, immunological and mechanical changes in pregnancy predispose women to infection (particularly urogenital and healthcare-associated infections, as well as other non-reproductive infections, e.g. pneumonia), placing them women at a ten-fold higher risk of developing sepsis. Physiological adaptations to pregnancy can obscure early signs of infection and sepsis, delaying diagnosis and increasing the risk of rapid progression to septic shock, with severe consequences for both mother and fetus. In LMICs, this diagnostic uncertainty often leads to the inappropriate use of antibiotics, contributing to antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

### The role of early-onset-sepsis in the neurodevelopment of very low birth weight infants [^117MrLoi]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Very low birth weight infants (VLBW, birth weight < 1500 g) are more susceptible to brain injury than term infants. This may lead to adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. While survival rates of VLBW-infants have increased in recent years, the rates of long-term developmental impairments have not decreased.

In their review article, Saigal et al. pointed out that about one quarter of surviving preterm infants have substantial neurological morbidity. Common impairments affecting the central nervous system (CNS) are intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, and sensory impairments. Several mechanisms have been proposed as to how systemic inflammation and subsequently elevated cytokine levels in mother and child in the perinatal period may damage brain parenchyma.

Other well established risk factors for adverse long-term neurological outcomes are low gestational age, low birth weight, male gender, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).

The aim of our study was to assess the effects of early-onset-sepsis (EOS) on VLBW infants' neurological development. EOS is usually defined as onset of an infection within the first 72 h of life in hospitalized infants with a proof of pathogen by blood culture. Numbers regarding the incidence of culture-proven EOS in VLBW infants range from 1 to 28 per 1000 live births depending on gestational age, birth weight, ethnicity and intrauterine infection among many other factors.

However, clear sepsis symptoms can occur even though attempts to culture the causative organism may remain unsuccessful ⁠. This situation has been defined as clinical sepsis in similar research. Recognizing clinical sepsis can be enhanced by long established blood biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CrP) and interleukins ⁠. The definition of EOS as an infection starting within the first 72 h of life reflects the proposed pathophysiology, as pathogens are considered to be transmitted vertically from mother to child in the pre- and perinatal period ⁠. Pathogens causing EOS are most commonly Group-B- Streptococcus (GBS) and, increasingly, Escherichia coli and several less common bacterial pathogens, but they may also include candida or viral pathogens.

### Molecular characterization of a rare ESBL E. coli strain causing a necrotizing enterocolitis outbreak in preterm infants [^111rvKv1]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a severe comorbidity of prematurity, is usually sporadic, but occasional outbreaks suggest an infectious cause. Escherichia coli, the most frequent Gram-negative pathogen in preterm infants, historically displays a low inhospital transmissibility.

Aim

To report the management of an NEC outbreak in a Belgian neonatal intensive care unit and the molecular characterization of a rare, highly virulent/resistant E. coli strain.

Methods

Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. Surveillance and clinical isolates characterized using standard methods were secondarily analyzed by bacterial whole-genome sequencing using EnteroBase for phylogenic classification and BioNumerics for resistance and virulence profile determination.

Findings

A cluster of 6 infants was colonized by a single extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli strain in a 1-month period. Four infants developed severe NEC, resulting in 1 death and 3 short bowel syndromes. Although the index infant and his twin sibling acquired the strain vertically from their mother, transmission occurred horizontally through caregivers in subsequent cases. Enhanced infection prevention and control measures allowed containment of the outbreak. Molecular typing of the strain revealed a single, previously unregistered O6:H1 serotype of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, urinary pathogenic E. coli harboring multiple resistance and virulence genes, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-encoding blaCTX-M-15 and fimbriae-encoding papA.

Conclusion

The emergence of high-virulence strains in neonatal intensive care units calls for the implementation of enhanced infection prevention and control strategies. Bacterial genomic sequencing techniques, if implemented in multidrug-resistant organism screening, could represent a valuable addition for early characterization of virulence and resistance profiles, and improve prevention and containment of infectious outbreaks.

### Early-onset sepsis among preterm neonates in China, 2015 to 2018 [^112Mu5U8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The epidemiology of early-onset sepsis (EOS) in China is poorly understood because of the paucity of high-quality data. We aimed to examine the epidemiology, pathogen distribution and neonatal outcomes of EOS among a large cohort of preterm infants in China.

Methods

All infants born at < 34 weeks of gestation and admitted to 25 tertiary neonatal intensive care units in China from April 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. EOS was defined as a culture-confirmed infection that occurred within 72 hours after birth.

Results

Among 27,532 enrolled infants, 321 (11.7 cases per 1000 admissions) infants developed EOS, and 61 (19.0%) infants died within seven days after EOS onset. The incidence of EOS among inborn infants in 18 perinatal centers was 9.7 cases per 1000 live births < 34 weeks' gestation (186/19,084). The case fatality rate was 22.6% (42/186). Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 61.7% of EOS and 82.0% of EOS-related deaths. Escherichia coli (20.3%) was the leading pathogen, followed by Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (16.5%), Achromobacter xylosoxidans (9.0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.1%). Group B streptococci infections were relatively rare (2.5%). EOS was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and retinopathy of prematurity.

Conclusions

There is a high burden of EOS among preterm infants in China with a distinctive pathogen distribution. Longitudinal epidemiologic monitoring, further investigation of causative pathogens and development of targeted strategies for prevention and treatment of EOS are needed.

### Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent group B streptococcal infections in newborn infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing various strategies [^1153QCKX]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported that universal strategies were associated with a lower incidence of EOGBS infection compared to risk-based strategies or having no strategy. However, IAP strategies still vary considerably around the world and are largely absent in developing countries. Reasons for the variation in IAP strategies include discussion concerning increased antibiotic use, antimicrobial resistance development and risk of a possible increase in non-GBS early-onset sepsis (EOS), caused by pathogens like Escherichia coli. Moreover, even when implementing universal strategies, there is no consensus of timing of GBS determination, though most guidelines recommend determination between 35 and 37 weeks' gestation.

In order to contribute to consensus on GBS prevention strategies, this review elaborates on previous work, while incorporating up-to-date evidence on a variety of outcomes needed for evidence-based and nuanced policy-making. We evaluated the effectiveness of different prevention strategies, by comparing maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity and mortality, the frequency of IAP administration, and the presence of antimicrobial resistance. Furthermore, we evaluated timing of GBS determination in universal strategies to prevent EOGBS infection in newborns.

### Early-onset infection caused by Escherichia coli sequence type 1193 in late preterm and full-term neonates [^113Gko12]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, we used WGS to characterize E. coli strains causing EOS from a prospective multicenter study in France and compared them to E. coli strains obtained from vaginal samples from pregnant women at 34–38 weeks of gestation. Although we observed no major differences between the EOS study and vaginal sample collections in distribution of phylogroups or virulence factors except the K1 antigen, we identified emerging ST1193 strains as major causes of EOS. Three isolates of the ST1193 clonal group caused meningitis, and half harbored an ESBL. E. coli ST1193 thus appears to be the most virulent and antimicrobial-resistant E. coli group that causes EOS.

Among major phylogroups, B2 and, to a lesser extent, D are associated with extraintestinal infections, whereas A and B1 are most associated with commensal strains or intestinal infections. We also observed predominance of B2 strains in our EOS population, regardless of the term of birth of the newborns. Although the proportion of phylogroup A strains was higher in the HVC than the EOS population, B2 strains largely predominated in the HVC collection, as reported in previous studies. However, sequence typing enabled a finer comparison between the 2 collections. Among the HVC strains, phylogroup A/STc10 (ST10, ST13795, ST6826, and ST13957) was predominant but was rarely observed among the EOS patients, in which ST95 and STc14 (notably ST14 and ST1193) were largely predominant. The high frequency of ST95 was expected because of its virulence in neonates, notably those with neonatal meningitis, which is well known worldwide. Of note, ST95 was second most common among HVC strains, suggesting its capacity to colonize the vagina, at least temporarily. Five of 6 mothers with EOS caused by ST95 received no prepartum antimicrobials. In contrast, ST14 and ST1193 strains were frequently associated with women receiving prepartum antimicrobials (5/8), and those strains were not present among HVC patients, suggesting the vaginal environment might inhibit the presence of ST14 and ST1193 strains. Of note, that STc14 but not ST95 was more prevalent among preterm neonates with EOS and 3/6 infections caused by ST1193 strains occurred in preterm newborns. It might be that ST1193 strains are less virulent than ST95 strains commonly found in full-term neonates. However, almost all women with preterm newborns received antimicrobial drugs, which might favor the selection of resistant strains, such as ST1193.

### About Escherichia coli infection… [^113vVasE]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points E. coliare bacteria found in many places like the intestines of people and animals.
- Most kinds of E. coliare harmless, but some can make you sick.
- This site focuses on the kinds of E. colithat cause diarrhea. Overview E. coli are germs called bacteria. They are found in many places, including in the environment, foods, water, and the intestines of people and animals. Most E. coli are harmless and are part of a healthy intestinal tract. E. coli help us digest food, produce vitamins, and protect us from harmful germs. But some E. coli can make people sick with diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, sepsis, and other illnesses. This website focuses on the kinds of E. coli. People can get infected after swallowing E. coli. This can happen through contaminated food or water or contact with animals, environments, or other people. Some people are more likely to get infected. Groups of people who are at increased risk for E.

coli infection include:

- Children younger than 5
- Adults 65 and older
- People with weakened immune systems
- International travelers E. coli infection can be serious. Infection with Shiga toxin-producing. E. coli can lead to a serious health condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome. HUS can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems, and even death. E. coli infection can be prevented. The good news is that you can take steps to help keep yourself and your family safe.

### Information for clinicians | E. coli infection… [^111fhZdK]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most intestinal E. coliinfections can be managed symptomatically.
- Patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting should be rehydrated.
- Early use of intravenous fluids may decrease the risk of renal failure in children with STEC infection. Testing for STEC Stool samples should be routinely cultured for E. coli O157 and simultaneously assayed for non-O157 STEC with a test that detects Shiga toxins. All presumptive E. coli O157 isolates and Shiga toxin-positive specimens should be sent to a public health laboratory for further characterization. Rapid, accurate diagnosis of STEC infection is important because early clinical management decisions can affect patient outcomes and early detection can help prevent secondary spread. Treatment Hydration Most E. coli infections can be managed symptomatically. Patients with profuse diarrhea or vomiting should be rehydrated.

Evidence from studies of children with STEC O157 infection indicates that early use of intravenous fluids may decrease the risk of renal failure. Antibiotics Antibiotics used to treat infection with diarrheagenic E. coli other than STEC include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and rifaximin. Clinicians treating a patient whose clinical syndrome suggests STEC infection should be aware that administering antimicrobial agents may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Resistance to antimicrobials is increasing worldwide. The decision to use an antibiotic should be carefully weighed against the severity of illness, the possibility that the pathogen is resistant, and the risk of adverse reactions, such as rash, antibiotic-associated colitis, and vaginal yeast infection.

Antimotility agents Antimotility agents should be avoided for patients with bloody diarrhea; treatment should be reassessed if symptoms have not improved in 48 hours. Antimotility agents also should not be given to patients with STEC infection because these agents may increase the risk of complications, including toxic megacolon, HUS, and neurologic complications. No known data show that kaolin-pectin compounds or lactobacillus slow diarrhea or relieve abdominal cramping.

### What is foodborne illness? (food safety for moms-to-Be) [^116Uorkn]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

While You're Pregnant Main Page You might have heard about foodborne illness outbreaks in the news, for example, caused by What Is Foodborne Illness | Listeria | Toxoplasma E. coliO157: H7 or Listeria monocytogenes. Often referred to as "food poisoning, " it's a sickness that occurs when people eat or drink harmful microorganisms or chemical contaminants found in some foods or drinking water. "Why should pregnant women be concerned about foodborne illness. " You are at particularly high risk for foodborne illness because your immune system is altered during pregnancy. This is a natural condition, which helps you and your baby get along with each other. However, such an alteration may make it harder for your body to fight off certain harmful foodborne microorganisms. Your unborn baby is also at high risk because the baby's immune system is not developed enough to fight off harmful foodborne microorganisms.

Foodborne illness during pregnancy can cause serious health problems, miscarriage, premature delivery, stillbirth or even death of the mother. Different microorganisms or chemical contaminants can affect the mother and fetus or newborn in a variety of ways. For example, sometimes foodborne illness can make the mother sick, leaving her exhausted and dehydrated. Other times the symptoms are absent or so mild that the mother doesn't even know that she's been infected, but she's still passing the infection to her unborn child
- who may then experience serious effects from the illness. "How can foodborne illness affect my baby. " Harmful foodborne microorganisms or some elements in food can cross the placenta and cause harm to the developing fetus. As a result, the infected fetus or newborn can experience a wide range of health problems
- or even death. But, read on. this Website shows you how to protect your baby. "What's the general treatment for foodborne illness.

" A doctor may perform a blood test or request a stool sample for testing. Maintaining hydration is an important part of the treatment, especially if the mother is vomiting and/or has diarrhea. Antibiotics that are safe to use during pregnancy may be prescribed by a doctor to get rid of the mother's infection. The antibiotics may also prevent infection of the fetus or newborn. Antibiotics may also be given to babies who are born with foodborne illness.
