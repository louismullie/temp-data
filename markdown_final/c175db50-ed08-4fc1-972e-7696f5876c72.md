## Question

How does biliary colic differ from cholecystitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how biliary colic differs from cholecystitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathophysiologic distinction between transient obstruction without inflammation versus persistent obstruction with inflammation. Then, I should compare clinical presentation features including pain quality, systemic inflammatory signs, and exam findings. Next, I will review diagnostic frameworks and investigations, especially Tokyo Guidelines criteria and the role of ultrasound, labs, and cholescintigraphy. After that, I should differentiate management strategies, timing of surgery, and antibiotic use. I will then consider surgical complexity, risks, and conversion. Finally, I will synthesize natural history and complication risks to produce a concise set of distinguishing features and address common pitfalls.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology because that anchors everything. Biliary colic represents pain from transient cystic duct obstruction by a stone without triggering gallbladder inflammation, whereas acute cholecystitis reflects persistent obstruction leading to a local inflammatory cascade that can progress to secondary bacterial infection with organisms like E. coli and Klebsiella, among others [^1177RydH] [^113bNUia].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the symptoms until I separate pain patterns. In biliary colic, pain is episodic, often severe, and occurs in attacks in the RUQ or epigastrium, consistent with Rome-type criteria, and typically resolves as the obstruction relieves, while in acute cholecystitis, pain is persistent with localized RUQ tenderness and may radiate, reflecting parietal peritoneal involvement; a positive Murphy's sign can support the diagnosis, although its likelihood ratios are modest and not definitive by themselves [^115N5s7N] [^113bNUia] [^114jxnHw].

> Wait, let me verify the systemic inflammatory component because that's a key discriminator. By definition, biliary colic lacks systemic inflammatory response (no fever, normal WBC/CRP), whereas the Tokyo Guidelines require local signs (RUQ pain/tenderness or Murphy's) plus systemic signs (fever, elevated WBC or CRP) and then imaging confirmation for definite acute cholecystitis; I initially thought strict numeric cutoffs like CRP > 10 mg/L and WBC > 11,000/μL were mandated, but I should correct myself: TG18 emphasizes the presence of inflammatory markers rather than fixed universal thresholds, so clinical context and institutional reference ranges matter [^1177RydH] [^111Dzo9D].

> I need to check diagnostics next and confirm the imaging hierarchy. Ultrasound is the preferred first-line test for gallbladder pathology and to assess cholecystitis features (wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, sonographic Murphy's), while cholescintigraphy (HIDA) is useful when ultrasound is equivocal; point-of-care ultrasound by emergency physicians has reasonable specificity but moderate sensitivity for acute cholecystitis, so negative scans don't fully exclude it in the right clinical context, and the full Tokyo framework remains essential [^114XCxpK] [^115XGtJD] [^113t6CC8] [^111Dzo9D].

> But wait, what about liver tests and jaundice, because these can confuse the picture. Mild hyperbilirubinemia can accompany acute cholecystitis from inflammatory cholestasis, whereas isolated biliary colic generally leaves bilirubin and LFTs normal unless there is concomitant choledocholithiasis; crucially, elevated LFTs or bilirubin alone have poor positive predictive value for common bile duct stones in the setting of cholecystitis, so further risk stratification and second-level testing (EUS/MRCP/IOC) are recommended rather than assuming ductal stones on labs alone [^113bNUia] [^112RxuPA] [^114gKpDj].

> I should confirm the management philosophy for biliary colic now. Analgesia with NSAIDs is first-line for symptomatic relief, and although biliary colic is "non-inflammatory", deferring surgery carries a high risk of readmission and biliary complications; multiple contemporary series support index-admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy to mitigate substantial early readmission rates and complications seen with delayed elective surgery, even though practice patterns often still defer [^1177RydH] [^114Af77b] [^113dUdNY] [^1116uYdY].

> Next, I should review acute cholecystitis management and timing because this is often exam-tested and guideline-driven. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy as soon as feasible — ideally within 7 days of hospital admission and within 10 days of symptom onset — reduces morbidity and length of stay versus delayed or intermediate timing, and antibiotics are indicated given infection risk; when surgical risk is prohibitive or sepsis is uncontrolled, image-guided gallbladder drainage is an appropriate bridge or alternative, and high-risk patients often still benefit from definitive surgery when expertise allows [^114XCxpK] [^116f4bpe] [^111wc8A3] [^111wR4qs] [^115MUCQT] [^116UzkoP] [^1145t1K2].

> Hold on, I should verify surgical complexity and bailout strategies. Biliary colic cases usually have less inflammation and are technically easier with lower conversion rates, whereas acute cholecystitis increases operative difficulty, adhesions, and conversion risk; when the critical view is unsafe, subtotal cholecystectomy is recommended, and conversion to open is appropriate in the setting of severe inflammation, dense adhesions, bleeding in Calot's triangle, or suspected bile duct injury to prevent catastrophic complications [^116dn5eX] [^11157uew] [^11168ruS] [^112V6S2S].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should place these distinctions in the context of natural history and population burden. Biliary colic sits at the "mild" end but is a precursor state, with roughly 30% progressing to complications over time if not definitively treated, while acute cholecystitis represents established complicated gallstone disease with significant risks — untreated complications historically reach double-digit mortality; epidemiologically, cholecystitis accounts for a meaningful fraction of biliary admissions and merits early definitive care [^111321Pu] [^113bNUia] [^114pPftD].

> Let me synthesize key distinguishing features so I'm not missing anything crucial. If pain is intermittent and colicky with spontaneous resolution, absent fever and normal WBC/CRP, and ultrasound shows stones without secondary inflammatory changes, biliary colic is most likely and warrants analgesia and usually cholecystectomy preferably on the index admission; if pain is persistent with RUQ tenderness and systemic inflammatory signs, and ultrasound demonstrates inflammatory features, that meets Tokyo criteria for suspected or definite acute cholecystitis and calls for early laparoscopic cholecystectomy with antibiotics and appropriate escalation if high-risk or unstable [^1177RydH] [^111Dzo9D] [^114XCxpK].

> I should double-check common pitfalls and edge cases before concluding. Elevated LFTs alone should not be used to diagnose choledocholithiasis in acute cholecystitis; apply risk stratification and confirm with EUS/MRCP/IOC as indicated, and remember that functional gallbladder disorders (including hyperkinesia) can mimic biliary colic with normal ultrasound, where HIDA physiology and careful patient selection guide management and evidence for cholecystectomy is evolving [^112RxuPA] [^114gKpDj] [^111N8ynN] [^11642tpT].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the reader sees that the decisive separator is inflammation: biliary colic is transient obstruction without systemic inflammation, while acute cholecystitis is persistent obstruction with local and systemic inflammatory response confirmed by imaging; that pathophysiologic split drives distinct diagnostic criteria, investigation pathways, urgency of cholecystectomy, and prognostic implications, and recognizing it early improves outcomes and reduces avoidable readmissions [^1177RydH] [^111Dzo9D] [^114XCxpK] [^114Af77b].

Biliary colic is **transient pain** from temporary cystic duct obstruction without inflammation, whereas cholecystitis is **persistent pain** from prolonged obstruction with gallbladder inflammation. Biliary colic typically presents with episodic RUQ/epigastric pain **lasting < 6 hours**, without fever or leukocytosis; ultrasound shows gallstones without wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. Cholecystitis presents with sustained RUQ pain > 6 hours, often with fever, leukocytosis, and a positive Murphy's sign. On ultrasound, gallstones, wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and a sonographic Murphy's sign are seen [^113t6CC8]. Management differs: biliary colic is managed with analgesia [^1177RydH] and elective cholecystectomy, whereas cholecystitis requires **urgent antibiotics** and **early cholecystectomy within 7 days** [^116f4bpe].

---

## Pathophysiology

Biliary colic results from **transient cystic duct obstruction** by gallstones or sludge [^113bNUia], causing increased intraluminal pressure and gallbladder distension that produces episodic pain without inflammation. In contrast, acute cholecystitis arises from **prolonged cystic duct obstruction**, leading to gallbladder inflammation and edema, with possible secondary bacterial infection (commonly E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterococcus) driving persistent pain and a systemic inflammatory response.

---

## Clinical presentation

| **Feature** | **Biliary colic** | **Cholecystitis** |
|-|-|-|
| Pain | Episodic, colicky, RUQ/epigastric, radiates to back/right shoulder, lasts < 6 hours | Persistent, severe, RUQ, radiates to back/right shoulder, lasts > 6 hours |
| Fever | Absent | Present (≥ 38°C) |
| Nausea/vomiting | Common | Common |
| Murphy's sign | Negative | Positive |
| Jaundice | Rare | Occasional |
| Systemic signs | Absent | Present (fever, **leukocytosis, elevated CRP**) [^111Dzo9D] [^114LvVvZ] |

---

## Laboratory findings

In biliary colic, laboratory tests are **typically normal**, although brief obstruction may cause mild, transient elevations in liver enzymes. In acute cholecystitis, **leukocytosis**, **elevated CRP** [^111Dzo9D], and mild elevations in ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and bilirubin are common [^1177QuKY].

---

## Imaging findings

Ultrasound is **first-line imaging** [^114XCxpK] for both conditions because of its availability, non-invasiveness, and accuracy [^113t6CC8].

| **Imaging feature** | **Biliary colic** | **Cholecystitis** |
|-|-|-|
| Gallstones | Present | Present |
| Gallbladder wall thickening | Absent | Present (> 3 mm) |
| Pericholecystic fluid | Absent | Present |
| Sonographic Murphy's sign | Negative | Positive |
| Gallbladder distension | Mild | Marked |

---

HIDA scanning is not routinely used for biliary colic. In cholecystitis, **non-visualization of the gallbladder** confirms the diagnosis [^115XGtJD].

---

## Management strategies

Biliary colic is managed with analgesia (NSAIDs or opioids) and antiemetics, followed by elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy to prevent recurrence and complications [^1177RydH] [^115ZN5BN]. Acute cholecystitis requires **urgent hospitalization**, intravenous antibiotics, and **early laparoscopic cholecystectomy** [^114BcThD] within 7 days of admission and within 10 days of symptom onset [^116f4bpe]. Consider percutaneous cholecystostomy for high-risk or non-surgical candidates [^116UzkoP] [^115MUCQT].

---

## Complications

Untreated biliary colic can progress to cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or cholangitis. Acute cholecystitis poses greater risks, including gallbladder **perforation, abscess, gangrene, and sepsis** [^113bNUia].

---

## Prognosis

Biliary colic has an excellent prognosis after elective cholecystectomy, with low recurrence when treated. Acute cholecystitis generally has a **good prognosis with early intervention**, whereas delayed treatment increases morbidity and mortality [^1161QhNQ] [^114B6Biy].

---

## Summary table

| **Feature** | **Biliary colic** | **Cholecystitis** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathophysiology | Transient cystic duct obstruction without inflammation | Prolonged obstruction with inflammation |
| Pain duration | < 6 hours | > 6 hours |
| Fever | Absent | Present |
| Murphy's sign | Negative | Positive |
| Leukocytosis | Absent | Present |
| Gallbladder wall thickening | Absent | Present |
| Pericholecystic fluid | Absent | Present |
| Management | Analgesia, elective cholecystectomy | Antibiotics, urgent cholecystectomy |
| Complications | Rare, but can progress to cholecystitis | Common, including perforation, abscess, sepsis |

---

Biliary colic and cholecystitis are distinct entities with different pathophysiology, clinical features, and management. Accurate **differentiation** is essential to guide appropriate treatment and prevent complications [^1169Tm3N].

### Acute cholecystitis [^114pPftD]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Low credibility.

Of people admitted to the hospital for biliary tract disease, 20% have acute cholecystitis. Up to the age of 50 years, acute calculous cholecystitis is three times more common in women than in men, and about 1.5 times more common in women than in men thereafter. About 95% of people with acute cholecystitis have gallstones. Optimal therapy for acute cholecystitis, based on timing and severity of presentation, remains controversial.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute cholecystitis? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 17 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: early cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy, observation alone, open cholecystectomy, and percutaneous cholecystostomy.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated biliary colic [^115ZN5BN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated biliary colic is one of the most common indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. When performed electively, laparoscopic cholecystectomy can involve several months of waiting, during which time individuals may develop life-threatening complications.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with uncomplicated biliary colic due to gallstones.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until March 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language and publication status.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted the data. We sought to include data on short-term mortality (30-day or in-hospital mortality), bile duct injury, other serious adverse events, quality of life, conversion to open cholecystectomy, length of hospital stay, operating time, and return to work. We planned to calculate the risk ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) with a 95% CI for continuous outcomes using RevMan and based on intention-to-treat analysis when data were available. Since only one trial contributed data to this review, Fisher's exact test was used for binary outcomes. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

- **Main results**: Only one trial including 75 participants (average age: 43 years; females: 65% of participants), randomized.

### Cholecystitis [^113bNUia]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute cholecystitis:

- **Definition**: Acute cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder and is usually caused by obstruction of the cystic duct.

- **Pathophysiology**: It is mostly caused by gallstones or by impacted biliary sludge, with or without secondary bacterial infection such as E. coli, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus faecalis.

- **Disease course**: The inflammatory process due to obstruction of the cystic duct results in clinical manifestations of persistent pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), along with mild jaundice. Disease progression may lead to gangrenous cholecystitis, gallbladder perforation, cholecystoenteric fistulas, gallstone ileus, and acalculous cholecystitis.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the United States, the overall mortality associated with untreated complications of acute cholecystitis is approximately 20%.

### Defining biliary hyperkinesia and the role of cholecystectomy [^111N8ynN]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

Functional gallbladder disorder is most commonly defined by biliary colic and low ejection fraction (EF) on cholescintigraphy. Biliary hyperkinesia is a controversial type of functional gallbladder disorder; its definition and the role of cholecystectomy in treating this disorder remains unclear.

- **Study design**: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent cholecystokinin-stimulated cholescintigraphy and cholecystectomy at three Mayo Clinic sites between 2007 and 2020. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, presented with symptoms of biliary disease, had an EF greater than 50%, underwent cholecystectomy, and had no evidence of acute cholecystitis or cholelithiasis on imaging. We used receiver operating characteristics curve analysis to identify the optimal cutoff value that predicted symptom resolution within 30 days of cholecystectomy.

- **Results**: A total of 2,929 cholecystokinin-stimulated cholescintigraphy scans were performed during the study period; the average EF was 67.5% and the median EF was 77%. Analyzing those with EFs greater than or equal to 50% yielded 1,596 patients, with 141 (8.8%) going on to have cholecystectomy. No significant differences were found in age, sex, BMI, or final pathology between patients with and without pain resolution. Using a cutoff EF of 81% was significantly associated with pain resolution after cholecystectomy (78.2% for EF greater than or equal to 81% vs. 60.0% for EF less than 81%, p = 0.03). Chronic cholecystitis was found in 61.7% of the patients on final pathology.

### A population-based analysis of the clinical course of 10,304 patients with acute cholecystitis, discharged without cholecystectomy [^114B6Biy]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Randomized trials and expert opinion support early laparoscopic cholecystectomy for most patients with acute cholecystitis (AC); however, practice patterns remain variable worldwide, and delayed cholecystectomy remains a common practice. We therefore present a population-based analysis of the clinical course of patients with AC discharged without cholecystectomy.

- **Methods**: Using administrative databases capturing all emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions within a geographic region encompassing 13 million persons, we identified adults with a first emergency admission for uncomplicated AC during the period of 2004 to 2011. In those discharged without cholecystectomy, the probability of a subsequent gallstone-related event (gallstone-related ED visit or hospital admission) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. The association of patient characteristics with time to first gallstone-related event after discharge was explored through multivariable time to event analysis.

- **Results**: Of 25,397 patients with AC, 10,304 (41%) did not undergo cholecystectomy on first admission. The probability of a gallstone-related event by 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year after discharge was 14%, 19%, and 29%, respectively. Of these events, 30% were for biliary tract obstruction or pancreatitis. When controlling for sex, income, and comorbidity level, the risk of a gallstone-related event was highest for patients 18 years to 34 years old.

- **Conclusion**: For patients who do not undergo cholecystectomy on first admission for AC, the probability of a gallstone-related ED visit remains high.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111Xs3Vq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

An update of the literature searches was performed for the purpose of this guideline. Sixteen trials were identified in the update (including the trials originally included in the systematic review). The number of participants with acute cholecystitis was not reported in one of the trials. In the remaining 15 trials, 1,240 participants were included in 14 trials comparing early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC), and 618 participants were included in one trial comparing ELC versus intermediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ILC).

- **Trial details**: The country, recruitment period, number of participants, duration of symptoms, timing of ELC, DLC, and ILC, and the surgical experience are reported in Table 3. Overall, it appears that ELC was performed within 10 days of onset of symptoms in most trials.

- **Main reasons for bias**:
	- High risk of bias: At least one of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, missing outcome bias, or selective outcome reporting bias was classified as high risk of bias.
	- Unclear risk of bias: At least one of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, missing outcome bias, or selective outcome reporting bias was classified as unclear risk of bias without any of the domains being classified as high risk of bias.
	- All studies were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. The risk of bias classification stated here is for the remaining domains.

### 2020 World society of emergency surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111grH3R]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

We performed a systematic review of studies reporting on the ability of prognostic factors or risk prediction models to predict important patient-related outcomes, such as mortality, complications, and conversion to open surgery in patients with acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we included 12 studies and 6,827 patients in one or more analyses. Only a few factors (TG13, age, male gender, previous abdominal surgery, diabetes, hypertension, and C-reactive protein) were reported in a format similar enough to allow comparisons between studies. The remaining factors were studied in single studies or using different thresholds. Therefore, there is no information on their reproducibility, and the results may be unreliable.

Among the prognostic factors reported in at least two studies, TG13 grade 3 had an increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to grade 1, with the risk increasing from a median risk of 1.3% to 6.5% (95% CI 3.7–11.2). However, most studies included only people who underwent surgery, not all of whom were patients with ACC. There have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of surgery versus observation in people with severe ACC. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by experienced surgeons had lower major complication rates than percutaneous cholecystostomy with no planned cholecystectomy. Therefore, despite the increased risk of mortality in TG13 grade 3 compared to TG13 grade 1, surgery seems to be the preferred option when possible. However, referral to high-volume centers and specialized centers may decrease the complications and resulting mortality.

### Implementation of a specialist-led service for the management of acute gallstone disease [^116dn5eX]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The 'gold standard' treatment for acute cholecystitis and biliary colic requiring hospital admission is urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is not routinely available in all hospitals.

- **Methods**: A retrospective audit of emergency admissions with acute cholecystitis or biliary colic from January to December 2000 led to the development and implementation of a specialist-led protocol for the urgent management of acute gallstone disease. A second audit was carried out covering the six months after implementation.

- **Results**: One hundred and fifty-eight patients were admitted with acute cholecystitis or biliary colic in the first audit period and 110 in the second interval. The rate of cholecystectomy at index admission increased from 37.3 to 67.3 percent, at a median of three days after admission, and the conversion rate to open surgery fell from 32 to 12 percent. Median hospital stay decreased from nine to 5.5 days, and the unplanned readmission rate decreased from 19.0 to 3.6 percent.

- **Conclusion**: Urgent cholecystectomy for the management of acute gallstone disease is feasible and achievable in an acute services hospital with a specialist upper gastrointestinal team. It can lead to a reduced conversion rate, shorter hospital stay, fewer unplanned readmissions, an acceptable operating time, and a low complication rate. The protocol is recommended for implementation in other hospitals.

- **Alternative treatment for patients with ACC who are not suitable for surgery: Observation and techniques for gallbladder drainage**: When should non-operative management be considered for patients with ACC?

- **Non-operative management (NOM)**: We suggest considering NOM, i.e. best medical therapy with antibiotics and observation, for patients refusing surgery or those who are not suitable for surgery [Quality of Evidence (QoE): low; Strength of Recommendation (SoR): weak].

- **Alternative treatment options**: We suggest considering alternative treatment options for patients who fail NOM and who still refuse surgery or are not suitable for surgery [QoE: low; SoR: weak].

Schmidt et al. published an RCT comparing observation and surgery in cases of ACC, with a long median follow-up time of 14 years. In their analysis, about 30% of patients with mildly symptomatic acute cholecystitis who did not undergo cholecystectomy developed gallstone-related complications, as compared with 3% of patients who underwent cholecystectomy. However, these differences were not significant for redisease or complications. Overall, 60% of patients had undergone surgery, while 40% avoided surgery.

There are significant limitations in the study, as recognized by the authors. Firstly, a relevant percentage of eligible patients (41%) were excluded from randomization. Secondly, the reasons for the exclusion were not stated in the paper. Thirdly, the definitions of dropout and failure within the observation group were not clear. Brazzelli et al. published a systematic review of two RCTs comparing observation with surgery in patients with symptomatic gallstone disease.

### Acute cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, and biliary leakage [^115XGtJD]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Use of cholescintigraphy to diagnose acute cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, and biliary leakage dates back to the late 1970s. Today, despite the many advances in imaging instrumentation, radiopharmaceuticals, and methodology over these years, cholescintigraphy still plays an important role in confirming or excluding these diagnoses in acutely ill patients. Acute calculous and acalculous cholecystitis, gallbladder perforation, biliary obstruction, and biliary leakage often present as acute abdominal pain and must be differentiated from other surgical and nonsurgical etiologies with similar symptoms and presentation. Understanding the pathophysiology of acute hepatobiliary diseases is vital for deciding on the most advantageous imaging work-up and for interpretation of the studies. To optimize the value of cholescintigraphy, up-to-date methodology, proper use of appropriate pharmacologic interventions, and recognition of characteristic image findings are critical.

### Management of acute cholecystitis [^111wR4qs]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Various aspects of the management of acute calculous cholecystitis, including the type and timing of surgery, role of antibiotics, and nonoperative management, remain controversial. This review focuses on recently published studies addressing the timing of cholecystectomy, use of cholecystostomy tubes, and role of antibiotics in this condition.

In most cases, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis can be initially confirmed with an abdominal ultrasound. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 24–72 hours of symptom onset) is better than delayed surgery (> 7 days) for most patients with grade I and II diseases. Percutaneous cholecystostomy and novel endoscopic gallbladder drainage interventions may be used as either a temporizing measure or a definitive therapy for those who are too sick to undergo surgery. Studies are conflicting as to whether antibiotics are required for the treatment of uncomplicated cases.

Cholecystectomy remains the only definitive therapy for acute cholecystitis. Guidelines recommend treatment on the basis of disease severity at presentation. Antibiotics and a variety of minimally invasive nonsurgical interventions, although not definitive, play an adjunctive role in the management of the disease.

### Test characteristics of emergency medicine-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113t6CC8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute cholecystitis accounts for up to 9% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain, and best practice entails early surgical management. Ultrasound is the standard modality used to confirm diagnosis. Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of emergency physician-performed point-of-care ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, compared with a reference standard of final diagnosis informed by available surgical pathology, discharge diagnosis, and radiology-performed ultrasound.

We completed a systematic review and meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO, in adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched seven databases as well as gray literature in the form of select conference abstracts from inception to February 8, 2023.

Two independent reviewers completed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias (QUADAS-2) assessment. Disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. Data were extracted from eligible studies to create 2 × 2 tables for diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis, and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic models were constructed.

Out of 1,855 titles and abstracts, 40 were selected for full-text review. Ten studies (n = 2,356) were included.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^115MUCQT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The WSES 2020 on ACC, based on the updated evidence, reinforces the pivotal role of ELC in the management of ACC, even in high-risk patients. The newly developed algorithm emphasizes the importance of two categories of patients: high-risk patients and those who are not suitable for surgery.

The CHOCOLATE Study defined high-risk patients as those with an APACHE score of 7–14; this high-quality study improved our understanding of managing this complex cohort of patients. Its results favor surgery when compared with biliary drainage in high-risk patients with ACC. However, there is not a single, universally accepted definition of this high-risk patient group. Therefore, accepting the suggestion from Loozen et al, it appears reasonable to recommend the development of local clinical pathways after deciding which of the available scores fits local needs and expertise.

In addition to the defined high-risk patients, the WSES proposes the category of patients who are not suitable for surgery. This group should include all ACC patients not fit for surgery, according to the specific surgeon's judgment, and patients who are not amenable to surgical treatment due to clinical conditions not classifiable with clinical or physiologic scores (Appendix 2). For this cohort of patients, surgery may be unsafe or impossible, and gallbladder drainage may be the best suitable option in case of uncontrolled sepsis and/or failure of NOM.

### Acute cholecystitis [^11656bvQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Of people admitted to hospital for biliary tract disease, 20% have acute cholecystitis. Up to the age of 50 years, acute calculous cholecystitis is three times more common in women than in men and about 1.5 times more common in women thereafter. About 95% of people with acute cholecystitis have gallstones. Optimal therapy for acute cholecystitis, based on timing and severity of presentation, remains controversial.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute cholecystitis? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: early cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy, observation alone, and open cholecystectomy.

- **ALT, AST, and GGT**: Blood tests to evaluate liver function and potential bile duct obstructions.
- **Bilirubin and ALP**: Measured to assess liver function and detect any blockages in the bile duct.
- **Abdominal ultrasound**: To visualize the gallbladder and bile ducts for any stones or blockages.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with acute cholecystitis [^114BcThD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Gallstones are present in about 10% to 15% of the adult western population. Between 1% and 4% of these adults become symptomatic in a year, with the majority experiencing biliary colic, although a significant proportion suffer from acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis is mainly performed after the acute episode resolves due to concerns about higher morbidity and the potential need for conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. However, delaying surgery exposes patients to gallstone-related complications.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this systematic review was to compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within seven days of clinical presentation with acute cholecystitis) versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (more than six weeks after index admission with acute cholecystitis) in terms of benefits and harms.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until July 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized clinical trials comparing early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in participants with acute cholecystitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

- **Main results**: We identified seven trials that met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, six trials provided data for the analysis.

### Comparing percutaneous treatment and cholecystectomy outcomes in acute cholecystitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113k2xBP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The strength of our work lies in its comprehensive and up-to-date evaluation of existing studies comparing clinical outcomes of critically ill patients with acute cholecystitis treated with percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) versus cholecystectomy (CC), as well as PC followed by CC. A key novelty of our study is the direct comparison between PC followed by CC and CC alone, which provides unique insights into the added benefits of this sequential approach. Additionally, our work is particularly valuable as it also includes a direct comparison between PC and CC within the same study, offering a more complete perspective on the effectiveness, safety, and long-term outcomes of these treatment strategies.

This study, however, presents several limitations that must be acknowledged when interpreting the results. First, the relatively small number of included studies and patients, particularly in certain subgroups, limits the generalizability of our findings and highlights the need for larger, multicenter studies to develop standardized protocols. Additionally, significant heterogeneity was observed across the studies, stemming from variations in patient selection criteria, definitions of critically ill patients, surgical techniques (both for CC and PC), and differences in postoperative management protocols. Although statistical methods were applied to account for this variability, clinical heterogeneity — driven by factors such as disease severity, comorbidity profiles, surgical expertise, and institutional practices — remains a critical element influencing outcomes. Notably, while comorbidity rates appeared similar between groups in our meta-analysis, the incomplete nature of the original data warrants cautious interpretation.

### Index admission cholecystectomy for biliary colic precludes the risk of readmissions with biliary complications and should be standard treatment [^113dUdNY]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Index admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) reduces the risk of further biliary attacks of biliary colic (BC). Nevertheless, patients admitted with BC are frequently discharged with a plan for an elective LC, which subjects them to the risk of subsequent biliary complications (e.g. cholecystitis, pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis) while waiting for elective LC. They also face the risk of further intervention (e.g. ERCP), longer length of stay (LOS), and other peri-operative adverse outcomes. Although the outcomes of index admission versus elective LC for biliary pathology have been compared, the literature mainly focuses on the optimal timing of cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. The risks and consequences of readmission before elective LC in patients admitted with BC have not yet been investigated.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the risk of readmission and biliary complications in patients who have been admitted with BC but then scheduled for elective LC. The secondary aim was to compare rates of peri-operative morbidity between the index admission, elective, and readmission LC cohorts.

### 2017 WSES and SICG guidelines on acute calcolous cholecystitis in elderly population [^1145pfY5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Associated biliary tree stones: when to suspect, how to investigate when there is a high index of suspicion, when to treat, and which treatment**: Common bile duct stones occur in about 5–10% of patients with ACC. The strategy of non-selective preoperative endoscopic ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, or the routine use of intraoperative cholangiography may not be appropriate options to manage these patients.

Extensive research for specific suggestions for associated biliary tree stones in cases of ACC in elderly patients has been conducted. There is no evidence for any difference in the likelihood or diagnostic accuracy of different investigations in elderly patients compared to the general population, to warrant a change in the recommendations for elderly patients.

- **Statement 5.1**: Even in elderly patients, elevation of liver biochemical enzymes and/or bilirubin levels is not sufficient to identify ACC patients with choledocholithiasis, and further diagnostic tests are needed (LoE 3 GoR C). As reported in the 2016 WSES guidelines for ACC, normal liver biochemical tests have a negative predictive value of 97%, whereas the positive predictive value of any abnormal liver biochemical test result is only 15%. The positive predictive value of liver function studies is a poor tool for predicting common bile duct stones, even in non-ACC cases, with results ranging from 25 to 50%.

The routine use of biochemical tests should be applied with caution in the suspicion of common bile duct stones, considering the aforementioned limitations.

- **Statement 5.2**: Even in elderly patients, the vis…

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116yRz7a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons combined the published validated clinical scores and proposed a risk stratification of CBDS in three different classes, defined as follows: low risk (50%) of CBDS. This proposed classification has clear clinical implications: patients with a low risk of CBDS should be operated on without further investigation; patients with moderate risk should be evaluated with a second-level examination, either preoperatively with endoscopic US (EUS) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or intraoperatively with laparoscopic US (LUS) or IOC, in order to select patients who need stone removal. Finally, according to local expertise, laparoscopic transcystic CBD exploration is a valuable option. Patients with high risk of CBDS should undergo preoperative diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP.

- **Table 2**: Risk factors and classification of risk for CBDS (modified from Maple et al. 2010).

- **What is the best tool to stratify the risk for CBDS in patients with ACC?** We suggest stratifying the risk of CBDS according to the proposed classification modified from the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeon Guidelines. Quality of Evidence: very low; Strength of Recommendation: weak.

The ASGE guidelines remain a valuable tool for the diagnosis and the management of CBDS in patients with ACC. According to their classification, high risk of complications necessitates careful management.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^116xi3ue]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

What is the role of microbiological cultures and sensitivities in patients with ACC? In patients with complicated ACC and those at high risk for antimicrobial resistance, it is recommended to adapt the targeted antibiotic regimen based on microbiological analysis results to ensure adequate antimicrobial coverage. The quality of evidence (QoE) is moderate, and the strength of recommendation (SoR) is weak.

Identifying the causative organism(s) is essential in managing ACC, especially for patients at high risk of antimicrobial resistance, such as immunocompromised individuals and those with healthcare-associated infections. The rate of positive bile cultures, from either gallbladder or bile samples from the common bile duct, ranges from 29% to 54% in cases of ACC. No additional studies have been found on this topic since the publication of the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC.

### Is there a difference in textbook outcomes of emergency cholecystectomy in older patients compared with younger patients [^114UPotY]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is the first presentation in approximately 15% of patients with gallstone disease and accounts for 7% of emergency abdominal pain consultations. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) represents the gold standard option in the management of acute cholecystitis if there is no cause to contraindicate it. Despite some remaining as a high-risk population, a significant proportion of elderly patients diagnosed with AC are being managed with LC.

Textbook outcome (TO) is a composite measure of the quality of surgical care. Its definition as a concept is achieving an uneventful course for a patient undergoing surgery. Initially defined as a 'textbook outcome' in colorectal surgery, the concept was subsequently carried over to and popularized in the field of esophagogastric surgery. Currently, it is increasingly used in various fields of surgical literature, although it should be stated that, in general, the use of this concept in benign diseases and emergency surgery remains limited. The highly variable presentations of emergency patients, comorbidities, and diverse types of interventions render establishing textbook outcomes challenging in this patient group. Physiological instability in these patients makes them particularly unwell and more likely to have poorer outcomes, which are expressed as additional adverse factors for emergency cohorts. Despite these challenging situations, emergency patient group-specific scenarios, such as "emergency laparotomy" and "trauma laparotomy", have been suggested as a basis to overcome these challenges.

### Is hyperkinetic gallbladder an indication for cholecystectomy [^11642tpT]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Low credibility.

The technetium-99m labelled hepato imino diacetic acid (HIDA) scan is widely used to evaluate patients with biliary colic who have a normal trans-abdominal ultrasound scan. Most studies recommend cholecystectomy for patients with biliary dyskinesia, defined by a gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) of less than 35–40% on a HIDA scan. However, there are no recommendations regarding the management of a hyperkinetic gallbladder, defined by a GBEF of greater than 80% on the HIDA scan. The aim of our study was to evaluate the outcomes following cholecystectomy on patients with biliary colic associated with a hyperkinetic gallbladder.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with biliary colic associated with a hyperkinetic gallbladder who underwent cholecystectomy in our practice from July 2014 to February 2018. Data collection included age, gender, body mass index, preoperative symptoms, comorbidities, additional tests, ejection fraction, surgery, and histopathology of the gallbladder. Symptomatic improvement was assessed during a routine 2-week postoperative visit and a follow-up phone interview.

- **Results**: Thirty-two patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the study period for symptomatic hyperkinetic gallbladder. All patients experienced abdominal pain related to food intake, and 17 (53%) patients had worsening of symptoms with cholecystokinin (CCK) infusion. The average GBEF was 92%. Chronic cholecystitis was observed in 29 (90%) patients on pathology. Twenty-three (74%) patients had complete resolution of biliary symptoms, 5 (16%) experienced improved symptoms, and 3 (10%) had no change in symptoms.

### What happens to biliary colic patients in New York State? 10-year follow-up from emergency department visits [^1141rZQU]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Biliary colic is a common diagnosis for patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The purpose of this study is to examine the outcomes of patients coming to the ED with biliary colic.

- **Methods**: The NYS longitudinal SPARCS database was used to identify patients presenting to the ED with biliary colic from 2005 to 2014. Through the use of a unique identifier, patients were followed in NYS across multiple institutions. Patients who were lost to follow-up, had duplicated records, and those that underwent percutaneous cholecystectomy tubes were excluded from the analysis.

- **Results**: Between 2005 and 2014, there were 72,376 patients who presented to an ED with biliary colic. The admission rate was 20.7–26.02%. Overall, most patients who presented to the ED did not undergo surgery (39,567; 54.7%), of which 35,204 (89%) had only one ED visit, while 4,363 (11%) returned to the ED for multiple visits (≥ 2 visits). Only 3.23–5.51% of patients underwent cholecystectomy at the time of initial presentation. Most subsequent cholecystectomies were performed electively (27.38–52.51%). The average time to surgery among patients who had an elective cholecystectomy was 178.4 days. Of the patients who underwent cholecystectomy, 10.35% had cholecystectomy at their first ED visit, 77.7% had cholecystectomy following the first ED visit, and 12% had multiple ED visits prior to surgery. Among patients who were discharged from the ED, 32% had their surgery at a different hospital than the index presentation.

A significant portion of patients (48.6%) who present to the ED with biliary colic are impacted over the long term.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^112RxuPA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

One flaw of the study is that the index diagnosis depends, to some extent, on the reference standard. Given the retrospective design of the study, it should be considered that the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis (CBDS) is assessed with endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP), which is mainly prompted by the presence of elevated liver function tests (LFTs); this may represent a source of bias. No systematic intra-operative cholangiography (IOC) was performed.

Are elevated LFTs or bilirubin sufficient for the diagnosis of CBDS in patients with acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC)?

- **Recommendation against the use of elevated LFTs or bilirubin**: We recommend against using elevated LFTs or bilirubin as the only method to identify CBDS in patients with ACC, in which case we recommend performing further diagnostic tests. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Historically, LFTs have played a major role in determining the presence of CBDS. However, the majority of published studies did not consider patients with ACC and included asymptomatic gallstones. Normal LFTs have a negative predictive value (NPV) of 97%, whereas the positive predictive value (PPV) of any abnormal LFTs is only 15%. The elevation of LFTs is a poor tool for the prediction of CBDS, even in patients without ACC, with literature figures ranging from 25 to 50%. In patients with ACC, LFTs may be altered due to the acute inflammatory process of the gallbladder and the biliary tree, rather than direct biliary obstruction. A proportion ranging between 15 and 50% of patients with ACC show elevation in LFTs without CBDS. Song et al. demonstrated that 424 out of 1178 patients with ACC had increased LFTs, namely ALT and aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than twice reference levels. Of these, only 246 (58%) had further evidence of CBDS.

### Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs for biliary colic [^1177RydH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Cholelithiasis refers to the presence of gallstones, which are concretions that form in the biliary tract, usually in the gallbladder. It is one of the most common surgical problems worldwide and is particularly prevalent in most Western countries. Biliary colic is the term used for gallbladder pain experienced by a person with gallstones and without overt infection around the gallbladder. It is the most common manifestation of cholelithiasis, observed in over one-third of people with gallstones over the course of 10 or more years. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been widely used to relieve biliary colic pain, but their role needs further elucidation. They may decrease the frequency of short-term complications, such as a mild form of acute cholecystitis, jaundice, cholangitis, and acute pancreatitis. However, they may also increase the occurrence of more severe and possibly life-threatening adverse events such as gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function impairment, cardiovascular events, or milder events such as abdominal pain, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, or cutaneous manifestations.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of NSAIDs in people with biliary colic.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP), Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and ClinicalTrials.gov until July 2016. We applied no language limitation.

### A proposal for a preoperative clinical scoring system for acute cholecystitis [^114eLrrN]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2016). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is a common diagnosis for which surgery is usually indicated. However, the heterogeneity of clinical presentation makes it difficult to standardize management. The variation in clinical presentation is influenced by both patient-dependent and disease-specific factors. A preoperative clinical scoring system designed to include patient-dependent and clinical factors might be a useful tool in clinical decision-making.

- **Methods**: The data of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in a university hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patient-dependent factors (age, sex, body mass index, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score) and disease-specific factors (history of biliary colics, white blood count, C-reactive protein, and gallbladder wall thickness) were used to compute a clinical score between zero and nine for each patient. Cholecystitis was classified as mild (score ≤ 3), moderate (4 ≤ score ≤ 6), or severe (score ≥ 7).

- **Results**: Cholecystitis was mild in 45 cases, moderate in 105 cases, and severe in 27 cases. Among patient-dependent factors, the male gender, age > 65 years, and American Society of Anesthesiologists score > 2 correlated significantly with high scores, P = 0.001. Equally, high white blood count, elevated C-reactive protein, and gallbladder wall thickness > 4 mm correlated significantly with high scores, P = 0.001. These findings were confirmed on multivariate analyses. High scores correlated significantly with the duration of surgery (P = 0.007) and the need for intensive care unit management.

### Percutaneous cholecystostomy: The radiologist's role in treating acute cholecystitis [^116UzkoP]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is a common condition, with laparoscopic cholecystectomy considered the gold standard for surgical management. However, surgical options are often unfavorable in patients who are very unwell or have numerous medical co-morbidities, where the mortality rates are significant. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) is an image-guided intervention used to decompress the gallbladder, reducing patients' symptoms and the systemic inflammatory response. PC has been shown to be beneficial in high-risk patient groups, predominantly as a bridging therapy. It allows for safer elective cholecystectomy once the patient has recovered from the acute illness or, in a minority of cases, serves as a definitive treatment in patients deemed unfit for surgery. This review aims to develop a broader understanding of PC, discussing its specific indications, patient management, technical factors, imaging guidance, and outcomes following the procedure.

### Index admission cholecystectomy for biliary colic precludes the risk of readmissions with biliary complications and should be standard treatment [^114pKyKt]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The principal studies comparing index admission and elective cholecystectomy in patients admitted with biliary pathology do not acknowledge readmission morbidity before the operation and its impact on overall outcome. This study demonstrates that the morbidity associated with readmission in patients with biliary colic is more severe than the difference in morbidity between index and elective cholecystectomy and cannot be disregarded. The same finding may be true for other biliary pathology, such as cholecystitis, and must be considered in future analyses.

Interestingly, this study suggests that younger and less comorbid patients are more likely to undergo index admission cholecystectomy. It could be postulated that on-call surgeons prefer to operate on fitter, healthier patients as they perceive such individuals as more straightforward. However, this approach may be counter-intuitive as it exposes more vulnerable patients to the risk of readmission, biliary complications, longer length of stay, and associated peri-operative morbidity. Prioritization of index admission cholecystectomy in older, more comorbid patients could help mitigate this risk and reduce overall morbidity. Clearly, this argument does not hold in the small cohort taking anticoagulant medications or in need of medical optimization prior to surgery.

In summary, there is considerable demand for index admission cholecystectomy. Resource issues will often mean that not every patient with gallstone disease can be operated on during their initial presentation.

### Index admission cholecystectomy for biliary colic precludes the risk of readmissions with biliary complications and should be standard treatment [^112HaKx3]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Hence, the biliary colic (BC) patient may be an ideal surgical candidate that should be prioritized for index admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), as by definition there is no gallbladder inflammation and the suspicion of ductal stones is low. This approach can be considered a low-risk strategy that reduces overall morbidity as well as the rate of biliary readmissions. Emergency biliary presentations consume a huge amount of resources, and biliary readmissions are an unfortunate and illogical consequence of busy healthcare systems. Whilst the results of this study cannot be regarded as conclusive evidence that BC patients should be prioritized over other sub-groups, it must be worthy of consideration. Further work is required to determine exactly which sub-groups of patients benefit most from index admissions with LC, as they should be prioritized by an on-call team.

Whilst index admission LC is the gold standard mode of treatment for BC, it is clear that not all of these patients will receive index admission LC. The present study only includes patients who ultimately proceeded to LC; thus, it may overestimate the readmission and complication rate whilst awaiting LC. From our experience, the vast majority of those admitted with biliary colic proceed to LC, and this is not anticipated to significantly influence the results. Regardless of the rate of readmission, the additional risk associated with LC following readmission is demonstrated, and index admission LC is the safest option. Indeed, these patients should be managed differently from those patients who have simply been referred to a surgical clinic, with expedited surgery.

- **Associated common bile duct stones: which tools to use for suspicion and diagnosis at presentation**: Choledocholithiasis, i.e. the presence of common bile duct stones (CBDS), is reported to occur in 10% to 20% of gallstone cases, with a lower incidence, ranging from 5% to 15%, in cases of acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC). Investigations for CBDS require time and may delay surgical treatment. Due to the relatively low incidence of CBDS during ACC, the main issue is to select patients with a high likelihood of CBDS who would benefit from further diagnostic tests and removal of CBDS. An uncommon condition that mimics CBDS is Mirizzi syndrome, which occurs in less than 1% of patients with gallstones. Preoperative investigations may help in the diagnosis, although the vast majority of cases are identified at surgery.

The only new study on this topic was a cross-sectional study on the role of liver function tests (LFTs). The authors evaluated the role of LFTs and the role of early follow-up in the diagnosis of CBDS in ACC. The most reliable LFT was gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), with a sensitivity of 80.6% and a specificity of 75.3%, using a cut-off level of 224 IU/L. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 50%, while negative predictive value (NPV) was 91.4%. The results also showed a significant decrease of LFTs within the non-CBD groups at a 4-day follow-up, which was not evident in the ACC + CBDS group — with the exception of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Moreover, in the CBDS group, all LFTs values improved significantly after the removal of the CBDS at a mean follow-up time of 4.3 days.

### 2016 WSES guidelines on acute calculous cholecystitis [^114jxnHw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

There is no single clinical or laboratory finding with sufficient diagnostic accuracy to establish or exclude acute cholecystitis (LoE 2 GoR B). A combination of detailed history, complete clinical examination, and laboratory tests may strongly support the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC) (LoE 4 GoR C).

A systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the role of different clinical signs and bedside tests in the diagnosis of ACC included 17 studies, in which quantitative assessment of diagnostic values of clinical tests were reported. Twelve variables related to history and clinical examination, five variables related to basic laboratory tests, and one variable, which was a combination of a clinical sign and a laboratory test, were tested in a cohort of patients with abdominal pain or suspected acute cholecystitis. Results showed that with the exception of Murphy's sign, none of the summary positive likelihood ratios (LR) of the clinical tests was higher than 1.6, and none of the summary negative LRs was less than 0.4. Murphy's sign had a positive LR of 2.8 (CI 95% 0.8 to 8.6) and a negative LR of 0.5 (CI 95% 0.2 to 1), but the 95% CI included the value 1.

Although the study was classified as high quality according to the Oxford classification, it presents some limitations. The study did not report the proportion of patients with abdominal pain and the proportion of patients with suspected acute cholecystitis. Although LR is robust in assessing prevalence, the inclusion of patients with abdominal pain together with patients suspected of having acute cholecystitis may be a source of bias.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cholangitis, more specifically with respect to laboratory tests (CBC and serum biochemistry), EASL 2016 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests as part of the initial evaluation of patients with fever, chills, abdominal pain, and/or jaundice:

- **WBCs**: White blood cell count should be checked as an indication of infection or inflammation.
- **CRP**: C-reactive protein levels provide additional information regarding the presence of inflammatory processes.
- **Liver biochemical tests**: These tests evaluate liver function and can indicate biliary obstruction or liver disease.

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^113W2p3P]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The management of acute calculous cholecystitis remains a topic open to debate, particularly concerning diagnosis, severity scores, treatment options, and timing for surgery.

- **Material and methods**: A systematic review on the treatment of acute cholecystitis has been conducted. The recommendations of recent guidelines have been examined, considering the review results.

- **Results**: Available literature supports the recommendation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis. Surgery should be performed as soon as possible following diagnosis, as early treatment reduces total hospital stay without increasing complication or conversion rates. Antibiotics can play various roles, and attention should be given to the risk of emerging resistance. While some authors advocate for surgical or percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder in advanced cases of inflammation or in patients with severe co-morbidities, the available evidence does not support these approaches, indicating a need for further studies to clarify their role.

### Index admission cholecystectomy for biliary colic precludes the risk of readmissions with biliary complications and should be standard treatment [^114Af77b]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Emergency biliary colic admissions can be managed with an index or elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Opting to perform an elective LC may have significant repercussions, such as the risk of readmissions before the operation with further attacks or with biliary complications (e.g. cholecystitis, pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis). The risk of readmission and biliary complications in patients admitted with biliary colic but scheduled for elective surgery has never been investigated. The secondary aim was to compare rates of peri-operative morbidity between the index admission, elective, and readmission LC cohorts.

All patients admitted with a diagnosis of biliary colic over a 5-year period and proceeding to LC were included in the study (n = 441). The risk of being readmitted and suffering further morbidity whilst awaiting elective LC was investigated. Peri-operative morbidity was compared between the index admission, elective, and readmitted LC groups using univariate and multivariate analysis.

Following a biliary colic admission, the risk of readmission whilst awaiting elective LC is significant (2 months-25%; 10 months-48%). In this group, the risks of subsequent biliary complications (18.0%) and the requirement for ERCP (6.5%) were significant. Patients who are readmitted before LC suffer a more complicated peri-operative course, including a longer total length of stay, higher post-operative complications, imaging, and readmission.

Index admission LC for biliary colic avoids the significant risk of readmission and biliary complications.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111wc8A3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Overall, it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC), when performed within 7 days of hospital admission and within 10 days of onset of symptoms, is superior to either intermediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ILC), which is performed between 7 days of hospital admission and 6 weeks, or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC), done between 6 weeks and 3 months after the initial hospital admission for acute cholecystitis.

Since blinding cannot be achieved in these comparisons and the outcomes were subjective, all the trials were deemed to be at high risk of bias. However, trials with low risk of bias are difficult to conduct in this comparison. Since the evidence was consistent across trials and outcomes, it appears highly likely that ELC is superior to either ILC or DLC. Therefore, despite the moderate-quality evidence (mainly due to the lack of blinding in the trials), the recommendation for ELC is strong.

However, it should be noted that the study authors described ELC as more complex; therefore, it should be attempted only by experienced surgeons. Referral to centers with high surgical expertise should be considered if adequate surgical expertise is not available. If ELC cannot be performed, DLC appears to be better than ILC. Although there is no evidence of a difference between DLC and ILC, the ACDC trial comparing ELC versus ILC showed that a significant proportion of patients undergoing ILC developed serious adverse events. Therefore, DLC may be preferable when ELC is not possible, although a proportion of patients with a planned DLC approach may need unplanned earlier surgery. There are no trials comparing ILC and DLC, and it is unlikely that they will be performed.

### Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy: Recurrent biliary admissions predispose to difficult cholecystectomy [^116Ud1d9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is performed on patients with a variety of biliary pathologies, the majority of which include biliary colic, cholecystitis, and choledocholithiasis/pancreatitis. Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELLC) is performed in symptomatic patients who have not required hospital admission or in cases where a biliary issue has been managed non-operatively during one or more emergency hospital admissions.

When assessing a patient's suitability for ELLC, it is important that surgeons have knowledge of risk factors associated with adverse peri-operative outcomes, such as intra-operative and post-operative complications, prolonged post-operative stays, and re-admission. This will help guide the decision to operate and form part of the informed consent process.

Patients undergoing cholecystectomy represent a heterogeneous group, making it more challenging to stratify risk. Previous studies have identified factors associated with technically challenging surgery, including the presence of acute cholecystitis, thickened gallbladder wall, comorbidities, and age greater than 65 years. Other studies have determined variables associated with post-operative complications following emergency LC.

A historic review of cholecystectomy data has often concentrated on rates of ductal injury. However, more contemporary analysis has placed greater emphasis on the generic complications experienced by patients undergoing biliary surgery, and it has been demonstrated that low-grade morbidity is a relatively common occurrence following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

### Tokyo guidelines 2018: Diagnostic criteria and severity grading of acute cholecystitis (with videos) [^111Dzo9D]. Journal of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Sciences (2018). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for acute cholecystitis" aids in the identification and classification of acute cholecystitis and gallstone disease. The primary purpose of these criteria is to guide clinicians in diagnosing acute cholecystitis, a common and potentially serious inflammation of the gallbladder, and to stratify patients based on the severity of their symptoms.

The diagnostic criteria consist of local signs of inflammation, systemic signs of inflammation, and imaging findings. Local signs of inflammation include Murphy's sign and right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness. Systemic signs of inflammation encompass fever, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated white blood cell count. Imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are also considered.

- **Definite acute cholecystitis**: Diagnosed if imaging findings characteristic of acute cholecystitis are present, along with either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation.
- **Suspected acute cholecystitis**: Diagnosed if either Murphy's sign or right upper quadrant mass, pain, or tenderness, and any one of the systemic signs of inflammation are present, but the characteristic imaging findings are not.

If these criteria are not met, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is not established. These diagnostic criteria provide a structured approach to the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, aiding clinicians in effective patient management.

### Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy: Recurrent biliary admissions predispose to difficult cholecystectomy [^11157uew]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Low credibility.

Causes for conversion to open (CTO) included adhesions in the cholecystohepatic triangle (14), cholecystoduodenal adhesions (3), hemorrhage (2), adhesions from previous surgery (2), gallbladder mass (2), bile duct injury (1), abnormal biliary anatomy (1), cholecystocolonic fistula (1), and cholecystoduodenal fistula (1). Rates of conversion to open were higher in those with cholecystitis and more admissions compared to those with biliary colic and no admissions (p < 0.05).

In the multivariate regression, factors associated with short-term complications (STC) and/or CTO included age ≥ 60 years (OR 2.09; p = 0.002), cholecystitis (OR 3.55; p < 0.001), pre-operative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (OR 2.55; p = 0.001), two previous admissions (OR 2.32; p = 0.007), and ≥ three previous admissions (OR 4.89; p < 0.001).

### Timing of cholecystectomy in acute cholecystitis [^1161QhNQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder that most commonly occurs as a result of obstruction of the cystic duct by gallstones. The standard treatment for acute cholecystitis is cholecystectomy.

- **Objective**: Our goal was to discuss the benefits of and compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of acute cholecystitis.

- **Materials and methods**: A Medline literature search was performed dating from January 1982 to July 2015. We limited the search to human studies written in English and used the keywords "Acute Cholecystitis", early vs. delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy, surgical management, and surgical complications.

- **Results**: There were 225 articles reviewed, of which 25 met criteria for selection. Our recommendations are based on these 25 articles.

- **Conclusion**: Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred over delayed, due to overall better quality of life, lower morbidity rates, and lower hospital cost. Ultimately, the management of acute cholecystitis by emergency physicians should be based on the patient's clinical status and available resources in their particular hospital.

### Does this patient have acute cholecystitis [^111pmgwj]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

Although few patients with acute abdominal pain will prove to have cholecystitis, ruling in or ruling out acute cholecystitis consumes substantial diagnostic resources.

- **Objective**: To determine if aspects of the history and physical examination or basic laboratory testing clearly identify patients who require diagnostic imaging tests to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

- **Data sources**: Electronic search of the Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, and English-language articles from January 1966 through November 2000 indexed in MEDLINE. We also hand-searched Index Medicus for 1950–1965, and scanned references in identified articles and bibliographies of prominent textbooks of physical examination, surgery, and gastroenterology. To identify relevant articles appearing since the comprehensive search, we repeated the MEDLINE search in July 2002.

- **Study selection**: Included studies evaluated the role of the history, physical examination, and/or laboratory tests in adults with abdominal pain or suspected acute cholecystitis. Studies had to report data from a control group found not to have acute cholecystitis. Acceptable definitions of cholecystitis included surgery, pathologic examination, hepatic iminodiacetic acid scan or right upper quadrant ultrasound, or clinical course consistent with acute cholecystitis and no evidence for an alternate diagnosis. Studies of acalculous cholecystitis were included. Seventeen of 195 identified studies met the inclusion criteria.

- **Data extraction**: Two authors independently abstracted data from the 17 included studies.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^115N5s7N]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). High credibility.

This variation in criteria for surgery was one of the reasons for initiating the SECURE trial, which tested one set of symptom criteria. The study randomized patients with gallstones and abdominal pain between usual care (diagnostics and treatment based on hospital standard care) and a restrictive strategy. In the restrictive arm of the study, cholecystectomy was advised only for patients who had all five prespecified symptoms based on the Rome III criteria and on predictors identified during a previous clinical study: severe pain in attacks, pain in the upper right quadrant or epigastrium, pain lasting 15–30 minutes or longer, pain radiating to the back, and a positive response to simple analgesics. The primary aim of the SECURE trial was to assess the percentage of patients who were pain-free after 1 year of follow-up.

The trial demonstrated a 7 percent higher cholecystectomy rate in the usual-care arm (75 percent of 537 patients) compared with the restrictive arm (68 percent of 530 patients) (P = 0.005). Despite more cholecystectomies, the usual-care strategy resulted in more patients being pain-free after 12 months of follow-up (60 percent versus 56 percent, respectively; P = 0.316). Rates of gallstone-related complications were similar in the two groups: 8 percent in the usual-care and 7 percent in the restrictive arm (P = 0.155). The SECURE trial also illustrated the limited validity of Rome III criteria regarding the indication for cholecystectomy in patients with cholecystolithiasis.
