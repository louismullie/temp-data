## Question

Lymph node finding on thyroid ultrasound

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage suspicious cervical lymph nodes found on thyroid ultrasound. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why lymph node assessment matters. Then, I should verify which sonographic features are most predictive of metastasis and how to weigh sensitivity versus specificity. Next, I will review guideline-based thresholds for biopsy and the role of thyroglobulin washout. After that, I should consider how results change surgical planning and perioperative imaging. Finally, I will address surveillance, special populations, and documentation/reporting standards, making sure I double-check areas where interobserver variability and evolving evidence might alter practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why lymph node ultrasound is indispensable in thyroid care. Cervical lymph node metastasis occurs in roughly 30–50% of differentiated thyroid cancer cases, and ultrasound is the first-line modality to map disease preoperatively and during surveillance, directly influencing surgical extent and recurrence risk stratification, so I need to ensure every thyroid ultrasound includes a systematic survey of central and lateral compartments when cancer is suspected or confirmed [^117SAXba] [^112G23bH] [^113UWJxo].

> Wait, let me verify the sonographic features that truly raise suspicion for metastasis, because no single sign is sufficient. The most consistently worrisome features include loss of the fatty hilum, round shape (short-axis to long-axis ratio approaching 1), cystic change, microcalcifications, peripheral vascularity, hyperechogenicity, and architectural distortion. Importantly, combining multiple features markedly improves specificity and positive predictive value, whereas loss of hilum alone trades high sensitivity for poor specificity, so I should avoid overcalling isolated hilum loss as malignant [^112ytTu9] [^112wzCgR] [^114Vdny4].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic performance trade-offs so I don't overstate any one feature. Cystic change and microcalcifications carry high specificity but low sensitivity, while loss of hilum is sensitive but nonspecific; a recent analysis showed that a composite of four features (enlargement, architectural distortion, loss of hilum, and microcalcifications) achieved 97% specificity and 88% PPV, which is far superior to any single feature, reinforcing the need to integrate patterns rather than rely on a single sign [^112ytTu9] [^114cVY3q].

> I need to check the size threshold for action, because size alone is misleading. Initially, I thought any node larger than 1 cm in short axis should prompt biopsy; wait, that's too simplistic and risks overtreatment. The ATA recommends ultrasound-guided FNA for sonographically suspicious nodes that are at least 8–10 mm in the shortest dimension if results would change management, while smaller suspicious nodes can often be observed unless they grow or threaten critical structures, so I should correct my earlier inclination and apply the 8–10 mm threshold in context [^117UYRb6] [^117FfBhS].

> Next, I should review how to confirm metastatic disease beyond cytology. Let me consider thyroglobulin washout from FNA, which is particularly helpful when cytology is indeterminate or when an intact thyroid gland complicates interpretation. A Tg level above about 10 ng/mL in the aspirate is highly suspicious, whereas levels below 1 ng/mL are reassuring, though I should double-check that results are interpreted alongside serum Tg and antibodies and the clinical context to avoid false positives or negatives [^116tMq3v] [^117UYRb6].

> I will now examine how ultrasound findings alter surgical planning, because that is where clinical impact is greatest. Preoperative mapping of central and lateral compartments changes operative strategy in roughly 20–40% of cases, enabling compartment-oriented dissections rather than blind sampling; if suspicious lateral nodes are identified, a comprehensive lateral neck dissection of levels IIa, III, IV, and Vb is recommended when disease is confirmed, while central nodes can often be assessed intraoperatively if total thyroidectomy is already planned, so I should coordinate imaging with the surgical team early [^113UWJxo] [^114ENtEi] [^114QgEue].

> But wait, what if ultrasound is limited by depth or operator dependence in the central compartment. I should confirm when cross-sectional imaging adds value. Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI can improve detection of bulky, retropharyngeal, or mediastinal nodes and can assist in extensive lateral disease or when ultrasound expertise is limited, and meta-analytic data suggest CT may have higher sensitivity for central compartment disease while ultrasound retains higher specificity, so selective adjunct imaging is reasonable in advanced presentations [^115w8ZpU] [^113WG4ks] [^112wWuPQ].

> Let me think about surveillance after treatment, because detecting small nodes too early can drive false positives. Ultrasound is the preferred modality for postoperative surveillance at 6–12 months and periodically thereafter, with risk-adapted intensity; nodes under 8–10 mm with suspicious features can be observed unless they enlarge or threaten vital structures, and rising serum Tg or new structural findings should prompt targeted ultrasound and, if indicated, FNA with Tg washout to confirm recurrence before escalating therapy [^117FfBhS].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts so I don't overgeneralize. In pregnancy, ultrasound-guided FNA is appropriate for suspicious lateral nodes, and in pediatrics, complete neck ultrasound to evaluate all cervical levels is recommended given higher rates of nodal disease. In patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis, reactive nodes are common, so I need to be cautious and correlate with clinical evolution before labeling nodes malignant [^115P3vVr] [^112Me6Tr] [^114Vdny4].

> Next, I should review documentation and reporting standards to ensure clear communication. Reports should specify nodal compartment, number, dimensions in three planes, shape, margins, content, echogenicity, presence or absence of hilum, and vascular pattern, ideally using standardized terminology and image-based nodal classification to facilitate surgical planning and longitudinal follow-up; multidisciplinary consensus statements support this structured approach to reduce variability and improve care coordination [^114Vdny4] [^116rZLun] [^112U1JoX].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of emerging tools so I don't miss evolving practice. Elastography remains investigational for nodal assessment with heterogeneous techniques and limited validation, whereas multimodal deep learning approaches show promising accuracy for lateral nodal metastasis prediction but are not yet ready to replace expert sonographic judgment and FNA confirmation in routine care, so I should treat these as adjuncts rather than substitutes for now [^1169nxDE] [^111docMy].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, risk-stratified workflow: integrate multiple suspicious sonographic features rather than any single sign, apply the 8–10 mm shortest-axis threshold for FNA when results would change management, confirm with cytology and consider Tg washout, use ultrasound to guide compartment-oriented surgery, add CT/MRI selectively for bulky or deep disease, and surveil with risk-adapted ultrasound while avoiding overdiagnosis of subcentimeter nodes. If I catch myself drifting toward size-only triggers, I should pause and re-anchor to morphology and clinical context to avoid overtreatment [^117UYRb6] [^113UWJxo] [^117FfBhS].

On thyroid ultrasound, **suspicious lymph nodes** show loss of fatty hilum, round shape, hyperechogenicity, microcalcifications, cystic change, and peripheral vascularity [^112wzCgR] [^114cVY3q]. Nodes with these features, especially when ≥ 8–10 mm, **warrant ultrasound-guided FNA with Tg washout** to confirm metastasis and guide surgery [^117UYRb6] [^114ng7VQ]. Normal nodes are oval with a preserved fatty hilum and central vascularity; reactive nodes are common and can mimic disease, so **correlation with clinical context is essential** [^114Vdny4] [^114aMdMr].

---

## Sonographic features of cervical lymph nodes

Cervical lymph nodes are **assessed for size, shape, echogenicity, calcifications, cystic changes, vascularity, and hilum** [^114Vdny4]. These features help distinguish benign from malignant nodes [^111jgXBe].

| **Sonographic feature** | **Benign/reactive nodes** | **Suspicious/malignant nodes** |
|-|-|-|
| Shape | Oval | Round (short-axis ≥ 50% of long-axis) |
| Hilum | Preserved fatty hilum | Loss of fatty hilum |
| Echogenicity | Hypoechoic | Hyperechoic |
| Calcifications | Absent | Microcalcifications |
| Cystic changes | Absent | Present |
| Vascularity | Central hilar flow | Peripheral vascularity |
| Size | Variable; < 8–10 mm short-axis | ≥ 8–10 mm short-axis |

---

## Specific ultrasound findings suggestive of metastatic lymph nodes

Metastatic lymph nodes from thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), have **characteristic sonographic features**:

- **Loss of fatty hilum**: Highly sensitive (89%) but nonspecific (19%) [^112ytTu9].
- **Round shape**: Short-axis ≥ 50% of long-axis; more specific for malignancy [^112jEgdr].
- **Hyperechogenicity**: Reflects increased cellularity [^notfound].
- **Microcalcifications**: Highly specific (93–100%) for metastatic PTC [^114cVY3q].
- **Cystic change**: Highly specific (91–100%) for metastatic PTC [^114cVY3q].
- **Peripheral vascularity**: Suggests malignancy [^114cVY3q].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound in detecting metastatic lymph nodes

Ultrasound is the **preferred modality** for detecting metastatic cervical lymph nodes in thyroid cancer, with performance varying by compartment:

- **Lateral compartment**: High sensitivity (82%) and specificity (84%) [^113WG4ks].
- **Central compartment**: Lower sensitivity (30–63%) due to artifacts from the thyroid gland [^1143Z2RN] [^113WG4ks].
- **Overall accuracy**: Ultrasound detects suspicious nodes in 20–31% of cases and alters surgical management in ~20% [^112wzCgR] [^113UWJxo].

---

## Clinical significance of lymph node metastasis in thyroid cancer

Lymph node metastasis significantly affects **prognosis and management**:

- **Incidence**: Occurs in 20–50% of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) [^112wzCgR] [^117SAXba].
- **Prognostic impact**: Increases recurrence risk and affects survival [^116AuDBE].
- **Risk stratification**: Guides extent of surgery and need for radioactive iodine therapy [^113UWJxo].

---

## Management of suspicious lymph nodes identified on ultrasound

When suspicious lymph nodes are identified, **management follows evidence-based guidelines**:

- **Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA)**: Recommended for nodes ≥ 8–10 mm with suspicious features if results will change management [^117UYRb6] [^114ng7VQ].
- **Thyroglobulin (Tg) washout**: Performed with FNA to confirm metastatic disease [^116tMq3v].
- **Surgical management**: Compartment-oriented neck dissection based on nodal location and extent of disease [^114ZGUj8].

---

## Limitations and challenges of ultrasound in lymph node evaluation

Despite its utility, ultrasound has **limitations**:

- **Operator dependence**: Accuracy varies with operator experience [^116cVEYv].
- **Anatomical constraints**: Central compartment nodes are difficult to visualize [^113WG4ks].
- **False positives/negatives**: Reactive nodes can mimic malignancy; small metastases may be missed [^114Vdny4] [^112wzCgR].

---

## Role of additional imaging modalities

Additional imaging may be used when ultrasound is inconclusive or disease is extensive. CT/MRI are used for **bulky disease, deep nodes, or extrathyroidal extension** [^115w8ZpU], and PET/CT is reserved for recurrent or aggressive disease [^111jgXBe].

---

Ultrasound is the **primary tool** for evaluating cervical lymph nodes in thyroid cancer, with key malignant features including loss of hilum, round shape, hyperechogenicity, microcalcifications, cystic change, and peripheral vascularity [^112G23bH]. Suspicious nodes ≥ 8–10 mm should undergo FNA with Tg washout to confirm metastasis and guide surgery [^117UYRb6].

Sonography plays several important roles in the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer. Ultrasound (US) is used for the detection and characterization of thyroid nodules as well as a guidance modality for fine-needle aspiration biopsy of indeterminate or suspicious nodules. US is also used to help stage thyroid cancer by identifying cervical lymph nodes suspicious for metastasis so they can be biopsied prior to subsequent neck dissection. Post-thyroidectomy, routine surveillance of the neck is performed with US to identify local recurrence and/or nodal metastatic disease so that focused and limited repeat neck dissection or alcohol ablation can be accomplished.

### Advances in ultrasound for the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer [^116zgBm6]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Ultrasonography (US) is increasingly being employed by endocrinologists and surgeons in the diagnosis and management of patients with thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. Recent consensus guidelines from the American Thyroid Association highlight the importance of this modality by recommending that patients with thyroid nodules should undergo further evaluation with cervical US to stratify the risk of malignancy. Likewise, ultrasound is advocated for the preoperative and postoperative diagnosis of cervical lymph node metastases.

Summary

This article will summarize the US characteristics that impart a suspicious appearance on thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes as well as those findings that are reassuring. Likewise, the indications for thyroid nodule and lymph node fine-needle aspiration will be reviewed. Finally, this article will briefly discuss adjunctive tools in US such as elastography, percutaneous ethanol ablation, and radiofrequency ablation.

Conclusions

US may be used to help stratify the risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes. This tool further aids in the diagnosis of malignancy when used in conjunction with fine-needle aspiration. US plays an important role as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the evaluation of patients with neck masses.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — postoperative neck imaging surveillance after primary resection states that ultrasound to evaluate the thyroid bed and central and lateral cervical lymph node compartments is the preferred method of imaging surveillance for most DTC (Strong recommendation, Moderate certainty evidence). If the serum Tg level after surgery is above the excellent response range (see Table 9), and/or there are Tg Ab, cervical ultrasound and/or cross-sectional imaging should be performed prior to administering RAI (Good Practice Statement). Six to 12 months following completion of initial therapy, cervical ultrasound to evaluate the thyroid bed and central and lateral cervical lymph node compartments should be performed, with timing and frequency thereafter informed by the patient's risk for residual or recurrent disease and response to therapy (Good Practice Statement). Suspicious lymph nodes or lesions < 8–10 mm in shortest dimension may be followed without FNA unless they grow or threaten vital structures such as the recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, esophagus, or great vessels (Conditional recommendation, Low certainty evidence). If cytological diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic DTC would influence treatment decisions or change management, ultrasonographically suspicious lymph nodes or lesions ≥ 8–10 mm in the shortest dimension should be assessed with FNA for cytology and measurement of Tg in the needle washout fluid (Good Practice Statement).

### Ultrasonography for the prediction of high-volume lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid carcinoma: should surgeons believe ultrasound results? [^117Vebxx]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The failure of preoperative ultrasound to detect metastatic lesions may be common. However, these lymph node involvements that cannot be showed on ultrasound may be representative of fewer and smaller lesions and may not have a significant influence on treatment outcomes. In regions routinely performing prophylactic LND, the LNM rate of PTMC can reach 30–40%, but it has been reported to be only 3.2% in regions without routine prophylactic LND. However, the postoperative recurrence and reoperation rate of the two groups did not seem to have an obvious difference. The 2015 ATA guidelines emphasized the impact of the size and number of metastatic lesions on prognosis. The recurrence rate of patients with high-volume LNMs (> 5 metastatic lymph nodes) was 19%, which was significantly higher than the recurrence rate of 2–4% in cN0pN1 patients (< 5 metastatic lymph nodes). These patients with high-volume LNMs should be identified and provided treatment cautiously, as their treatment outcomes have a great impact on the prognosis of disease. Based on our results, when lymph node involvement was detected by ultrasound, the rate of postoperative high-volume LNMs was 47.8%; when lymph node involvement was not detected, the rate of postoperative high-volume LNMs was 5.3%. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the diagnosis were 63.8%, 90.3% and 87.0%, respectively. These findings indicate that lymph node involvement found by ultrasound has great value for predicting postoperative high-volume LNMs. Furthermore, when no lymph node involvement was detected by preoperative ultrasound, the negative predictive value for high-volume LNMs was 94.7%, which was much higher for PTMC (96.7%). The results suggest that the possibility of high-volume LNMs is very low for patients without lymph node involvement on preoperative ultrasound, and less aggressive treatment (active surveillance or treatment without prophylactic LND) may not bring poor outcomes for these patients.

### Value of CT added to ultrasonography for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in patients with thyroid cancer [^112wWuPQ]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The benefit of CT for the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in patients with thyroid cancer is still unclear.

Methods

Three hundred fifty-one patients with thyroid cancers from 7 hospitals were prospectively enrolled in order to compare diagnostic performance between a combination of ultrasound and CT (ultrasound/CT) and ultrasound alone for prediction of lymph node metastasis and to calculate patient-based benefits of CT added to ultrasound.

Results

Of 801 pathologically proven neck levels, ultrasound/CT showed higher sensitivities in both central and lateral compartments and improved accuracy in the lateral compartment compared to ultrasound alone. In the retropharyngeal/superior mediastinal compartment, although CT could detect lymph node metastasis an ultrasound could not. Patient-based benefit was demonstrated in 13.1% of patients (46/351), and was higher in patients with cancers > 1 cm than cancers ≤ 1 cm.

Conclusion

In patients with thyroid cancer, CT improved surgical planning by enhancing the sensitivity for lymph node metastasis and by detecting lymph node metastasis that was overlooked with ultrasound alone.

### Sonographic features of cervical lymph nodes after thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma [^114n3Nkz]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Unlike the preoperative findings in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, the postoperative sonographic features of cervical lymph nodes have not been established. This study aimed to assess the sonographic features of metastatic lymph nodes after thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Methods

The study population consisted of 104 consecutively registered patients who had undergone thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma and underwent sonographically guided fine-needle aspiration of lymph nodes in the neck. The sonographic features of each lymph node were retrospectively evaluated by a single radiologist. The confirmation methods for the 115 lymph nodes included surgery (n = 35), measurement of thyroglobulin levels in the aspirates (n = 2), malignant cytologic analysis (n = 10), and benign cytologic analysis with sonographic follow-up over 12 months (n = 68). We determined the diagnostic indices of individual sonographic features for differentiating between metastatic and benign lymph nodes by comparing these features with the final diagnoses.

Results

Of the 104 patients, 67 underwent at least 1 cycle of radioisotope therapy after thyroidectomy. The malignancy rate for the lymph nodes was 42.6% (49 of 115). A significant relationship was found between malignancy and the presence of an intranodal cystic component, intranodal microcalcifications, diffusely increased echogenicity, a microlobulated margin, a round shape, loss of echogenic hila, and mixed or central vascularity on color Doppler sonography (P < .05).

Conclusions

The sonographic features of metastatic cervical lymph nodes in postoperative patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma were similar to those in preoperative patients.

Thyroid nodules — suspicious lymph nodes on ultrasound — should have metastatic involvement confirmed with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) washout biomarkers, and advanced imaging may be considered in aggressive presentations. In the case of suspicious US features, confirm the metastatic nature of a lymph node with measurement of Tg or calcitonin in the washout of the FNA needle, and consider the use of MRI, CT, and/or 18FDG PET/CT in selected cases with aggressive features for a more accurate preoperative staging.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American college of endocrinology, and associazione medici endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules – 2016 update [^11387RoL]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasonography (US) criteria for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) — local invasion and lymph nodes: Extension beyond the capsule, invasion of prethyroid muscles, or infiltration of the trachea or recurrent laryngeal nerves are US findings of concern that demand immediate cytologic assessment. Enlarged lymph nodes with cystic changes, microcalcifications, or absence of hilus are highly suspicious, while rounded appearance and chaotic hypervascularity are common but less specific; suspicious lymph nodes and any coexistent thyroid nodule, whatever the size, always warrant FNA biopsy and Tg or calcitonin determination on FNA lymph node washout according to clinical suspicion.

### Don't routinely order a thyroid ultrasound in patients with abnormal… [^111MKgC7]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Thyroid ultrasound is used to identify and characterize thyroid nodules, and is not part of the routine evaluation of abnormal thyroid function tests unless the patient also has a large goiter or a lumpy thyroid. Incidentally discovered thyroid nodules are common. Overzealous use of ultrasound will frequently identify nodules, which are unrelated to the abnormal thyroid function, and may divert the clinical evaluation to assess the nodules, rather than the thyroid dysfunction. Imaging may be needed in thyrotoxic patients; when needed, a thyroid scan, not an ultrasound, is used to assess the etiology of the thyrotoxicosis and the possibility of focal autonomy in a thyroid nodule.

### Elastography as a potential modality for screening cervical lymph nodes in patients with papillary thyroid cancer: a review of literature [^1169nxDE]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Papillary thyroid cancer often presents with cervical lymph node involvement and has a high incidence of recurrence, which requires routine follow-up with ultrasound imaging. Elastography is a novel ultrasound technique that has been demonstrated to be effective clinically in detecting tissue pathology in areas such as the liver and breast. Preliminary data suggest that it may be effective in screening tissues in the neck for malignancy, specifically cervical lymph nodes. However, diagnostic criteria and elastographic techniques vary significantly among the studies we have reviewed, which all tend to focus on populations of patients with many different types of primary malignancies. Further research is required on the feasibility of creating standardized and reproducible clinical criteria in a specific patient population. To study the clinical utility of elastography in cervical lymph nodes, patients with diagnosed papillary thyroid carcinoma may serve as an ideal population because of their need for ultrasound surveillance and the propensity of papillary thyroid cancer to metastasize to and recur in cervical lymph nodes. We will review the limitations, techniques, and reported clinical utility of elastography on cervical lymph nodes and its potential as a screening modality for papillary thyroid cancer.

### Role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer [^117USRQa]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the role of ultrasonography in the detection and management of thyroid cancer.

Methods

Viewpoints are presented on the appropriate applications and the advantages of ultrasonography, based on an extensive personal experience with more than 1,500 ultrasound examinations for assessment of thyroid nodules and for follow-up surveillance of patients with thyroid cancer.

Results

Ultrasonography is ideal for thyroid imaging because of the high echogenicity of thyroid tissue, the superficial site of the thyroid that allows the use of high-frequency transducers yielding high resolution, and the low expense compared with other techniques. In patients with a thyroid nodule, ultrasonography can assist in distinguishing benign from malignant disease. Ultrasound studies will characterize the presence of cystic versus solid elements, the degree of echogenicity of solid elements, the existence of calcifications, and the regularity and definition of the nodule borders. Although individual sonographic features of thyroid nodules are not specific for benign or malignant lesions, a constellation of typical features has more diagnostic value. Hypoechogenicity, poorly defined irregular margins, and microcalcifications are characteristics that should increase the index of suspicion for a malignant nodule. Cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirates is the optimal diagnostic test, and ultrasonographic guidance for performance of the aspiration biopsy is often helpful and sometimes critical. Ultrasonography is also useful for detection of cervical lymph node metastatic lesions. Lymph nodes involved with metastatic thyroid cancer tend to become rounded and bulging, and they lose their hilar echoes as their structure becomes disrupted.

Conclusion

Because of its high resolution and relatively reasonable cost, ultrasonography is valuable in the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^111UKVvF]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 — Thyroid sonography and lymph node survey (Recommendation 6) states that thyroid sonography with survey of the cervical lymph nodes should be performed in all patients with known or suspected thyroid nodules (Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence). Diagnostic thyroid/neck ultrasound (US) should be performed in all patients with a suspected thyroid nodule, nodular goiter, or a radiographic abnormality suggesting an incidentally detected thyroid nodule (including CT, MRI, or 18FDG-PET uptake). US should evaluate thyroid parenchyma and gland size; nodule size, location, and characteristics; and the presence or absence of suspicious cervical lymph nodes, and the report should document three-dimensional nodule size, location, and detailed features (composition, echogenicity, margins, calcifications, shape if taller than wide, and vascularity). In patients with low serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) who have radionuclide thyroid scintigraphy suggesting nodularity, US should also be performed to identify hyperfunctioning nodules that do not require FNA and nonfunctioning nodules that meet sonographic criteria for FNA.

### 2025 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with differentiated thyroid cancer [^117SAXba]. Thyroid (2025). High credibility.

Cervical lymph node involvement and sonographic diagnostic performance — Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) — involves cervical lymph nodes in 30–50% of patients in most series using standard pathological techniques, and no single sonographic feature has adequate sensitivity for detecting lymph nodes with metastatic thyroid cancer, although cystic change has the highest odds of malignancy.

Evaluation of pediatric thyroid nodules — fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and ultrasound (US) features: The 2009 adult guidelines indicate that FNA is not warranted for evaluation of a nodule < 1 cm in size unless the patient is considered high-risk or the nodule is associated with pathologic regional lymph nodes; in children, size alone does not predict malignant histology, so US characteristics and clinical context should be used to identify nodules that warrant FNA. Features more common in malignant lesions include hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, increased intranodular blood flow, microcalcifications, and abnormal cervical lymph nodes, and in all children with a suspicious nodule, US evaluation of the cervical lymph nodes should be performed.

Preoperative neck ultrasound and lymph node evaluation — Recommendation 7 — states that preoperative neck ultrasound to evaluate central and lateral cervical lymph nodes and assess gross extrathyroidal extension is recommended for all patients undergoing surgery for malignant cytologic or molecular findings (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of sonographically suspicious lymph nodes at least 8–10 mm in the smallest diameter should be performed to confirm malignancy if this would change management (strong recommendation, low certainty evidence). The addition of FNA thyroglobulin (Tg) washout to the evaluation of suspicious cervical lymph nodes may be performed in select preoperative patients, but interpretation may be difficult in patients with an intact thyroid gland (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Confirmation of malignancy in suspicious lymph nodes is achieved by ultrasound-guided FNA for cytology and/or measurement of Tg in the needle washout.

### Impact of preoperative ultrasonographic staging of the neck in papillary thyroid carcinoma… [^112jEgdr]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

This prospective study included 60 patients diagnosed as having PTC from January 1 through June 30, 2006. Patients had undergone previous thyroid US evaluation with no palpable adenopathy. Lymph nodes were deemed suspicious by US findings with a minor axis greater than 10 mm, a minor axis greater than 50% of the major axis, or hyperechogenicity with or without microcalcifications. Metastasis was confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy or frozen section analysis. Patients with confirmed metastasis underwent a neck dissection. The location of adenopathy reported by US was correlated with the pathological report. The US evaluation was performed with a high-resolution instrument equipped with a high-frequency linear-array 5- to 12-MHz transducer.

Lymph nodes were characterized by US findings as highly suggestive of metastasis with any of the following criteria: minor axis greater than 10 mm, minor axis greater than 50% of major axis, or hyperechogenicity with or without microcalcifications. 11 In the US report, the nodal status of each neck level was given separately, including level VI, which was specified as right or left. The US staging of the neck detected adenopathy suggestive of metastasis in 12 of the 60 patients, which was pathologically confirmed in 11 of the 12. The patient with false-positive US findings reported as nonspecific reactive lymphadenitis associated with thyroiditis did not undergo lymph node dissection. One false-negative case of metastasis was detected by careful exploration of the central compartment. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity were 92% and 98%, respectively.

The decision to extend the lymph node dissection relied on whether metastases were found in the central compartment only or in the lateral neck. The US evaluation detected metastasis in the central compartment alone in 2 of 11 patients, the central and lateral compartments in 6, and the lateral compartment alone in 3. With this approach, 1 patient was identified as having macroscopic metastasis that was not detected by US evaluation.

### Frequent screening with serial neck ultrasound is more likely to identify false-positive abnormalities than clinically significant disease in the surveillance of intermediate risk papillary thyroid cancer patients without suspicious findings on follow-up ultrasound evaluation [^1117JqVg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Although we recognize that some of the atypical US findings could develop into a structural disease recurrence during long-term follow-up, our findings have relevance to the first 5 years of follow-up because none of the atypical findings were found to be clinically significant structural disease recurrence in that time frame. Furthermore, the structural disease recurrences were not detected during the first 3 years of follow-up indicating that nearly all atypical ultrasonographic findings obtained during this early follow-up period represent false-positive results rather than true structural disease recurrence. When coupled with our earlier observations that sonographically suspicious and atypical lymph nodes and thyroid bed nodules usually remain stable for many years or grow slowly over 2–3 years, there appears to be little clinical justification for the routine use of US examination in the first 3 years of follow-up after ATA intermediate-risk patients attain a nonstimulated Tg less than 1.0 ng/mL and a neck US without suspicious findings. These observations would not be applicable to either ATA high-risk patients or ATA intermediate-risk patients with incomplete structural or biochemical response to therapy because the risk of structural disease recurrence in those patients is significantly higher and could present at earlier time points.

Historically, recurrence from thyroid cancer was observed many years after the initial treatment. In a long-term study of patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer by Mazzaferri and Jhiang, 57% of recurrences were diagnosed in the first 5 years of follow-up, whereas 43% of the recurrences were detected 5–35 years after initial treatment. In another long-term study by Hay et al, thyroid cancer recurrence was detected up to 60 years after the initial treatment. These older studies were conducted when preoperative neck US was not the standard of care and when sensitive surveillance tools such as serum Tg and high-resolution neck US were not available. Because the time to detection of persistent/recurrent thyroid cancer has changed due to improving technology, the surveillance plan for thyroid cancer patients should adopt a more risk-stratified approach for better patient care and cost-effectiveness.

For a known or suspected thyroid nodule, thyroid ultrasound with a survey of the cervical lymph nodes is the test of choice. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy for nodules ⩾ 1 cm in diameter with a high or intermediate sonographically suspicious pattern. Features of a highly suspicious nodule include microcalcifications, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, taller than wide shape, and extrathyroidal extension, correlating with an estimated 70–90% risk of malignancy. Results should be reported based on the six diagnostic categories outlined in the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology, which now takes into consideration the NIFTP reclassification, and the FNA biopsy repeated if the report reveals a nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory specimen. Surgical resection, radioiodine ablation, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression remain the mainstay of DTC therapy but the benefit of active surveillance, and interventional and systemic therapies has also been increasingly acknowledged in more recent years for select cases.

Cervical lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid cancer during surveillance — With prophylactic lateral and central neck dissections despite normal preoperative cervical lymph node sonography, up to 90% of patients with papillary cancers < 1 cm have metastatic level VI lymph nodes and up to 40% have metastatic lateral neck lymph nodes, but in the absence of these dissections this is not the observed clinical loco-regional recurrence rate and ultrasound may detect small-volume metastatic disease that may represent a stable reservoir of residual cancer. Only one study has addressed predictors of outcome and found no sonographic, pathologic, demographic, or molecular feature predicted outcome, and observational studies using standardized ultrasound protocols are required to define the magnitude and predictors of disease progression.

### Ultrasonography for the prediction of high-volume lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid carcinoma: should surgeons believe ultrasound results? [^116cVEYv]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) accounts for approximately 85% of thyroid malignancies. The incidence has been increasing rapidly in recent years, and it has even become the highest of all malignancies in Korea. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis of PTC is satisfactory, and the 10-year overall survival rate is over 90%. Throughout the lifespan, the main problems confronted by most patients are recurrence and reoperation.

Cervical lymph node metastases (LNMs) are very common, especially in the central compartment, and the metastatic rate is 20–90%. The prognostic significance and surgical management of LNM remain controversial. However, several studies have shown that LNM is the second independent risk factor for PTC patients following distant metastasis. Moreover, for patients with high-volume LNMs (> 5 pathological lymph node metastases), the risk of recurrence increases significantly. Based on the 2015 ATA risk stratification system, patients with high-volume LNMs have an intermediate risk of recurrence, and treatment for these patients should thus be highly proactive. Therefore, identifying patients with high-volume LNMs before surgery is of great significance for treatment decision-making.

Ultrasound is the most convenient and effective method for screening thyroid disease. However, ultrasound is operator dependent and cannot image deep anatomic structures that are adequately shadowed by bone or air. Although studies have noted that the efficacy of lymph node metastasis detection by ultrasound is not ideal, the preoperative detection of high-volume LNMs by ultrasound remains unexplored. This study was designed to evaluate the value of preoperative ultrasound for predicting high-volume LNMs in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.

AIUM practice guideline — lymph nodes ultrasound specifies that indications for an ultrasound examination of enlarged cervical lymph nodes include determination of likely inflammation from metastatic malignant lymph nodes; determination of a lymph node from another mass lesion such as a cyst, schwannoma, paraganglioma, lipoma, or parathyroid adenoma; determination of possible lymphomatous node(s); determination of the presence of metastatic lymphadenopathy at specific levels to determine the required type of neck dissection; determination of the specific level of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma within lymph node(s) to assist in defining the primary source; fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for cytology; and core sampling for lymphoma. A mass identified on physical examination is well suited to subsequent sonographic evaluation, lymph nodes are examined initially with grayscale ultrasound imaging, and if a focused examination is performed, a regional or comprehensive ultrasound inspection of other lymph node levels is usually required. If a primary malignant lesion in the aerodigestive tract or thyroid gland is identified on physical examination, ultrasound may be the first-line imaging modality used, allowing identification of other nodes that may not be palpable and access to cytology with ultrasound-guided FNA.

Neck ultrasound performance and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) adjuncts — among low- and intermediate-risk patients, the risk of lymph node recurrence is low (< 2%) in patients with undetectable serum Tg, and 1 g of neoplastic thyroid tissue will increase the serum Tg by ~1 ng/mL during LT4 treatment and by approximately 2–10 ng/mL following TSH stimulation. Neck US can detect N1 as small as 2–3 mm in diameter, but benefits of their early discovery (< 8–10 mm) is not demonstrated, and FNAB cytology misses thyroid cancer in a significant proportion (up to 20%) of patients. For Tg assessment in aspirate fluid, the Tg concentration in the aspirate fluid between 1 and 10 ng/mL is moderately suspicious for malignancy, levels are often elevated (> 10 ng/mL) in lymph node metastases, and up to one half of the FNAB performed for suspicious US findings are benign; nonsuspicious and small nodes (< 8–10 mm in the smallest diameter) can be monitored with neck US.

Thyroid ultrasonography — indications, malignant features, and FNA triggers are stated as follows: To evaluate any kind of thyromegaly, thyroid ultrasonography is the standard practice in North America, and ultrasonography using high-resolution transducers is the most sensitive method available of assessing gland architecture and detecting nodules. Ultrasonography should be used in any patient with a nodular thyroid in order to determine the size of the nodules, the number of nodules, and the need for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, and certain ultrasonographic features associated with increased likelihood of malignancy include microcalcifications, irregular margins, hypoechogenicity, extrathyroidal extension, tall shape, absence of halo, hypervascularity, and abnormal lymph nodes. A significant increase in thyroid nodule size, defined as greater than 50% increase in volume, is an indication for FNA sampling/re-sampling of a thyroid nodule.

### Thyroid ultrasonography [^1155a5zq]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The recent prevalence of ultrasonography (US) has facilitated the early detection and qualitative evaluation of thyroid nodules. Furthermore, novel technical developments are extending the application range of US for other thyroid diseases.

Methods

The use of US to differentiate between thyroid carcinoma and benign nodule, between a metastatic lymph node and a reactive node, between thyroid lymphoma and chronic thyroiditis, and between destruction-induced thyrotoxicosis and Graves' disease is introduced.

Results

Classification systems for thyroid nodule have shown high diagnostic accuracy for thyroid carcinomas except follicular carcinoma. US diagnosis of lymph node metastasis showed high specificity but low sensitivity. Patients who were suspected of thyroid lymphoma based on US findings should undergo incisional biopsy or thyroidectomy for diagnosis of the histologic type if fine-needle aspiration biopsy findings suggest lymphoma. Patients should be carefully followed even if they were diagnosed as negative based on cytologic findings. Measurement of thyroid blood flow is helpful for diagnosing destruction-induced thyrotoxicosis, such as painless thyroiditis, by distinguishing the lesion from Graves' disease.

Conclusions

Ultrasonography is useful for diagnosing various thyroid diseases, including thyroid carcinoma. The remaining issue to be resolved is the diagnosis of follicular carcinoma. Trials using novel techniques to differentiate these lesions are expected.

### Explainable multimodal deep learning for predicting thyroid cancer lateral lymph node metastasis using ultrasound imaging [^111docMy]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative prediction of lateral lymph node metastasis is clinically crucial for guiding surgical strategy and prognosis assessment, yet precise prediction methods are lacking. We therefore develop Lateral Lymph Node Metastasis Network (LLNM-Net), a bidirectional-attention deep-learning model that fuses multimodal data (preoperative ultrasound images, radiology reports, pathological findings, and demographics) from 29,615 patients and 9836 surgical cases across seven centers. Integrating nodule morphology and position with clinical text, LLNM-Net achieves an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.944 and 84.7% accuracy in multicenter testing, outperforming human experts (64.3% accuracy) and surpassing previous models by 7.4%. Here we show tumors within 0.25 cm of the thyroid capsule carry > 72% metastasis risk, with middle and upper lobes as high-risk regions. Leveraging location, shape, echogenicity, margins, demographics, and clinician inputs, LLNM-Net further attains an AUC of 0.983 for identifying high-risk patients. The model is thus a promising for tool for preoperative screening and risk stratification.

### Significance and management of incidentally diagnosed metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma in cervical lymph nodes in neck dissection specimens [^115SYw3N]. Head & Neck (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of patients with incidentally discovered metastatic thyroid cancer in cervical lymph nodes in neck dissection specimens for other pathologies is unclear.

Methods

Retrospective review of neck dissection specimens for nonthyroid malignancy during a 30-year period was undertaken to identify incidental metastatic papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).

Results

Twenty-six patients had an incidental finding of PTC in lymph node(s) in neck dissection specimens. Subsequent ultrasound of the thyroid showed nodules in 20 patients. Eleven (42%) underwent total thyroidectomy, 1 (4%) had a lobectomy, and 14 (54%) were kept under active surveillance only. At a median follow-up of 48months (range 10–189 months), all patients who had undergone surgery and those under surveillance were free of PTC recurrence.

Conclusion

Evaluation for detection of a primary thyroid tumor is essential in all patients with incidentally discovered metastatic PTC. Decision regarding surgery or surveillance is dependent on clinical and radiological tumor features and patient factors.

### American Thyroid Association statement on preoperative imaging for thyroid cancer surgery [^111jgXBe]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The success of surgery for thyroid cancer hinges on thorough and accurate preoperative imaging, which enables complete clearance of the primary tumor and affected lymph node compartments. This working group was charged by the Surgical Affairs Committee of the American Thyroid Association to examine the available literature and to review the most appropriate imaging studies for the planning of initial and revision surgery for thyroid cancer.

Summary

Ultrasound remains the most important imaging modality in the evaluation of thyroid cancer, and should be used routinely to assess both the primary tumor and all associated cervical lymph node basins preoperatively. Positive lymph nodes may be distinguished from normal nodes based upon size, shape, echogenicity, hypervascularity, loss of hilar architecture, and the presence of calcifications. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of suspicious lymph nodes may be useful in guiding the extent of surgery. Cross-sectional imaging (computed tomography with contrast or magnetic resonance imaging) may be considered in select circumstances to better characterize tumor invasion and bulky, inferiorly located, or posteriorly located lymph nodes, or when ultrasound expertise is not available. The above recommendations are applicable to both initial and revision surgery. Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) or PET-CT may be helpful in cases of recurrent cancer with positive tumor markers and negative anatomic imaging.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^112G23bH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Thyroid ultrasound and sonographic risk-stratification systems

Thyroid ultrasonography (US) is the first-line tool for thyroid imaging. The thyroid gland is superficial in the neck, with the posterior border usually located less than 4 cm below the skin surface. High-resolution linear probes provide excellent image definition of the gland. The examination is safe and painless, requires no preparation, and can be performed rapidly in different care settings. To characterize thyroid nodules and obtain an initial estimate of their risk for malignancy, the examiner should focus on the echogenicity of the nodule; its composition (solid, cystic, mixed), shape, and margins; the presence within the nodule of calcifications or other hyperechoic foci; and the characteristics of all cervical lymph nodes. Findings consistently associated with malignancy include hypoechogenicity; infiltrative, irregular, or lobulated margins; intranodular microcalcifications; and a taller-than-wide shape. In addition to the nodule itself, all US studies must include a thorough exploration of all cervical lymph node compartments, and the presence of any suspicious lymph nodes should be noted. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of these features vary, and no single feature has proved capable of reliably distinguishing malignant lesions from those that are benign. In addition, recognition and reporting of these features are characterized by substantial interobserver and even intraobserver variability.

### Which ultrasound characteristics predict lymphatic spread of papillary thyroid cancer? [^112ytTu9]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines recommend lymph node mapping US in patients with definitive cytological evidence of thyroid cancer. Suspicious lymph node features on imaging including enlarged size (> 1 cm in any dimension), architectural distortion, loss of fatty hilum, and microcalcifications often prompt evaluation with fine needle aspiration. There is no universally agreed upon model for determining which ultrasound characteristics most strongly correlate with metastatic disease.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients with confirmed papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) undergoing lymph node mapping ultrasound from 2013 to 2019 was performed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value were calculated for each individual ultrasound characteristic as well as for characteristic combinations.

Results

Data from 119 lymph nodes were included. Malignant lymph nodes were more likely to be enlarged (71% versus 61%, P < 0.001) and to have each individual suspicious feature. Loss of fatty hilum had the highest sensitivity (89%) but was not specific (19%) for metastatic disease. Architectural distortion was found to have the highest specificity (87%). A combination of the four features was found to have higher specificity (97%) and PPV (88%) than any individual feature or combination of two/three features.

Conclusions

A combination of four sonographic features correlates with metastatic PTC to lymph nodes and has the highest specificity and PPV for malignancy. A risk stratification model based on these features may lead to better classification of ultrasound findings in PTC patients with concern for nodal metastases.

Cervical lymph node metastases in differentiated thyroid carcinoma — Cervical lymph node metastases occur in 20%–50% of patients, with micrometastases (< 2 mm) that may approach 90%; preoperative US identifies suspicious cervical adenopathy in 20%–31% of cases and may alter surgical approach in as many as 20% of patients, though preoperative US identifies only half of the lymph nodes found at surgery. Sonographic features suggestive of metastatic lymph nodes include enlargement, loss of the fatty hilum, a rounded rather than oval shape, hyperechogenicity, cystic change, calcifications, and peripheral vascularity. Confirmation of malignancy uses US-guided FNA for cytology and/or Tg washout, and a Tg concentration < 1 ng/mL is reassuring.

Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 25.0). For sensitivity and specificity evaluations, the following formulas were applied using the histopathological report as the gold standard: sensitivity = true positives/(true positives + false negatives) and specificity = true negatives/(true negatives + false positives). Positive predictive value = true positives/(true positives + false positives) and negative predictive value = true negatives/(true negatives + false negatives). Fisher's exact test or the χ 2 test was used to examine the differences between patients with and without LNM/high-volume LNM. Multivariate models were used to determine the risk factors for LNM/high-volume LNMs; p value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

### Ultrasound of thyroid, parathyroid glands and neck lymph nodes [^113tUbQc]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

In the past 15 years high-frequency B-mode sonography and colour-power Doppler have become the most important and most widely employed imaging modalities for the study of the neck, in particular for thyroid gland, parathyroids and lymph nodes. Sonography allows not only the detection but often also the characterization of the diseases of these organs, distinguishing benign from malignant lesions with high sensitivity and specificity, which could be further improved by the employ of ultrasound contrast agents and harmonic imaging. Although no single sonographic criterion is specific for benign or malignant nature of the lesions, the combination of different signs can be markedly helpful to speed up the diagnostic process. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) remains the most accurate modality for the definitive assessment of thyroid gland nodules and of any doubtful case of nodal disease. In association with clinical findings and serum levels of parathormone, FNAB has specificity close to 100% for the characterization of parathyroid adenomas. A combined approach with sonography and FNAB is generally highly effective.

### American Thyroid Association consensus review and statement regarding the anatomy, terminology, and rationale for lateral neck dissection in differentiated thyroid cancer [^111iYcfF]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical lymph node metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) are common. Thirty to eighty percent of patients with papillary thyroid cancer harbor lymph node metastases, with the central neck being the most common compartment involved. The goals of this study were to: (1) identify appropriate methods for determining metastatic DTC in the lateral neck and (2) address the extent of lymph node dissection for the lateral neck necessary to control nodal disease balanced against known risks of surgery.

Methods

A literature review followed by formulation of a consensus statement was performed.

Results

Four proposals regarding management of the lateral neck are made for consideration by organizations developing management guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and DTC including the next iteration of management guidelines developed by the American Thyroid Association (ATA). Metastases to lateral neck nodes must be considered in the evaluation of the newly diagnosed thyroid cancer patient and for surveillance of the previously treated DTC patient.

Conclusions

Lateral neck lymph nodes are a significant consideration in the surgical management of patients with DTC. When current guidelines formulated by the ATA and by other international medical societies are followed, initial evaluation of the DTC patient with ultrasound (or other modalities when indicated) will help to identify lateral neck lymph nodes of concern. These findings should be addressed using fine-needle aspiration biopsy. A comprehensive neck dissection of at least nodal levels IIa, III, IV, and Vb should be performed when indicated to optimize disease control.

### Lymph node imaging for thyroid cancer [^116aHzoT]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cervical lymph nodes (LNs) in the central (level VI) and lateral (levels II-V) compartments of the neck are the most common sites of locoregional metastases associated with thyroid cancer. Prophylactic nodal dissections are uncommon in modern thyroid surgery and are not routinely performed due to concern for increased morbidity and do not offer improved survival. Therefore, a selective approach for LN dissections is increasingly important. Preoperatively, this is most frequently assessed with cervical ultrasound (US). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck can also be used for preoperative assessment. Both US and CT imaging can be used to characterise LNs in levels II-VI and their risk of malignancy based on size, morphology, and growth. US-guided fine-needle aspiration of equivocal LN with thyroglobulin (Tg) washout can also determine if a LN harbours malignancy. For postoperative surveillance after total thyroidectomy, both US and CT continue to play an important role at 6–12 months intervals. These patients may also benefit from additional biochemical data such as Tg levels in addition to LN and thyroid bed imaging. Thyroid uptake scans may also play a role in LN surveillance postoperatively for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma in certain clinical contexts. Less commonly, positron emitted tomography may play a role, but is typically reserved for patients with aggressive or radioactive iodine refractory disease.

### Use of ultrasound in the management of thyroid cancer [^115nwa4c]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

The use of ultrasound for thyroid cancer has evolved dramatically over the last few decades. Since the late 1960s, ultrasound has become essential in the examination of the thyroid gland with the increased availability of high-frequency linear array transducers and computer-enhanced imaging capabilities of modern day portable ultrasound equipment in a clinic- or office-based setting. As a noninvasive, rapid, and easily reproducible imaging study, ultrasound has been demonstrated to have a broadened utility beyond the simple confirmation of thyroid nodules and their sizes. Recently, office-based ultrasound has become an integral part of clinical practice, where it has demonstrated overwhelming benefits to patients being evaluated and treated for thyroid cancer. Ultrasound has become useful in the qualitative characterization of thyroid nodules based on benign or malignant features. On the basis of such classifications and the relative risk for thyroid malignancy, the need for ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, preoperative and intraoperative staging, lymph node mapping, and the extent of surgery can subsequently be determined. Furthermore, ultrasound has additional value in the surveillance of patients treated for thyroid cancer.

### Efficacy of preoperative neck ultrasound in the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis from thyroid cancer [^1143Z2RN]. The Laryngoscope (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

This study was performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of surgeon-performed preoperative neck ultrasound (US) in the detection of both central and lateral cervical lymph node metastases from thyroid cancer.

Study Design

Prospective cohort study.

Methods

Data for all patients with thyroid cancers and follicular thyroid lesions who were evaluated by means of preoperative neck US were reviewed. The cervical lymph nodes were assessed for suspicion of metastasis based on US characteristics. The diagnostic accuracy of US was determined according to whether histologically confirmed cancer was present in surgical cervical lymph node specimens.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity of US in predicting papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) metastasis in the central neck were 30.0% and 86.8%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of US in predicting metastasis in the lateral neck were 93.8% and 80.0%, respectively. A subset of patients underwent US followed by revision neck dissection for PTC, and the sensitivity and specificity of US in predicting metastasis in the lateral neck were 100% and 100%, respectively.

Conclusions

Preoperative neck US is a valuable tool in assessing patients with thyroid cancers. The highly sensitive and specific nature of US in predicting cervical lymph node metastasis in the lateral neck, especially in the setting of recurrent disease, can provide reliable information to assist in surgical management. Although US for central compartment lymphadenopathy in the presence of the thyroid gland is less sensitive and specific than US for the lateral neck, it still provides useful information that can be obtained at the same time the primary thyroid pathology is assessed.

Lymph node assessment

Lymph node involvement is most common in papillary thyroid cancer. In 20% of patients with papillary thyroid cancer, a symptomatic cervical lymph node is one of the main complaints. In addition, nodal metastases have been reported in 50% of patients with papillary thyroid cancer on first presentation. In follicular thyroid cancer, metastases have a tendency to spread to distant organs. For medullary thyroid cancer, both cervical lymph nodes and distant organs can be involved.

Cervical lymph node assessment should be an integral part of the thyroid nodule examination. The neck should be thoroughly screened for any abnormal lymph nodes. Normal and reactive lymph nodes are usually oval with an echogenic hilum, and they are typically hypo-echoic relative to nearby muscle. On Doppler evaluation, there is normally colour flow at the hilum of a reactive lymph node, but it can also appear avascular. An abnormal lymph node would have lost one or a combination of these normal features in terms of shape, echotexture, fatty hilum, irregular contour and vascularity (Fig. 5e). The presence of an abnormal lymph node would result in a category of U5 regardless of any benign features of the thyroid nodule. Abnormal lymph nodes should undergo FNAC along with the nodule to facilitate accurate diagnosis and staging.

A thorough discussion of cervical lymph node evaluation is beyond the scope of this article. However, a number of studies have illustrated in detail the sonographic characteristics of neck lymph nodes, which the reader should find useful for guiding the ultrasound examination.

### American Thyroid Association consensus review and statement regarding the anatomy, terminology, and rationale for lateral neck dissection in differentiated thyroid cancer [^111EtSd2]. Thyroid (2012). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) lateral neck metastasis — risk factors and evaluation — should consider clinical features and targeted assessment. A number of important factors in the patient's history are relevant to the risk for and detection of lateral neck metastases in patients with DTC, and it is important to consider risk factors including the patient's age, gender, tumor size, presence of lymphovascular invasion, extra-thyroidal extension, and presence of central compartment nodal disease; younger patients and men appear to have a significantly higher risk of cervical lymph node metastasis than older patients or women. Recent identification of molecular alterations such as the presence of the BRAF mutation may be important markers to consider, but, consistent with the 2009 American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines, BRAF or other markers being positive alone are insufficient justification to do a prophylactic lateral neck dissection at the present time. In the setting of primary or recurrent DTC, palpable hard/firm lymph nodes should prompt a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the lateral neck by clinical and radiographic examination, and recommendation 21 suggests that preoperative high resolution ultrasound (US) examination of the contralateral thyroid lobe and cervical lymph nodes is the standard of care for all patients undergoing thyroid surgery for malignant cytology.

Thyroid nodules are widely prevalent, and often discovered incidentally. Malignancy rates are low for incidental thyroid nodules, and overall outcomes are favorable regardless of diagnosis. Patients with thyroid nodules should be evaluated with TSH levels followed by ultrasound of the thyroid and cervical lymph nodes. It is important to recognize sonographic features suspicious for thyroid malignancy and obtain biopsies when indicated according to major society guidelines. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology along with molecular testing can help guide management decisions regarding thyroid nodules. Surgical resection and other emerging technologies are safe and effective for the treatment of thyroid nodules needing intervention.

- describe the position, size, shape, margins, content, echogenic pattern, and vascular features of the nodules

- detail the nodules bearing the ultrasound characteristics associated with malignancy in case of multiple nodules rather than describing the largest/dominant nodule

- describe the cervical compartment, number, shape, size, margins, content, echogenic pattern, presence of hilum, and vascular feature in case of suspicious regional neck lymph nodes

- add a rating stratifying thyroid lesions based on their risk of malignancy to reliably communicate the expected risk of cancer.

### Ultrasonography for the prediction of high-volume lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid carcinoma: should surgeons believe ultrasound results? [^113Cft5r]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Our results showed that among the clinical factors that may affect the prediction of high-volume LNMs, male sex (20.2% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.001), age ≤ 55 years old (12.9% vs. 8.8%, p < 0.001) and tumor diameter > 1 cm (24.0% vs. 6.8%, p < 0.001) were risk factors for high-volume LNMs, results that were similar to those of previous studies. Nevertheless, the risk factor for high-volume LNMs, which was more important than these known clinical risk factors, was lymph node involvement detected by preoperative ultrasound with an OR of 12.553. Ultrasound evaluation is an operator-dependent method. Surgeons should be particularly vigilant regarding whether the experience of the sonographer will affect the ultrasound results, especially in the evaluation of cervical lymph node involvement, which has good predictive value for high-volume LNMs. Our results showed that the proportion of LNM detected by skilled and general sonographers was 17.3% and 15.7% (p = 0.363) in the two groups with similar conditions, respectively (Supplementary Table). In the multivariate analysis, a skilled sonographer was not an independent risk factor for detecting LNM by ultrasound (OR = 1.121, 95% CI 0.879–1.429, p = 0.358). However, this study was not a standard diagnostic test; therefore, a standard diagnostic test should be conducted to clarify the impact of sonographer experience on ultrasound results. Moreover, there are needs to expand the population and conduct a multi-center prospective study to evaluate the value of ultrasound in predicting high-volume lymph node metastases for the results just from a retrospective study in one center.

Results

Initial clinicopathological characteristics

Patients were predominantly female (73%), with a median age of 45.9 years at the study entry, and a median follow-up duration of 10 years (range 1–15 y) (Table 1). Initial therapy included total thyroidectomy without neck dissection in 59%, central neck dissection in 14%, and central and lateral neck dissection in 27% of the patients. Most patients (47%) had classic papillary thyroid carcinoma; 29% had follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma, and 24% had tall-cell papillary thyroid carcinoma. Seventy percent of patients presented with lymph node metastasis; however, most the metastatic lymph nodes were small, with a median size of 0.8 cm (range 0.2–4.0 cm). Because patients with distant metastases had been excluded from the study, all the patients in the study cohort with an age younger than 45 years were classified as having American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I disease, and all patients with an age of 45 years and older were classified as having AJCC stage III or IV disease. At the initiation of the study, 54% of the patients (49 of 90) had an excellent response to therapy, whereas 46% of the patients (41 of 90) had an acceptable response to therapy. Prior to entering the study, a small number of patients (11%) who had an incomplete response to initial therapy underwent additional neck dissection, which rendered them free of disease.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance and interpretation of diagnostic ultrasound of the thyroid and extracranial head and neck [^114Vdny4]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Cervical lymph node ultrasound evaluation — Sonographic examination of cervical lymph nodes may be comprehensive or focused, as appropriate for the clinical question and scenario. The size and location of abnormal lymph nodes should be documented, and suspicious nodal morphology including, but not limited to, calcification, cysts/ focal echogenic areas that are unrelated to a fatty hilum, and abnormal blood flow should be documented. Round shape and absence of echogenic hilum, although reported in malignant nodes, are findings with poor specificity in thyroid cancer. Location of abnormal lymph node(s) should be documented with annotations and/or enough visual information to describe the location according to the image-based nodal classification system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery, or in a fashion that allows the referring clinician to convert the location of abnormal nodes to that system. Node evaluation should be performed at centers with experienced personnel, and lymph node size varies with nodal compartment with node size often less important in malignancy assessment than nodal morphology. Enlarged cervical nodes can be seen in lymphoma and other malignancies but are often reactive and are seen in acute and chronic infections and inflammatory disease processes such as postviral syndromes and Hashimoto thyroiditis. In the pediatric population, cervical lymph node size, echotexture, vascularity, and potential nodal suppuration or abscess-formation evaluation are important in the evaluation of acute lymphadenitis.

### Ultrasonography for the prediction of high-volume lymph node metastases in papillary thyroid carcinoma: should surgeons believe ultrasound results? [^112fRFZK]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

This retrospective study included a total of 2073 consecutive PTC patients (male: 490, female: 1583) who underwent primary surgery in our institution for 1 year. This study was approved by the Ethics Committees of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, and all the patients had signed the informed consent.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) newly diagnosed PTC and (2) underwent lobectomy or near-total/total thyroidectomy with cervical lymph node dissection (LND) according to the Chinese guidelines (All PTC patients should undergo at least ipsilateral central neck dissection and lateral neck dissection when cN1b was indicated. The recommendation for primary thyroid surgery is similar to ATA guidelines). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) underwent revision surgery; (2) not underwent cervical LND; and (3) non-PTC on pathological examination. In multifocal cases, the largest diameter of tumors was included for analysis. The number of metastatic lymph nodes was calculated by pathological examination. More than 5 metastatic lymph nodes were defined as high-volume LNMs.

Preoperative ultrasound, which was performed in all patients, provided data on the extent of thyroid disease and suspicious cervical central and lateral lymphadenopathy. There are six features which were used for judging clinically involved nodes (cN1) in our institution. They are enlargement and round shape, loss of the fatty hilum, peripheral vascularity, hyperechogenicity, cystic aspect and microcalcifications. The criteria for lymph nodes involvement are any two or more of the first three features, or any one or more of the last three features, when chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis was considered on ultrasound examination; the criteria for lymph nodes involvement are any one or more of the six features when chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis wasn't considered. In terms of analyzing the influence of the sonographer on the examination results, sonographers were divided into two groups based on their experience: group A, general sonographer who had less than 5 years experience in thyroid ultrasound with approximately 600–700 cases per year, and group B, skilled thyroid sonographer who had performed over 1000 thyroid screening cases per year over the past 5 years.

### Ultrasonography vs computed tomography for papillary thyroid cancer cervical lymph node metastasis… [^113WG4ks]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Ultrasonography demonstrated a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 47% for extrathyroidal extension. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that further study is warranted of the role of CT for papillary thyroid cancer staging, possibly as an adjunct to US. The American Thyroid Association3 and the United Kingdom National Multidisciplinary Guidelines4 recommend the utilization of ultrasonography for the preoperative imaging evaluation of primary thyroid tumors and cervical lymph node basins to assess for nodal metastasis. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is only recommended in a small number of cases, including to assess extent of tumor invasion or bulky nodal metastasis, or if US expertise is not readily available. 3–5. In total, 12 771 observations of CLNM and 1747 observations of extrathyroidal extension of disease were included.

There were 44 studies for a total of 20 465 observations for US, 15 studies for a total of 11 055 observations for CT, and 2 studies for a total of 300 observations for MRI, which reported on the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging modality for CLNM or extrathyroidal extension of disease in thyroid cancer. For US, there were 17 studies that reported on 3162 observations of individuals with thyroid cancer, 1244 of which demonstrated lateral compartment CLNM. The pooled estimates of the mean sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of US for lateral compartment CLNM were 82%, 84%, and 0. 90, respectively. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of US and CT in the detection of CLNM and extrathyroidal disease extension for 31 942 observations of individuals with thyroid cancer in 47 studies.

We found no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between US and CT for lateral compartment CLNM. Although both US and CT demonstrated a low overall sensitivity for central compartment CLNM, CT demonstrated a higher sensitivity, while US demonstrated a higher specificity.

### Striving toward standardization of reporting of ultrasound features of thyroid nodules and lymph nodes: a multidisciplinary consensus statement [^116rZLun]. Thyroid (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The use of high-resolution ultrasound (US) imaging is a mainstay of the initial evaluation and long-term management of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. To fully capitalize on the diagnostic capabilities of a US examination in the context of thyroid disease, many clinicians consider it desirable to establish a universal format and standard of US reporting. The goals of this interdisciplinary consensus statement are twofold. First, to create a standardized set of US features to characterize thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes accurately, and second, to create a standardized system for tracking sequential changes in the US examination of thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes for the purpose of determining risk of malignancy.

Summary

The Thyroid, Head and Neck Cancer (THANC) Foundation convened a panel of nine specialists from a variety of medical disciplines that are actively involved in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. Consensus was achieved on the following topics: US evaluation of the thyroid gland, US evaluation of thyroid nodules, US evaluation of cervical lymph nodes, US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules, and US-guided FNA of cervical lymph nodes.

Conclusion

We propose that this statement represents a consensus within a multidisciplinary team on the salient and essential elements of a comprehensive and clinically significant thyroid and neck US report with regards to content, terminology, and organization. This reporting protocol supplements previous US performance guidelines by not only capturing categories of findings that may have important clinical implications, but also delineating findings that are clinically relevant within those categories as specifically as possible. Additionally, we have included the specific features of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions that have not been previously addressed.

### Ultrasound in head and neck surgery: thyroid, parathyroid, and cervical lymph nodes [^113xGyUE]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Ultrasound (US) of the neck is extremely sensitive in detecting thyroid, parathyroid, and cervical lymph node pathology, and is regarded as the most complete and cost-effective imaging method for evaluating the thyroid and parathyroid glands, as well as for the diagnostic evaluation of the cervical lymph node basin. US is widely used in screening high-risk individuals, evaluation of palpable and nonpalpable thyroid nodules, needle guidance for biopsy of nonpalpable and suspicious nodules, and preoperative evaluation of the extent of thyroid neoplasms, as well as in the detection of residual, recurrent, or metastatic thyroid tumors, and in observing nonsurgical cases. It has thus become an important adjunct to the practice of head and neck surgery.

Univariate and multivariate analyses for LNM

Univariate analysis showed that compared with control group (patients without LNM), LNM were more common in male sex (58.4% vs. 41.1%, p < 0.001), age < 55 years old (47.0% vs. 34.9%, p < 0.001), tumor diameter > 1 cm (64.2% vs. 36.3%, p < 0.001) and usLNM (+) patients (77.0% vs. 38.9%, p < 0.001) (Table 3). Multivariate analysis showed that male sex (OR = 1.869, 95% CI 1.499–2.331, p < 0.001), tumor diameter > 1.0 cm (OR = 2.203, 95% CI 1.892–2.565, p < 0.001) and usLNM (+) (OR = 3.978, 95% CI 2.999–5.275, p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for LNM. In contrast, age > 55 years old (OR = 0.605, 95% CI 0.462–0.791, p < 0.001) was an independent protective factor for LNM (Table 4).

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^115UDkkV]. Annals of Surgery (2020). High credibility.

The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons thyroid surgery guideline — nodal dissection and imaging — states: "Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is often present at TC diagnosis and can occur subclinically in up to 75% and 80% of MTC and PTC patients, respectively". "Therefore, a preoperative diagnosis of TC by cytology or molecular testing should prompt imaging to assess for LNM". "Neck US that includes evaluation of central and lateral LN basins is recommended in patients with cytologic evidence of TC" and "may be performed in patients with indeterminate cytology to help identify nonpalpable lymphadenopathy". "In selected patients, CT of the neck and upper chest can provide additional data especially in extensive lateral neck disease".

### Role of lymph node dissection in primary surgery for thyroid cancer [^112mnz8C]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2007). Low credibility.

The preoperative evaluation of the clinically N0 neck and the operative management of cervical lymph nodes in patients with papillary and medullary thyroid cancer remains controversial. The appreciation that even patients with low-risk disease have a significant risk for recurrence has generated interest in a more comprehensive preoperative evaluation of the neck and has renewed debate on the extent of lymphadenectomy at the time of thyroidectomy. The authors recommend using preoperative ultrasound before thyroidectomy for all patients with thyroid cancer and before any subsequent surgeries for recurrent disease to identify the extent of lymph node metastases and thereby facilitate complete surgical removal of all gross disease in the neck. The optimal surgical procedure for removing cervical lymphadenopathy is compartment-oriented neck dissection based on the findings from preoperative ultrasound.

### Significance and management of thyroid lesions in lymph nodes as an incidental finding during neck dissection [^111qrjFE]. Head & Neck (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The incidental discovery of thyroid lesions in lymph nodes during a lymph node dissection performed for a separate primary head and neck tumor is an unusual clinical entity. Its discovery has led to controversy regarding its significance and management.

Methods

We identified five patients over the years 1991–1999 with this finding. All five patients were subsequently treated with a total thyroidectomy and a level VI lymph node dissection.

Results

Pathological examination revealed three papillary carcinomas and level VI lymph node metastases in the two patients who had carcinoma in their thyroid glands. All five patients are presently free of their primary and thyroid disease on follow-up examinations.

Conclusions

These patients should be addressed with additional work-up and surgery if metastatic thyroid cancer is documented in the lymph node. We offer a diagnostic algorithm that may aid in further work-up and treatment in these unusual cases.

### The impact of metastatic lymph nodes on risk stratification in differentiated thyroid cancer: have we reached a higher level of understanding? [^116AuDBE]. Thyroid (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The revised American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines for differentiated thyroid cancer emphasize a variety of clinicopathologic features of metastatic lymph nodes in determining the risk of recurrence. The mere presence of a positive node is not sufficient to confer reliable prognostic significance. The number and size of lymph nodes, as well as the presence of extranodal extension (ENE), impact risk stratification. Moreover, the presence of clinically evident lymph nodes is important for determining risk of recurrence. A patient's place on the risk spectrum has ramifications for the management of differentiated thyroid cancer. However, there are inherent inconsistencies in the identification and characterization of metastatic lymph nodes. Moreover, the significance of ENE must be clarified.

Summary

There are many obstacles to the consistent reporting of metastatic lymph nodes. What constitutes a "clinically evident" lymph node has not been well defined, lacks precision, and varies depending on clinical context, as well as the experience of the surgeon and the ultrasonographer. The number of lymph nodes sampled by surgeons and reported by pathologists may vary from institution to institution. The literature on ENE has been limited by the fact that the definition of ENE has not been standardized. Nevertheless, 17/19 manuscripts reviewed herein suggest that ENE confers a worse prognosis. The ATA risk stratification for metastatic lymph nodes published in the 2015 guidelines combines clinicopathological features that are variably identified and reported across institutions. This review brings into question the significance of the number of nodes with ENE, a factor that is used as an important stratifying variable in the latest guidelines.

Conclusions

Metastatic lymph nodes do not all carry the same prognostic significance, but a risk assignment based on the ATA guidelines is limited by a lack of standardization in clinical and pathologic definitions, lymph node sampling, and reporting. This study reviews the limitations of prior studies on ENE and concludes that the body of the evidence reported in those studies suggests that ENE increases the risk of recurrence. The impact of ENE in lymph nodes in thyroid cancer risk stratification should be reconsidered.

### Central neck lymph node size measured by ultrasound significantly predicts central neck lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma [^115XiZjD]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether Central lymph node (CLN) size as measured by an ultrasound can significantly predict CLN metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Materials and methods: This retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with PTC who underwent ultrasound and central neck dissection (CND). We excluded patients who received previous thyroid surgery or radiation. We analyzed the correlation between CLN size and characteristics by ultrasound and histopathologic findings among positive CLN patients. Results: Of the 48 patients who underwent preoperative ultrasound and CND, 34 patients had positive CLN identified by ultrasound. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasound in this diagnostic setting was 88.0%, 21.0%, 73.2%, 42.9%, and 68.7%, respectively. The risk of CLN metastasis of PTC was 67.7% and 85.7% for lymph node size 3.1 to 4 mm and 4.1 to 5 mm, respectively. The risk increased to 100% when the lymph node size was > 5 mm. Positive preoperative ultrasound of lateral neck lymph node was found to be a significant risk factor for CLN metastasis (P = .003). Conclusion: Ultrasound was found to be an effective preoperative evaluation in patients with PTC to determine the likelihood of CLN metastasis and whether CND is indicated, especially in the ultrasound-positive central lymph node. A high risk of metastasis was found in CLN size > 3 mm by ultrasound, and the risk dramatically increased in CLN size > 5 mm. We also found positive lateral neck node from preoperative ultrasound to be a significant risk factor for CLN metastasis.

### Ultrasonographic characteristics of thyroid nodules… [^116FeC1h]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background High-resolution real-time ultrasonography can detect characteristics of thyroid nodules, but the US differentiation between malignant nodules and benign nodules is not well described. Hypothesis Ultrasonography is useful for predicting malignancy of thyroid nodules. Design A retrospective study of 329 thyroid nodules in 309 patients comparing US characteristics and pathological results. According to a receiver operating characteristic curve constructed from this multiple logistic regression analysis, the best point not to overlook malignancy is the point at which sensitivity is 94% and specificity is 87%. The probability of malignancy at this point is greater than 0.
2. For follicular neoplasms, ultrasonographic diagnosis was unreliable, even when multiple logistic regression analysis was applied.

Conclusion We can predict malignancy of nonfollicular neoplasms of the thyroid by using multiple logistic regression analysis based on only 5 features: margin, shape, echo structure, echogenicity, and calcification. ULTRASONOGRAPHY is useful for evaluation of thyroid nodules because of its safety, noninvasiveness, nonradioactivity, and effectiveness. Presently, high-resolution real-time US not only detects the presence, site, number, and size of thyroid nodules but also clearly shows the characteristics of thyroid nodules. The US examination was performed with a US scanner equipped with a 6- to 13-MHz linear probe. The spatial resolution for this system is about 2 mm.

Margin, shape, halo sign, echo structure, internal echo, echogenicity, calcification, and invasion to adjacent organs were assessed to make a US diagnosis of either malignant or benign disease. Using receiver operating characteristic curves based on the multiple logistic regression analysis, we identified the best point with high true-positive and low false-negative rate. The probability at this point was greater than 0.
2. Some typical US characteristics are shown in Figure
3. For follicular neoplasms, we could not differentiate carcinoma from adenoma by the same procedure.

### Explainable multimodal deep learning for predicting thyroid cancer lateral lymph node metastasis using ultrasound imaging [^113yWtbd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Thyroid cancer is a prevalent malignancy worldwide, with an increasing incidence reported globally. Cervical lymph node metastasis, encompassing both central and lateral compartments, is a critical factor affecting patient prognosis, with an incidence rate of 20–50%, and increasing the risk of mortality by 46%. The central compartment is widely recognized as the station for lymph node metastasis, and numerous related studies have been conducted –. In contrast, studies on lateral compartment metastasis are scarce, primarily due to: (1) the complexity of the anatomical structure, with the distribution pathways and connection patterns of lymphatic vessels around the thyroid varying among individuals; (2) the dispersed distribution of lateral lymph nodes, complicating statistical analysis and potentially leading to omissions; (3) limitations of research methods — lateral lymph nodes are often located in deep cervical tissues, and their small size and depth make accurate detection and research challenging, with ultrasound sensitivity in predicting lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM) being only 62%; and (4) difficulty in sample acquisition. Biopsy of lateral lymph nodes requires a high level of clinician expertise and poses certain risks to patients, limiting the scale and depth of related studies. Furthermore, central compartment lymph nodes are routinely dissected, whereas prophylactic dissection of lateral lymph nodes is not typically considered standard procedure in some countries and regions, leading to a significant shortage of available samples for research.
