## Question

Flow chart for emergency IBD managment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a flow chart for emergency IBD management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical scenario and triage. Then, I should verify initial stabilization and supportive care. Next, I will review diagnostic workup and exclusion of mimics. After that, I need to confirm first-line therapy and the 3–5 day reassessment window. Then, I will examine rescue options and dosing nuances. I should also check surgical indications and timing. Finally, I will consider maintenance planning, special populations, and quality metrics, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and triage framework. Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a medical emergency defined by more than six bloody stools per day with systemic toxicity (fever, tachycardia, anemia, or elevated CRP), and in pediatrics a PUCAI score of 65 or higher; patients meeting these criteria should be admitted for intensive monitoring and multidisciplinary care, with early surgical involvement for high-risk cases [^115xEFnD] [^116AiKVd] [^116C6zk4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about outpatient management. I initially thought ambulatory pathways might be broadly acceptable, but wait, I should verify the balance of evidence. While UK cohorts suggest ambulatory ASUC care can be feasible in selected, closely monitored patients without high-risk features, expert consensus during COVID-19 cautioned against routine ambulatory care due to risks of delayed escalation and missed endoscopic assessment; thus, ambulatory pathways should be reserved for carefully selected patients with daily specialist oversight and rapid access to inpatient care if deterioration occurs [^116ePQ5v] [^117Tp3VY] [^112vFXGC].

> Next, I should review initial stabilization and supportive care. I need to ensure hemodynamic stability with two large-bore IVs, aggressive IV crystalloids, and transfusion thresholds of hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL in stable patients and less than 9 g/dL in massive bleeding or with comorbidities; I should also initiate pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis early given the elevated thrombotic risk in IBD flares and avoid NSAIDs, anticholinergics, and opioids that can precipitate colonic dilation or mask pain [^117QKy8h] [^115KGtuN] [^115z4NFe] [^116871JG].

> I will now examine the diagnostic workup and exclusion of mimics. I should double-check that stool studies include C. difficile, bacterial cultures, and CMV PCR, with endoscopic assessment via flexible sigmoidoscopy within 24–72 hours to grade severity and obtain biopsies for CMV; I also need to assess for toxic megacolon with daily abdominal exams and plain radiographs if concern arises, and avoid medications that increase colonic diameter or mask symptoms [^117TBJx5] [^116871JG] [^111CDu6b].

> Let me consider first-line medical therapy and the reassessment window. Intravenous corticosteroids are the cornerstone: methylprednisolone 40–60 mg daily or hydrocortisone 100 mg three to four times daily, with reassessment at day 3 using stool frequency, bleeding, vitals, and CRP; if there is inadequate improvement, I should escalate to rescue therapy rather than prolonging steroids, as delays increase colectomy risk [^111wJKq8] [^111DwWa1] [^117ApoEZ].

> Wait, let me verify the rescue therapy options and dosing nuances. Infliximab or cyclosporine are appropriate second-line agents with comparable short-term efficacy; for infliximab, accelerated or intensified dosing may be considered in patients with low albumin or high inflammatory burden, though guideline panels make no firm recommendation for routine intensification due to low-quality evidence, so I should individualize based on risk and local experience [^112fhxAR] [^116EqAdX] [^116871JG].

> I should confirm surgical indications and timing. Indications include failure of steroids by day 3–5, failure or intolerance of rescue therapy, toxic megacolon, perforation, or massive hemorrhage; subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy is the procedure of choice in emergencies, and early surgical consultation should occur within 48–72 hours of admission to avoid delays that increase postoperative morbidity [^111Prjot] [^114PiXzp] [^117MGDXZ].

> Next, I should review maintenance planning after remission. If remission is achieved with infliximab, I should continue the same agent for maintenance; if remission is achieved with cyclosporine, thiopurines are a reasonable maintenance option, with vedolizumab as an alternative when thiopurines are unsuitable, recognizing the evidence base is weaker for cyclosporine-based maintenance strategies [^114i9izL] [^116VevPQ] [^115iao88].

> But wait, what about special populations and emerging therapies. In pediatrics, the same principles apply with PUCAI-guided monitoring and early rescue; in pregnancy, methylprednisolone is preferred over hydrocortisone to minimize fluid retention, and infliximab is favored over cyclosporine; for steroid-refractory patients, small case series suggest tofacitinib may be effective, but I should confirm that current guidelines still consider JAK inhibitors investigational in ASUC pending stronger evidence [^116AiKVd] [^116871JG] [^112sdS5C].

> I need to ensure quality metrics and system processes are embedded. Daily multidisciplinary rounds, standardized ASUC order sets, and clear escalation triggers at day 3 improve timeliness of rescue and reduce colectomy delays; ambulatory pathways, where used, must include daily gastroenterology review, rapid access to endoscopy, and explicit safety-net criteria for immediate admission if deterioration occurs [^116ePQ5v] [^117Tp3VY].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure internal consistency. The sequence is: triage and admission for ASUC, stabilize and exclude infection, start IV corticosteroids with day 3 reassessment, escalate to infliximab or cyclosporine if inadequate response, involve surgery early, and plan maintenance based on the rescue agent used; I should double-check that each branch point aligns with major guidelines and that no step contradicts the evidence base before finalizing the pathway [^111DwWa1] [^116ZBXkv] [^116871JG].

The emergency IBD management flowchart is a **stepwise, time-sensitive algorithm** for acute severe UC and severe Crohn's flares, emphasizing early recognition, stabilization, infection exclusion, and rapid escalation to rescue therapy or surgery when indicated [^117W8A2M]. Key steps include: **admit and stabilize** (IV fluids, electrolytes, VTE prophylaxis) [^111MGXTz]; **exclude infection** (stool C. difficile, cultures, CMV PCR, chest X-ray) [^117TBJx5]; **start IV corticosteroids** (methylprednisolone 40–60 mg/day or hydrocortisone 100 mg Q8H) [^111wJKq8]; reassess at **day 3** — if no improvement, initiate rescue therapy (infliximab or cyclosporine) [^116ZBXkv]; and if rescue fails or complications arise (toxic megacolon, perforation, massive hemorrhage), **proceed to urgent colectomy** [^116871JG]. For Crohn's, prioritize **abscess drainage**, bowel rest, and early surgical consultation for obstruction or perforation [^117W8A2M]. Daily monitoring of stool frequency, CRP, and albumin guides escalation, and multidisciplinary care is essential throughout [^111Efw4J].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Immediate IV access, fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte correction [^111MGXTz].

- **Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis**: Initiate pharmacologic prophylaxis (e.g. LMWH) due to elevated VTE risk in IBD flares [^115KGtuN].

- **Nutritional support**: Avoid routine TPN; provide enteral nutrition if tolerated [^117WukuB].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, renal and liver function, CRP, ESR, lactate, and coagulation profile [^116871JG].

- **Infection screening**: Stool C. difficile toxin, bacterial cultures, and CMV PCR; chest X-ray if respiratory symptoms [^117BHnqh].

- **Imaging**: Abdominal X-ray or CT to assess for toxic megacolon, perforation, or obstruction [^notfound].

- **Endoscopy**: Flexible sigmoidoscopy within 24–72 hours to assess severity and obtain biopsies for CMV [^116871JG].

---

## Medical management

### Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC)

First-line therapy is **intravenous corticosteroids** (methylprednisolone 40–60 mg/day or hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours) [^111wJKq8]. Reassess at **day 3**; if there is inadequate response, initiate rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine [^116ZBXkv]. Routine antibiotics are not recommended unless infection is confirmed [^113iaMEs].

---

### Severe Crohn's disease flare

- **Bowel rest**: NPO status if obstruction or severe symptoms.

- **Corticosteroids**: IV methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone for induction.

- **Antibiotics**: Indicated for abscess or suspected infection (e.g. metronidazole and ciprofloxacin).

- **Biologic therapy**: Early consideration of infliximab or adalimumab in severe flares [^notfound].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

| **Indication** | **Recommended surgical procedure** |
|-|-|
| Toxic megacolon | Subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy [^notfound] |
| Colonic perforation | Emergency colectomy [^notfound] |
| Massive hemorrhage | Subtotal colectomy [^115sThND] |
| Failure of medical therapy | Colectomy after 3–5 days of rescue therapy [^notfound] |
| Severe Crohn's obstruction or abscess | Segmental resection or drainage [^notfound] |

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Daily monitoring should include **stool frequency, abdominal exam, vitals, CRP, and albumin** [^116871JG]. Maintain a **multidisciplinary approach** with gastroenterology, surgery, nutrition, and nursing [^115wyyvy]. Educate patients on medication adherence, symptom monitoring, and when to seek care [^111Efw4J].

### Inpatient management of acute severe ulcerative colitis [^111Efw4J]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a potentially life-threatening presentation of ulcerative colitis that in nearly all cases requires inpatient management and coordinated care from hospitalists, gastroenterologists, and surgeons. Even with ideal care, a substantial proportion of patients will ultimately require colectomy, but most patients can avoid surgery with intravenous corticosteroid treatment and if needed, appropriate rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine. In-hospital management requires not only therapies to reduce the inflammation at the heart of the disease process, but also to avoid complications of the disease and its treatment. Care for ASUC must be anticipatory, with patient education and evaluation starting at the time of admission in advance of the possible need for urgent medical or surgical rescue therapy. Here we outline a general approach to the treatment of patients hospitalized with ASUC, highlighting the common pitfalls and critical points in management.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis is a medical emergency that requires prompt recognition, evaluation, and intervention. Patients require hospital admission with laboratory, radiographic, and endoscopic evaluation with initiation of corticosteroid treatment. Despite early intervention, many patients require salvage medical therapy, with some progressing to colectomy. Here we review important concepts and recent advances in the evaluation and medical management of adult and pediatric patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute severe colitis (ASC) is a relatively frequent manifestation in children with ulcerative colitis and one of the few emergencies in paediatric gastroenterology. A standardized proactive approach based on tight monitoring and timely medical and surgical interventions may improve patients' outcomes. We aimed to update the previous ASC guidelines using detailed recommendations and practice points, based on a systematic review of the literature and consensus of experts. These guidelines update is a joint effort of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization. A systematic search was performed in Pubmed Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases using 13 predefined PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes) based questions and 30 non-PICO based questions. Grading methodology was based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine-Levels of evidence. The questions were addressed by working subgroups following an iterative consensus voting process, including three online voting meetings and one face-to-face meeting. A total of 36 recommendations and 72 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 88% for all statements, regarding initial evaluation, monitoring, medical and surgical treatment of ASC in children. Several topics have been revised since the previous 2018 guidelines and differ from corresponding published adult guidelines. These guidelines present a comprehensive overview of the management of ASC in children, offering practical recommendations and practice points aiming to standardize clinical and surgical treatment and improve outcomes of this severe scenario.

### How to manage: acute severe colitis [^1133DzaN]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a medical emergency which is associated with significant morbidity and a mortality rate of 1%. ASUC requires prompt recognition and treatment. Optimal management includes admission to a specialist gastrointestinal unit and joint management with colorectal surgeons. Patients need to be screened for concomitant infections and thromboprophylaxis should be administered to mitigate against the elevated risk of thromboembolism. Corticosteroids are still the preferred initial medical therapy but approximately 30%-40% of patients fail steroid therapy and require rescue medical therapy with either infliximab or cyclosporine. Emergency colectomy is required in a timely manner for patients who fail rescue medical therapy to minimise the risk of adverse post-operative outcomes. We discuss current and emerging evidence in the management of ASUC and outline management approaches for clinicians involved in managing ASUC.

### Medical management of severe ulcerative colitis [^117UrVvc]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The medical management of patients with severe ulcerative colitis requires initial stabilization, careful and repeated evaluations to exclude confounding or coexisting diagnoses, and timely delivery of appropriate medications. Medical therapies for these patients are potent but may be toxic, and administration must be done by experienced medical professionals, with adequate access to appropriate laboratory, radiographic, endoscopic, and surgical facilities. Patients who fail to respond to high-dose intravenous corticosteroids in a timely basis should be evaluated for cyclosporin therapy, or proceed to surgery. The promise of newer, investigational therapies to induce and maintain remission must be borne out by large controlled trials.

### Acute severe ulcerative colitis: from pathophysiology to clinical management [^111MGXTz]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and rectum, resulting from a dysregulated immune response towards intraluminal antigens in a genetically predisposed host. The disease has a varying extent and severity. Approximately 20% of patients with ulcerative colitis experience a severe flare during the course of their disease, requiring hospitalization. Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is potentially a life-threatening condition that requires early recognition, hospitalization, correction of body fluids and electrolytes, and nutritional support if needed. Superimposed bacterial or viral infections need to be excluded and thromboprophylaxis should be started. Intravenous corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for this condition. Rescue treatment with ciclosporin or infliximab is indicated in patients who do not sufficiently respond to corticosteroids after 3–5 days, with close monitoring of the patients' symptoms, serum C-reactive protein and albumin levels. If medical therapy fails, timely colectomy should be performed to prevent critical complications. In this article, we review all relevant aspects of ASUC, from its pathophysiological background to modern management in clinical practice.

Conclusion

The guidelines referenced in this review offer a useful summary for how to manage UC. They highlight the need for accurate diagnosis, early initiation of appropriate therapy and ongoing assessment of disease progress and the side effects of treatment. Care is often centralised, but awareness of who and when to refer for assessment both initially and during relapse (particularly for severe colitis) will remain an important part of the overall management of these children.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^1142k52w]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis — initial inpatient management: among hospitalized patients with ASUC, after excluding alternative etiologies, intravenous methylprednisolone doses of 40–60 mg/d or equivalent are the mainstay of therapy. Routine use of adjunctive antibiotics in patients without infections is not recommended. We advocate for a 3- to 5-day trial of intravenous corticosteroids before transitioning to medical rescue therapy with cyclosporine or infliximab.

### Acute severe ulcerative colitis management: unanswered questions and latest insights [^114WDqox]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a distinctive ulcerative colitis flare presentation characterised by the presence of systemic inflammation as well as bloody diarrhoea, and occurs at least once in 25% of patients with ulcerative colitis during their disease course. Each episode carries a risk of complications, need for colectomy, and mortality. Little is known about ASUC pathogenesis, although impaired host-microbiota crosstalk involving pathobionts is suspected. In this Review, we discuss unanswered questions and results from the latest research on the medical-first-line, second-line, and potential third-line therapies-and surgical management of ASUC. We detail promising options for management, such as the use of enteral nutrition in combination with intravenous steroids, the ability to predict early failure of first-line or second-line therapies, and the emerging role of JAK inhibitors. An optimal framework to personalise therapy on the basis of multiomics tools is yet to be developed.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113FB1Tu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — therapeutic management guidance: Therapeutic management in UC should be guided by the extent of bowel involvement, an assessment of disease activity and disease prognosis; patients with moderate-to-severely active UC or with high risk of hospitalization or colectomy should be treated with therapies that have evidence for efficacy based on clinical trials and real world studies. We recommend that prognosis should guide choice of therapy as much as activity of inflammation at the time of acute illness.

### The management of the hospitalized ulcerative colitis patient: the medical-surgical conundrum [^114pmm3v]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review article, we address emerging evidence for the medical and surgical treatment of the hospitalized patient with ulcerative colitis.

Recent Findings

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the colon and rectum. About one-fifth of patients will be hospitalized from ulcerative colitis, and about 20–30%, experiencing an acute flare will undergo colectomy. Because of the significant clinical consequences, patients hospitalized need prompt evaluation for potential complications, stratification of disease severity, and a multidisciplinary team approach to therapy, which involves both the gastroenterologist and surgeon. Although corticosteroids remain first-line therapy, second-line medical rescue options, primarily infliximab or cyclosporine, are considered within 3–5 days of presentation. In conjunction, an early surgical consultation to present the possibility of a staged proctocolectomy as one of the therapeutic options is equally important.

Summary

A coordinated multidisciplinary, individualized approach to treatment, involving the patient preferences throughout the process, is optimal in providing patient-centered effective care.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^114PiXzp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Statement 5.1.3

In case of no improvement with a second-line therapy, in discussion with a gastroenterologist, surgery is recommended in acute severe ulcerative colitis (QoE C).

Statement 5.1.4

Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy is a safe and effective treatment for patients requiring emergency surgery for acute severe ulcerative colitis presenting with massive colorectal hemorrage (QoE B).

Recommendations

We suggest evaluating all hemodynamically stable patients presenting with acute severe ulcerative colitis in a multidisciplinary approach with the gastroenterologist to decide on options for initial medical treatment (weak recommendation based on low-level evidence 2C).

We recommend performing emergency surgical exploration in hemodynamically unstable patients, according to damage control principles and in patients with colonic perforation. A Subtotal colectomy with ileostomy in acute severe ulcerative colitis is the surgical treatment of choice in patients presenting massive colorectal haemorrhage or non-responders to medical treatment (strong recommendation based on high-level evidence 1A).

### Consensus for managing acute severe ulcerative colitis in children: a systematic review and joint statement from ECCO, ESPGHAN, and the porto IBD working group of ESPGHAN [^1113a1gp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASC) is a potentially life-threatening disease. We aimed to formulate guidelines for managing ASC in children based on systematic review of the literature and robust consensus process. This manuscript is a product of a joint effort of the ECCO (European Crohn's and Colitis Organization), the Pediatric Porto Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Working group of ESPGHAN (European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition) and ESPGHAN.

Methods

A group of 19 experts in pediatric IBD participated in an iterative consensus process including two face-to-face meetings. A total of 17 predefined questions were addressed by working subgroups based on a systematic review of the literature.

Results

The recommendations and practice points were eventually endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 95% regarding: definitions, initial evaluation, standard therapy, timing of second-line therapy, the role of endoscopic evaluation and heparin prophylaxis, how to administer second-line medical therapy, how to assess response, surgical considerations, and discharge recommendations. A management flowchart is presented based on daily scoring of the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), along with 28 formal recommendations and 34 practice points.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide clinically useful points to guide the management of ASC in children. Taken together, the recommendations offer a standardized protocol that allows effective monitoring of disease progress and timely treatment escalation when needed.

### Managing acute severe ulcerative colitis in the hosptialised setting [^1169LpdT]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis affects approximately 146000 people in the UK and is the most common form of inflammatory bowel disease. The majority of patients will have uncomplicated disease, but around 1 in 10 patients will develop acute severe colitis. Despite modern medical management, colectomy rates of 27% and mortality rates of 1% are still reported. Good supportive care and intravenous corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment, but up to one-third of patents will not respond. The Travis criteria allow early recognition of those patients failing to improve by day 3, allowing timely planning of medical rescue therapy or surgery. Rescue therapy with either infliximab or ciclosporin appears equally efficacious. Patients naive to thiopurines seem to have better colectomy-free survival rates following rescue therapy than those previously exposed. We review the published evidence behind the conventional management of acute severe ulcerative colitis.

### Sequential rescue therapy with JAK inhibitors in corticosteroid and infliximab-refractory acute severe ulcerative colitis: a case series [^116vFjM8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a life-threatening medical emergency affecting over 20% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Initial management with intravenous corticosteroids (IVCS) is effective for most presentations. However, 30%–40% of patients fail to respond to IVCS and require rescue medical therapy or urgent colectomy. Infliximab or ciclosporin is considered first-line rescue therapy for IVCS-refractory ASUC and has comparable rates of clinical response, colectomy, adverse events and death. Unfortunately, despite improvements in the modern era, approximately 15% of patients are medically refractory and progress to colectomy, highlighting the need for other treatment options. –

Rescue therapy with dose-intensified infliximab is commonly used and may reduce colectomy rates further, although observational evidence supporting this practice is equivocal and suggests this approach may only defer rather than avoid colectomy. More recently, an Australian multicentre randomised study (PREDICT-UC) found no difference in the day 7 clinical response between a standard (5 mg/kg) and intensified (10 mg/kg) initial infliximab dose. However, subgroup analysis suggested that a higher initial infliximab dose may still provide short-term benefits for patients with lower serum albumin and higher inflammatory burden. Thus, there remains a potential role for dose-intensified infliximab in select patients.

### Ambulatory care management of 69 patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis in comparison to 695 inpatients: insights from a multicentre UK cohort study [^1112Qhq6]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Although our current data cannot be used to define a suitable cohort for ambulatory ASUC management, we speculate that patients with the following characteristics may be appropriate for such a pathway: younger patient age, motivated and engaged patient, no features of megacolon/imminent need for colectomy and biological naïve.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies reviewing management of patients with ASUC in the ambulatory setting prior to the pandemic, with just one single centre report detailing the benefits of such an approach for six patients as a COVID-19 pandemic-driven initiative. In this report, Townsend et al describe how they undertook daily patient review, clinical investigations and delivered intravenous corticosteroids, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, and where appropriate, second-line infliximab rescue treatment all in an ambulatory setting. Only one of the six patients (all of whom met ASUC criteria) treated with this approach required hospital admission for colectomy. In our study, two ambulatory pathways were evident: for 80% of ambulatory patients this entailed initial inpatient intravenous corticosteroids, an expedited discharge and then further doses of intravenous corticosteroid as an outpatient; for 20% of ambulatory patients they received their first dose of intravenous corticosteroid as an outpatient. Notably, nearly half (40%) of these latter ambulatory patients were subsequently admitted to hospital, demonstrating the importance of clear pathways for safe and urgent admission. Neither ambulatory approach was associated with detrimental outcomes.

### AGA technical review on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^116jRjY1]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

A subset of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) present with, or progress to, moderate to severe disease activity. These patients are at high risk for colectomy, hospitalization, corticosteroid dependence, and serious infections. The risk of life-threatening complications and emergency colectomy is particularly high among those patients hospitalized with acute severe ulcerative colitis. Optimal management of outpatients or inpatients with moderate to severe UC often requires the use of immunomodulator and/or biologic therapies, including thiopurines, methotrexate, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, TNF-α antagonists, vedolizumab, tofacitnib, or ustekinumab, either as monotherapy or in combination (with immunomodulators), to mitigate these risks. Decisions about optimal drug therapy in moderate to severe UC are complex, with limited guidance on comparative efficacy and safety of different treatments, leading to considerable practice variability. Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized development of clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform the clinical guidelines, this technical review was completed in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Focused questions in adult outpatients with moderate to severe UC included: (1) overall and comparative efficacy of different medications for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with or without prior exposure to TNF-α antagonists, (2) comparative efficacy and safety of biologic monotherapy vs combination therapy with immunomodulators, (3) comparative efficacy of top-down (upfront use of biologics and/or immunomodulator therapy) vs step-up therapy (acceleration to biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy only after failure of 5-aminosalicylates, and (4) role of continuing vs stopping 5-aminosalicylates in patients being treated with immunomodulator and/or biologic therapy for moderate to severe UC. Focused questions in adults hospitalized with acute severe ulcerative colitis included: (5) overall and comparative efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for inpatients refractory to corticosteroids, in reducing risk of colectomy, (6) optimal dosing regimens for intravenous corticosteroids and infliximab in these patients, and (7) role of adjunctive antibiotics in the absence of confirmed infections.

### Outcomes of acute severe ulcerative colitis at initial presentation [^115QR4NV]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

20–25% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) will experience at least one episode of acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). Up to 20% of nonresponders to medical treatment require surgery during the index episode. For approximately one-third of the patients, ASUC is the first manifestation of the disease, presenting unique challenges.

Methods and Aims

Retrospective cohort study including 185 patients hospitalized with ASUC. We aim to compare the clinical outcomes between patients with new-onset and established UC.

Results

62 (33.5%) patients had new-onset, while 123 (66.5%) had established UC. Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics were similar between groups. Patients with new-onset UC experienced longer hospitalizations (19 ± 22 vs. 12 ± 11 days; P = 0.002), longer delay until receiving rescue therapy [11 vs. 6 days (interquartile range: 6–8 days); P = 0.014] and more severe bacterial infections (16 vs. 4%; P = 0.005). We found no significant differences in steroid response (P = 0.719), need for rescue therapy (P = 0.522), response to rescue therapy (P = 0.234), colectomy (P = 0.655), mortality (P = 0.516), and hospital readmission (P = 0.929) between groups. After 1 year, colectomy or death occurred in 13.5% of patients. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes included active smoking, extensive colitis, the need for rescue therapy, and severe bacterial infections - but not new-onset disease.

Conclusion

Major clinical outcomes were similar between patients with new-onset and established UC.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^116871JG]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) inpatient management — initial evaluation, monitoring, and therapy selection: All patients with ASUC should undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy within 72 hours and preferably within 24 hours of admission to assess endoscopic severity and obtain biopsies for cytomegalovirus colitis. All patients with ASUC should be assessed for the presence of toxic megacolon, and response should be monitored using stool frequency, rectal bleeding, physical examination, vital signs, and serial C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, and medications with anticholinergic side effects should be avoided in ASUC. In patients failing to adequately respond to medical therapy by 3 d or with suspected toxicity, surgical consultation should be obtained. In patients with ASUC, the choice between infliximab and cyclosporine should be based on provider experience with the agent, history of prior failure of immunomodulator or anti-TNF therapy, and serum albumin. Toxic megacolon, colonic perforation, severe refractory hemorrhage, and refractoriness to medical therapy are indications for surgery in patients with ASUC. Infliximab and cyclosporine do not increase postoperative complications of colectomy and surgery should not be deferred based on this exposure. In patients failing to adequately respond to intravenous corticosteroids (IVCS) by 3 d or to infliximab induction, there are insufficient data to routinely recommend treatment with tofacitinib or upadacitinib. In patients with ASUC initiating infliximab, dose intensification should be considered for those with low serum albumin (< 2.5 g/dL).

3.12 Acute severe ulcerative colitis

Statement 15. We recommend that adult patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) (defined by the modified Truelove and Witts criteria as > 6 bloody stools per day and systemic toxicity with at least one of: temperature > 37.8°C, pulse > 90 bpm, haemoglobin < 105 g/L or C-reactive protein > 30 mg/L) or adolescents with a Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) score of 65 or more should be admitted to hospital for assessment and intensive management (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Between 15% and 25% of patients with UC will require hospitalisation for an acute severe flare of disease at some stage in the natural history of their disease, often as the index presentation. Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a potentially life-threatening condition, characterised by clinical and laboratory assessment using the modified Truelove and Witts criteriaor, in the case of adolescent patients, the Paediatric UC activity index. In current practice C-reactive protein is measured far more than ESR, and has the advantage of a less non-specific increase with age. A retrospective UK study (1950–2007) showed that the colectomy rate during first admission with ASUC was 19%, but after several admissions rose to 38.2%. In the biologics era, the colectomy rate after admission for ASUC in the CONSTRUCT trial was 23% during the inpatient stay, and in another study was 19% at 2 years.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^111ssH5W]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^115sThND]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Statement 5.3.2

An upper and lower GI endoscopy should be the initial diagnostic procedure for nearly all stable patients presenting with acute gastro-intestinal bleeding (QoE C).

Statement 5.3.3

Computed tomography angiography should be performed in patients with ongoing bleeding who are hemodynamically stable after resuscitation (QoE C).

Statement 5.3.4

Surgical treatment is recommended in patients with life-threatening bleeding and persistent hemodynamic instability and in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis non-responders to medical treatment presenting with massive colorectal hemorrhage (QoE B).

Statement 5.3.5

Significant recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding could be an indication for urgent surgery (QoE C).

Recommendations

We recommend performing immediate surgery in unstable patients presenting with hemorrhagic shock, and non responders to resuscitation. An intraoperative ileoscopy, if available, could be useful in localizing the bleeding source in patients with Crohn's disease. In patients presenting with acute severe ulcerative colitis and refractory hemorrhage, non-responders to medical treatment, the surgical treatment of choice is a subtotal colectomy with ileostomy, if skills are present (strong recommendation based on low-level evidence 1C).

We suggest evaluating hemodynamically stable IBD patients presenting a gastrointestinal bleeding at first with a sigmoidoscopy and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (weak recommendation based on low-level evidence 2C).

Summary of evidence and discussion

Gastrointestinal bleeding is a common complication in patients with UC or CD and is caused by inflammation/ulceration of the bowel. Usually, the bleeding resolves with medical treatment and rarely it requires an immediate surgical procedure.

Medical treatment includes patients with hemodynamic instability and/or suspected ongoing bleeding receiving intravenous fluid/blood product resuscitation with the goal of normalization of blood pressure and heart rate prior to endoscopic evaluation/intervention. Packed red blood cells should be transfused to maintain the hemoglobin above 7g/dL. A threshold of 9g/dL should be considered in patients with massive bleeding, significant comorbidities (especially cardiovascular ischemia) or possible delay in receiving therapeutic interventions.

Massive, life-threatening lower gastrointestinal bleeding is uncommon in patients with IBD and occurs in less than 6% of cases. Because of the low incidence of severe hemorrhage in IBD, a limited number of studies are available to guide management.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^1139UK2n]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence and discussion

According to the diagnostic criteria of Truelove and Witts for UC severity classification, acute severe colitis affects 5 to 15% of patients with UC and is characterized as colitis with bloody stool frequency ≥ 6/day and a tachycardia (> 90bpm), or temperature > 37.8°C, or anemia (hemoglobin 10.5g/dL), or an elevated ESR (> 30mm/h) (only one additional criterion in addition to the bloody stool frequency ≥ 6/day is needed to define a severe attack). Endoscopic criteria for severe colitis include a hemorrhagic mucosa with deep ulceration, mucosal detachment on the edge of these ulcerations and well-like ulceration, all of which can be assessed at flexible sigmoidoscopy.

There are some controversies regarding the indications for surgery in case of severe acute colitis, and the determination of the correct time for surgery is still a matter of debate. It is well known that the majority with severe acute colitis will respond to medical therapy: in 2007, Turner et al. conducted a systematic review including 32 clinical trials analyzing the response to steroid therapy in severe UC and found that the response rate to steroids is 66% and 34% of patients required colectomy within a short period of time. This study has some limitations, such as the time period of the included studies (1974–2006) and the wide heterogeneity among included cohorts of patients, but interestingly found a small reduction in colectomy rates in the studies that reassessed the need for colectomy after 2 weeks of medical therapy versus those who did it within 2 weeks. Furthermore, the introduction of biologic therapy opened new perspectives for salvage therapy in steroid-refractory patients and some studies demonstrated that up to 80% of patients with acute severe colitis resistant to steroid therapy could respond to biologic therapy, thus avoiding an emergent colectomy. Post-operative morbidity is higher after emergency surgery when compared with elective surgery, for both UC and CD, suggesting that the increased use of rescue therapy may contribute to reducing emergency surgical interventions and improve outcome. On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that both a delay in surgery and prolonged intravenous immunosuppressive therapy are associated with increased morbidity and mortality following subsequent surgery. Based on these results, it seems reasonable to suggest a tailored approach to the patient with acute severe colitis and an attempt at initial conservative management with bowel rest, parenteral nutrition, parenteral steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient must be monitored closely for any signs of progressive deterioration, such as worsening pain or tenderness, progressive leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia, or hypotension. For steroid refractory disease, surgical options or therapeutic alternatives for rescue therapy should be considered early (on or around day 3 of corticosteroid therapy) by a multidisciplinary team that includes both a surgeon and gastroenterologist.

### Current management of severe ulcerative colitis [^11644TjM]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Approximately 15% of patients with ulcerative colitis develop an acute attack of severe colitis, and 30% of these patients require colectomy. Severe ulcerative colitis is therefore considered a medical emergency, the management of which requires close collaboration between gastroenterologists and surgeons. The mortality rate for patients with severe ulcerative colitis is now < 1% in specialist centers, but it was high before intravenous steroid therapy and early surgery were introduced; indeed, mortality is still high in nonspecialized centers. As colectomy severely affects quality of life, therapy with intravenous ciclosporin and, more recently, infliximab has been introduced to try to avoid the need for surgery. Ciclosporin induces short-term remission, but the long-term benefit remains unsatisfactory as colectomy is often only delayed. A significant short-term reduction in the colectomy rate has, however, been observed after infliximab treatment. The use of infliximab versus ciclosporin in patients with severe ulcerative colitis remains to be defined. The timing of surgery remains a cardinal decision in the management of severe ulcerative colitis; increased morbidity resulting from prolonged ineffective medical treatment and, therefore, a delay in surgical treatment should be avoided.

AGA clinical practice guidelines — risk features and steroid use in mild–moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) note that certain disease features, even in patients who present initially with mild–moderate disease activity, may predict an aggressive disease course; these include age younger than 40 years at diagnosis, extensive disease, severe endoscopic activity (presence of deep ulcers), extra-intestinal manifestations, and elevated inflammatory markers. Clinicians should be aware of these high-risk features to identify patients who may benefit from more aggressive initial therapy or who might need more rapid intensification of therapy if symptoms are not adequately controlled. In addition, clinicians should avoid repeated courses of corticosteroids, even in those with mild–moderate disease, and consider escalation of therapy in patients who frequently need corticosteroids for disease control.

### Inpatient management of inflammatory bowel disease-related complications [^117W8A2M]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite advances in therapeutic options, a sizeable proportion of patients with inflammatory bowel disease require hospitalization or surgery during their lifetime. While current treatment guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease cover the spectrum of disease severity and behavior, management of acute complications of inflammatory bowel disease can present unique challenges that are not always addressed in these guidelines. In this review, the authors provide a comprehensive summary of the existing literature focused on management of patients hospitalized with complications of inflammatory bowel disease. Proposed management algorithms are provided to guide clinicians through common scenarios to determine the most appropriate interventions - escalation of medical therapies, non-surgical therapeutic interventions (drainage of intra-abdominal abscess or endoscopic balloon dilation) or surgery. Prevention of complications is proposed through a multi-disciplinary approach that involves surgeons, dieticians, radiologists, pathologists and infectious disease consultants.

### Tofacitinib in acute severe ulcerative colitis: review addressing seven key unmet needs [^1167GShz]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) represents a medical emergency within the spectrum of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is historically defined by the Truelove and Witts criteria — specifically, the presence of six or more bloody stools per day accompanied by systemic signs such as fever, tachycardia, or anemia. ASUC affects approximately 20% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) over their disease course and requires urgent hospitalization. It carries a significant colectomy risk — around 20% within 3 months of the first admission, rising to 30.2% by 12 months, and potentially reaching up to 85% in steroid non-responders without rescue therapy. Despite advances in management, the pooled mortality rate in ASUC remains at around 1% in patients treated with infliximab or ciclosporin salvage therapy. The economic burden is equally stark, with per-admission costs for UC ranging from approximately $5000 to $14,000 in Canada. Similar figures are reported globally; for instance, a 2023 study from Australia identified a median index admission cost of 7829 AUD (approximately $5200), with these costs being primarily driven by the length of stay and need for colectomy. Current guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) advocate a stepwise approach: intravenous (IV) steroids as first line, followed by infliximab or ciclosporin for non-responders. Although overall colectomy rates for UC have seen some reduction in recent decades, rates for acute severe cases remain persistently high, highlighting an ongoing need for therapies that effectively halt disease progression and prevent surgery.

### Strategies for the care of adults hospitalized for active ulcerative colitis [^117WahpB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon; as many as 25% of patients with this disease require hospitalization. The goals of hospitalization are to assess disease severity, exclude infection, administer rapidly acting and highly effective medication regimens, and determine response. During hospitalization, patients should be given venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and monitored for the development of toxic megacolon. Patients who do not respond to intravenous corticosteroids should be considered for rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine. Patients who are refractory to medical therapies or who develop toxic megacolon should be evaluated promptly for colectomy. Patients who do respond to medical therapies should be discharged on an appropriate maintenance regimen when they meet discharge criteria. We review practical evidence-based management principles and propose a day-by-day algorithm for managing patients hospitalized for ulcerative colitis.

### Ambulatory care management of 69 patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis in comparison to 695 inpatients: insights from a multicentre UK cohort study [^116ePQ5v]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Approximately 1 in 10 patients diagnosed with ASUC are managed using an ambulatory pathway: for the majority this entails initial inpatient and then subsequent outpatient intravenous medical therapies; for a smaller number of patients treatment was successfully delivered entirely in the ambulatory setting. Although underpowered for our primary outcome, we report no difference in the requirement for colectomy among ASUC patients treated along ambulatory as compared with traditional inpatient pathways. Furthermore, 3 months after the index ASUC presentation, rehospitalisation for further flare and colectomy rates were not different. Although patients receiving ambulatory care from presentation were younger, we found no other differences in either baseline disease characteristics or biomarkers of ASUC severity.

Twenty-two out of sixty participating UK hospitals used an ambulatory pathway for one or more patients in the last 2 years. While COVID-19 related constraints on IBD services and concerns regarding nosocomial infection in immunosuppressed patients may have catalysed the use of ambulatory pathways, notably, 12 UK centres had already adopted this practice prior to outbreak of the pandemic.

The 2020 British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) expert-based RAND panel guidelines for the management of ASUC during the COVID-19 pandemic specifically state that outpatient management with daily intravenous methylprednisolone is inappropriate, regardless of SARS-CoV-2 status. Clinicians may be concerned that ambulant pathways hinder close observation, reduce the effectiveness of therapies and risk delays to treatment escalation. We are concerned that stool culture and urgent flexible sigmoidoscopy were less frequently performed in the cohort treated as ambulatory from the point of diagnosis — these remain key investigations for the treatment of ASUC. However, other key standards including stool frequency clinical assessment, blood monitoring and IBD MDT discussion remained comparable in ambulatory and inpatient pathways, and there was no delay in escalation of treatment or time to surgery. Both methylprednisolone at doses of 1–1.5 mg/kg (maximum 60 mg/day) and hydrocortisone 100 mg four times daily can be used in adult patients with ASUC with equal response rates. In our study, physicians utilised methylprednisolone more in the ambulatory setting compared with the inpatient setting which likely reflects that methylprednisolone is a once-a-day medication compared with four times a day with hydrocortisone. Our rates for steroid response, rescue therapy and colectomy are all in line with published literature.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^112Di3KC]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the imperative for early initiation of therapy emerges as a pivotal strategy in optimizing UC management, facilitated by prompt diagnosis. Regrettably, many patients with UC face diagnostic delays postsymptom onset, posing a risk for adverse outcomes and significant bowel damage in IBD. Clinical evidence consistently underscores the superior response rates to drugs in patients with shorter disease duration. Thus, raising awareness of UC symptoms in primary care settings is crucial to ensure timely access to specialized care and appropriate treatment. Early disease identification enables patients to commence suitable medications promptly, with studies consistently linking timely access to immunosuppressants or biologics to improved outcomes.

Moreover, the expanding array of new therapeutic agents presents a challenge in selecting the most suitable drug for UC management. With numerous therapeutic options available for mild-to-moderate as well as moderate-to-severe forms of UC, choosing the right agent for each patient has become increasingly complex and personalized. The T2T strategy offers guidance in identifying the optimal treatment solution for individual patients in a tailored manner. Additionally, proper patient profiling is essential, involving the assessment of patient risk stratification and prognostication. Validated prognostic and predictive tools, such as biomarkers, have the potential to enable personalized therapy and facilitate the targeted use of treatments. This approach ensures that patients at lower risk receive less intensive medical therapy, while those at higher risk of disease progression are treated with more intensive strategies. However, a significant challenge lies in the time required to develop, validate, and commercialize biomarkers, highlighting the need for ongoing research and innovation in this area.

### Do we know how to use corticosteroids in acute severe ulcerative colitis? [^113BG8NG]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Options for the treatment of acute severe ulcerative colitis have broadened with the use of ciclosporin and infliximab, but corticosteroids remain first-line treatment. However, an optimum regimen for drug, dose and duration has not been established in the 57years since Truelove and Witts first reported their value. In the absence of evidenced-based guidance this study sought to discover how gastroenterology units in the UK manage patients with acute severe colitis. In January 2010 a questionnaire was sent to all members of the inflammatory bowel disease section of the British Society of Gastroenterology enquiring about their use of corticosteroids in a typical patient with acute severe colitis. One hundred and two responses were obtained, representing more than 50% of the UK gastroenterology units. No consensus, and a wide variation in practice was found between these units. Over 70% of responders initially treat patients with intravenous hydrocortisone (400mg/day), although some units prefer methylprednisolone and dexamethasone. On transfer to oral treatment, all units use prednisolone, most starting with 40mg/day. There are no agreed national or international guidelines on the reducing regimen or duration of oral treatment-the area of greatest variation in our survey. Most units reduce prednisolone by 5mg/week, but because of variations in the timing and magnitude of dose reduction, total exposure to prednisolone varies by 2.6-fold. To minimise harm from undertreatment or overtreatment of acute severe colitis a controlled study of prednisolone dose and duration is needed.

Implications and concluding remarks

By combining clinical expertise from the BSG CRG and IBD Section Committee in conjunction with other medical and surgical IBD and COVID-19 experts, we have provided guidance to clinicians regarding the appropriate management of ASUC during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting where current BSG guidance may need adaptation. Population-based studies are needed to clarify the risks and benefits of interventions used in the management of ASUC during the pandemic. Until then, we consider the results of the panel, which largely support following the well-established and evidence-based BSG guideline, will help guide clinicians in this challenging and evolving area.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^114Yxu3v]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that seems to be rising in incidence and prevalence throughout the world. These guidelines were developed to indicate the preferred approach to the management of adult patients with ulcerative colitis as established by valid scientific research and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee. The scientific evidence for the recommendations made in these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process, assessing the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) and assigning a strength of recommendation based on its apparent clinical benefit (strong or conditional). In instances where the available evidence was not appropriate for a formal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, statements were developed using expert consensus (termed key concept statements). These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable to practitioners regardless of specialty or interest and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios. As opposed to standards of care, guidelines are inherently flexible, and physicians should use them as tools in choosing the best course in a specific clinical situation. These guidelines represent the state of the evidence at the time of this publication. As new evidence emerges, these guidelines will be continuously reviewed, and updates will be published as needed to assure continued validity.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^113Ueo4a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis — Recommendations for hospitalized management state: In patients with acute severe UC (ASUC), we recommend testing for CDI (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with ASUC, we recommend pharmacologic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as compared with no prophylaxis to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). We recommend against routine use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the management of ASUC (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest against total parenteral nutrition for the purpose of bowel rest in ASUC (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with ASUC, we recommend a total dose of 60 mg/d of methylprednisolone or hydrocortisone 100 mg 3 or 4 times per day to induce remission (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with ASUC failing to adequately respond to intravenous corticosteroids (IVCS) by 3 days, we recommend medical rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with ASUC who achieve remission with infliximab treatment, we recommend maintenance of remission with the same agent (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with ASUC who achieve remission with cyclosporine treatment, we suggest maintenance of remission with thiopurines (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with ASUC who achieve remission with cyclosporine treatment, we suggest maintenance of remission with vedolizumab (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Ambulatory care management of 69 patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis in comparison to 695 inpatients: insights from a multicentre UK cohort study [^116RyJyX]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Initial assessment

Patients who received ambulatory care from ASUC diagnosis were less likely to have a stool culture sent (64% (9/14) vs 80% (43/54) vs 93% (631/679), respectively, p = 0.0005) or undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy (47% (7/15) vs 85% (45/53) vs 77% (532/68), respectively, p = 0.011) compared with patients who were discharged to ambulatory pathways or those patients receiving traditional inpatient care (table 2). Regarding other standards of ASUC assessment, the proportion of patients who underwent close monitoring of stool frequency and blood tests, timing of emergency flexible sigmoidoscopy and case discussion at IBD multidisciplinary meeting (MDT) were similar among the three groups.

Table 2
Assessment of ASUC

Outcomes

The proportion of patients requiring colectomy during index ASUC management period was no different among all three treatment pathways: inpatient = 15.0% (104/695) vs ambulatory from diagnosis = 13.3% (2/15) vs discharged to ambulatory = 13.0% (7/54), p = 0.87 (table 3). Additionally, response to intravenous corticosteroids, time to and rate of rescue or primary induction treatment (figure 3A), time to colectomy (figure 3B), mortality and duration of inpatient treatment were similar in the three groups (table 3). Patients treated as ambulatory from ASUC diagnosis were more likely to receive intravenous methylprednisolone rather than intravenous hydrocortisone than either patients discharged to ambulatory pathways or the inpatient cohort (p = 0.0005). Eighteen (2.6% (18/690)) of the inpatients but none of ambulatory cohort went straight to biologic rescue/induction without first receiving intravenous corticosteroids. Although not significant, there was a trend towards patients treated as ambulatory from diagnosis being more likely to receive rescue or primary induction treatment and yet they were less likely to respond to these therapies as compared with other treatment pathways.

### Conventional medical management of inflammatory bowel disease [^115VThLe]. Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Conventional therapies for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents. A time-structured approach is required for appropriate management. Traditional step-up therapy has been partly replaced during the last decade by potent drugs and top-down therapies, with an accelerated step-up approach being the most appropriate in the majority of patients. When patients are diagnosed with CD or ulcerative colitis, physicians should consider the probable pattern of disease progression so that effective therapy is not delayed. This can be achieved by setting arbitrary time limits for administration of biological therapies, changing therapy from mesalamine in patients with active ulcerative colitis, or using rescue therapy for acute severe colitis. In this review, we provide algorithms with a time-structured approach for guidance of therapy. Common mistakes in conventional therapy include overprescription of mesalamine for CD; inappropriate use of steroids (for perianal CD, when there is sepsis, or for maintenance); delayed introduction or underdosing with azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate; and failure to consider timely surgery. The paradox of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy is that although it too is used inappropriately (when patients have sepsis or fibrostenotic strictures) or too frequently (for diseases that would respond to less-potent therapy), it is also often introduced too late in disease progression. Conventional drugs are the mainstay of current therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases, but drug type, timing, and context must be optimized to manage individual patients effectively.

### Recent advances in clinical practice: management of inflammatory bowel disease during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116VBpAh]. Gut (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with a new presentation of acute severe UC

Managing patients with a new diagnosis of acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) was of particular concern, given the severity of illness, degree of immunosuppression that may be required, and risk of developing COVID-19 in hospitals. Two UK-based RAND appropriateness panels support existing recommendations, particularly the initiation of corticosteroid treatment, escalation to infliximab and timely surgical intervention, irrespective of COVID-19 status, in both childrenand adultswith IBD.

In the PROTECT-ASUC study, a UK-wide case–control study across 60 acute secondary care hospitals, recruiting 782 patients with ASUC (398 during COVID-19 pandemic and 384 historical controls), more patients received rescue therapy or surgery during the pandemic than in the historical cohort (55% vs 42%, p < 0.001), with a shorter time to rescue therapy during the pandemic. This difference was driven by a greater use of rescue and primary induction therapies with biologics, ciclosporin or tofacitinib in the pandemic than in the historical cohort; colectomy rates were similar across both groups. Although there was an increased use of outpatient-based pathways for initial administration of intravenous steroids during the pandemic, compared with historical controls, most patients were still managed as an inpatient. Although number of cases were small, rates of colectomy were comparable among individuals treated as inpatients and the two cohorts managed as outpatients. Results from these studies suggest that healthcare providers should continue to adapt hospital-based treatment pathways to improve care of patients with newly diagnosed IBD while limiting their risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Treatment of hospitalized adult patients with severe ulcerative colitis: toronto consensus statements [^112YZdm8]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to provide updated explicit and relevant consensus statements for clinicians to refer to when managing hospitalized adult patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis (UC).

Methods

The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology consensus group of 23 voting participants developed a series of recommendation statements that addressed pertinent clinical questions. An iterative voting and feedback process was used to do this in conjunction with systematic literature reviews. These statements were brought to a formal consensus meeting held in Toronto, Ontario (March 2010), when each statement was discussed, reformulated, voted upon, and subsequently revised until group consensus (at least 80% agreement) was obtained. The modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria were used to rate the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Results

As a result of the iterative process, consensus was reached on 21 statements addressing four themes (General considerations and nutritional issues, Steroid use and predictors of steroid failure, Cyclosporine and infliximab, and Surgical issues).

Conclusions

Key recommendations for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe UC include early escalation to second-line medical therapy with either infliximab or cyclosporine in individuals in whom parenteral steroids have failed after 72h. These agents should be used in experienced centers where appropriate support is available. Sequential therapy with cyclosporine and infliximab is not recommended. Surgery is an option when first-line steroid therapy fails, and is indicated when second-line medical therapy fails and/or when complications arise during the hospitalization.

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) — infliximab dosing strategy in hospitalized adults: the guideline panel makes no recommendation regarding routine use of intensive vs standard infliximab dosing in adult patients hospitalized with ASUC refractory to intravenous corticosteroids. There were no RCTs and five observational studies comparing infliximab regimens; on meta-analysis there was no significant difference in the short-term risk of colectomy in intensive vs standard infliximab dosing regimens (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.74–3.52). In 2 studies, upfront induction with higher-dose infliximab (10 mg/kg) was superior to dose stacking with standard doses (5 mg/kg), with lower risk of colectomy (RR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.08–0.68), but overall, quality of evidence was rated as very low quality due to serious risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 2: acute severe colitis-an evidence-based consensus guideline from the European Crohn's and colitis organization and the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^115MWrA5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Acute severe colitis (ASC) is one of the few emergencies in pediatric gastroenterology. Tight monitoring and timely medical and surgical interventions may improve outcomes and minimize morbidity and mortality. We aimed to standardize daily treatment of ASC in children through detailed recommendations and practice points which are based on a systematic review of the literature and consensus of experts.

Methods

These guidelines are a joint effort of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) and the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). Fifteen predefined questions were addressed by working subgroups. An iterative consensus process, including 2 face-to-face meetings, was followed by voting of the national representatives of ECCO and all members of the Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Porto group of ESPGHAN (43 voting experts).

Results

A total of 24 recommendations and 43 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 91% regarding diagnosis, monitoring, and management of ASC in children. A summary flowchart is presented based on daily scoring of the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index. Several topics have been altered since the previous 2011 guidelines and from those published in adults.

Discussion

These guidelines standardize the management of ASC in children in an attempt to optimize outcomes of this intensive clinical scenario.

### Ambulatory care management of 69 patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis in comparison to 695 inpatients: insights from a multicentre UK cohort study [^1123hnB9]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Data collection

We used baseline clinical information including demographics (age, gender, ethnicity, body mass index, comorbidities and smoking status), disease characteristics (disease duration and disease extent) as well as disease severity markers (C reactive protein (CRP), albumin, haemoglobin, lymphocytes and faecal calprotectin). Following diagnosis of ASUC, details of corticosteroid therapy including preparation, dose, duration, clinical setting where instituted and continued (ambulatory outpatient care or inpatient), need for rescue or primary induction therapy, and emergency colectomy during index admission were used. Follow-up data at 3 months from index ASUC event included subsequent UC flare, subsequent need for hospital readmission for UC flare and subsequent need for colectomy. The day of initial admission was marked as day 1, or in the case of patients managed entirely in the ambulatory setting, the earlier of first day intravenous corticosteroids or rescue therapy.

All clinical data were collected pseudoanonymised and entered into a secure central REDCap (Research Electonic Data Capture) server hosted at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, UK.

Outcomes of interest

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with ASUC requiring colectomy during the index ASUC management period. Secondary outcome measures included need and time to rescue therapy (including primary induction), time to colectomy, total number of days spent in hospital as inpatient (excluding purely ambulatory patients never admitted to hospital), mortality and 3-month follow-up data including: proportion of patients with a further UC flare; proportion of patients readmitted to hospital with UC flare and primary colectomy rates.

### In-hospital management of inflammatory bowel disease [^115sSnvE]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The management of hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex. Despite considerable therapeutic advancements in outpatient ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease management, the in-hospital management continues to lag with suboptimal outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief overview of our approach to managing patients hospitalized with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) and Crohn's disease-related complications, followed by a summary of emerging evidence for new management approaches.

Recent Findings

ASUC has seen the emergence of well validated prognostic models for colectomy as well as the development of novel treatment strategies such as accelerated infliximab dosing, Janus kinase inhibitor therapy, and sequential therapy, yet the rate of colectomy for steroid-refractory ASUC has not meaningfully improved. Crohn's disease has seen the development of better diagnostic tools, early Crohn's disease-related complication stratification and identification, as well as better surgical techniques, yet the rates of hospitalization and development of Crohn's disease-related complications remain high.

Summary

Significant progress has been made in the in-hospital IBD management; however, both the management of ASUC and hospitalized Crohn's disease remain a challenge with suboptimal outcomes. Critical knowledge gaps still exist, and dedicated studies in hospitalized patients with IBD are needed to address them.

### Ischaemic colitis: practical challenges and evidence-based recommendations for management [^116ZhJEZ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ischaemic colitis (IC) is a common condition with rising incidence, and in severe cases a high mortality rate. Its presentation, severity and disease behaviour can vary widely, and there exists significant heterogeneity in treatment strategies and resultant outcomes. In this article we explore practical challenges in the management of IC, and where available make evidence-based recommendations for its management based on a comprehensive review of available literature. An optimal approach to initial management requires early recognition of the diagnosis followed by prompt and appropriate investigation. Ideally, this should involve the input of both gastroenterology and surgery. CT with intravenous contrast is the imaging modality of choice. It can support clinical diagnosis, define the severity and distribution of ischaemia, and has prognostic value. In all but fulminant cases, this should be followed (within 48hours) by lower gastrointestinal endoscopy to reach the distal-most extent of the disease, providing endoscopic (and histological) confirmation. The mainstay of medical management is conservative/supportive treatment, with bowel rest, fluid resuscitation and antibiotics. Specific laboratory, radiological and endoscopic features are recognised to correlate with more severe disease, higher rates of surgical intervention and ultimately worse outcomes. These factors should be carefully considered when deciding on the need for and timing of surgical intervention.

Conclusions and recommendations for further studies

This is the largest study of ambulatory ASUC treatment to date. We capture an emerging UK practice which challenges conventional treatment paradigms and current BSG expert guidance. We recommend that patients managed in the ambulatory setting are reviewed by gastroenterologists daily to monitor clinical parameters and assess for potential complications including venous thromboembolism and biochemical disturbance. We urge collaboration among UK centres and suggest establishing a prospective pragmatic non-inferiority study comparing colectomy rates in patients randomised to either ambulatory or inpatient treatment from the point of ASUC diagnosis. This study will explore both the clinical and cost effectiveness of ambulatory care as well as the patient and physician acceptability. These data may enable risk assessment and identification of patients based on baseline parameters suitable for ambulatory ASUC care; either entirely in an ambulatory setting, or where discharge can be expedited, with safe transfer of management to an ambulatory unit. Ambulatory ASUC care represents an ambitious target for transformational care within the IBD management.

### Adaptations to the British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of acute severe UC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: a RAND appropriateness panel [^115yijh8]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Of concern to most clinicians caring for patients with IBD is the possible risk of the drugs used to manage ASUC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Intravenous corticosteroids remain the most widely used induction therapy in ASUC, but it is uncertain how they may influence outcome in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. Corticosteroids are known to increase the risk of sepsis and respiratory tract infections and may also increase viral replication and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. There is also evidence that steroids may increase morbidity and/or mortality from some respiratory viruses such as influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome and SARS-CoV, although steroids have an established role in the management of ARDS. Beyond corticosteroids, immunomodulators such as thiopurines, biologics and tofacitinib are frequently used at various stages of the management of ASUC and there is also a lack of data regarding their safety in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Finally, it is important to consider the possible effects of drugs used to manage COVID-19 on IBD. For example, interleukin 6 inhibitors are being tested in patients with COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04315298) but have been associated with intestinal perforation in IBD.

We used an established methodology, a RAND appropriateness panel, to produce guidance in this challenging clinical area. Regarding initial management, there was agreement that all patients with ASUC should be managed as inpatients. Ambulatory care was considered inappropriate, since patients with ASUC need regular monitoring and involvement of a multidisciplinary team, this type of complex care being difficult to deliver in the outpatient setting. While there was some support for ambulatory management to avoid patients being admitted, thereby decreasing the risk of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, the risks of managing ASUC as an outpatient were considered to outweigh this possible benefit. Furthermore, in scenarios in which patients had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, no such benefit existed. Nevertheless, in view of the acknowledged risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital, it is perhaps unsurprising that the panel considered it appropriate to isolate patients with ASUC in a side room wherever possible.

Introduction

Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) traditionally requires inpatient hospital management for intravenous therapies and/or colectomy. Ambulatory ASUC care has not yet been evaluated in large cohorts.

Aims

We used data from PROTECT, a UK multicentre observational COVID-19 inflammatory bowel disease study, to report the extent, safety and effectiveness of ASUC ambulatory pathways.

Methods

Adults (≥ 18 years old) meeting Truelove and Witts criteria between 1 January 2019–1 June 2019 and 1 March 2020–30 June 2020 were recruited to PROTECT. We used demographic, disease phenotype, treatment outcomes and 3-month follow-up data. Primary outcome was rate of colectomy during the index ASUC episode. Secondary outcomes included corticosteroid response, time to and rate of rescue or primary induction therapy, response to rescue or primary induction therapy, time to colectomy, mortality, duration of inpatient treatment and hospital readmission and colectomy within 3 months of index flare. We compared outcomes in three cohorts: (1) patients treated entirely in inpatient setting; ambulatory patients subdivided into; (2) patients managed as ambulatory from diagnosis and (3) patients hospitalised and subsequently discharged to ambulatory care for continued intravenous steroids.

Results

37% (22/60) participating hospitals used ambulatory pathways. Of 764 eligible patients, 695 (91%) patients received entirely inpatient care, 15 (2%) patients were managed as ambulatory from diagnosis and 54 (7%) patients were discharged to ambulatory pathways. Aside from younger age in patients treated as ambulatory from diagnosis, no significant differences in disease or patient phenotype were observed. The rate of colectomy (15.0% (104/695) vs 13.3% (2/15) vs 13.0% (7/54), respectively, p = 0.96) and secondary outcomes were similar among all three cohorts. Stool culture and flexible sigmoidoscopy were less frequently performed in ambulatory cohorts. Forty per cent of patients treated as ambulatory from diagnosis required subsequent hospital admission.

Conclusions

In a post hoc analysis of one of the largest ASUC cohorts collected to date, we report an emerging UK ambulatory practice which challenges treatment paradigms. However, our analysis remains underpowered to detect key outcome measures and further studies exploring clinical and cost-effectiveness as well as patient and physician acceptability are needed.

Results

Of 822 patients recruited, we excluded 58 patients (1 coexisting COVID-19 infection, 6 fell outside study date periods, 19 did not receive any intravenous corticosteroid or rescue therapy, 26 with infective diarrhoea and 6 had missing data for primary outcome measure — colectomy) and report the outcomes in 764 patients divided into three groups: patients managed as inpatients for the entirety of their ASUC episode (n = 695), and an ambulatory cohort of seventy patients who are subdivided into patients managed as ambulatory from diagnosis (n = 15), and patients managed initially as inpatients but subsequently discharged to ambulatory pathways (n = 54) (figure 2). Of the 15 patients managed as ambulatory pathway from the point of diagnosis, 40% (6/15) were subsequently admitted to hospital; thus, 60% (9/15) patients received entirely ambulatory ASUC treatment. Inpatient ASUC cases were recruited from all 60 participating UK sites, whereas ambulatory patients were recruited from 22 centres (7 centres in prepandemic only, 10 centres in pandemic only and 5 centres in both eras) (online supplemental table 1).

Baseline characteristics

Inpatients, patients who were ambulatory from diagnosis and patients discharged to ambulatory pathways were well matched for gender, comorbidities, body mass index, IBD phenotype, years since IBD diagnosis and day 1 biomarkers (table 1). Ambulatory patients from diagnosis were younger (median age 30 years old (IQR 22–39) vs 37 years old (IQR 26–53) vs 45 years old (IQR 33–59), respectively, p = 0.02) than those managed as inpatients or discharged to ambulatory pathways.

### Cyclosporin therapy in severe ulcerative colitis: is it worth the effort? [^114FbfMd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cyclosporin is advocated in the treatment of acute severe ulcerative colitis that has failed to respond to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. This approach is controversial, with critics highlighting the temporary nature of remissions and the potential for adverse effects. There have been few reports of the long-term outcome of those patients who do respond. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical outcome of all patients treated with cyclosporin at our institution over the past five years.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 46 patients who presented to a tertiary referral center. Initial responders were those who avoided colectomy; a sustained response was defined as a remission that lasted while the patient was taking oral cyclosporin and for three months after this therapy was discontinued.

Results

Thirty-two (69 percent) of 46 patients had an initial response to therapy, and 50 percent met criteria for a sustained response. Eleven of 23 sustained responders subsequently relapsed. At a mean of 22 months' follow-up, 26 percent of patients remain well and have never relapsed. Serious infective complications occurred in two patients, possibly attributable to therapy. No factors predictive of a likely response were identifiable on retrospective analysis.

Conclusions

This study confirms the efficacy of cyclosporin in the management of severe ulcerative colitis. Although many initial responders subsequently relapse, such patients may benefit from having even a short time to adjust to the need for surgery. A substantial minority (26 percent) of all patients treated remain in long-term remission.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^116ytvi8]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) interpretation — For patients: Strong recommendation states, Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, whereas conditional recommendation states, The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not. For clinicians: Strong recommendation notes, Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences, while conditional recommendation states, Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with their values and preferences. Use shared decision making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences. For policy makers: Strong recommendation indicates, The recommendation can be adapted as policy or performance measure in most situations, and conditional recommendation notes, Policy making will involve various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision making is appropriate.

### Ulcerative colitis care pathway [^111KtEP5]. Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis care pathway — make diagnosis and assess inflammatory status and assess comorbidities and disease- and therapy-related complications, followed by stratify according to colectomy risk. Management branches include inductive and maintenance therapy (low-risk); for higher-risk cases, identify patient requiring hospitalization, with inductive and maintenance therapy (high-risk, outpatient) and subsequent therapy for high-risk outpatient not in remission, or inductive and maintenance therapy (high-risk, inpatient).

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^113j97zC]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Guideline scope and outcomes — this guideline addresses adult outpatients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) and hospitalized adults with ASUC, focusing on "immunomodulators, biologics, and small molecules for induction and maintenance of remission", and notes that "in general, most drugs that are initiated for induction of remission are continued as maintenance therapy, if they are effective", which "is considered standard of care" with the assumption effective drugs "will be continued for maintenance of remission". It states "this guideline does not address surgical management of moderate to severe UC or ASUC", and for ASUC evidence profiles include "short-term colectomy risk (within 3 months of hospitalization)". Effect estimates "are presented as the risk for failure to induce or maintain remission, that is, a relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) < 1 suggests that the drug under consideration is more effective than the comparison drug or placebo for induction or maintenance of remission".

### Successful initial tofacitinib treatment for acute severe ulcerative colitis with steroid resistance: a case series [^112sdS5C]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Only 1% of ulcerative colitis (UC) cases are acute severe UC (ASUC)
The standard therapy for ASUC is intravenous corticosteroids; however, 30% of UC patients will not recover with corticosteroids alone
Infliximab and calcineurin inhibitors have been reported as possible treatments for ASUC, but they have a long half-life and require more time before their efficacy can be judged
Tofacitinib directly inhibits signaling of an important subset of proinflammatory cytokines

What the new findings are:

Tofacitinib is one of the possible first-line treatments for ASUC with steroid resistance
All but one of our patients was able to avoid total colectomy in this case series
The very short half-life of tofacitinib is beneficial, because a response can be observed only 3–5 days after its administration in a real clinical case series
A high rate of clinical remission can be achieved without severe adverse events, and colectomy can be avoided, by initial administration of high-dose tofacitinib

### Management of acute severe colitis in children with ulcerative colitis in the biologics era [^116BDiU8]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Approximately one-third of children with ulcerative colitis will experience at least 1 attack of acute severe colitis (ASC) before 15 years of age. Severe disease can be defined in children when Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index is > 65 and/or ≥ 6 bloody stools per day, and/or 1 of the following: tachycardia, fever, anemia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate with or without systemic toxicity. Our aim was to provide practical suggestions on the management of ASC in children. The goal of medical therapy is to avoid colectomy while preventing complications of disease, side effects of medications, and mortality.

Methods

A systematic search was carried out through Medline via PubMed to identify all articles published in English to date, based on the following keywords "ulcerative colitis", "pediatric ulcerative colitis", "biological therapy", and "acute severe colitis". Multidisciplinary clinical evaluation is recommended to identify early nonresponders to conventional treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, and to start, if indicated, second-line therapy or "rescue therapy", such as calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) and anti-tumor necrosis factor molecules (infliximab).

Results

Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index is a valid predictive tool that can guide clinicians in evaluating response to therapy. Surgery should be considered in the case of complications or rapid clinical deterioration during medical treatment.

Conclusions

Several pitfalls may be present in the management of ASC, and a correct clinical and therapeutic approach is recommended to reduce surgical risk.

### Positioning biologics and small molecules in the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^1116NRQs]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review addresses the selection of biologic and small molecule therapy for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC). With several new treatment options approved within the past few years, an update in positioning is timely and relevant.

Recent Findings

Updates on the safety and comparative efficacy of approved therapeutic agents for UC are presented. Newly approved therapies including tofacitinib and ustekinumab, as well as where to position these treatments are discussed. Data on the first-ever head-to-head trial of biologic therapy in UC are examined. This review provides an evidence-based overview of the optimal management strategies of patients in both the inpatient and outpatient settings.

Summary

As we move closer towards the goal of personalized therapy for our patients with UC, we hope to better select appropriate and effective treatment options. Newly approved therapies provide us with additional options for management. Future advancements in predictive serologic, mucosal, genetic, and fecal markers can enable us to tailor therapy to an individual patient.

### Management of inflammatory bowel disease… [^112ZVxWP]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

General Principals of Management Endoscopic and radiologic studies are used to diagnose the particular disorder and to determine the extent of the disease. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the patient and the physician work together to establish realistic treatment goals. Therapy is then individualized to meet these goals. 16, 17. The newer 5-ASA agents are the drugs of choice in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who are allergic to sulfa. Side effects associated with the 5-ASA agents include interstitial nephritis, pleuropericarditis, leukopenia and pancreatitis. Fortunately, these side effects are quite rare. Corticosteroids Systemic Corticosteroids For the past 30 years, corticosteroids have been the mainstay of therapy in patients with moderate to severe active inflammatory bowel disease. 25 Initial treatment is prednisone, 40 to 60 mg per day.

In severely ill hospitalized patients, reasonable initial therapy is hydrocortisone, 100 mg administered intravenously every eight hours. Intravenous therapy generally produces rapid improvement of symptoms, with maximal benefit occurring when the corticosteroid has been administered for six to eight days. Before immunosuppressant therapy is initiated, side effects and other treatment alternatives should be discussed with the patient. Then it is best to set a definable goal, such as closure of a fistula or tapering from corticosteroids, and a minimum three-month time frame for reaching that goal. The use of immunosuppressant drug therapy requires close communication between patient and physician. It is prudent to obtain a baseline chest radiograph and to monitor complete blood count, liver function and renal function every two weeks until the patient is receiving oral therapy, and every one to three months thereafter.

Before methotrexate therapy is initiated, the risks of treatment and the possible need for a liver biopsy should be discussed with the patient. 36 In such patients, intravenously administered cyclosporine is highly effective for rapid disease control, and it may allow patients to avoid surgery. However, by one year, 70 to 80 percent of these patients may still require surgery. 37 Thus, in many patients, the role of cyclosporine is to change a risky emergency operation into a less urgent procedure. Cancer Screening Ulcerative colitis is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. An epidemiologic study.

### Acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: evaluation and management… [^117QKy8h]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

INPATIENT EVALUATION Patients with risk factors for moderate to severe bleeding should undergo further evaluation and may require hospital admission. Management OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT Most cases of lower GI bleeding are self-limited and can be managed in an outpatient capacity. 28 Internal hemorrhoids grades I to III are amenable to in-office procedures with banding or infrared photocoagulation. Fiber supplementation alone decreases bleeding by 50%. 15 Banding has greater long-term success rates than infrared photocoagulation, but the latter confers greater pain improvement. Symptomatic grade III or grade IV hemorrhoids likely will require hemorrhoidectomy by a general surgeon.
15.

INPATIENT MANAGEMENT Patients who are hemodynamically unstable require immediate resuscitation. Initial management should include continuous monitoring, placement of two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters, and intravenous fluid administration. Critically ill patients can receive normal saline or balanced crystalloids; a recent meta-analysis demonstrated no difference in mortality, acute kidney injury, or need for renal replacement therapy. 8 Resuscitation goals include a heart rate less than 100 bpm and a SBP consistently higher than 115 mm Hg. 2, 9 Blood transfusions should be performed to maintain the hemoglobin level above 7 g per dL in nonacutely or minimally bleeding patients.

In contrast, blood transfusions should be initiated in patients with a large quantity of active bleeding and inadequate vital sign response to intravenous fluid replacement when the hemoglobin level drops below 9 g per dL. Special Considerations Percutaneous catheter embolization should be considered for patients who are high-risk surgical candidates, do not respond to hemodynamic resuscitation, and are unable to tolerate bowel preparation for urgent colonoscopy. Success rates for this procedure have been reported as high as 80% to 90%. After a patient has experienced a lower GI bleed, a multidisciplinary team approach, including input from specialists involved in the patient's care, is recommended to minimize the risk of recurrent bleeding and maximize treatment of comorbidites.
