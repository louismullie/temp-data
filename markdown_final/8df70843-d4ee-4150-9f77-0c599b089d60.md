## Question

What does a negative ANCA screen with reflex mean?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "negative ANCA screen with reflex" means on a lab report. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes an "ANCA screen" today and how labs structure reflex algorithms. Then, I should verify how to interpret a "negative" screen when reflex testing is ordered but not triggered. Next, I will assess the diagnostic implications and limitations of a negative result in the context of pre-test probability. After that, I should review current guideline recommendations for testing and confirmation, including when to biopsy. Finally, I will synthesize practical next steps and documentation language that align with evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm what an "ANCA screen" typically means now, because older and newer workflows differ. Historically, screening used indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) to detect c-ANCA or p-ANCA patterns, followed by antigen-specific assays for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA if positive, but current international and European recommendations support using high-quality antigen-specific immunoassays (PR3 and MPO) as the primary screen without the categorical need for IIF, which materially affects how a "screen" result should be read today [^111vG1Pn] [^112FoNkn].

> Wait, let me verify the "reflex" concept in this context, since reflex pathways can vary by lab. In laboratory medicine, reflex testing means a predefined automatic follow-up test occurs when a specific trigger is met, such as syphilis algorithms that reflex to a quantitative non-treponemal test after a positive treponemal screen, or HCV programs that reflex to RNA after a positive antibody, both intended to reduce care gaps and improve diagnostic completion rates [^111mVdU3] [^117MX4YD]. For ANCA, the traditional reflex has been positive IIF pattern leading to automatic PR3/MPO antigen-specific testing, though many labs now start directly with PR3/MPO immunoassays per updated consensus and EULAR guidance [^111K4rK5] [^111vG1Pn].

> Hold on, I should verify what "negative ANCA screen with reflex" actually reports. In practice, this usually means the initial screen — often a PR3/MPO antigen-specific immunoassay under current best practice — did not detect PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA, so the reflex pathway was not triggered and no additional testing was performed; if a lab still uses IIF-first, it means the IIF screen was negative and therefore no antigen-specific confirmatory assay was reflexed, but many centers have moved to immunoassay-first per 2017 international consensus and 2024 EULAR recommendations [^111K4rK5] [^111vG1Pn].

> I need to consider the clinical meaning of a negative screen carefully and not over-interpret it. A negative ANCA reduces the probability of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) but does not exclude it, as up to about 10% of patients with small vessel vasculitis can be clinically ANCA-negative, and the negative predictive value depends strongly on pre-test probability, so in high-suspicion scenarios (for example pulmonary–renal syndrome or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage), a negative screen must not delay urgent referral or biopsy when indicated [^114MJxFX] [^116fTe6y].

> Next, I should review what the guidelines actually ask us to do when AAV is suspected. EULAR and CanVasc recommend high-quality antigen-specific PR3- and MPO-ANCA immunoassays as the preferred primary tests when clinical suspicion is present, and emphasize that diagnosis is ultimately clinical and often requires histologic confirmation; specifically, they recommend obtaining a biopsy to establish a new diagnosis of AAV when feasible and safe, in keeping with the primacy of tissue for confirmation [^111vG1Pn] [^113DQEAj] [^113c5oKL].

> But wait, what about false negatives and assay limitations — I should double-check those. False negatives can occur early in disease before seroconversion, in cases with antibodies to minor neutrophil antigens not detected by standard PR3/MPO assays, or due to technical constraints, so methodologic context matters; moreover, single-analyte performance can be modest in unselected cohorts, and interpretive pitfalls increase if testing is ordered in low-prevalence settings without adequate clinical gating or pattern correlation [^114PT9Fc] [^114SJDys] [^117SH3tP].

> Let me think about result gradients and interpretation, because not all positives or negatives carry equal weight. Multicentre data show that defining assay-specific thresholds and using result-interval likelihood ratios improves clinical interpretation, with higher antibody levels conferring much higher likelihood of AAV, and that adding IIF confirmation to a high-quality immunoassay may not substantially improve diagnostic AUC compared with immunoassay alone, which underpins the shift to immunoassay-first algorithms [^1129Asaz] [^111K4rK5].

> I should now translate this into concrete actions. If clinical suspicion for AAV remains high despite a negative screen, do not be reassured falsely; proceed with urgent specialty referral and targeted tissue biopsy where feasible, and continue the appropriate organ-specific evaluation, recognizing that seronegative AAV and alternative vasculitides (for example IgA vasculitis or drug-induced vasculitis) may present similarly; if the initial test was IIF-only, obtain high-quality PR3/MPO immunoassays directly per guidelines, and consider repeat testing only if evolving clinical features increase pre-test probability rather than repeating indiscriminately [^113DQEAj] [^111vG1Pn] [^117PSPmc] [^117GyYd6].

> Hold on, I should verify how to document and communicate this clearly. In the chart, I would note: "ANCA screen negative; no PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA detected by high-quality immunoassay (or IIF negative if applicable); reflex confirmatory testing not triggered per lab algorithm; result lowers but does not exclude AAV — interpret in the context of clinical suspicion and proceed to tissue diagnosis if indicated", which aligns with current testing strategies and guideline-based diagnostic pathways [^111vG1Pn] [^111K4rK5].

> In summary, a "negative ANCA screen with reflex" indicates that the primary screen — preferably PR3/MPO immunoassay per contemporary guidance — found no detectable PR3- or MPO-ANCA and therefore no reflex testing was performed; this meaningfully reduces but does not negate the probability of AAV, so in patients with moderate to high pre-test probability, one should not defer expedited specialty evaluation and biopsy when safe, because up to a minority of true AAV cases are seronegative and diagnosis remains a clinical–histologic synthesis [^111vG1Pn] [^114MJxFX] [^113DQEAj].

An "ANCA screen with reflex negative" means the initial ANCA screen was negative, so **no reflex PR3/MPO testing was performed** [^111K4rK5]. This result makes ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) **less likely but does not exclude it**, especially if clinical suspicion is high or the patient is already on immunosuppression [^114MJxFX]. If suspicion persists, **repeat ANCA testing**, **tissue biopsy**, or alternative diagnostics should be considered [^113DQEAj] [^114r4uGW].

## ANCA screening and reflex testing

ANCA screening detects **ANCAs** associated with AAV (GPA, MPA, EGPA) [^111vG1Pn]. Reflex testing means that when the screen is positive, the laboratory automatically performs **PR3/MPO assays** to confirm and characterize the antibodies [^112qf5nq].

---

## Interpretation of "ANCA screen with reflex negative"

Negative screen indicates **no detectable ANCAs** on the initial assay; **No reflex** means PR3/MPO testing is not performed [^111K4rK5].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Reduced likelihood**: a negative screen lowers the probability of AAV but does not exclude it [^111vG1Pn].
- **False negatives**: can occur due to early disease, low titers, or immunosuppression [^114MJxFX] [^115kbFvM].
- **Clinical context**: interpretation must consider symptoms, signs, and other tests [^112qf5nq].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: different assays have varying sensitivity/specificity [^1129Asaz].
- **ANCA-negative AAV**: some patients have AAV despite negative ANCA [^111vG1Pn].
- **Repeat testing**: consider if suspicion remains high [^117GFwLW].

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Clinical correlation**: reassess symptoms, signs, and labs [^11167eog].
- **Repeat ANCA**: if suspicion persists, repeat testing [^112qf5nq].
- **Tissue biopsy**: consider to confirm or exclude AAV [^113DQEAj] [^114r4uGW].
- **Alternative diagnoses**: evaluate other causes of symptoms [^111HAXho].

---

An "ANCA screen with reflex negative" means the initial screen was negative and no further PR3/MPO testing was done; this reduces but **does not eliminate the likelihood of AAV**, so **further evaluation is warranted** if clinical suspicion remains [^111vG1Pn].

Investigations can further support a diagnosis of AAV and refute the major differential diagnoses of infection and cancer. As in the case study, urinalysis can rapidly screen for renal involvement in a multi-system disease. Patients with haematuria or proteinuria in this context have a high probability of having AAV. This probability is approximately 2% if the dipstick findings occur in isolation, rising to 85% if there is concomitant sinus and pulmonary disease.

ANCA testing improves diagnostic certainty for patients with a high pre-test probability of disease. However, up to 10% of patients with small vessel vasculitis clinically test negative for ANCA. Conversely, false positive results can occur in the general population and in association with infections, malignancy, and autoimmune gastrointestinal and renal disease. Given this complexity, ANCA tests are not usually requested in primary care. Kidney or lung biopsies may be taken by specialty services to confirm a diagnosis of AAV or exclude differential diagnoses such as cancer.

In summary, the diagnosis of vasculitis is not easy, requiring extensive clinical experience and access to immunological and histopathological tests. Appropriate treatment, both inductive and supportive, is even more challenging. The absence of markers that unequivocally correlate with disease activity and differentiate it from other clinical conditions makes management difficult. We expect that the results of the presented study will serve for a better interpretation of the available laboratory tests.

This special edition reviews the progress in understanding systemic vasculitis associated with autoantibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens (ANCA). European research groups have significantly contributed to this research, including the initial observations of the association between ANCA and vasculitis. Areas of interest include classification and epidemiology, genetics and pathogenesis, disease assessment, histology, and long-term outcomes.

Clinical trials conducted by the European Vasculitis Study Group have helped to define the standard of care for treating patients with vasculitis and provided a platform for investigating newer therapies. The prognosis of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis has improved due to facilitated diagnosis and the development of consensus, evidence-based treatment recommendations. The ANCA story exemplifies the power of a biomarker in influencing a disease area, inspiring research, and providing physicians with better tools to treat patients with these disorders.

### Disease assessment in systemic vasculitis [^116iBoW4]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

The anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitides are complex multi-system disorders with many overlapping clinical features. Their outcome has been transformed by effective immunosuppression, preventing death in over 70% of cases. The quality of survival is affected by the disease course, which is characterized by a significant likelihood of relapse in 38%, chronic effects from the disease and its treatment, as well as emerging or worsening comorbidity, all of which contribute to the patient's clinical condition and outcome. Whilst imaging and laboratory testing, including histology, are important aspects of diagnosis, they are of limited value in assessing response to therapy or subsequent disease course.

We have developed standardized, validated clinical methods to quantify disease activity and damage; we are developing effective measures of patient experience to complement these procedures. This approach provides a rational basis for clinical management as well as being essential in the conduct of clinical trials and studies in vasculitis by providing reproducible definitions of relapse, remission, and response to therapy for patients with systemic vasculitis. Clinical assessment remains the gold standard for evaluating disease progress, but requires regular training to ensure standardization. The development of biomarkers in the future may produce a more accurate description of the disease and identify potential targets for therapy, as well as predictors of response to drugs.

### Anca-mpo: is this a useful test [^114SJDys]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

We revisited the question of the usefulness of the ANCA-MPO assay, particularly whether it is valuable in diagnosing AAV and drug-induced vasculitis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent the ANCA-MPO test between July and December 2022 at University College London Hospital. We defined the following secondary goals:

- **Specialties frequency**: Assess which specialties most frequently request this test.
- **Diagnoses identification**: Identify the diagnoses made.
- **Frequency of positive tests**: Determine the frequency of positive ANCA-MPO tests.
- **Correlation analysis**: Evaluate whether the ANCA screen test, including the atypical p-ANCA and p-ANCA patterns, correlated with the ANCA-MPO test.

The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki were observed during the study period.

The ANCA-MPO test was performed on 614 patients: 64.8% females and 35.2% males. Of the patients whose ethnicity was confirmed, 54.4% were Caucasians, 13.2% Asians, and 13.2% Afro-Caribbeans. The specialties most frequently requesting the test were Rheumatology (38.1%), Neurology (17.4%), Respiratory (6.5%), Dermatology (6.4%), Nephrology (5.5%), and ENT (5.4%). Forty patients had a diagnosis of AAV or cocaine-induced vasculitis. Other diagnoses included LN (4.3%), RA (3.7%), SLE (3.5%), and interstitial lung disease (2.8%). No diagnosis was reached for 18.6% of patients, while clinical diagnosis was inconclusive in 2.9%. Diagnoses established were GPA in 2.4%, EGPA in 0.9%, AAV in 1.6%, and cocaine-induced vasculitis in 0.4%. No patients tested had a diagnosis of MPA.

### Position paper: Revised 2017 international consensus on testing of ANCAs in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis [^111K4rK5]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) are valuable laboratory markers used for the diagnosis of well-defined types of small-vessel vasculitis, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). According to the 1999 international consensus on ANCA testing, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) should be used to screen for ANCAs, and samples containing ANCAs should then be tested by immunoassays for proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCAs and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs. The distinction between PR3-ANCAs and MPO-ANCAs has important clinical and pathogenic implications. As dependable immunoassays for PR3-ANCAs and MPO-ANCAs have become broadly available, there is increasing international agreement that high-quality immunoassays are the preferred screening method for the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis. The present consensus statement proposes that high-quality immunoassays can be used as the primary screening method for patients suspected of having the ANCA-associated vasculitides GPA and MPA without the categorical need for IIF, and presents and discusses evidence to support this recommendation.

Among other possible causes, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies can be caused by conditions including drug-induced ANCA vasculitis, ulcerative colitis, microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn's disease, infective endocarditis, and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. Additionally, medications such as hydralazine, minocycline, phenytoin, penicillamine, allopurinol, sulfasalazine, sulfasalazine DR, phenytoin ER, and minocycline ER can also induce anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.

### Negative commercial screening test for paraneoplastic antibodies in a case of opsoclonus [^115RYFiY]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS) is challenging as it comprises a group of clinically heterogeneous entities, all related to a coexistent, but sometimes occult, malignancy. The detection of paraneoplastic antibodies aids the clinician in establishing the diagnosis of a PNS. Paraneoplastic antibodies are screened by means of immunohistochemistry or indirect immunofluorescence on cerebellar slices. Cerebellar substrates that can be used for screening for paraneoplastic antibodies are commercially available.

Such commercial screening was applied to the serum and CSF of a 48-year-old woman presenting with a subacute onset of oscillopsia and diplopia. No family history of neurologic diseases was present. Two months prior, she experienced initial symptoms of anorexia, nausea, and balancing problems. Two weeks before admission, she experienced the first signs of multidirectional binocular diplopia and oscillopsia. Neurologic examination revealed a normal mental and cognitive status. Ocular motility showed full-range eye movements. The patient mentioned binocular diplopia on lateral gaze and downgaze. Initially, bursts of ocular flutter were noticed, confirmed by video-oculography, which evolved over time into a constant opsoclonus. This opsoclonus caused significant visual impairment with a drop in visual acuity to logMAR 0.7. She had a normal motor and sensory examination. The osteotendinous reflexes were brisk without pathologic reflexes. Gait was broad-based ataxic, without overt appendicular ataxia. In a later phase, she mentioned infrequent shock-like symptoms.

### Antiproteinase 3 antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and disease activity in Wegener granulomatosis [^115gcXR9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The utility of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels to guide the management of patients with Wegener granulomatosis remains controversial.

- **Objective**: To determine whether pro-proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA levels are a better measure of disease activity than mature-PR3-ANCA levels, whether decreases in either level are associated with shorter time to remission, and whether increases are followed by relapse.

- **Design**: Prospective, observational cohort study.

- **Setting**: Eight United States medical centers that participated in a treatment trial for Wegener granulomatosis.

- **Patients**: 156 patients with Wegener granulomatosis enrolled during periods of active disease.

- **Measurements**: PR3-ANCA levels (by capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and disease activity (by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener granulomatosis).

- **Results**: The ANCA levels were only weakly associated with disease activity across patients. The longitudinal association within patients was stronger, but changes in ANCA levels explained less than 10% of the variation in disease activity. Decreases in mature- and pro-PR3-ANCA levels were not statistically significantly associated with a shorter time to remission, and increases in mature-PR3-ANCA levels (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.8 [95% CI, 0.4 to 1.9]; P = 0.67) and pro-PR3-ANCA levels (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.0 [CI, 0.5 to 2.1]; P = 0.99) were not associated with relapse. The proportion of patients who had relapse within 1 year of an increase in PR3-ANCA levels was 40% for mature-PR3 (CI, 18% to 56%) and 43% for pro-PR3 (CI, 22% to).

### Executive summary: The 2025 British Society for Rheumatology management recommendations for ANCA-associated vasculitis [^114CeJ6y]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) consists of heterogeneous, multisystem disorders characterized by inflammation and necrosis of small and medium-sized blood vessels with unknown aetiology. Three distinct clinico-pathological syndromes have been identified: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), which are associated with autoantibodies directed against neutrophil granular proteins, proteinase 3, and myeloperoxidase. These conditions are uncommon, with incidence and prevalence rates of approximately 25 per million population and 200 per million, respectively. Despite significant advances in treatment, mortality rates remain elevated, 2.3 times that of the general population. Early diagnosis, swift implementation of appropriate immunosuppression, and limiting toxicities from treatment are key to mitigating mortality and damage from AAV.

### Antibodies to selected minor target antigens in patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) [^114PT9Fc]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

In patients with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, indirect immunofluorescence (IF) distinguishes between cytoplasmic (C-ANCA) and perinuclear (P-ANCA) neutrophil staining patterns. In patients with primary systemic vasculitis such as Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome, these IF staining patterns correspond broadly with antibodies to the two major antigens: the C-ANCA pattern is generally associated with antibodies to serine protease 3 (PR3) and the P-ANCA pattern with antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO). However, some sera positive for ANCA by IF are negative for anti-PR3 and anti-MPO antibodies, suggesting the presence of antibodies to minor antigens of PMN granules.

We tested sera from a previously well-defined clinical cohort of patients for antibodies to four possible minor antigens: bactericidal permeability increasing protein, elastase, cathepsin G, and lactoferrin. IF-positive (+) sera had significantly higher antibody frequencies to the minor antigens than did the IF-negative (-) sera (P < 0.01). Patients with IF(+) PR3(-) MPO(-) sera showed the most varied reactivity to the minor antigens. Among the IF(+) groups, the IF(+) PR3(+)/MPO(-) sera showed the lowest reactivity to the minor antigens. Patients with well-defined ANCA specificities, e.g. the PR3-ANCA response associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, are less likely than other patient subsets to have antibodies to minor antigen targets. Autoantibodies to these minor antigens contribute to the overall pattern of ANCA identified by.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, more specifically with respect to severity assessment, CanVasc 2021 guidelines recommend stratifying patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing ANCA-associated vasculitides according to the extent and severity of the disease to tailor treatment accordingly.

### Key advances in the clinical approach to ANCA-associated vasculitis [^1134WZJ3]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The updated nomenclature for vasculitis defines this varied group of disorders by aetiology, specific features of pathogenesis, and clinical symptoms; diagnostic and classification criteria for clinical practice are in development. Here, I review some important advances in the management of vasculitis within the category of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), which encompasses microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). The clinical approach to the management of the patient with AAV should include testing for ANCA specificity; proteinase 3 (PR3)-specific ANCAs are most often associated with GPA, whereas myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCAs are usually associated with MPA. Also important to the management of AAV is an assessment of the disease stage and severity to enable tailored treatment based on an algorithm derived from controlled-trial data. Remaining questions pertain to the dosage and duration of corticosteroid treatment, the selection of patients for, and duration of, maintenance treatment after induction of remission, and the identification of safer and more effective therapies than are currently in use. Outcome measures should assess not only disease activity but also damage and quality of life. Infections, cardiovascular events, and malignancies also contribute to outcome, and their prevention should therefore be part of the clinical approach to managing patients with AAV.

### Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs): Role in diagnosis, disease monitoring, and prognosis [^117GFwLW]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare and potentially fatal autoimmune disorder characterized by pauci-immune necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized blood vessels. The pathogenic role of ANCAs in AAV is supported by both clinical and experimental evidence, and when used in the proper clinical setting, ANCA testing is highly specific for AAV. Testing with both indirect immunofluorescence assay and enzyme immunoassay may increase sensitivity for AAV; however, testing with a high-quality enzyme immunoassay may be used alone. Nonvasculitic conditions and drugs can cause ANCA positivity without manifestations of AAV. We review ANCA testing itself, performance characteristics and specific conditions for the laboratory test, and various conditions when ANCA testing is useful in diagnosis, disease monitoring, and selecting treatment.

### ANCA-MPO: Is this a useful test [^114BLdeF]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

The ANCA screen test, performed in 476 patients (77.5%), was positive in 43.2%. Among them, 25.7% and 23.4% showed a p-ANCA and atypical p-ANCA pattern, respectively. The most frequent pattern was atypical c-ANCA (29.8%). The ANCA-MPO test was positive in 2.0%.

The performance of the ANCA-MPO test as a predictor of AAV or drug-induced vasculitis was assessed through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.59 (95% CI 0.5, 0.7). The Youden index was determined to establish the cut-off value with the highest validity of the ANCA MPO test. The optimal cut-off was 0.3, with a sensitivity of 40.0% and a specificity of 79.0% (Youden index 0.2). Calibration was verified through the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. The ANCA screen result did not correlate with the ANCA-MPO result [odds ratio (OR) 7.4; P-value 0.059; 95% CI 0.9, 58.7]. No correlation was also identified with p-ANCA (OR 3.8; P-value 0.05, 95% CI 0.1, 14.7) or atypical p-ANCA (OR 0.9; P-value 0.933; 95% CI 0.2, 4.6).

AAV is uncommon, with diverse clinical features. Guchelaar et al. compared the diagnostic value of ANCA IIF and immunoassay for diagnosing AAV. The sensitivity obtained for ANCA-MPO with immunoassay was 58.1%, and the specificity was 95.6%. Although the ANCA test is considered relevant for AAV diagnosis, our data showed the discriminatory ability of the test is unsatisfactory, as the AUC is < 0.6. With a Youden index close to zero, the ANCA-MPO test showed little ability to discriminate between patients with AAV and those with drug-induced vasculitis.

### A multicentre study to improve clinical interpretation of proteinase-3 and myeloperoxidase anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies [^1129Asaz]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this multicentre study was to improve the clinical interpretation of PR3- and MPO-ANCAs as an adjunct for the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) by defining thresholds and test result intervals based on predefined specificities and by calculating test result interval-specific likelihood ratios (LRs).

- **Methods**: Eight different PR3- and MPO-ANCA immunoassays from seven companies were evaluated using 251 diagnostic samples from AAV patients and 924 diseased controls.

- **Results**: Thresholds for antibody levels were determined based on predefined specificities (95, 97.5, 99, and 100%) and used to delimit test result intervals. Test result interval-specific LRs were determined. For all assays, the LR for AAV increased with increasing antibody level. For all but one immunoassay, high antibody levels (associated with LR > 55) were found in a substantial fraction (> 65%) of patients. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics analysis of a diagnostic approach in which positive results were confirmed by IIF or another immunoassay was not substantially higher than the AUC of performing an immunoassay only. The highest AUC was found when immunoassay was combined with another immunoassay or with IIF.

- **Conclusion**: To diagnose AAV based on PR3- and MPO-ANCA, it is useful to define thresholds for antibody levels and to assign test result interval-specific LRs. Higher antibody levels are associated with a higher likelihood of disease. Such information improves clinical interpretation.

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection [^117MX4YD]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The implementation of reflex HCV RNA testing, where a test for HCV RNA is automatically performed following a positive HCV antibody result, has been a significant advance. In regions lacking reflex testing, 20% to as high as 50% of individuals who test positive for HCV antibodies do not undergo follow-up HCV RNA testing. This represents a major drop-off in the HCV cascade of care. When Quest Diagnostics, a large commercial laboratory in the United States, adopted reflex HCV RNA testing, the rate of follow-up HCV RNA testing within 30 days of a positive HCV antibody test increased from 40% to 95%. In parallel, Spanish data indicated that the rate of RNA testing rose from 52% to 91% with the introduction of reflex testing. Despite the benefits, challenges with inadequate sample volume or sample mishandling still prevent laboratories from achieving universal HCV RNA testing for all antibody-positive samples.

Although reflex testing is an important step and should become standard practice globally, its implementation is limited in many regions, including numerous high-income countries, particularly in rural and remote communities. Laboratories have cited challenges moving samples from the serology section to the site of nucleic acid testing, especially if these tests are not conducted in the same location. This challenge should be weighed against the inconvenience and cost to a patient who must return to a provider and provide a second sample for follow-up testing. Some laboratories require the collection of a second sample at the time of initial anti-

### Anca-mpo: is this a useful test [^115a2xpP]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

Specialties that most frequently requested the test were those managing common symptoms of AAV, including renal, pulmonary, upper respiratory tract, and dermatological features.

In addition to AAV and drug-induced vasculitis, 200 additional diagnoses were noted among those for whom the test was requested. Our study supports previous data describing a positive ANCA test in non-vasculitic conditions. This is due to indiscriminate testing in patients with a low pre-test probability of AAV or drug-induced vasculitis, increasing the frequency of false-positive results obtained. Although the 2017 consensus statement recommends testing with high-quality MPO-ANCA assays rather than screening with IIF, this has serious cost implications. We suggest that internal policies should guide the use of this test so that it is only requested when clinically appropriate.

The main limitations of our study are that it is single-centre and retrospective. However, the detailed assessment of the clinical diagnosis in over 600 patients in whom the test was performed provides significant compensation.

In conclusion, our results indicate that the ability of ANCA-MPO to predict AAV or drug-induced vasculitis is limited.

### Prediction of relapses in PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis by assessing responses of ANCA titres to treatment [^117L5Kfe]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

We performed a retrospective evaluation of whether c-ANCA titres (indirect immunofluorescence) and anti-proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA levels (ELISA) at diagnosis and following immunosuppressive treatment predict the relapse of ANCA-associated vasculitis.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with PR3-ANCA-associated vasculitis between 1991 and 2002, with at least 2 years of follow-up, and treated with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids only (1991–1996) or switched to azathioprine after induction of remission with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids (1997–2002) were included. ANCA were assessed by immunofluorescence and direct PR3-specific ELISA at diagnosis and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after diagnosis. Actuarial relapse-free survival was analyzed with the log-rank test.

- **Results**: We studied 87 patients positive for PR3-ANCA: 46 were on cyclophosphamide maintenance therapy and 41 switched to azathioprine. Overall actuarial relapse-free survival was 72% at 2 years and 34% at 5 years. Relapse-free survival did not differ between patients on cyclophosphamide maintenance and those switched to azathioprine maintenance (P = 0.34). Patients who became and remained negative for c-ANCA (immunofluorescence) or PR3-ANCA (ELISA) until 24 months after diagnosis had a lower risk of relapse (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). Positive c-ANCA (immunofluorescence) titres at 3 months (relative risk [RR] 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–3.8), 12 months (RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.1–3.3), 18 months (RR 2.9; 95% CI 1.3–4.6), and 24 months (RR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2–5.0) were significantly associated with relapse within 5 years.

### Anca associated vasculitis [^116fTe6y]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV) is primarily clinical, supported by serological and histological data. There are many possible presenting symptoms, none being more important than another for making the diagnosis, and no isolated discriminating symptoms for AAV. The key to diagnosis is the prompt recognition of an inflammatory disease pattern when multiple symptoms emerge, especially if more than one organ system is implicated or in combination with chronic systemic symptoms. Therefore, when two or more of these symptoms develop concurrently, the index of suspicion should be high.

- **Clinical scenarios**: Two clinical scenarios pose particular diagnostic difficulty.
	- **Alveolar haemorrhage**: It can be hard to recognize and is devastating if missed. Alveolar haemorrhage may present with haemoptysis, but this symptom is absent in up to half of cases. Some patients with extensive airspace bleeding will report only shortness of breath or cough and have a near-normal chest examination. Patients with haemoptysis plus other features of AAV warrant same-day hospital assessment to rule out pulmonary haemorrhage without further primary care investigations if these would delay referral. All other patients with suspected vasculitis and dyspnoea or cough should have a full blood count. If there is a recent drop in haemoglobin (or a low haemoglobin with no historic comparator), then it is advisable to urgently discuss the possibility of pulmonary haemorrhage with a specialty service.

### Assessment of the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies [^11311nj1]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The most important cause of death in the active phase of AAV is infectious complications, and the increase in inflammatory markers (leukocytosis, ESR, CRP) is equally typical for vasculitis and severe infection. Repeated measurements of procalcitonin concentrations have proven to be very helpful in differentiating bacterial infections, and their effectiveness in diagnostics has been demonstrated in many clinical studies.

In the presented study, procalcitonin concentration was significantly higher in active vasculitis than in remission. The highest values were found in patients with severe AAV, who developed respiratory failure, alveolar bleeding, and required mechanical ventilation or NIV assisted respiration. In all these patients, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was used. Two patients from this population eventually died from septic shock.

The correct procalcitonin concentration of < 0.5 ng/ml is likely to exclude significant bacterial infection. In patients with AAV during the period of disease activity, results are often observed in the so-called gray zone (0.5–1.0 ng/ml), despite the absence of infectious symptoms. This may be due to a generalized inflammatory reaction. In the presented study, similar to other clinical trials, a procalcitonin concentration above 1.0 ng/ml was strongly associated with infectious complications, severe lower respiratory tract involvement, and an increased risk of death.

Numerous studies have shown an increased risk of venous thrombosis in the course of active AAV. The relationship of the markers stimulating the coagulation system and their implications continue to be a significant focus of ongoing research.

### ANCA-MPO: Is this a useful test [^115nsGPp]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

ANCA-MPO may not accurately predict ANCA-associated vasculitis and drug-induced vasculitis. ANCAs bind proteins expressed in neutrophils responsible for vascular inflammation. ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small-vessel vasculitis characterized by necrotizing vasculitis, with few or absent immune deposits. This classification includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).

Positive staining of ANCA has three main patterns by IIF: p-ANCA, c-ANCA, and atypical. The last includes all the other neutrophil or monocyte-specific immunofluorescent reactivity, resulting from a mixture of cytoplasmic and perinuclear staining that can be present in other inflammatory diseases. The immunoassay detects antibodies against PR3 and MPO, which are strongly associated with c-ANCA and p-ANCA, respectively.

Results of multiple polymerase chain reaction tests coinciding with the start of symptoms were negative, indicating that acute infection was not the cause of the patient's symptoms. Coronavirus disease 2019-induced autoimmune diseases have been described in adults, but this case report represents the first case described in a pediatric patient.

### Clinical impact of subgrouping ANCA-associated vasculitis according to antibody specificity beyond the clinicopathological classification [^114LgvTW]. Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

In ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), classifications have emerged to individualize homogeneous clinical and outcome patterns, including the recently defined anti-MPO granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) subgroup. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the impacts of re-classification based on clinicopathological criteria and/or ANCA specificity.

A retrospective monocentric study conducted at Caen University Hospital led to the identification of PR3 or MPO-ANCA AAV patients from January 2000 or September 2011, respectively, to June 2016. Eosinophilic GPA patients were excluded. AAVs were thereby also classified either as GPA or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) according to the European Medicines Agency vasculitis algorithm.

A total of 150 AAV patients were included (94 GPA, 56 MPA; 87 anti-PR3 and 63 anti-MPO patients). GPA patients exhibited a worse relapse-free survival but a better renal survival (P < 0.001 and P = 0.021, respectively) than MPA patients. Overall, relapse-free and renal survival rates were similar between anti-PR3 and anti-MPO patients (P = 0.35, 0.17 and 0.15, respectively). Similarly, the prognosis was identical between anti-MPO MPA patients and anti-PR3 MPA patients (P = 0.33, 0.19 and 0.65, respectively), and between anti-MPO GPA patients and anti-PR3 GPA patients (P = 0.06, 0.99 and 0.64, respectively). Moreover, anti-PR3 GPA and anti-MPO GPA patients exhibited no differences in clinical manifestations or BVAS score.

Clinicopathological classification appeared to be the strongest criterion for distin

### Disease heterogeneity in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis: Implications for therapeutic approaches [^112MXH5h]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

In recent decades, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis has transformed from an almost uniformly fatal disease to a treatable form of primary systemic vasculitis. Substantial disease heterogeneity exists within ANCA-associated vasculitis, and the increasing understanding of this heterogeneity has implications for guiding treatment decisions. Approaches to induction and maintenance therapy vary depending on disease severity, clinical manifestations, and patient-specific factors.

In this narrative review, we examine how disease heterogeneity in ANCA-associated vasculitis, with respect to disease severity, clinical presentations, and ANCA specificity, influences therapeutic decision making. Many questions regarding therapeutic strategies in ANCA-associated vasculitis remain unanswered, and these should guide future research in this complex group of diseases.

### Anca-Gbm dot-blot: Evaluation of an assay in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis [^1145jgx7]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is characterized by the rapid and progressive loss of renal function and the presence of crescentic glomerulonephritis (CGN). Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are mandatory to prevent death and/or renal failure. We have evaluated an ANCA-GBM dot-blot diagnostic test in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and inter-observer effect in consecutive patients with RPGN (n = 82). Control sera (n = 34) included healthy and relevant disease controls. Dot-blots were independently evaluated by nine observers.

Proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA, myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA, and both were detected by ELISA in 36, 32, and 3 samples of 71 patients with pauci-immune CGN, respectively. Two additional samples were ANCA negative. The dot-blot revealed a sensitivity of 92–95% for PR3-ANCA and 80–86% for MPO-ANCA. The specificity of the dot-blot for PR3- and MPO-ANCA was 100%. In the patients with anti-GBM nephritis (n = 9), anti-GBM was detected by both ELISA and dot-blot (sensitivity: 100%). The specificity of the anti-GBM dot-blot was 91–94%. However, the inter-observer effect was relatively high for the detection of anti-GBM antibodies (24%).

In conclusion, the ANCA-GBM dot-blot is a useful screening tool in situations where conventional ANCA testing is not readily available, with excellent performance for PR3-ANCA detection but less optimal sensitivity for MPO-ANCA and specificity for anti-GBM detection. Therefore, it is recommended to include the following advice in the report to the physicians: 1) Patients with a high clinical suspicion for MPO-ANCA-as…

### Assessment of the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies [^1141ddTR]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

In the studied population, the mean initial concentration of creatinine was high and amounted to 3.39 mg/dl (mean GFR 33.17 ml/min/1.73 m²), and after 6 months of treatment, it decreased only to 2.86 mg/dl (mean GFR 37.87 ml/min/1.73 m²). The difference was not statistically significant.

- **Laboratory test results - assessment of kidney involvement**: Only in 4 patients (14.3%) did the GFR value increase above 60 ml/min/1.73 m². In 11 patients (39.3%), it remained below 30 ml/min/1.73 m², including 3 patients (10.7%) who had to continue renal replacement therapy. Furthermore, 3 individuals (10.7%) with advanced renal failure died. The amount of daily proteinuria did not show a significant correlation with AAV activity (p = 0.275), and the percentage of patients in remission with daily protein excretion above 150 mg was as high as 62.5%.

### Maintenance of remission and risk of relapse in myeloperoxidase-positive ANCA-associated vasculitis with kidney involvement [^117WBGxc]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

- **Proposal for clinical use**: The clinical use of MPO-ANCA status for remission-maintenance guidance in MPO-ANCA–associated vasculitis with GN is proposed based on serial MPO-ANCA determinations. The suggested interval is informed by the observed time for MPO-ANCA to reappear after turning negative through treatment, with a median time of 5.5 months (interquartile range 3.1–15.5 months).

- **Factors influencing treatment start**: The initiation of maintenance immunosuppression will depend on risk factors including age, baseline eGFR, previous relapses, and the heightened risk of progression to kidney failure. Following guidelines grounded in randomized controlled trial results, and supported by relapse observations in our cohort using conventional disease-modifying drugs, rituximab is advised as the preferred treatment for remission maintenance.

ANCA-associated vasculitis is a disease characterized by relapsing and remitting phases. The risk of relapse is associated with inadequate remission-maintenance treatment, such as immunosuppressants at subtherapeutic doses or premature discontinuation. There is an inherent need for continuous, appropriate, and effective remission-maintenance treatment. Our study indicates that approximately 42% of patients experiencing relapses during remission-maintenance treatment received doses deemed subtherapeutic, with 60% remaining persistently MPO-ANCA–positive. Conversely, the impact of the treatment duration on minimizing relapse rates remains uncertain. Specifically, extending azathioprine maintenance beyond 18 months did not improve relapse-free survival outcomes.

### Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis: where to go [^113K6ENA]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Enormous progress has been made during the last 25 years in our understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV). This has led to improvements in early diagnosis, treatment, and secondary prevention of these diseases. Nevertheless, there are still unmet needs in the AAV.

With respect to diagnosis and follow-up, sensitive biomarkers that reflect disease activity, even during smouldering disease, are needed. In the field of aetiopathogenesis, genetic and epigenetic studies are being performed not only directed at the autoimmune response but also at the expression of potentially modified autoantigens. Environmental factors, particularly microbial factors, are also being explored. This research will enable the analysis of gene-environment interactions in the AAV, further elucidating their aetiopathogenesis.

Explaining the differences in clinical presentation between proteinase 3 (PR3)-associated AAV and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-associated AAV requires an adequate animal model for PR3-ANCA disease, which is currently lacking. Although many large randomized controlled trials have established a foundation for a rational therapeutic approach to AAV, late morbidity and mortality remain significant. The availability of new biologicals and the development of sensitive biomarkers for disease activity could further improve the prognosis for patients suffering from AAV.

### Syphilis [^1146BUgA]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

When faced with inconclusive results, it is important to consider the circumstances under which they arise. Generally, inconclusive results occur during early infection or from waning antibody levels in late infection. The most common scenarios include:

- **RPR and treponemal screening**: A positive RPR with a negative treponemal screening (EIA/CLIA) and confirmatory tests (TPPA) suggests the RPR result is a false positive.
- **Screen and confirmatory test**: A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with a negative confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR is likely a false positive but could indicate early infection.
- **Waning antibody levels**: A positive screen (EIA/CLIA) with an indeterminant confirmatory test (TPPA) and negative RPR could represent waning antibody levels following a previous, treated infection or a new infection.

When results are inconclusive, clinicians should inquire about previous syphilis infection and treatment. If early syphilis is possible, retesting in two to four weeks is advised. If results remain unchanged, interpretation should be based on patient history — consider the possibilities of late untreated infection, treated infection, or non-venereal treponemal disease in adults from endemic countries in South and Central America, South-East Asia, and Africa.

### Simple, readily available clinical indices predict early and late mortality among patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis [^117F3T77]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The early identification of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) who are at increased risk for inferior clinical outcomes at the time of diagnosis might help optimize the immunosuppressive therapy. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictive value of simple clinical characteristics, which may be applicable for early risk stratification of patients with AAV.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 101 consecutive patients with AAV receiving a protocolized immunosuppressive therapy. Baseline Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) and non-vasculitic comorbidities were computed. Predictors of early (90 days) mortality, infectious death, relapse, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) were evaluated.

- **Results**: The baseline comorbidity score independently predicted early mortality (HR 1.622, CI 1.006–2.614) and showed an association with infectious mortality (HR 2.056, CI 1.247–3.392). Patients with a BVAS at or above the median (= 21) had worse early mortality in univariable analysis (HR 3.57, CI 1.039–12.243) (p = 0.031), and experienced more frequent relapses (p = 0.01) compared to patients with a BVAS below the median.

- **Conclusions**: Assessing baseline comorbidities, in addition to clinical indices characterizing the severity and extension of AAV, might help clinicians in the risk stratification of patients. Future prospective studies are needed to investigate whether therapies based on risk stratification could improve both short-term and long-term survival.

### Anca negative pulmonary vasculitis: A challenging diagnosis [^117MbasC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A man in his 40s with end-stage kidney disease due to IgA nephropathy and receiving peritoneal dialysis presented with a 1-week history of breathlessness, cough, and nosebleeds. A CT scan of the chest revealed ground glass changes, while blood tests indicated elevated inflammatory markers and a negative vasculitis screen. This included negative ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies. Initial treatment for suspected atypical pneumonia with antibiotics yielded no clinical improvement. Over the course of the admission, his symptoms progressively worsened, leading to oxygen dependency with a FiO2 of 40% and episodes of haemoptysis.

Suspicions of pulmonary vasculitis arose due to clinical deterioration, prompting consultation with a tertiary vasculitis centre. It was subsequently concluded that the clinical and radiological findings correlated with ANCA-negative pulmonary vasculitis or a rare case of IgA-associated pulmonary capillaritis. Treatment with methylprednisolone and rituximab led to significant improvement, allowing rapid oxygen withdrawal. The patient was discharged with a tapering prednisolone regimen.

### Hypotheses on the etiology of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody associated vasculitis: The cause is hidden, but the result is known [^111hDgjp]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The first description of what is now known as antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated necrotizing vasculitis appeared more than 140 years ago. Since then, many aspects of the pathogenic pathway have been elucidated, indicating the involvement of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies. However, the reason why antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies are produced in the first place remains unknown. Over the years, many hypotheses have emerged addressing the etiology of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody production, but no exclusive factor or set of factors can so far be held responsible. This paper reviews the most influential hypotheses regarding the causes of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, with the aim of placing these hypotheses in an epidemiological context that centers on environmental and genetic influences.

### Utility of repeat extractable nuclear antigen antibody testing: A retrospective audit [^11256GV5]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Autoantibodies to extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) are frequently ordered during the workup of suspected autoimmune connective tissue diseases. There are no guidelines for repeat test ordering. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of repeat ENA testing after an initial negative result.

A retrospective study was conducted in a single, multicenter tertiary health network in Melbourne, Australia. Results of all ENA tests were extracted from the hospital laboratory information system. For patients who had a change in ENA result from negative to positive, clinical information was obtained from the hospital records regarding new diagnosis of an ANA-associated rheumatic disease (AARD).

A total of 23,438 ENA tests were performed in 19,603 patients from 29 July 2013 to 28 September 2020. Of these, 20,918 (89.2%) were negative and 215 (0.9%) were equivocal. Of the 2,305 positive tests, the most common ENA auto-antibody specificity detected was anti-Ro52 (1,185, 51.4%). Among the 19,603 patients, 2,636 (13.4%) had more than one ENA test performed during the study period. Most of these patients (2,523, 95.7%) had stable ENA results with no change compared to the first test. Only 53 patients (2.2%) had an ENA result that changed from negative to positive. Excluding patients with pre-existing rheumatic conditions and those under 18, there were five new AARDs found in the remaining 34 patients.

In conclusion, repeat ENA test results rarely change or result in a new diagnosis of an AARD, with repeated testing only warranted if there is a change in clinical manifestations.

### Assessment of the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies [^1143M7tL]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The study analyzed the results of laboratory tests at different stages of AAV disease and treatment. The course of the disease is very variable, and the assessment of the patient is based on experience and extensive differential diagnosis. The clinical activity scales, BVAS v3 and BVAS/WG, have a documented value for assessing the severity of the disease, but the classification of symptoms depends on the doctor's experience.

The study population was characterized by high disease activity; more than 78% of patients were diagnosed with the generalized and severe form. Renal involvement was confirmed in 75% of patients, with initially high creatinine levels, which in most patients did not return to normal despite treatment. The studies by Houben et al. and Hanaoka et al. showed that the increased concentration of creatinine and the decrease in GFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m² at the time of diagnosis are late indicators of AAV activity in the kidneys, which is consistent with the presented work. Despite treatment, a significant proportion of patients remain in the advanced stage of chronic kidney disease, which significantly worsens the long-term prognosis.

### Automatic laboratory-initiated reflex testing to identify patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia [^1156YiHZ]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

The clinical usefulness of automatic laboratory-initiated testing of patients with recent-onset normocytic anemia to diagnose autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is uncertain. During a 28-month period, we performed 784,185 CBC counts. Patients without a history of anemia had reticulocyte count testing if hemoglobin values were less than 10 g/dL. Of 784,185 CBC counts, 3,841 (0.49%) revealed recent-onset normocytic anemia, and 424 (11.04%) had reticulocyte counts of 2% or more.

Of those with elevated reticulocyte counts, 52 (12.3%) had positive DAT results. Patient information was available for 40 patients, and physicians were unaware of the existence of AIHA in 33 (83%) of them. Of the 40 patients, 11 (28%) were treated with steroids and 6 (15%) were hospitalized. In 2 patients (5%), medications were stopped because they were suspected to have caused the hemolytic anemia.

Automatic laboratory testing for patients with recent-onset normocytic anemia ensures recommended practices, probably saves physician visits, and, for some patients, results in more timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Diagnosing and treating ANCA-associated vasculitis: An updated review for clinical practice [^11167eog]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

ANCA-associated vasculitides (AAV) are a group of rare, primary, systemic necrotizing small-vessel vasculitides. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis account for approximately 80–90% of all AAV. Exposure to silica dust, farming, and chronic nasal Staphylococcus aureus carriage are associated with an increased risk of developing AAV.

When a diagnosis of AAV is suspected, such as in patients with multisystem organ dysfunction or those with features such as chronic rhinosinusitis, cavitated lung nodules, palpable purpura, or acute kidney injury, appropriate further investigations are needed, including ANCA testing. In this scenario, a structured clinical assessment should be conducted, evaluating all the organs possibly involved. Tissue biopsy may be necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis.

Therapeutic algorithms vary based on the severity of AAV, the clinical diagnosis/ANCA specificity, and the patient's age, weight, comorbidities, and prognosis. Recent data favor rituximab as a preferable option for both induction and maintenance of remission. Additionally, regimens with fewer glucocorticoids are equally effective and safer in inducing remission compared to conventional regimens, and avacopan is an effective glucocorticoid-sparing option. In contrast, there is no compelling evidence to support the routine use of plasma exchange in addition to standard remission-induction therapy in AAV. ANCA and other biomarkers can be helpful in association with clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment decisions. Patients should be frequently evaluated.

### The effect of a symptom related "gating policy" on ANCA requests in routine clinical practice [^117GyYd6]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Most positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) results are associated with non-vasculitic conditions, and guidelines have been proposed for the judicious use of this test. The outcome of applying similar guidelines in a routine laboratory is reported.

- **Methods**: All immunology requests (6,500) over six months were selected, and those requesting ANCA were studied for the appropriateness of the clinical data supporting the request, the presence of ANCA in those samples tested, and the final diagnosis. Antibodies were detected by indirect immunofluorescence.

- **Results**: ANCA testing was requested in 287 samples. Application of a "gating policy", which refuses analysis on requests that are not supported by clinical data suggestive of systemic vasculitis, made clinicians more selective about the patients for whom they requested ANCA testing. The percentage of "appropriate" screens for systemic vasculitis was relatively high (212 of 287 requests; 72.5%). Only one of the remainder, for whom ANCA testing was initially refused, developed an ANCA-related systemic vasculitis in the two years after the study, but the delay in reporting her positive ANCA was only two days. Most of the samples tested were negative (155 of 212), but most (42 of 57) of the patients with positive ANCA results were found to have a systemic vasculitis.

- **Conclusions**: A gating policy to select requests supported by clinical data suggestive of systemic vasculitis makes ANCA testing more clinically relevant and cost-effective.

### Are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies a marker predictive of relapse in Wegener's granulomatosis? A prospective study [^116Jfi8F]. Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate the predictive value of testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in 55 patients with systemic Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), a randomized, prospective trial was conducted comparing corticosteroids with oral or pulse cyclophosphamide.

All 55 patients received corticosteroids. A cyclophosphamide pulse of 0.7 g/m² was administered at the time of diagnosis. After the first pulse, patients were randomly assigned to receive either pulse or oral cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day), independent of ANCA results. ANCA were detected using an immunofluorescence assay to correlate them with WG relapse. Monitoring of ANCA continued throughout the study.

At diagnosis, ANCA were found in 48 (87%) patients, showing a cytoplasmic labeling pattern in 44 patients and a perinuclear pattern in four. Follow-up ANCA data were available for 50 patients; ANCA disappeared in 34 patients and persisted in nine. For 79% of the patients, clinical improvement corresponded with the disappearance of ANCA, whereas deterioration was noted with persistence or increased titre. Among initially ANCA-positive patients, 23 relapses were noted. Relapses were more frequent with persistent or reappearing ANCA [13/19 ANCA-positive patients vs. 3/29 ANCA-negative patients (P < 0.01)]. Nine relapses (39%) occurred in patients with persistent ANCA, and in eight cases (35%), ANCA reappearance preceded relapse. The mean time to relapse did not differ between patients who became ANCA-negative and those who remained persistently ANCA-positive.

### Myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase 3-ANCA without immunofluorescent ANCA found by routine clinical testing [^115kbFvM]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Testing for serum antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) by indirect immunofluorescence (IF) and by antiproteinase 3 (PR3)/antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody assays may identify patients with PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA despite a negative IF (IF-negative MPO/PR3-positive); however, the significance of this result is not clear. We sought to determine whether IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive results identified any cases of clinically meaningful systemic vasculitis at our institution.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive patients identified at our institution over a 2-year period.

- **Results**: Of the 2345 samples tested over 2 years, 1998 were IF-negative. Among these IF-negative samples, 49 samples (2.5%) derived from 38 patients tested positive for MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA. Only 1 IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive patient was subsequently diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Eleven IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive patients (29%) had been previously diagnosed and treated for AAV, all with positive IF and antibody tests prior to treatment. Four patients had evidence of cutaneous vasculitis not attributed to AAV, while several of the remaining IF-negative, MPO/PR3-positive patients had other immunologic disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (5 patients) and inflammatory bowel disease (3 patients).

- **Conclusion**: In this real-life cohort assayed simultaneously by IF and multiplexed bead assays, the detection of MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA without a positive IF rarely led to a new diagnosis of systemic vasculitis.

### Addendum to the international consensus statement on testing and reporting of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Quality control guidelines, comments, and recommendations for testing in other autoimmune diseases [^114aaJRy]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) tests are employed to diagnose and monitor inflammatory activity in Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and its renal-limited variant (pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis), as well as Churg-Strauss syndrome. The International Consensus Statement on testing and reporting of ANCA asserts that ANCA are most readily demonstrated in these conditions through a combination of indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using normal peripheral blood neutrophils and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that detect ANCA specific for proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase.

The team responsible for the International Consensus Statement has developed quality control guidelines, examples of comments for various IIF patterns and ELISA results, and recommendations for ANCA testing when inflammatory bowel disease and other non-vasculitic ANCA-associated autoimmune diseases are suspected.

### Current and emerging techniques for ANCA detection in vasculitis [^117SH3tP]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) is a well-established diagnostic test used to evaluate suspected necrotizing vasculitis of small blood vessels. Conditions associated with these antibodies, collectively referred to as ANCA-associated vasculitides, include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). The diagnostic utility of ANCA testing depends on the type of assay performed and on the clinical setting.

Most laboratories worldwide use standard indirect immunofluorescence tests (IFT) to screen for ANCA and then confirm positive IFT results with antigen-specific tests for proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Developments such as automated image analysis of immunofluorescence patterns, so-called third-generation PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA ELISA, and multiplex technology have improved the detection of ANCAs.

However, challenges in routine clinical practice remain, including methodological aspects of IFT performance, the diverse antigen-specific assays available, the diagnostic value of testing in clinical settings, and the prognostic value of serial ANCA monitoring in the prediction of disease relapse. This review summarizes the available data on ANCA testing, discusses the usefulness of the various ANCA assays, and advises on the clinical indications for the use of ANCA testing.

### Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and the Churg-Strauss syndrome [^117XrH7t]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Since testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) became available for routine evaluation, no large homogeneous cohort of patients with the Churg-Strauss syndrome has been studied.

- **Objective**: To define the clinical and biological characteristics of newly diagnosed Churg-Strauss syndrome, according to the presence or absence of ANCA.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional analysis of manifestations of participants who were enrolled in treatment trials between December 1995 and December 2002.

- **Setting**: Multicenter study in 63 clinical centers in France, Belgium, Latvia, and the United Kingdom, coordinated by the French Vasculitis Study Group.

- **Participants**: 112 patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome that was recently diagnosed on the basis of classifications.

- **Measurements**: The authors compared principal demographic, clinical, and laboratory features according to ANCA status at diagnosis.

- **Results**: The authors detected ANCA in 43 (38%) patients. Positive ANCA status at diagnosis was associated with renal involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and biopsy-proven vasculitis, whereas negative ANCA status was associated with heart disease and fever.

- **Limitations**: The authors assessed ANCA by immunofluorescence, but they did not assess ANCA centrally or systematically retest if ANCA was undetected at diagnosis.

- **Conclusions**: Phenotypically, ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative Churg-Strauss syndrome might differ. The association of ANCA positivity with clinical symptoms that indicate inflammation and necrosis of small vessels might characterize a predominantly vasculitic.

### Anca-associated vasculitis - clinical utility of using ANCA specificity to classify patients [^115dX4Ka]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are a heterogeneous group of rare syndromes characterized by necrotizing inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels and the presence of ANCAs. Several clinicopathological classification systems exist that aim to define homogeneous groups among patients with AAV, with the main syndromes being microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and eosinophilic GPA (EGPA).

Two main types of ANCA can be detected in patients with AAV, defined according to their autoantigen target: leukocyte proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Patients with GPA are predominantly PR3-ANCA-positive, whereas those with MPA are predominantly MPO-ANCA-positive, although ANCA specificity overlaps only partially with these clinical syndromes. Accumulating evidence suggests that ANCA specificity could be better than clinical diagnosis for defining homogeneous groups of patients, as PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA are associated with different genetic backgrounds and epidemiology.

ANCA specificity affects the phenotype of clinical disease, as well as the patient's initial response to remission-inducing therapy, relapse risk, and long-term prognosis. Thus, the classification of AAV by ANCA specificity rather than by clinical diagnosis could convey clinically useful information at the time of diagnosis.

### Simple, readily available clinical indices predict early and late mortality among patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis [^115J1LRC]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

The early identification of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) who are at increased risk for inferior clinical outcomes at the time of diagnosis might help optimize immunosuppressive therapy. In this study, we aimed to determine the predictive value of simple clinical characteristics that could be applied for early risk stratification of patients with AAV.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 101 consecutive patients with AAV receiving protocolized immunosuppressive therapy. Baseline Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) and non-vasculitic comorbidities were computed. Predictors of early (90 days) mortality, infectious death, relapse, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) were evaluated.

- **Results**: The baseline comorbidity score independently predicted early mortality (HR 1.622, CI 1.006–2.614) and showed an association with infectious mortality (HR 2.056, CI 1.247–3.392). Patients with BVAS at or above the median (= 21) had worse early mortality in univariable analysis (HR 3.57, CI 1.039–12.243, p = 0.031) and experienced more frequent relapses (p = 0.01) compared to patients with BVAS below the median.

- **Conclusions**: Assessing baseline comorbidities, alongside clinical indices characterizing the severity and extension of AAV, may aid clinicians in risk stratification of patients. Future prospective studies are needed to investigate whether therapies based on risk stratification could improve both short-term and long-term survival.

### Assessment of the correlation of commonly used laboratory tests with clinical activity, renal involvement and treatment of systemic small-vessel vasculitis with the presence of ANCA antibodies [^113hZj9P]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

At the time of diagnosis of active AAV, the ANCA concentration was significantly increased. The mean value was 68.16 IU/ml, and the median was 51.0 IU/ml. The administered treatment decreased ANCA in the majority of patients, but the mean value was as high as 25.68 IU/ml (p < 0.05). Despite treatment, in individual cases, the ANCA concentration remained notably high. For instance, in one woman, the ANCA level exceeded 177 IU/ml in complete clinical remission, and in another woman, the concentration increased from 51 IU/ml to 78 IU/ml.

In the remaining four patients, despite low initial ANCA concentrations of 2.2–5.2 IU/ml, high clinical activity of the disease was observed. Three patients were diagnosed with severe disease, and one with generalized disease. ANCA antibodies showed no correlation with the severity of GPA/MPA (p = 0.68).

### Clinical applications of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing [^111vR8j7]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are closely associated with Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome, and have contributed to new pathogenetic concepts and improved nomenclature of systemic vasculitides, specifically antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides. However, the application of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing as a clinical diagnostic tool is still regarded as controversial. This review summarizes the most recent developments in the field, identifies areas of uncertainty, and provides practical guidelines.

- **Recent findings**: The problems of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing include the diversity of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody target antigens, assay standardization and performance, the application of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing in a clinical setting with a low pretest probability, and the widespread assumption that antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titers alone may closely reflect disease activity and therefore may be used to guide therapy.

Recent findings demonstrate that the combined use of indirect immunofluorescence tests and solid phase assays to detect antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies directed against myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 can minimize the occurrence of false-positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody results. Furthermore, the yield of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing can be improved by the use of a well-standardized test, adherence to published guidelines, and restricting the use of the tests to clinical situations with appropriate pretest probability levels.

### Audit of the clinical usefulness of a rapid qualitative ELISA screen for antimyeloperoxidase and antiproteinase 3 antibodies in the assessment of patients with suspected vasculitis [^112JFa9c]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

The need for urgent antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) results when assessing patients with acute renal failure, pulmonary renal syndrome, or mononeuritis multiplex has led to the development of a rapid qualitative ELISA screening assay for antibodies to myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3).

- **Aims**: To report the use of a rapid qualitative ELISA screen for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA in a regional immunology laboratory and its correlation with standard indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and quantitative ELISA for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA.

- **Methods**: Over 12 months, 103 samples requiring urgent ANCA testing were screened by a rapid qualitative ELISA and the results compared with IIF and quantitative ELISA assays for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA.

- **Results**: There was an excellent correlation between the rapid qualitative ELISA and standard ANCA IIF and a routine ELISA for MPO/PR3-ANCA, with sensitivities ranging from 82% to 100%. There were two false negatives, which gave weak to moderately positive values as determined by routine ELISA. However, the clinical relevance of these two cases is doubtful.

- **Conclusions**: The rapid ELISA for anti-MPO and anti-PR3 correlates well with quantitative ELISA and IIF ANCA, and urgent management decisions in patients with suspected small vessel vasculitis can be based with confidence on this test.

### A dual-fixed neutrophil substrate improves interpretation of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence [^112QW8Xx]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

To determine whether the addition of a formalin-fixed neutrophil substrate could improve interpretation and prediction of autoantigenic specificity in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing. Routine diagnostic samples sent for ANCA testing were analyzed prospectively on a dual substrate of both ethanol- and formalin-fixed neutrophils. Positive samples on ethanol-fixed neutrophils were deemed:

- **Typical**: If formalin-fixed neutrophils also stained.
- **Atypical**: If formalin-fixed neutrophils did not stain.

Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) results were correlated with antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) and anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) results with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Of 1,426 samples, 201 from unique patients were ANCA-positive (200 on IIF, 1 on ELISA alone). Thirty-two (45%) of 71 typical ANCA staining patterns were positive for either an anti-MPO or anti-PR3 antibodies, whereas only one (0.8%) of 129 atypical patterns was ELISA-positive in a patient without systemic vasculitis. Only one (3%) of 34 ELISA-positive samples had a negative IIF-ANCA (1/1,426 patients, 0.07%), and this patient did not have vasculitis.

Concomitant staining on formalin fixation of IIF-positive ethanol-fixed ANCA samples improves the interpretation of ANCA testing and is predictive of vasculitis autoantigens MPO and PR3.
