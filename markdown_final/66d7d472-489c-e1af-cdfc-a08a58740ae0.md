## Question

In a patient with diabetic kidney disease, can you continue sglti once the egfr drops below 20

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an SGLT2 inhibitor should be continued in a patient with diabetic kidney disease once the eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², and under what conditions it should be stopped. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative guideline positions. Then, I should verify the pivotal trial data that inform continuation below eGFR 20. Next, I will examine safety signals and the expected eGFR dip. After that, I need to check for any exceptions or scenarios where stopping is warranted. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, monitoring-aware recommendation with dosing and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the guideline stance, because that frames best practice. KDIGO 2024 explicitly recommends considering continuation of SGLT2 inhibitors even if eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², unless the therapy is not tolerated or kidney replacement therapy is initiated, which signals a strong endorsement to continue in advanced CKD when safe [^6b782b17] [^9d801ad5] [^ac1d1ae7]. The UK Kidney Association 2023 update goes further, providing a grade 2B recommendation to consider initiation even when eGFR is below 20 mL/min/1.73 m² in selected patients, underscoring that both continuation and, in some cases, initiation can be appropriate in this range [^4a28020e] [^43f38971] [^fd7971ca]. I should also confirm that major diabetes guidelines align with this approach; ADA 2025 and AACE 2022 both support use down to eGFR 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and emphasize continuation for kidney and cardiovascular protection rather than glycemic control per se [^093f3aff] [^5d00ef8b] [^c26a7eb0].

> Wait, let me verify the trial evidence that makes this recommendation evidence-based rather than extrapolation. EMPA-KIDNEY enrolled participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and demonstrated a 28% reduction in kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death, with consistent benefits across eGFR strata, including those with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², supporting continuation at low eGFR [^fa234564] [^66b29871]. DAPA-CKD included patients down to eGFR 25 mL/min/1.73 m² and showed a 39% reduction in the composite kidney outcome, with subgroup analyses indicating benefit even when eGFR was below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², reinforcing class efficacy at low GFR [^63f33ec6] [^940e04cd]. CREDENCE, while enrolling down to eGFR 30 mL/min/1.73 m², explicitly continued therapy until dialysis or transplant and showed robust kidney benefits, establishing precedent for continuation as kidney function declines [^63f33ec6] [^308d39d3]. A collaborative meta-analysis including these trials concluded that kidney benefits are consistent down to eGFR around 20 mL/min/1.73 m², which directly informs continuation decisions below 20 in many patients [^f13ccfb5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I need to check the expected hemodynamic effects and monitoring thresholds. SGLT2 inhibitors cause a predictable, reversible eGFR dip of about 3–5 mL/min/1.73 m² shortly after initiation due to reduced intraglomerular pressure; this is protective long term and not a reason to stop unless the decline exceeds about 30% from baseline or is accompanied by concerning clinical features, in which case I should reassess volume status, blood pressure, and concomitant medications before deciding to discontinue [^ca579b2b] [^6b782b17] [^b77bf1db]. I should confirm that major guidelines advise not altering CKD monitoring frequency solely because SGLT2 therapy was started, which helps avoid unnecessary discontinuation for expected dips [^367bc278] [^a465263f].

> I will now examine the key exceptions where continuation is not advised. If the patient is not tolerating therapy due to recurrent genital mycotic infections, volume depletion, or other adverse effects, then stopping is reasonable. Likewise, once kidney replacement therapy is initiated, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally discontinued because the pathophysiologic rationale and trial evidence do not extend to dialysis, though emerging studies are exploring this question [^6b782b17] [^9d801ad5] [^f2380e87]. But wait, what if the patient has type 1 diabetes or is at high risk for euglycemic ketoacidosis? In that case, SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated or require extreme caution, so I should confirm diabetes type and ketoacidosis risk before continuing therapy in advanced CKD [^971ef83c] [^62cf3ada].

> Let me consider dosing and practical management, because I need to ensure we apply this safely. For glycemic purposes, the glucose-lowering effect wanes as eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², so I should not expect meaningful A1C reduction below 20 mL/min/1.73 m²; however, the kidney and cardiovascular benefits persist, so the indication for continuation is renoprotection and cardiorenal risk reduction rather than glycemic control [^9ae994e4] [^747debff]. I should double-check that no dose escalation is needed for cardiorenal benefit; indeed, trials used fixed doses and dose titration is not required for kidney or heart outcomes, which simplifies care in advanced CKD [^ded576d2]. I need to ensure we mitigate volume depletion risk by reviewing diuretics and blood pressure agents at initiation and after any eGFR dip, and I should educate on sick-day rules and perioperative holds to reduce ketoacidosis risk [^402bb46d] [^971ef83c].

> Next, I should review how to monitor and when to act. I should confirm that a post-initiation eGFR decline up to about 20–30% is expected and not an automatic reason to stop; if the decline exceeds 30% or is accompanied by symptoms, I should reassess volume status, blood pressure, and interacting drugs, and only consider discontinuation if no reversible cause is found or if intolerance persists [^ca579b2b] [^c9f0e962]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with real-world safety data; large observational cohorts and meta-analyses show no excess AKI signal and generally favorable safety profiles even at low eGFR, which supports continuation with routine monitoring rather than preemptive stopping [^b77bf1db] [^cb6ca7c5].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, in diabetic kidney disease, SGLT2 inhibitors should generally be continued even if eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², unless the patient is not tolerating therapy or has started kidney replacement therapy, because the kidney and cardiovascular benefits persist and the safety profile remains acceptable with appropriate monitoring and risk mitigation [^6b782b17] [^9d801ad5] [^fa234564]. I need to ensure shared decision-making, especially if eGFR is very low, and document the rationale for continuation alongside a plan to monitor for adverse effects and reassess if clinical status changes [^402bb46d].

In diabetic kidney disease, **SGLT2 inhibitors can be continued even if eGFR drops below 20 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^6b782b17] if the patient is tolerating therapy and has not yet started dialysis or kidney transplantation [^9d801ad5]. The kidney and cardiovascular benefits persist at low eGFR, and major guidelines (KDIGO 2024, UK Kidney Association 2023, ADA 2025) support continuation unless therapy is not tolerated or kidney replacement therapy is initiated [^6b782b17] [^4a28020e] [^093f3aff]. Monitor for adverse effects and adjust concomitant medications as needed, but routine discontinuation solely for eGFR < 20 is not recommended [^c9f0e962].

## Clinical evidence supporting continuation below eGFR 20

Recent trials and meta-analyses show that **SGLT2 inhibitors reduce kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events** even at low eGFR:

- **EMPA-KIDNEY**: Included participants with eGFR down to 20 mL/min/1.73 m²; empagliflozin reduced kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% regardless of diabetes status, with consistent benefits across eGFR strata, including eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^fa234564] [^66b29871].

- **DAPA-CKD**: Included participants with eGFR down to 25 mL/min/1.73 m²; dapagliflozin reduced the composite kidney outcome by 39% with benefits evident in those with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^63f33ec6] [^940e04cd].

- **Meta-analyses**: Large meta-analyses confirm consistent kidney and cardiovascular benefits across a range of eGFR, including patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² [^f13ccfb5] [^cb6ca7c5].

## Guideline recommendations

Major nephrology and diabetes guidelines align on **continuation below eGFR 20**:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding continuation below eGFR 20** |
|-|-|
| KDIGO 2024 | Continue SGLT2 inhibitors even if eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², unless not tolerated or kidney replacement therapy is initiated [^6b782b17] [^9d801ad5] |
| UK Kidney Association 2023 | Consider initiating or continuing SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73 m², recognizing potential absolute benefits given high risk of progression [^4a28020e] [^43f38971] |
| ADA 2025 | Initiate and continue SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2DM and CKD with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m², with continuation considered even if eGFR declines below 20 if tolerated and not requiring dialysis [^093f3aff] [^5d00ef8b] |

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

While benefits persist, **clinicians should monitor for adverse effects** and adjust concomitant therapies:

- **Volume depletion**: Monitor for hypotension or dehydration, especially with diuretics or in elderly patients [^402bb46d] [^62cf3ada].

- **Hyperkalemia**: SGLT2 inhibitors generally reduce hyperkalemia risk, but monitor potassium, particularly with ACE inhibitors or ARBs [^c9f0e962].

- **Genital infections**: Educate on hygiene and recognize infections early [^402bb46d].

- **Acute kidney injury**: SGLT2 inhibitors reduce AKI risk, but monitor for intercurrent illness or perioperative periods when temporary holding may be prudent [^b77bf1db] [^971ef83c].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting discontinuation

Continuation is broadly supported, but **discontinuation is appropriate** when:

- **Intolerance**: Persistent adverse effects such as recurrent genital infections, volume depletion, or symptomatic hypotension [^notfound].

- **Dialysis or transplantation**: Initiation of kidney replacement therapy [^6b782b17] [^9d801ad5].

- **Significant eGFR decline**: Rapid, unexplained declines in eGFR (> 30% from baseline) warrant evaluation and may necessitate stopping therapy [^ca579b2b] [^c9f0e962].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Continue SGLT2 inhibitors**: Even if eGFR drops below 20 mL/min/1.73 m², if the patient is tolerating therapy and has not started dialysis or transplantation [^6b782b17] [^9d801ad5].

- **Monitor closely**: Watch for adverse effects, volume status, and kidney function changes [^c9f0e962].

- **Discontinue if**: Therapy is not tolerated, kidney replacement therapy is initiated, or there is a rapid, unexplained decline in eGFR [^6b782b17] [^ca579b2b].

---

In diabetic kidney disease, **SGLT2 inhibitors can be continued even when eGFR falls below 20 mL/min/1.73 m²** if the patient is tolerating therapy and has not yet started dialysis or transplantation, with benefits persisting at low eGFR and guideline support for continuation [^6b782b17] [^4a28020e] [^093f3aff].

### Impact of diabetes on the effects of sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors on kidney outcomes: collaborative meta-analysis of large placebo-controlled trials [^f13ccfb5]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Based on the average risk in different trial populations, we estimated that for every 1000 patients with chronic kidney disease treated for one year with an SGLT2 inhibitor, 11 first kidney disease progression events would be prevented in patients with diabetes, and 15 would be prevented in patients without diabetes. In these patients, such treatment also appeared to result in an estimated four to five fewer acute kidney injury events in patients with and without diabetes. Individual trials have shown that kidney benefits translate into important reductions in the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, and the cardiovascular and kidney benefits appear to be cost-saving in diabetic chronic kidney disease. We found no good evidence that the kidney benefits were modified by the average level of kidney function studied in the trials. Importantly, efficacy and safety data from EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD combined include information on nearly 3000 patients with an eGFR of 20–30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. A total of 489 kidney disease progression outcomes accrued in those with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 in those two trials. Although some clinical practice guidelines have started recommending use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes at eGFRs down to 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 (based on grade B levels of evidence), many other recommendations limit initiation to those with eGFR greater than 25 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 or 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. As patients with decreased eGFR are at the highest absolute risk of kidney disease progression, our findings should encourage the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 with continued use below this level. Several hundred participants in the chronic kidney disease trials had an eGFR below 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 at randomisation or during follow-up (eg, 254 participants in EMPA-KIDNEY at randomisation), providing indirect evidence to support initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in selected patients with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min per 1.73 m 2.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: sodium-glucose Co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibition in adults with kidney disease 2023 UPDATE [^e7041cb4]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Two of the four clinical trials of SGLT-2 inhibition conducted in people with CKD have enrolled people without diabetes (DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY), and in both trials SGLT-2 inhibition has been continued below an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73m 2 without evidence of increased adverse events. In EMPA-KIDNEY, in which over half of the participants did not have diabetes, SGLT-2 inhibition was shown to have consistent relative benefits across the spectrum of eGFR, including among people with eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73m 2 (Fig. 4). Given that people with low eGFR are at high risk of progression to kidney failure, the absolute benefit is likely to be considerable for this population, irrespective of diabetes status. We therefore provide a grade 2B Recommendation for initiation of use of SGLT-2 inhibition for people without type 2 DM with eGFR < 20 mL/min/1.73m 2.

Recommendations for implementation in people with or without type 2 diabetes

We recommend using SGLT-2 inhibitors with demonstrated efficacy for their given indications (Grade 1A).

Rationale

Government regulators review data from randomised trials and assess their reliability through regulatory inspections. Regulatory licences/indications therefore provide a key guide to which SGLT-2 inhibitors have generated definitive evidence of efficacy and safety for a given use. We therefore recommend selecting SGLT-2 inhibitors according to these licensed indications, wherever possible (summaries of which are provided in section 4 of the Supplementary appendix).
2 We recommend using clinically appropriate single agent renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade in combination with SGLT-2 inhibition, wherever RAS blockade is indicated and tolerated (Grade 1A)

The disconnect between glucose lowering and effects on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes is a characteristic feature of SGLT2 inhibition. This is further supported by head-to-head data showing that canagliflozin slows the loss of kidney function compared with glimepiride and that kidney benefits are independent of HbA1c before and during therapy, and by the degree of HbA1c lowering.

Because the risk of ESKD and cardiovascular mortality increases substantially as eGFR declines, the absolute effects of treatment with SGLT2 inhibition are likely to be at least as large, if not greater, in patients with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 compared with those with preserved kidney function. In the CREDENCE trial, the estimated number of primary events prevented per 1000 patients treated over 2.6 years is substantially greater in participants with a starting eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1

The accumulated trial evidence provides strong evidence that SGLT2 inhibition should be prioritized in people with T2DM and CKD, including those with a starting eGFR of 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Importantly, in the CREDENCE trial, participants whose eGFR fell to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 continued on randomized treatment until dialysis or transplantation. As a result, the FDA now permits the continued use of canagliflozin with an eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 until dialysis or transplantation in people already initiated on therapy.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, SGLT-2 inhibitors, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider continuing SGLT-2 inhibitors even if the eGFR falls < 20 mL/min/1.73 m², unless it is not tolerated or RRT is initiated.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^971ef83c]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease primary care — SGLT2 inhibitor safety, perioperative management, and eGFR thresholds: SGLT2i treatment is contraindicated for type 1 diabetes, and caution should be taken when titrating down insulin doses in patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin at initiation of SGLT2i therapy due to risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Multiple perioperative guidelines suggest holding SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical illness and reinitiating after an acute event has passed. With SGLT2i initiation, there is an expected, reversible decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and other guideline development groups have deemed this reversible decrease safe enough to recommend not reassessing eGFR following the initiation of SGLT2i therapy. In the evidence review, the lowest eGFR for initiation was 20 mL/min/1.73m2. Most studies did not specify discontinuation thresholds; two specified discontinuation when eGFR was < 15mL/min/1.73m2, and one specified discontinuation at the start of hemodialysis. There appeared to be continued efficacy until initiation of dialysis, and the Work Group suggests continuation of SGLT2i treatment until patients are started on dialysis. Work Group members raised concerns that SGLT2i may potentiate volume depletion with loop diuretics; additional monitoring might be indicated and, depending on volume status, a decrease in diuretics at initiation might be warranted.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^a1a01047]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate thresholds for SGLT2 inhibitor use — initiation, continuation, and trial enrollment: The guideline specifies a lower limit eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 for initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor, but maintains that it is safe to continue until reaching the need for KRT. DAPA-CKD and EMPEROR enrolled patients down to an eGFR of 25 and 20 mL/ min/1.73 m2, respectively. EMPA-KIDNEY (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03594110) is enrolling patients down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. It may be appropriate in patients with uACR > 1,000 mg/g who are at high risk for rapid decline in eGFR or have a history of rapid eGFR decline to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor at an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, as the DAPA-CKD trial is directly applicable to patients with CKD.

### Concordance with screening and treatment guidelines for CKD in type 2 diabetes… [^39323960]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective To identify risk factors for nonconcordance with guideline-recommended CKD screening and treatment in patients with T2D. Design, Setting, and Participants. A separate analysis reviewed prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in adults with CKD and an outpatient clinician visit for T2D between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Compared with patients with eGFR of at least 120 mL/min/1. 73 m2, patients with eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1. 73 m2 had a lower risk of nonconcordance with CKD screening guidelines. Additionally, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, and prescription of thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and statins were associated with a lower risk of nontreatment.

As the eGFR increased, the risk of nontreatment decreased. Compared with patients with an eGFR of 60 to 90 mL/min/1. 73 m2, patients with an eGFR of 30 to 44 mL/min/1. 73 m2 were less likely to receive treatment. In contrast, patients with lower eGFR and select cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to receive CKD screening. Additionally, despite the novel approach of evaluating only encounters after FDA approval of SGLT2 inhibitors to treat CKD and including patients who approximated the stringent inclusion criteria for the corresponding phase 3 studies, only 3. 6% of patients with CKD received both ACEI or ARB and SGLT2 inhibitor therapies, primarily driven by a paucity of SGLT2 inhibitor prescriptions. Peripheral arterial disease and lower eGFR were associated with nontreatment. Interventions could also emphasize the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with peripheral arterial disease or lower eGFR.

These benefits appear to be irrespective of diabetes status, cause of kidney disease, or level of GFR.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^c26a7eb0]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) for kidney protection in T2D — An SGLT2i with proven kidney protection is recommended for people with T2D who have an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2; in those with HF, empagliflozin can be used with an eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and if eGFR drops below this level on treatment, the SGLT2i does not have to be stopped unless kidney replacement therapy is required. Recognized side effects are not greater at lower eGFR, initial reports of higher rates of lower extremity amputation with canagliflozin have not been substantiated, SGLT2is tend to lower serum potassium, and the risk of AKI is actually reduced by 25% with SGLT2i use in persons with T2D.

### 2023 UPDATE: luso-Brazilian evidence-based guideline for the management of antidiabetic therapy in type 2 diabetes [^7dc322fc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence

In the EMPA-KIDNEY trial, patients with CKD (eGFR 20 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or eGFR of 45–90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR ≥ 200 mg/g) were randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin ten mg/d or matching placebo (n = 6,609). The primary outcome was a composite of the progression of kidney disease. During a median of 2.0 years of follow-up, progression of kidney disease occurred in 13.1% in the empagliflozin group and 16.9% in the placebo group (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.82, P < 0.001). Results were consistent across the subgroups defined according to eGFR ranges, including patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2.
The KDIGO 2020 guideline states that long-term benefits of SGLT2i regarding eGFR preservation are observed despite the initial decline and a reversible decrease after initiating SGLT2i. In the CREDENCE trial, canagliflozin was continued among participants whose eGFR fell below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Based on the CREDENCE protocol, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 unless not tolerated or ESKD is initiated.

### Association of SGLT2 inhibitors with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis [^8de11bc3]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

When initially approved for clinical use, SGLT2 inhibitors had product-labeled cautions or contraindications for use in patients with reduced eGFR, based exclusively on the attenuation of glycemic efficacy as eGFR wanes and without specific safety concerns that typically underpin eGFR-based prescriptions. However, with the demonstration of CV and kidney benefits across the spectrum of kidney function in patients enrolled in trials to date, an eGFR as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, the CANVAS trials, VERTIS CV, and CREDENCE, liberalization of these restrictions is now justified. For example, based on the results from CREDENCE, canagliflozin has a product-labeled indication to reduce the incidence and progression of kidney disease, approved for initiation down to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, with use allowed to continue in patients taking canagliflozin until initiation of dialysis. Similarly, society recommendations and guidelines endorse the use of all SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or higher, independent of glucose considerations and based wholly on the CV and kidney benefits as supported by the present meta-analyses.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, SGLT-2 inhibitors, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that the initiation or use of SGLT-2 inhibitors does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^093f3aff]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended for high-risk CKD and for use at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for individuals at high risk of CKD progression, and for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. The eGFR limit is supported by major trial criteria (CREDENCE: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 300 mg/g; DAPA-CKD: eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 200 mg/g), analyses suggesting safety and effectiveness at eGFR levels of > 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and EMPA-KIDNEY efficacy in participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment.

### The impact of metformin on kidney disease progression and mortality in diabetic patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: a real-world cohort study [^6ed878e2]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are the leading causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and significantly contribute to ongoing morbidity. For the past two decades, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended metformin as the first-line therapy for T2D, owing to its efficacy, affordability, weight neutrality, and benefits in cardiovascular outcomes as well as its potential role in slowing kidney disease progression. However, the latest 2022 consensus on Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, joint issued by ADA and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), also advocates for the inclusion of sodium-glucose -cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in all diabetes patients as part of the comprehensive approach to managing glucose levels and reducing cardiovascular and renovascular risk. Specifically, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended for all T2D patients with diabetic kidney disease and an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) above 20 ml/min/1.73 m 2, to mitigate CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular events, regardless of baseline HbA1c, or metformin use. These recommendations are particularly crucial for patients with multiple atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors, established ASCVD, or diabetic kidney disease.

Substantial evidence indicates that inadequate glycemic control within the initial years following T2D diagnosis is strongly correlated with a higher risk of future microvascular and macrovascular complications, as well as increased mortality. This "glycemic legacy" effect, consistently observed in both randomized controlled trials and real-world observational studies, underscores the critical importance of selecting first-line medications or combination therapies for T2D that not only optimize glycemic control but also provide significant cardiovascular and renal protective benefits.

In recent years, accumulating data has reinforced the benefits of metformin in improving cardiovascular and renal outcomes, even in patients with progressive CKD and eGFR levels below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Nevertheless the 2022 joint ADA and KDIGO guidelines, while recognizing metformin's superior efficacy in glycemia control, highlight a reduced efficacy in cardiovascular and renal protection when compared with SGLT2 inhibitors. Whether metformin offers additional renal protection and survival benefits when combined with SGLT2 inhibitors remains uncertain.

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the real-world impact of a combined metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors regimen, compared to treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors alone, on renal progression outcomes and all-cause mortality in T2D patients.

Rationale notes that "Large trials individually and when combined in meta-analysis demonstrate clear net benefits of SGLT2i, with benefits particularly large in people without diabetes due to almost no risk of serious harm from ketoacidosis or lower-limb amputation", and that "SGLT2i reduced the risk of AKI by 23% in people with or without diabetes (Figure 22)". Additional effects include that "SGLT2i also favorably reduce BP, uric acid levels, fluid overload, and the risk of serious hyperkalemia". For patients with concomitant heart failure, "a person with CKD and heart failure has a clear indication for the use of SGLT2i to reduce risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure irrespective of level of albuminuria". Evidence certainty statements indicate "The overall certainty of evidence for the efficacy of SGLT2i to delay CKD progression in people with CKD without diabetes is moderate", supported by an IPD meta-analysis "which included data from 2 RCTs evaluating an SGLT2 inhibitor among adults with CKD but not diabetes", where "Both RCTs were considered to have a low risk of bias". Certainty gradings specify "The certainty of the evidence for CKD progression was graded as high" and "The certainty of the evidence for kidney failure was downgraded to moderate due to imprecision".

SGLT2 inhibition across different levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

The completed trials included participants with varying levels of baseline eGFR and albuminuria. In the three cardiovascular outcome trials, the proportion of participants with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ranged from 7.4 to 25.9%. In contrast, ∼60% of participants in CREDENCE had a baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Most participants in the cardiovascular outcome trials had levels of albuminuria within the normal range at baseline, whereas those in the CREDENCE trial were required to have a urinary albumin:creatinine ratio of at least 300 mg/g at enrolment. While protection against kidney failure with SGLT2 inhibitors other than canagliflozin remains to be demonstrated in the ongoing kidney outcome trials, the accumulated trial evidence has allowed for a robust assessment of the effects of SGLT2 inhibition in patients with T2DM across varying levels of eGFR and albuminuria.

The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is directly proportional to glomerular filtration, and thus glycaemic efficacy decreases substantially as kidney function declines. Because regulatory approvals for these drugs have been primarily based on their ability to reduce glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), SGLT2 inhibitors have largely not been approved for use in people with an eGFR < 45 mL/min1.73 m 2. However, in the CREDENCE trial, the effect of canagliflozin on doubling of serum creatinine, ESKD or death due to kidney disease {hazard ratio [HR] 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–0.81]} was consistent across all levels of kidney function down to an eGFR of 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2. The effect of canagliflozin on cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke [HR 0.80 (95% CI 0.67–0.95)] was also not modified by baseline kidney function. While largely powered by the effects of canagliflozin observed in the CREDENCE trial, a recent meta-analysis of the four major trials showed that SGLT2 inhibition reduces the risk of progression of kidney disease across all levels of kidney function studied to date, including ∼30% proportional risk reduction in people with an eGFR of 30–45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, in whom the glucose-lowering effect is almost completely abrogated.

### Canagliflozin for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease and implications for clinical practice: a narrative review [^150b0ab7]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Renal outcomes data for people with DKD are not yet available for other SGLT2 inhibitors; however, trials for the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin and empagliflozin that include this population as well as people with CKD (without T2DM) are ongoing and expected to be completed in late 2020 and 2022, respectively. These data may help to clarify whether the renal benefits seen with canagliflozin in CREDENCE trial participants are a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors and whether these effects may extend to people with CKD who do not have T2DM to further establish the renal efficacy and safety of this class of drugs.

The results from the CREDENCE trial prompted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand the indication for canagliflozin to a new patient population. Prior to CREDENCE, canagliflozin was approved for two indications: (1) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM and (2) to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease. On the basis of results from the CREDENCE trial, the FDA approved canagliflozin to reduce the risk of ESKD, doubling of serum creatinine, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with T2DM and diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria (> 300 mg/day). The US prescribing information for canagliflozin was also updated to allow the continuation of canagliflozin 100 mg in people already receiving therapy whose eGFR falls to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with a UACR > 300 mg/g until initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation. Evidence from the CREDENCE trial also prompted the American Diabetes Association to update its guidelines in June 2019 to recommend that people with T2DM with an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and albuminuria (> 300 mg/g) consider using an SGLT2 inhibitor to reduce their risk of DKD progression and/or cardiovascular events. Further updates to these guidelines published in 2020 suggested that SGLT2 inhibitors should be considered independently of HbA1c for people when atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or CKD predominates or for people with T2DM and CKD who require treatment in addition to metformin to attain target HbA1c. Taken together, these new recommendations demonstrate that canagliflozin treatment is beneficial to a diverse array of people in a broad range of circumstances, and physicians should consider the unique characteristics of each patient when determining if canagliflozin is an appropriate treatment option (Fig. 8).

KDIGO 2024 CKD — hemodynamically active therapies and eGFR change: Practice Point 2.1.4 states that among people with chronic kidney disease who initiate hemodynamically active therapies, "GFR reductions of > 30% on subsequent testing exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation". Acute eGFR decline after intensive blood pressure control shows "reductions of 10%–20% being typical within the first 3 months of treatment", and "acute rises in SCr (or declines in eGFR) of < 20%–30% are expected and do not warrant changes in therapeutic agents". Trials of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) suggest participants with " > 10% initial drop in eGFR" have similar outcomes "except in unusual cases when the acute "dip" in eGFR was > 30% from baseline". A "significant drop in eGFR (> 30%)" during initiation of antihypertensives, renin–angiotensin system inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, or SGLT2i "should prompt a review into other causes and warrants close monitoring", and providers "should avoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents" because early dips are "typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity".

### SGLT2 inhibition for the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease: a review [^f7abf8dd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States and the world alike, and there is a great unmet need for treatments to reduce DKD development and progression. Inhibition of sodium/glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubule of the kidney has emerged as an effective antihyperglycemic treatment, leading to regulatory approval of several first-generation SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In follow-on clinical trials for the cardiovascular safety of the SGLT2 inhibitors, secondary effects to prevent or reduce albuminuria and decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate spurred further investigation into their potential application in DKD. This review summarizes the current understanding of mechanisms by which SGLT2 inhibitors block glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule and improve systemic glucose homeostasis, the hypothesized mechanisms for kidney-protective effects of SGLT2 inhibition, and current recommendations for use of this class of antihyperglycemic agents in diabetic patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rates. Results of ongoing clinical trials in patients with DKD are eagerly awaited to expand knowledge of how SGLT2 inhibitors might be used for prevention and treatment.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in type 2 diabetes — SGLT2 inhibitors have kidney and cardiovascular benefits, but their glucose-lowering effect decreases at low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and CKD increases hypoglycemia risk requiring careful monitoring with insulin or sulfonylureas. Dedicated kidney outcomes trials in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes have shown that the SGLT2 inhibitors empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and dapagliflozin have beneficial effects on slowing progression of CKD and CV outcomes. However, their ability to lower glucose levels declines when the eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m². A secondary analysis of the GRADE trial found that insulin glargine, liraglutide, sitagliptin, and glimepiride did not prevent CKD when added to metformin in those without underlying CKD. Individuals with CKD are at high risk for hypoglycemia, and if treated with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, treatment needs close monitoring and adjustment as eGFR declines with education on hypoglycemia occurrence.

1.5 Acute effects on measurements of kidney function

It is well established that SGLT2 inhibitors result in an initial drop in total eGFR, related to altered intra‐renal haemodynamics. Reductions in intraglomerular pressure may acutely cause a drop in eGFR due to reduced filtration pressure but are protective against decline in kidney function over time by reducing nephron loss. The effect on eGFR was clearly demonstrated in the CREDENCE trial, where participants receiving canagliflozin experienced a larger reduction in eGFR in the first 3 weeks than with placebo (between‐group difference of −3.17 mL/min/1.73 m 2) but then a much smaller decline in eGFR over time (−1.85 ± 0.13 vs. −4.59 ± 0.14 mL/min/1.73 m 2). By 12 months, the two groups had a similar change in eGFR from baseline, and thereafter, the canagliflozin arm had a more favourable eGFR change from baseline. The acute drop in eGFR reverses upon medication cessation, providing reassurance it is not due to injury. Large trials including the CANagliflozin CardioVascular Assessment Study (CANVAS) and the Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients – Removing Excess Glucose (EMPA‐REG OUTCOME) trials of canagliflozin and empagliflozin respectively demonstrated the acute treatment‐associated eGFR drop was reversible when treatment was ceased at the end of the study.

Despite early reports raising concern about an AKI risk with SGLT2 inhibitor use, later clinical trial evidenceand large real‐world studies, have demonstrated SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of AKI.

As in the EMPA‐KIDNEY trial, empagliflozin can be prescribed with an eGFR of 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2, while dapagliflozin was used with an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the DAPA‐CKD trial. The CREDENCE trial demonstrated safe continuation of SGLT2 inhibitors until reaching end‐stage kidney failure. Analyses of the EMPA‐KIDNEY and DAPA‐CKD trials showed benefits to kidney protection regardless of the initial acute eGFR drop. The decision of whether SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued after an acute eGFR drop of more than 30% remains uncertain.

### Chronic kidney disease in diabetes: guidelines from KDIGO… [^0099d2ad]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Structured diabetes self-management education programs are recommended because they improve self-efficacy and clinical outcomes.
- First-line antiglycemic treatment for type 2 diabetes and CKD with eGFR as low as 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 should include metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor to improve cardiovascular outcomes and limit CKD progression. Glycemic Treatment For people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with an eGFR 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 or higher, metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, in combination, are recommended for first-line medical treatment because they improve glycemic control outcomes. Metformin limits weight gain and reduces cardiovascular events, whereas the SGLT2 inhibitor improves cardiovascular outcomes and limits kidney disease progression. Metformin is safe in patients with an eGFR above 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 unless risk for acute kidney injury is high.

The dose of metformin should be reduced when eGFR is less than 45 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 and discontinued when eGFR is less than 30 mL per minute per

1. 73 m 2 or in people treated with dialysis. SGLT2 inhibitor use can cause a reversible decline in eGFR that usually does not require stopping the medication. The SGLT2 inhibitor can be continued with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 if well-tolerated and dialysis is not imminent. SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated with genital mycotic infections and rare diabetic ketoacidosis. Limb amputations were increased in one trial. The guidelines recommend treatment with a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist in patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved glycemic goals despite use of metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or who are unable to use those medications. Some of the GLP-1 receptor agonists have a beneficial effect in reducing cardiovascular events.

GLP-1 receptor agonist trials are safe with an eGFR as low as 15 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. Am J Manag Care. 2018; 24: S138–S145.

### Barriers to initiating SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease: a real-world study [^3a3fdd21]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) attributed to diabetes (diabetic kidney disease) occurs in 20–40% of patients with diabetes. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a clinical diagnosis made based on the presence of albuminuria and/or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). It is caused by hyperglycemia, hypertension, aging, and other risk factors of chronic kidney disease. Although the prevalence of DKD is increasing, there are few medications to treat or slow its disease course.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) is a renoprotective glucose-lowering drug. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) is effective in protecting against the progression of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes (T2D). American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that the use of an SGLT2i for patients with T2D and DKD having an eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) > 30 mg/g, particularly in those with UACR > 300 mg/g.

However, real-world evidence demonstrates that SGLT2i is currently underutilized for eligible patients and that the decision to start SGLT2i is typically deferred to the endocrinologist. Although recent studies have reported that the use of SGLT2i reached 6.2% in T2D and CKD, they did not clarify the barriers against initiation of SGLT2i, including clinical factors such as the impact of glycemic control.

Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with T2D who received SGLT2i and factors limiting the initiation of SGLT2i in patients with eGFR ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and UACR ≥ 30 mg/g in diabetes clinics from teaching hospitals.

Rationale

The excellent safety profile of SGLT-2 inhibition in people with CKD without DM has been established in nearly 5000 such people from DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY. DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY demonstrated beneficial effects across the spectrum of eGFR in terms of progression of kidney disease in people with and without diabetes (Fig. 5). Furthermore, EMPA-KIDNEY also showed that among people without albuminuria rate of kidney function decline (chronic eGFR slope) was reduced by 0.78 mL/min/1.73m 2 per year in participants with A1 levels of albuminuria (< 30 mg/g) to a rate of -0.11 mL/min/1.73m 2 per year, and by 1.20 mL/min/1.73m 2 per year in participants with A2 levels (30–299 mg/g; Fig. 3). Such absolute benefits would be predicted to translate into clinically meaningful reductions in progression of kidney disease, even among people with low albuminuria at baseline. Among those with low levels of albuminuria and low eGFR at initiation, such effects on eGFR decline could translate into delay in the onset of kidney failure if used over a period of years. Furthermore, SGLT-2 inhibition has been shown to reduce the risk of AKI and cardiovascular risk, as well as hospitalisations from any cause. Given the clear magnitude of benefit of SGLT-2 inhibition in this population and the reassuring safety profile, we provide a grade 1 Recommendation for this statement. However, at present only EMPA-KIDNEY provides direct evidence in this population, with further supporting evidence obtained from eGFR slopes of the trials in heart failure (i.e.g.rade B level of evidence). Cost-effective analyses in this group would provide valuable additional information.
3 We suggest clinicians consider initiating SGLT-2 inhibition in people with an eGFR below 20 mL/min/1.73m 2 to slow progression of kidney disease (Grade 2B)

Empagliflozin lowered progression of kidney disease and death from cardiovascular causes (HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.64–0.82]; P < 0.001). Notably, while glucose-lowering effects are blunted with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2, renal and cardiovascular benefits were still seen at eGFR levels as low as < 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 with no significant change in long-term eGFR decline compared with standard of care.

Use of SGLT2i in patients DKD: impact of eGFR

Since 2016, scientific societies have also suggested the role of SGLT2i in patients with T2DM and specific comorbidities. Table 2 summarizes some of the key position manuscripts. Overall, scientific societies recommend considering SGLT2is as preferential agents to treat T2DM on top of metformin when patients have atherosclerotic CVD, heart failure or DKD. Contrary to the FDA, which provides different regulatory advice for each drug according to specific cardiovascular safety trial results, scientific societies usually use the generic term 'SGLT2i' or 'SGLT2i with evidence of cardiovascular or renal protection'. Additionally, given the striking benefit over heart failure hospitalization, the preferential use of SGLT2i for patients with heart failure is suggested or recommended, although this was not a primary outcome of cardiovascular safety trials. Scientific societies fall short of recommending the use of SGLT2i outside the eGFR limits provided by regulatory authorities (Table 3). It is likely that the range of eGFR at which canagliflozin can be prescribed will expand in the near future, given the renal benefit observed in the CREDENCE trial of canagliflozin versus placebo in patients with overt DKD, in which patients were enrolled with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and canagliflozin was not stopped until renal replacement therapy was initiated (Supplementary data, Figure S2A). We believe that this supports an indication of canagliflozin at any eGFR value in non-dialysis patients, always with the caveat that initiation of SGLT2i may decrease the baseline eGFR as it decreases hyperfiltration. In this regard, in T2DM patients with DKD, canagliflozin decreased the relative risk of a composite primary outcome of ESKD (dialysis, transplantation or a sustained estimated GFR of < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2), doubling of the serum creatinine level or death from renal or cardiovascular causes by 30% versus placebo [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59–0.82; P = 0.00001]. More specifically, a hard component of the composite, the residual risk of ESKD was reduced to 2/100 patient-years of follow-up (Supplementary data, Figure S2B). Taken together with beneficial effects over pre-specified renal outcomes such as incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, initiation of renal replacement therapy or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria in patients with milder or no evidence of DKD in cardiovascular safety trials, overall data point to a nephroprotective effect at different stages of DKD that warrants preferential use of SGLT2i to treat T2DM patients from very early in the course of DKD, and even before its occurrence to prevent or delay it. The kidney outcomes success of SGLT2i trials for T2DM has set the stage for additional trials enrolling non-T2DM patients.

Figure 2 — Practical guide for initiating SGLT2 inhibitors describes patient selection, intervention, and follow-up for type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease and eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m²; high-priority features include ACR ≥ 200 mg/g [≥ 20 mg/mmol] and heart failure, and potential contraindications include genital infection risk, diabetic ketoacidosis, foot ulcers, and immunosuppression. SGLT2 inhibitor options with proven benefits are canagliflozin 100 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg, and empagliflozin 10 mg, with education on sick day protocol, perioperative care, and foot care, and follow-up includes assessing adverse effects, reviewing knowledge, and anticipating an acute drop in eGFR, which is generally not a reason to stop the SGLT2 inhibitor. For glycemia, hypoglycemia risk factors include insulin or sulfonylurea use, history of severe hypoglycemia, and HbA1c at or below goal; if high, education includes hypoglycemia symptoms and glycemia monitoring and consider insulin/sulfonylurea dose reduction, with follow-up to ask about hypoglycemia and reduce sulfonylurea or insulin if needed. For volume, volume depletion risk factors include concurrent diuretic use, tenuous volume status, and history of AKI; if high, education includes volume depletion symptoms and consideration of diuretic dose reduction, with follow-up to re-assess volume and reduce concomitant diuretic if needed.

ACEI indicates angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; DPP-4i, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate. External validation using a multicenter cohort data set of 1233 patients with AKD patients who were SGLT-2i users confirmed the observed beneficial outcomes. Notably, the risk reduction associated with SGLT-2is remained significant even among patients without hypertension, those with advanced chronic kidney disease, and those not receiving other hypoglycemic agents. type 2 diabetes experience a decline in kidney function even before the onset of AKI, emphasizing their combined association with CKD development.

7 Recently, acute kidney disease has emerged as a transitional stage between AKI and CKD, lasting 7 to 90 days after an AKI episode. 8–10 With the increasing incidence of AKI among hospitalized patients in various settings, 11 AKD is also becoming increasingly prevalent. After PSM, the 2 groups had small and well-matched differences in age, sex, race and ethnicity, comorbidities, medication use, and most other laboratory results. The mean eGFRs in the SGLT-2i and control groups were 76. 9 and
74. 2 mL/min/1. 73 m2, respectively. Our analysis of the risks and burdens of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in a post-AKI care setting after acute dialysis revealed several significant findings. First, our findings have important implications for the management of AKD. Specifically, they highlight the importance of using SGLT-2is and implementing follow-up strategies for such patients.

Second, our findings suggest that the use of SGLT-2is in patients with AKD and an eGFR of less than or equal to 30 or less than or equal to 45 mL/min/1. 73 m2 and in those without hypertension may have significant implications for reducing the risks and burdens of major cardiovascular and kidney diseases.

Selected clinical trials of SGLT2i and SGLT1/2i, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and sotagliflozin

The Canagliflozin and Renal Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy (CREDENCE) trial was a seminal study of SGLT2i in DKD with a dedicated primary composite kidney outcome.CREDENCE enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes, eGFR of 30–90 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300–5000 mg/g. The prespecified enrollment strategy aimed to include at least 60% of patients with eGFR of < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, a population at higher risk of ESKD than previously studied. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, canagliflozin reduced the primary composite kidney endpoint by 31%, with a noteworthy benefit in a secondary heart failure outcome. The trial was prematurely discontinued after 2.6 years due to overwhelming efficacy. CREDENCE demonstrated kidney benefits independent of baseline HbA1c, extent of HbA1c reduction, and stage of CKD, leading to the first kidney-related indication for SGLT2i by the US FDA in 2019.

There is evolving information about the use of SGLT2i among patients with eGFR of < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and non-DKD. Dapagliflozin in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease included 4304 participants, two-thirds with diabetes, with eGFR of 25–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Dapagliflozin reduced the composite risk of ≥ 50% eGFR decline, ESKD, and renal or cardiovascular death by 39%. In subgroup analyses, the benefit of dapagliflozin was consistent regardless of HbA1c, eGFR, or presence of diabetes. The Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) is an ongoing study that will report the effect of empagliflozin on kidney progression or cardiovascular (CV) death.EMPA-KIDNEY will deliver important information among patients with or without diabetes, with or without albuminuria, and eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Clinical Evidence of Renoprotective Effect with SGLT2i

Regulatory Guidance for Renal Outcome Trials

The European Renal Best Practice guideline group recently observed that high-quality studies addressing clinically relevant questions for CKD patients are lacking, despite the frequency of CKD. Inadequate reporting of outcomes is challenging for clinical decision-making and for generating evidence-based guidance. A sufficiently large change in GFR has been considered a surrogate endpoint for the CKD outcomes. As the progression of CKD is slow and there are no overt symptoms until the end stage, establishing clinical parameters to define its progress is challenging. A scientific workshop sponsored by the NKF and the US FDA proposed a 30 or 40% decline in eGFR as an endpoint for clinical trials in CKD. It was also noted that an eGFR decline of 40% may be more broadly acceptable than a 30% decline across a wider range of baseline GFRs and patterns of treatment effects on GFR. Evidence was stronger for a GFR decline of 40%. The 30 and 40% reduction in eGFR correspond to a 1.3- and 1.5-fold increase in serum creatinine level, respectively. For both endpoints, a follow-up during the trial of at least 2–3 years and a sample size > 1000 to allow 90% power is recommended. The workshop concluded that more research is required for composite endpoints, including other kidney outcomes, such as the occurrence of CKD GFR category 4 or acute kidney injury (AKI). A meta-analysis of 37 randomized trials also endorsed the primary endpoint of a 30–40% reduction in eGFR. The European Medical Agency and FDA endorsed the 40% reduction in eGFR as a primary endpoint and further recommended the collection of meaningful clinical events (ESRD/mortality) as secondary outcomes, with the aim to provide important supportive information on patient benefit. More recently, major adverse renal events (MARE) have been proposed as the outcome measure for future studies. MARE includes a set of major morbidity events such as the development of new-onset DKD, reaching ESRD, starting RRT, or receiving a kidney transplant, and mortality.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2(SGLT2) inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors represent a novel category of hypoglycemic agents that enhance normal tubuloglomerular feedback, alleviate glomerular filtration pressure, mitigate hyperfiltration, and decrease urinary protein excretion by inhibiting sodium and glucose reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules. These effects are believed to underlie the kidney protective properties of SGLT2 inhibitors. Furthermore, the kidney protective mechanisms of SGLT2 inhibitors may involve modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as enhancement of kidney energy metabolism. Recent large-scale clinical studies have demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors have shown efficacy in controlling blood sugar levels, reducing proteinuria in patients with DKD, and delaying the decline of kidney function. Based on previous findings, the 2022 KDIGO guidelines recommend that SGLT-2 inhibitors be initiated in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and CKD patients at eGFR ≥ 20mL (/ min•1.73m2). SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy should be carried out for as long as possible if tolerated, and should be continued even if eGFR falls below 20mL (/ min•1.73m2) until kidney replacement therapy is started. Dapagliflozin received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 30, 2022, for the purpose of mitigating the risk of renal decline, renal failure, cardiovascular mortality, and hospitalization due to heart failure in adult patients diagnosed with CKD. However, SGLT2 inhibitors are contraindicated for individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or those experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Additionally, the presence of glycosuria associated with this medication may elevate the risk of developing infections in the reproductive and urinary systems.

Dapagliflozin trials included participants with eGFR ≥ 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m² (including persons without DM) and empagliflozin trials included eGFR 30 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m² (including persons with T2D ≥ 20%); dapagliflozin slowed decline more in T2D, while empagliflozin had similar eGFR decline across groups. GLP-1 RAs also are an option for reducing albuminuria progression, eGFR decline, and ASCVD risk in T2D with DKD with eGFR 15 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Is GFR decline induced by SGLT2 inhibitor of clinical importance? [^710d1300]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have demonstrated remarkable cardiovascular (CV) and renal benefits beyond glycemic control in several trials and emerged as therapeutic agents in the treatment of heart failure and chronic kidney disease. However, it has been repeatedly described that initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy causes an initial decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which may lead to physician's concern. This initial decline in eGFR with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment is suggested to be related to a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. The mechanism underlying the reduction of the intraglomerular pressure with SGLT2 inhibitor treatment appears to be different in different cohorts. Previously, we showed in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with empagliflozin treatment that this reduction in intraglomerular pressure is caused by a postglomerular vasodilatation, rather than a preglomerular vasoconstriction by tubuloglomerular feedback as demonstrated in patients with type 1 diabetes and experimental studies. In support to our study, van Bommel et al. observed similar results in T2D patients with dapagliflozin treatment. Although this vasodilatory effect on the efferent arterioles results in an initial drop in eGFR, in the long term it comes to an improvement of kidney function and slows the progression of kidney disease.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^c407aca8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

KDOQI US commentary — eGFR and UACR variability thresholds and related actions — states that a practice point suggests that a doubling of the UACR may exceed expected variability and warrant evaluation. It notes that the American Diabetes Association standards of care recommend for people with diabetes and ACR ≥ 300 mg/g reducing ACR by 30% or greater to slow CKD progression. KDIGO addresses eGFR variability with a practice point suggesting that a change in eGFR of > 20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation, and if a hemodynamically active therapy is initiated (eg, RAS inhibitors or SGLT2 inhibitors), a threshold of > 30% is suggested to exceed the expected variability and warrant further evaluation. Post hoc analyses after SGLT2 inhibitors have shown that individuals with initial eGFR decreases of > 10% have similar eGFR trajectories and long-term kidney benefits as those with an initial eGFR decrease of ≤ 10%. Treatment with diuretics may increase the risk of an eGFR dip with SGLT2 inhibitors. Initial eGFR declines of > 30% are rare and should warrant review of volume status, blood pressure (BP), and other causes. Residual albuminuria detected while on appropriately dosed RAS inhibitor and SGLT2 inhibitors should prompt a clinician to consider adding a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in a patient with type 2 diabetes.

Kidney failure was defined as a composite of eGFR < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m² (or eGFR < 10 ml/min per 1.73 m² in EMPA-KIDNEY), maintenance dialysis, or kidney transplantation; data for kidney failure were not available for SCORED.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to management of diabetic nephropathy, SGLT-2 inhibitors, DC 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate a SGLT-2 inhibitor in adult patients with T2DM and CKD, defined by an eGFR of 20–45 mL/min/1.73 m² regardless of urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, or an eGFR of 45–90 mL/min/1.73 m² with urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 20 mg/mmol, who are on maximally tolerated or maximally prescribed doses of RAAS inhibitors, to delay progression of CKD and progression to dialysis, and to reduce the likelihood of cardiovascular events.

SGLT2 inhibitors

In addition to the benefits described for secondary kidney outcomes in SGLT2 inhibitor cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), three dedicated kidney outcome trials of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in CKD have been completed to date (Table 1). The first trial published was the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial. CREDENCE reported a 30% relative risk reduction for its primary kidney composite outcome (Table 1). The Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Chronic Kidney Disease (DAPA-CKD) and the Study of Heart and Kidney Protection With Empagliflozin (EMPA-KIDNEY) trials quickly followed, thus establishing a class effect of SGLT2 inhibitors for kidney protection. Importantly, DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY included participants without diabetes, with lower eGFRs (baseline eGFRs down to 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and with wide variations in baseline albuminuria (Table 1). Subgroup analyses from the EMPA-KIDNEY trial found no heterogeneity of relative effect based on CKD cause or baseline eGFR. Similarly, a meta-analysis of large SGLT2 inhibitor outcome trials reported kidney benefit in patients with CKD or HF irrespective of baseline diabetes status or kidney function. In consideration of these remarkably consistent findings of kidney and CV benefit, SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy for CKD by organizations including the American Diabetes Association (ADA), Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE). SGLT2 inhibitors are currently recommended in people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibition is currently recommended once a patient progresses to dialysis or kidney transplant. However, a potential therapeutic role of SGLT2 inhibitors for patients treated by dialysis or kidney transplant is under study. The Renal Lifecycle Trial (NCT05374291) will assess the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney failure, HF, mortality and safety in patients with eGFR ≤ 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2, chronic dialysis or kidney transplant with an eGFR ≤ 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^c9f0e962]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Clinical utility of SGLT2 inhibitors — early eGFR changes, glycemia-related adjustments, and salutary effects are described. SGLT2 inhibitor initiation is associated with a reversible decline in eGFR of 3–5 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the first 4 weeks of therapy, after which GFR typically stabilizes during ongoing SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Because SGLT2 inhibitor therapy reduces blood glucose in persons with preserved eGFR, reduction of insulin or insulin secretagogues may be needed to avoid hypoglycemia in those with eGFR > 45 mL/min/1.73 m2. These agents reduce risk of hyperkalemia, without causing hypokalemia, and mitigate fluid retention, and therefore SGLT2 inhibitors can facilitate initiation and persistent use of other guideline-directed medical therapies for CKD and heart failure.

### Long-term effects of empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^0f6e2a89]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The mechanisms for any persisting effects of SGLT2 inhibitors still need to be elucidated. Preservation of nephron number during the active trial period might conceivably reduce hyperfiltration and risk of ESKD, and preservation of kidney function may have mediated some of the post-trial observed benefits on cardiovascular death. The acute eGFR dip with SGLT2 inhibition reversed within 4 weeks after discontinuation, so some of the observed post-trial benefit on eGFR components of kidney disease progression could result from reversal of the acute eGFR dip after cessation of study drug. However, that does not explain continuing benefits on ESKD.

Participants who did not start an SGLT2 inhibitor had twice the predicted risk of kidney failure of participants who started an SGLT2 inhibitor post-trial. This phenomenon may reflect some uncertainty about the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibition in those with more advanced CKD, and inertia in changes in practice owing to the time taken for regulatory/payer approvals. This prognostic imbalance implies, in particular, that any comparison of outcomes between participants allocated empagliflozin who started an SGLT2 inhibitor post-trial versus those allocated placebo who remained off SGLT2 inhibition post-trial will be confounded, and hence unreliable.

Current international guidance on use of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD provide recommendations of different strengths for patients who were eligible for EMPA-KIDNEY based on different levels of albuminuria. The almost doubling of the number of first primary outcomes from 990 in the active trial's report to 1866 after post-trial follow-up appears to help us to address uncertainties resulting from the active trial period. Benefits on the post-trial follow-up primary outcome, kidney disease progression, and difference in eGFR on last measurement were similar irrespective of level of albuminuria, as well as diabetes status, level of kidney function, and primary kidney diagnosis. This is consistent with effects on eGFR-slope from the active trial phase.

Our trial was designed to ensure that findings would be widely generalizable. Other key strengths of this trial were its large size and broad eligibility criteria, high levels of adherence to study drug, the high volunteer rate for post-trial follow-up, and the almost complete follow-up. Post-trial follow-up addresses some of the limitations of the active trial, including its low number of cardiovascular deaths.

### Empagliflozin in patients with chronic kidney disease [^fa234564]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this population of patients with a wide range of causes of CKD, GFR and levels of albuminuria, empagliflozin safely reduced the risk of the primary outcome of kidney disease progression or death from cardiovascular causes by about 28%. Treatment was effective irrespective of whether patients had diabetes, and across a broad range of eGFR down to around 20 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2. Risk of hospitalization for any cause was also reduced by 14%.

The effect of SGLT2 inhibition on kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death seen in the present trial is quantitatively similar to that seen in two other large placebo-controlled trials in CKD populations. The CREDENCE trial of canagliflozin required all participants to have type 2 diabetes and a urinary ACR of at least 300 mg/g, and excluded patients with an eGFR of less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2. The DAPA-CKD trial of dapagliflozin required participants to have a urinary ACR of 200 mg/g and an eGFR of 25 to 75 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2. It included 1398 participants without diabetes and 624 participants with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2.EMPA-KIDNEY adds substantially to the existing evidence by demonstrating consistent benefits among 3569 (54%) participants without diabetes and, separately, among 2282 (35%) participants with an eGFR below 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2. Despite recruiting 3192 (48%) participants with a urinary ACR below 300 mg/g, there was a limited number of primary outcomes in these types of patient as their CKD was progressing at a slower rate than participants with a urinary ACR of at least 300 mg/g. Prespecified exploratory analyses of the annual rate of change in eGFR - an accepted surrogate for kidney disease progression– showed empagliflozin slowed the rate of chronic eGFR decline in patients with a urinary ACR below 300 mg/g at baseline (including those with urinary ACR < 30 mg/g).

### Kidney outcomes using a sustained ≥ 40% decline in eGFR: a meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor trials [^7ce11599]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

A recent meta‐analysis of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor outcome trials reported that SGLT2 inhibitors were associated with reduction in the risk of adverse composite kidney outcomes, with moderate heterogeneity across the trials; however, the endpoints were defined differently across the trials.

Hypothesis

The apparent heterogeneity of the meta‐analysis of kidney composite outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitor trials will be substantially reduced by using a consistent assessment of sustained ≥ 40% decline in eGFR/chronic kidney dialysis/transplantation/renal death across trials.

Methods

We performed a meta‐analysis of kidney composite outcomes from the four SGLT2 cardiovascular outcome trial programs conducted in general type 2 diabetes mellitus populations, which included, as a surrogate of progression to kidney failure, a sustained ≥ 40% decline in eGFR along with kidney replacement therapy and kidney death. The trials assessed were VERTIS CV (NCT01986881), CANVAS Program (NCT01032629 and NCT01989754), DECLARE‐TIMI 58 (NCT01730534), and EMPA‐REG OUTCOME (NCT01131676).

Results

Data from the trials comprised 42 516 individual participants; overall, 998 composite kidney events occurred. SGLT2 inhibition was associated with a significant reduction in the kidney composite endpoint (HR 0.58 [95% CI 0.51–0.65]) and with a highly consistent effect across the trials (Q statistic p = .64; I² = 0.0%).

Conclusions

Our meta‐analysis highlights the value of using similarly defined endpoints across trials and supports the finding of consistent protection against kidney disease progression with SGLT2 inhibitors as a class in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who either have established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or are at high cardiovascular risk with multiple cardiovascular risk factors.

Recommendations for Optimal Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduce the risk of progression to DKD and renal death by approximately 40–50% in people with T2DM who are at risk of CV events and are on ACE-Is and ARBs. Thus, SGLT2i have emerged as the new drugs that must be included in the armamentarium for the management for people with T2DM having CVD or mild-to-moderate DKD to curb morbidity and mortality. The recommendations for optimal use of SGLT2i, generated on the basis of evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses, is summarized below.

### Kidney outcomes of SGLT2 inhibitors among older patients with diabetic kidney disease in real-world clinical practice: the Japan chronic kidney disease database Ex [^ee0fa7bc]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

We compared the kidney outcomes between patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) aged ≥ 75 years initiating sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering drugs, additionally presenting with or without proteinuria.

Research Design and Methods

Using the Japan Chronic Kidney Disease Database, we developed propensity scores, implementing a 1:1 matching protocol. The primary outcome included the decline rate in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and secondary outcomes incorporated a composite of a 40% reduction in eGFR or progression to end-stage kidney disease.

Results

At baseline, the mean age at initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 348) or other glucose-lowering medications (n = 348) was 77.7 years. The mean eGFR was 59.3mL/min/1.73m 2 and proteinuria was 230 (33.0%) patients. Throughout the follow-up period, the mean annual rate of eGFR change was -0.80mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year (95%CI -1.05 to -0.54) among SGLT2 inhibitors group and -1.78mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year (95%CI -2.08 to -1.49) in other glucose-lowering drugs group (difference in the rate of eGFR decline between the groups was 0.99mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year (95%CI 0.5 to 1.38)), favoring SGLT2 inhibitors (p < 0.001). Composite renal outcomes were observed 38 in the SGLT2 inhibitors group and 57 in the other glucose-lowering medications group (HR 0.64, 95%CI 0.42 to 0.97). There was no evidence of an interaction between SGLT2 inhibitors initiation and proteinuria.

Conclusions

The benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on renal outcomes are also applicable to older patients with DKD aged ≥ 75 years.

SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit — initiation and renal dose modifications — should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials, and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. For canagliflozin, dose modifications are: eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2: max dose 100 mg daily; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control. For dapagliflozin, eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is not recommended for glycemic control; and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2: use is contraindicated.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors: extending the indication to non-diabetic kidney disease? [^66bc6106]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

This year the medical community was pleasantly surprised by the results of the first large outcome trial that primarily examined the renal effects of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor canagliflozin (CANA) in subjects with diabetes and impaired kidney function. The Evaluation of the Effects of Canagliflozin on Renal and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Participants With Diabetic Nephropathy (CREDENCE) trial showed that CANA, relative to placebo, reduces the risk for end-stage renal disease, doubling of creatinine or renal death by 34% [hazard ratio 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.53–0.81]. These effects were consistent across baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and haemoglobin A1c subgroups. In this review we combine the results of the CREDENCE trial with those of several cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors and show that, unexpectedly, patients with lower eGFR levels may have greater benefit with respect to cardiovascular outcome than patients with normal kidney function. The cardio- and renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors seem to be independent of their glucose-lowering effects, as shown in several post hoc analyses. In this review we discuss the alleged mechanisms of action that explain the beneficial effects of this novel class of drugs. Moreover, we discuss whether these findings indicate that this class of drugs may also be beneficial in non-diabetic chronic kidney diseases.

EFFICACY RATIONALE FOR COMBINATION THERAPY IN CKD

Despite optimal use of a highly effective therapy on top of standard of care, rates of kidney function decline remain high for many patients with CKD. Across the three SGLT2i kidney outcome trials, ∼10% of participants who were randomized to SGLT2i experienced CKD progression or died due to cardiovascular or kidney disease over a median follow-up of 2.0–2.6 years. In EMPA-KIDNEY, the annualized rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with urine albumin: creatinine ratios (uACR) of > 300 to < 1000 mg/g, 1000 to < 2000, and ≥ 2000 mg/g in the empagliflozin arm were −2.17, −3.31, and −5.60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year, respectively (Fig. 1). Indeed, despite an average 30% reduction in albuminuria with canagliflozin in the CREDENCE trial, residual albuminuria at 6 months post-randomization was still the most powerful predictor of long-term risk of kidney failure (Fig. 1). These observations underscore the need for multiple therapies for many individuals with CKD to reduce residual cardio–kidney risk and achieve the best possible outcomes.

We tested for heterogeneity in the associations between SGLT2 inhibitor use and outcomes by each subgroup with the inclusion of multiplicative interaction terms. A statistically significant interaction was defined as p value < 0.05. ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARBs, angiotensin II receptor blockers; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; ESKD, end-stage kidney disease; SGLT2, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most frequent and serious complications of type 2 diabetes (T2D), affecting approximately 30%–40% of individuals with T2D and accounting for a substantial proportion of excess cardiovascular morbidity, premature mortality and healthcare expenditures in this population.

Diabetic kidney disease is clinically heterogeneous, and the classical phenotype characterized by albuminuria and progressive loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) coexists with non‐albuminuric forms, in which eGFR decline occurs in the absence of mild or overt proteinuria. This phenotypic variability reflects differences in underlying pathophysiology, may influence prognosis, and contributes to the complexity of managing CKD in people with T2D.

Several therapeutic strategies have been shown to delay CKD progression in T2D. In addition to renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, newer pharmacological agents have emerged with kidney‐protective effects. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) significantly reduce the risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events in patients with T2D and established CKD or high cardiovascular risk. Non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRA), such as finerenone, further reduce albuminuria and adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with albuminuric CKD already receiving optimized background therapy. More recently, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RA) have shown potential kidney protective effects, with the FLOW trial demonstrating a reduced risk of major kidney outcomes in T2D patients with CKD treated with semaglutide.

Although randomized controlled trials have firmly established the efficacy of these therapies in selected populations, their translation into routine clinical practice remains suboptimal. Furthermore, the generalizability of trial findings to real‐world populations — who are often older, more comorbid, and more heterogeneous than trial participants — remains uncertain. Real‐world evidence is therefore essential to complement trial data, assess effectiveness across broader patient groups, and identify residual gaps in care. Moreover, given the lack of head‐to‐head comparisons in randomized clinical trials, real‐world studies offer a unique opportunity to provide initial insights into identifying the most effective treatments for patients in the context of an expanding range of beneficial therapeutic options. Yet, comparative observations of how different drugs perform in terms of nephroprotection in a real‐life context are scarce.

The present study addresses these knowledge gaps. Specifically, it aims to characterize kidney outcomes in new‐users of SGLT2i versus new‐users of other glucose‐lowering medications (GLM) in a large, contemporary cohort of patients with T2D and CKD in a real‐world clinical setting.
