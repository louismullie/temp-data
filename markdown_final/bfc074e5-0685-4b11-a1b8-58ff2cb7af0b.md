## Question

how to manage oligohydraminos

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage oligohydramnios across gestational ages and etiologies, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and choosing the optimal measurement method. Then, I should classify the severity and determine etiology. Next, I will stratify management by gestational age and associated conditions, including preterm and term scenarios, PPROM, and fetal anomalies. After that, I should review intrapartum considerations and special populations such as TOLAC. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight controversies and evidence gaps, making sure I verify each step against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and measurement method, because misclassification drives unnecessary interventions. I initially thought AFI < 5 cm was the standard, but wait, let me verify the preferred approach; FIGO and AIUM favor single deepest vertical pocket (SDP/MVP) ≤ 2 cm over AFI ≤ 5 cm to reduce overdiagnosis and unnecessary inductions, and this is supported by comparative studies and meta-analyses, even though some argue AFI remains reasonable in certain contexts, so I should document the method used and repeat measurements to confirm persistence before labeling oligohydramnios [^113uouQC] [^113932Li] [^113QbDrB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check severity and the clinical context. Severe oligohydramnios, especially anhydramnios, portends higher risks such as cord compression, meconium aspiration, and pulmonary hypoplasia, and the timing of onset matters greatly for lung development, so I should correlate with gestational age, maternal comorbidities, fetal growth, and membrane status before deciding on management intensity [^116MLqQg] [^111ELzW9].

> Next, I should review etiologies systematically so I don't miss a reversible cause. I need to ensure I exclude rupture of membranes with a careful history and, if needed, a sterile speculum exam or biochemical testing, then evaluate for placental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction, fetal anomalies (notably renal/urinary tract obstruction or agenesis), maternal conditions such as hypertension or preeclampsia, and medication exposures including NSAIDs and renin–angiotensin system agents, because each changes management and counseling [^1135v6b5] [^111iDGnZ] [^112b4W3M].

> For preterm gestations under 34 weeks, I should confirm that isolated oligohydramnios without other abnormalities warrants expectant management with close surveillance rather than immediate delivery. Wait, I should double-check the surveillance cadence; FIGO suggests twice-weekly NST/BPP and Doppler 1–2 times weekly for FGR with mild associated abnormalities, which I can adapt to isolated oligohydramnios while avoiding iatrogenic prematurity, and I should consider maternal hydration as a low-risk adjunct to modestly increase AFI, recognizing that clinical outcome benefits are unproven [^115c5q86] [^114eVL1y] [^111GhCU9].

> But wait, what if oligohydramnios is severe or there are additional risk factors? I need to ensure I escalate appropriately: hospitalization, daily fetal assessment, and consideration of corticosteroids for fetal maturation if delivery is anticipated within 7 days, with delivery reserved for clear indications such as nonreassuring testing, severe FGR with abnormal Dopplers, or maternal indications, balancing neonatal risks of prematurity against fetal compromise [^115c5q86].

> For pregnancies at or beyond 34 weeks, I should reconsider the threshold for delivery. Initially, I thought isolated oligohydramnios alone mandates induction at 37 weeks, but hold on, I should verify; evidence and guidelines suggest that isolated oligohydramnios without other compromise can be managed expectantly to 41 weeks with twice-weekly testing, reserving induction for additional risk factors or reaching 41 weeks, and I should confirm that this approach avoids unnecessary early deliveries without clear benefit [^115QD4nH].

> At term, I need to ensure I integrate oligohydramnios into shared decision-making about induction. Let me think about the Cochrane synthesis: planned early delivery for suspected compromise at term did not improve major perinatal outcomes compared with expectant management, though it increased intermediate nursery admissions and earlier gestational age at birth, so I should individualize based on cervical favorability, patient preferences, and evolving fetal status rather than reflexively inducing for oligohydramnios alone [^1135dCsx].

> If membranes are ruptured, I should confirm gestational age and latency, because PPROM management hinges on both. I need to check that antenatal corticosteroids are indicated before 34 weeks, antibiotics are used to reduce infectious morbidity, and tocolysis is generally avoided, while recognizing that persistent oligohydramnios after previable PPROM is associated with lower survival and higher developmental delay, which should inform counseling and neonatal planning [^116gJprN] [^1161SXx4].

> For suspected fetal anomalies, I should verify that early involvement of maternal–fetal medicine is essential. Let me consider lower urinary tract obstruction: early-onset oligohydramnios worsens pulmonary prognosis, and fetal therapy such as vesicoamniotic shunting may improve survival but does not eliminate long-term renal morbidity, so counseling must be nuanced and individualized, with serial imaging and multidisciplinary planning [^113ytK9m] [^111ELzW9].

> Intrapartum, I need to ensure continuous electronic fetal monitoring given the higher risk of cord compression and meconium, and I should have a low threshold for amnioinfusion when variable decelerations suggest cord compromise, while preparing for neonatal resuscitation and meconium management as indicated, because oligohydramnios increases risks of fetal distress and operative delivery even when antepartum testing was reassuring [^116BbPKR] [^113uouQC].

> Special populations deserve tailored plans. In patients with a prior cesarean, I should confirm that TOLAC is not contraindicated by oligohydramnios; recent multicenter data suggest high vaginal delivery rates and no excess uterine rupture with favorable neonatal outcomes compared with planned repeat cesarean, so I should offer TOLAC with standard precautions and continuous monitoring, documenting shared decision-making [^1175cPdh].

> I should also remember medication-related oligohydramnios. If the patient is on NSAIDs after 20 weeks or renin–angiotensin system blockers, I need to stop the offending agent promptly, monitor with serial ultrasounds, and consider delivery timing if oligohydramnios persists or fetal status deteriorates, because injury may be ongoing even after drug cessation [^112b4W3M] [^111iDGnZ].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with evidence. Confirm diagnosis with SDP ≤ 2 cm or AFI ≤ 5 cm and repeat to ensure persistence; exclude ROM and evaluate for FGR, anomalies, hypertension, and medications; if preterm and isolated, manage expectantly with hydration and surveillance; if term and isolated, consider expectant management to 41 weeks with testing; if additional risk factors or severe oligohydramnios, discuss induction and delivery planning; if PPROM, follow latency-based protocols with steroids and antibiotics; if fetal anomaly, refer to MFM for counseling and potential fetal therapy; intrapartum, use continuous monitoring and amnioinfusion as needed, and in prior cesarean patients, offer TOLAC when appropriate [^113uouQC] [^111XjPKw] [^1175cPdh].

> Finally, I should acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps so counseling is balanced. The optimal measurement method remains debated, with FIGO favoring SDP to reduce overdiagnosis while some argue AFI performs comparably in outcome-driven contexts; isolated oligohydramnios likely reflects placental insufficiency in some cases and is associated with recurrence and SGA in future pregnancies; and although maternal hydration increases AFI, high-quality outcome data are lacking, so I should frame it as low-risk adjunctive therapy rather than definitive treatment [^113QbDrB] [^113sr3AH] [^114eVL1y].

Oligohydramnios is managed by **confirming the diagnosis with ultrasound** (AFI ≤ 5 cm or MVP ≤ 2 cm) [^113932Li] and **identifying the cause** (FGR, PPROM, fetal anomalies, maternal meds, placental insufficiency) [^1135v6b5]. At term, **isolated oligohydramnios warrants induction** [^115hkHF3] if there are additional risk factors; otherwise, expectant management with twice-weekly testing is reasonable [^115QD4nH]. Preterm cases require individualized care: if < 34 weeks, give corticosteroids and consider tocolysis; if 34–37 weeks, deliver if there are additional risk factors; if ≥ 37 weeks, deliver. Intrapartum, use continuous EFM, amnioinfusion for cord compression, and have neonatal resuscitation ready [^116BbPKR]. Postpartum, monitor for neonatal complications and counsel on recurrence risk in future pregnancies [^113sr3AH].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and initial assessment

- **Ultrasound confirmation**: Use AFI ≤ 5 cm or MVP ≤ 2 cm to diagnose oligohydramnios [^113932Li] [^113uouQC].

- **Identify underlying causes**: Evaluate for FGR, PPROM, fetal anomalies, maternal medications (e.g. NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors), and placental insufficiency [^1135v6b5].

- **Maternal hydration**: Oral or IV hydration can transiently increase amniotic fluid volume and may be considered in isolated cases [^114eVL1y] [^111GhCU9].

---

## Management based on gestational age and clinical context

### Preterm gestation (< 34 weeks)

- **Expectant management**: Preferred if isolated oligohydramnios without additional risk factors [^113hyLD4].

- **Corticosteroids**: Administer antenatal corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity [^116eG6oM].

- **Tocolysis**: Consider if preterm labor is present.

- **Surveillance**: Conduct regular fetal monitoring with NST, BPP, and Doppler studies [^115c5q86].

- **Delivery**: Indicated if FGR, abnormal Doppler, or fetal distress is present [^115hkHF3].

---

### Late preterm and early term (34–37 weeks)

At 34–37 weeks, **individualized management** is guided by fetal growth, Doppler findings, and maternal status. Delivery should be considered when FGR, abnormal Doppler, or maternal complications are present [^113uouQC].

---

### Term gestation (≥ 37 weeks)

At term, **isolated oligohydramnios** warrants consideration of induction, particularly with additional risk factors [^115QD4nH]. Expectant management with twice-weekly testing is reasonable if fetal status is reassuring [^115QD4nH].

---

## Intrapartum management

- **Continuous electronic fetal monitoring**: Essential due to increased risk of cord compression and fetal distress [^113uouQC].

- **Amnioinfusion**: Consider for significant cord compression or recurrent variable decelerations [^notfound].

- **Mode of delivery**: Vaginal delivery is preferred unless obstetric indications necessitate cesarean section.

- **Neonatal resuscitation**: Ensure availability of neonatal resuscitation equipment and trained personnel.

---

## Postpartum considerations

Postpartum, **neonatal monitoring** should assess for respiratory distress, renal dysfunction, and other complications. Parents should be counseled on the risk of recurrence and the need for enhanced surveillance in future pregnancies [^113sr3AH].

## Management of oligohydramnios

| **Gestational age** | **Management approach** | **Indications for delivery** |
|-|-|-|
| < 34 weeks | Expectant management; corticosteroids; tocolysis if indicated | - FGR <br/> - Abnormal Doppler <br/> - Fetal distress |
| 34–37 weeks | Individualized management | - FGR <br/> - Abnormal Doppler <br/> - Maternal complications |
| ≥ 37 weeks | Consider induction; expectant management if isolated | - Additional risk factors <br/> - Abnormal fetal testing |

---

Oligohydramnios management is **tailored to gestational age, fetal status, and underlying causes**, with expectant management and surveillance for stable cases and delivery for those with additional risk factors or fetal compromise.

### Management of oligohydramnios in pregnancy [^114mL44Z]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

The finding of oligohydramnios in pregnancy is problematic. The various mechanisms that control amniotic fluid, the inability to precisely measure and quantify the amount, and the relevance of a "decreased" amount of fluid make the management of this finding unclear. Given the limited amount of data, the single deepest vertical pocket may be a better method than the amniotic fluid index to define oligohydramnios. A large prospective study is needed to develop the most optimal management recommendations, especially for idiopathic oligohydramnios at or near term.

### Planned early delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby for improving outcomes [^1135dCsx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fetal compromise in the term pregnancy is suspected when the following clinical indicators are present: intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), decreased fetal movement (DFM), or when investigations such as cardiotocography (CTG) and ultrasound reveal results inconsistent with standard measurements. Pathological results would necessitate the need for immediate delivery, but the management for 'suspicious' results remains unclear and varies widely across clinical centres. There is clinical uncertainty as to how to best manage women presenting with a suspected term compromised baby in an otherwise healthy pregnancy.

Objectives

To assess, using the best available evidence, the effects of immediate delivery versus expectant management of the term suspected compromised baby on neonatal, maternal and long-term outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing expectant management versus planned early delivery for women with a suspected compromised fetus from 37 weeks' gestation or more.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Of the 20 reports identified by the search strategy, we included three trials (546 participants: 269 to early delivery and 277 to expectant management), which met our inclusion criteria. Two of the trials compared outcomes in 492 pregnancies with IUGR of the fetus, and one in 54 pregnancies with oligohydramnios. All three trials were of reasonable quality and at low risk of bias. The level of evidence was graded moderate, low or very low, downgrading mostly for imprecision and for some indirectness. Overall, there was no difference in the primary neonatal outcomes of perinatal mortality (no deaths in either group, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded moderate), major neonatal morbidity (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 2.81, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), or neurodevelopmental disability/impairment at two years of age (RR 2.04, 95% CI 0.62 to 6.69, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). There was no difference in the risk of necrotising enterocolitis (one trial, 333 infants) or meconium aspiration (one trial, 459 infants), There was also no difference in the reported primary maternal outcomes: maternal mortality (RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.13 to 74.87, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low), and significant maternal morbidity (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.22, one trial, 459 women, evidence graded low). The gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier in women randomised to early delivery (mean difference (MD) -9.50, 95% CI -10.82 to -8.18, one trial, 459 women) and women in the early delivery group were significantly less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67, one trial, 33 women). Significantly more infants in the planned early delivery group were admitted to intermediate care nursery (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.61, two trials, 491 infants). There was no difference in the risk of respiratory distress syndrome, (one trial, 333 infants), Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (three trials, 546 infants), resuscitation required (one trial, 459 infants), mechanical ventilation (one trial, 337 infants), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.23, three trials, 545 infants, evidence graded very low), length of stay in NICU/SCN (one trial, 459 infants), and sepsis (two trials, 366 infants). Babies in the expectant management group were more likely to be < 2.3rd centile for birthweight (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.73, two trials, 491 infants), however there was no difference in the proportion of babies with birthweight < 10th centile (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.10). There was no difference in any of the reported maternal secondary outcomes including: caesarean section rates (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.59, three trials, 546 women, evidence graded low), placental abruption (one trial, 459 women), pre-eclampsia (one trial, 459 women), vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), assisted vaginal birth (three trials 546 women), breastfeeding rates (one trial, 218 women), and number of weeks of breastfeeding after delivery one trial, 124 women). There was an expected increase in induction in the early delivery group (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.78 to 2.37, one trial, 459 women). No data were reported for the pre-specified secondary neonatal outcomes of the number of days of mechanical ventilation, moderate-severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy or need for therapeutic hypothermia. Likewise, no data were reported for secondary maternal outcomes of postnatal infection, maternal satisfaction or views of care.

Authors' Conclusions

A policy for planned early delivery versus expectant management for a suspected compromised fetus at term does not demonstrate any differences in major outcomes of perinatal mortality, significant neonatal or maternal morbidity or neurodevelopmental disability. In women randomised to planned early delivery, the gestational age at birth was on average 10 days earlier, women were less likely to have a baby beyond 40 weeks' gestation, they were more likely to be induced and infants were more likely to be admitted to intermediate care nursery. There was also a significant difference in the proportion of babies with a birthweight centile < 2.3rd, however this did not translate into a reduction in morbidity. The review is informed by only one large trial and two smaller trials assessing fetuses with IUGR or oligohydramnios and therefore cannot be generalised to all term pregnancies with suspected fetal compromise. There are other indications for suspecting compromise in a fetus at or near term such as maternal perception of DFM, and ultrasound and/or CTG abnormalities. Future randomised trials need to assess effectiveness of timing of delivery for these indications.

### A review of amniotic fluid dynamics and the enigma of isolated oligohydramnios [^1123EYe5]. American Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Traditionally, oligohydramnios has been implemented as a sign of potential fetal compromise and associated with an increased incidence of adverse perinatal morbidity and mortality. Decreased amniotic fluid volume is especially of concern when it occurs in conjunction with structural fetal anomalies, fetal growth restriction, postdates pregnancies, and maternal disease. Consequently, following ultrasonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios at term, delivery is routinely advocated even in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies with an appropriate-for-gestational-age fetus, irrespective of the presence of reassuring fetal evaluation and the absence of maternal disease. Numerous factors complicate the ultrasonographic diagnosis of oligohydramnios. These include a lack of complete detailed understanding of the physiology of the dynamics of oligohydramnios, the transient condition at times of decreased amniotic fluid volume, generally poor performance of ultrasonography in detecting oligohydramnios, an array of different ultrasound diagnostic criteria, and varying ultrasonographic thresholds. In light of the latter and the lack of prospective randomized data, is unclear that the practice of effecting delivery for isolated oligohydramnios at term is justified. This article presents physiologic dynamics of amniotic fluid, factors that may affect amniotic fluid volume, possible pitfalls in the ultrasonographic assessment of amniotic fluid volume, and the clinical significance of oligohydramnios. In addition, the literature regarding perinatal outcome associated with oligohydramnios and current available data supporting expectant noninterventional management of cases complicated by isolated oligohydramnios at term are discussed.

### Pulmonary effects of prolonged oligohydramnios following mid-trimester rupture of the membranes – antenatal and postnatal management [^113iiihh]. Neonatology (2012). Low credibility.

Mid-trimester, preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) with prolonged oligohydramnios remains a challenge for both obstetricians and neonatologists. Although survival rates have improved, morbidity remains common particularly due to pulmonary insufficiency and pulmonary hypertension. The aetiology of abnormal lung development is unknown but may depend critically on pulmonary vascular development. Antenatal evaluation of at-risk foetuses by three-dimensional ultrasound and MRI is possible but the techniques need to be further assessed. Antenatal corticosteroids given in cases of PPROM reduce the incidence of neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage and necrotising enterocolitis without increasing maternal or neonatal infection. The true risk-benefit ratio of antibiotics, tocolysis and strategies to normalise amniotic fluid volume remains less clear. There is no consensus regarding the optimal ventilation strategy to support infants with pulmonary insufficiency following PPROM, and further work is required to determine whether and which pulmonary vasodilators improve long-term outcome in these infants.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^113sr3AH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the current study points to a strong association between isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery and any main placental disorder in the subsequent delivery, especially oligohydramnios recurrence and small for gestational age neonate. Based on our results the risk for a small for gestational age neonate is increased two-fold in subsequent delivery. Accordingly, isolated oligohydramnios may be the first sign of placental insufficiency even in the absence of overt fetal growth impairment and may be an independent manifestation of the placental related complications spectrum.

Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our hypothesis, and to define the proper management in cases of isolated oligohydramnios, including establishing guidelines for follow up in subsequent pregnancies.

8.1.4 Ultrasound measurement of amniotic fluid volume

Professional societies do not recommend inclusion of isolated amniotic fluid volume assessment into management decisions for FGR. A decrease in amniotic fluid volume can occur as a result of fetal oliguria in response to progressive placental dysfunction and hypoxia, as well as rupture of membranes. 287, 288, 324 Accordingly, additional evaluation is required to determine the significance of decreased amniotic fluid volume. Oligohydramnios can be defined as an ultrasound measured four‐quadrant amniotic fluid index below or equal to 5 cm, or a maximum vertical amniotic fluid pocket below or equal to 2 cm. 325 Use of the latter reduces overdiagnosis of oligohydramnios and is preferred. Oligohydramnios is associated with an increased rate of intrapartum FHR abnormalities, need for cesarean section, and low 5‐minute Apgar scores, but not acidosis at birth. 326

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^1121PYSk]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Oligohydramnios, defined as a deficiency in amniotic fluid, is considered a significant factor contributing to adverse perinatal outcomes, encompassing low Apgar scores, birth asphyxia, cesarean deliveries (CDs), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, meconium aspiration syndrome, and respiratory distress syndrome.,

In the context of patients with a history of previous CD, there is a global initiative to minimize repeated CDs due to associated morbidity. Trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) has emerged as a practical and widely endorsed option by various formal organizations and guidelines, aiming to reduce the overall incidence of CDs and their repeats. However, the efficacy in decreasing complications lies not only in promoting TOLAC but also in judiciously selecting appropriate candidates, as a failed TOLAC might lead to urgent CD, and carries an elevated risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Despite previous studies that have reported an increased risk of CD in cases of isolated or uncomplicated oligohydramnios, data regarding TOLAC outcomes in this subgroup of patients with oligohydramnios diagnosed at term is limited.

The present study aimed to assess the maternal and neonatal outcomes among patients diagnosed with oligohydramnios at term who underwent TOLAC compared to those who underwent planned repeat cesarean delivery (PRCD), thus providing comprehensive insights that might help clinical decision making of optimal delivery strategies in this specific subgroup of patients.

### Reducing stillbirths: interventions during labour [^115WXS2E]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In settings where safe, comprehensive EOC is already available, and diagnostic and monitoring capacity allow, advanced interventions to manage pre-eclampsia, PPROM, and oligohydramnios are needed. A few interventions examined in this review show strong evidence of impact for certain indications, including Caesarean for breech birth at term and induction of labour for post-term pregnancy. There is some evidence that other interventions such as amnioinfusion and maternal hyperoxygenation may reduce perinatal mortality, but further research on their safety and effectiveness in a range of settings is required before they can be routinely included in programs. In areas without comprehensive essential obstetric care capacity, it is key to prioritise improved access to EmOC, especially vacuum extraction and Caesarean section. EmOC is a package of clearly life-saving interventions, and there is an association between countries with high unmet obstetric need and intrapartum stillbirth rates. Safe EmOC, ideally as part of a package of comprehensive essential obstetric care services to address obstetric problems before they become emergencies, will have the greatest impact on intrapartum stillbirth rates in low-resource settings, though expanding provision of EmOC requires developing solutions for numerous logistical and infrastructural challenges. These interventions would need complementary measures to ensure staff training and optimise delivery strategies in health systems.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^1175cPdh]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the maternal and neonatal outcomes of patients with oligohydramnios attempting a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) versus those who underwent planned repeat cesarean delivery (PRCD).

Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with a term singleton pregnancy following a single low‐segment transverse cesarean delivery (CD) and a recent diagnosis of oligohydramnios (maximal vertical pocket < 2 cm) between 2017 and 2021. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were compared between patients attempting TOLAC and those opting for PRCD. Univariate analysis was conducted, followed by a multivariate analysis.

Results

A total of 352 deliveries were included, of which 278 (79%) attempted TOLAC and 74 (21%) attempted PRCD. The successful vaginal delivery rate for patients who attempted TOLAC was 84.5%. The uterine rupture rate was not significantly different between those attempted TOLAC versus PRCD (1.1% vs. 0%, P = 0.371). However, the rate of hypoglycemia (2.2% vs. 8.1%, P = 0.012) and the composite adverse neonatal outcome was higher among patients with PRCD (11.5% vs. 24.3%, P = 0.005). After controlling for potential confounders, we still demonstrated an independent association between reduced rates of composite adverse neonatal outcome and TOLAC (adjusted odds ratio 0.46, 95% CI: 0.23–0.92, P = 0.028).

Conclusion

TOLAC for patients with oligohydramnios appears to be a reasonable alternative and is associated with favorable outcomes. Further large and prospective research on this subject may lead to improved management strategies and better maternal and neonatal outcomes.

### Reducing stillbirths: screening and monitoring during pregnancy and labour [^114SVqU1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

Although a reasonable number of Cochrane reviews and RCTs were available which assessed the impact of one or more implementation strategies for many screening and monitoring interventions, none of the interventions we reviewed demonstrated convincing evidence of impact on stillbirths or perinatal mortality. A number of studies that did report statistically significant impact on stillbirth or perinatal mortality, or which suggested large magnitude differences between intervention and control/comparison groups, lacked sufficient rigor to justify recommending the routine use of the interventions evaluated.

The evidence for all interventions reviewed in this paper is summarised in Table 18. Of the range of monitoring interventions evaluated, fetal movement counting and Doppler monitoring were promising for further evaluation in high-risk pregnancies in low-resource settings. Low amniotic fluid measurements were strongly predictive of stillbirth, but interventions to restore adequate amniotic fluid volume or to deliver the baby based on identification of oligohydramnios have not been systematically tested to conclude whether amniotic fluid assessment is a useful diagnostic tool that leads to actions which prevent stillbirth.

### Fetal therapy for the treatment of congenital bladder neck obstruction [^113ytK9m]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) comprises a heterogeneous group of pathologies associated with early-onset oligohydramnios and cystic renal disease that have high rates of perinatal morbidity (from renal disease) and mortality (from pulmonary hypoplasia). The use of prenatal detailed ultrasonography and fetal urine analysis has been only partially successful in identifying fetuses with LUTO with relatively good prognosis that would benefit from in utero therapy. The most common prenatal therapy is vesicoamniotic shunting. Newer techniques, such as fetal cystoscopy, have potential for enhancing prenatal triage and simultaneously delivering treatment. Vesicoamniotic shunting seems to improve perinatal survival, but whether this treatment or conservative management is used, the surviving children have a high rate of end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis and transplantation. Further investigation of long-term outcomes of vesicoamniotic shunting and fetal cystoscopy is hoped to delineate the risks and benefits of these prenatal treatments and inform management strategies.

Conclusion

TOLAC for patients with oligohydramnios appears to be a reasonable alternative and is associated with favorable outcomes. Further large and prospective research on this subject may lead to improved management strategies and better maternal and neonatal outcomes.

### Reducing stillbirths: screening and monitoring during pregnancy and labour [^113acjn4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Screening and monitoring in pregnancy are strategies used by healthcare providers to identify high-risk pregnancies so that they can provide more targeted and appropriate treatment and follow-up care, and to monitor fetal well-being in both low- and high-risk pregnancies. The use of many of these techniques is controversial and their ability to detect fetal compromise often unknown. Theoretically, appropriate management of maternal and fetal risk factors and complications that are detected in pregnancy and labour could prevent a large proportion of the world's 3.2 million estimated annual stillbirths, as well as minimise maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Methods

The fourth in a series of papers assessing the evidence base for prevention of stillbirths, this paper reviews available published evidence for the impact of 14 screening and monitoring interventions in pregnancy on stillbirth, including identification and management of high-risk pregnancies, advanced monitoring techniques, and monitoring of labour. Using broad and specific strategies to search PubMed and the Cochrane Library, we identified 221 relevant reviews and studies testing screening and monitoring interventions during the antenatal and intrapartum periods and reporting stillbirth or perinatal mortality as an outcome.

Results

We found a dearth of rigorous evidence of direct impact of any of these screening procedures and interventions on stillbirth incidence. Observational studies testing some interventions, including fetal movement monitoring and Doppler monitoring, showed some evidence of impact on stillbirths in selected high-risk populations, but require larger rigourous trials to confirm impact. Other interventions, such as amniotic fluid assessment for oligohydramnios, appear predictive of stillbirth risk, but studies are lacking which assess the impact on perinatal mortality of subsequent intervention based on test findings. Few rigorous studies of cardiotocography have reported stillbirth outcomes, but steep declines in stillbirth rates have been observed in high-income settings such as the U.S., where cardiotocography is used in conjunction with Caesarean section for fetal distress.

Conclusion

There are numerous research gaps and large, adequately controlled trials are still needed for most of the interventions we considered. The impact of monitoring interventions on stillbirth relies on use of effective and timely intervention should problems be detected. Numerous studies indicated that positive tests were associated with increased perinatal mortality, but while some tests had good sensitivity in detecting distress, false-positive rates were high for most tests, and questions remain about optimal timing, frequency, and implications of testing. Few studies included assessments of impact of subsequent intervention needed before recommending particular monitoring strategies as a means to decrease stillbirth incidence. In high-income countries such as the US, observational evidence suggests that widespread use of cardiotocography with Caesarean section for fetal distress has led to significant declines in stillbirth rates. Efforts to increase availability of Caesarean section in low-/middle-income countries should be coupled with intrapartum monitoring technologies where resources and provider skills permit.

### Maternal hydration for increasing amniotic fluid volume in oligohydramnios and normal amniotic fluid volume [^114eVL1y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid) may be responsible for malpresentation problems, umbilical cord compression, concentration of meconium in the liquor, and difficult or failed external cephalic version. Simple maternal hydration has been suggested as a way of increasing amniotic fluid volume in order to reduce some of these problems.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of maternal hydration on amniotic fluid volume and measures of pregnancy outcome.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched. Date of last search: September 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing maternal hydration with no hydration in pregnant women with reduced or normal amniotic fluid volume.

Data Collection and Analysis

Eligibility and trial quality were assessed by both reviewers.

Main Results

Two studies of 77 women were included. The women were asked to drink two litres of water before having a repeat ultrasound examination. Maternal hydration in women with and without oligohydramnios was associated with an increase in amniotic volume (weighted mean difference for women with oligohydramnios 2.01, 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 2.56; and weighted mean difference for women with normal amniotic fluid volume 4.5, 95% confidence interval 2.92 to 6.08). Intravenous hypotonic hydration in women with oligohydramnios was associated with an increase in amniotic fluid volume (weighted mean difference 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 3.24). Isotonic intravenous hydration had no measurable effect. No clinically important outcomes were assessed in any of the trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Simple maternal hydration appears to increase amniotic fluid volume and may be beneficial in the management of oligohydramnios and prevention of oligohydramnios during labour or prior to external cephalic version. Controlled trials are needed to assess the clinical benefits and possible risks of maternal hydration for specific clinical purposes.

### The amniotic fluid index and oligohydramnios: a deeper dive into the shallow end [^113QbDrB]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Second- and third-trimester obstetrical ultrasound examinations include an amniotic fluid volume assessment. Professional organizations' clinical guidance recommends using semiquantitative techniques, such as the single deepest vertical pocket or amniotic fluid index, for this purpose. The single deepest vertical pocket is described as the preferred method of assessing amniotic fluid volume based on fewer oligohydramnios diagnoses and labor inductions with no demonstrable difference in pregnancy outcomes compared with the amniotic fluid index. We offer an alternative interpretation of the evidence for this advice, drawn from 6 randomized clinical trials and 2 meta-analyses comparing the single deepest vertical pocket to the amniotic fluid index. Individually and collectively, these reports are underpowered to detect significant differences in maternal and perinatal outcomes by study group. Moreover, randomized clinical trials comparing maternal and perinatal outcomes resulting from a policy of labor induction at or beyond 37 weeks of gestation vs expectant care consistently favor labor induction, the very intervention paradoxically cited as favoring the single deepest vertical pocket vs the amniotic fluid index. We conclude that the amniotic fluid index should be considered a reasonable method for third-trimester amniotic fluid assessment and diagnosing oligohydramnios.

### Clinical relevance of sonographically estimated amniotic fluid volume: polyhydramnios [^115rnp1m]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Polyhydramnios is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid within the amniotic cavity. The etiology of polyhydramnios may be idiopathic, the consequence of fetal structural anomalies, or the consequence of various fetal and maternal conditions. The clinical importance of polyhydramnios is found in its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes and the risk of perinatal mortality. The antenatal management of polyhydramnios can be challenging as there are no formalized guidelines on the topic. The purpose of this review is to provide a literature-based overview on the subject of polyhydramnios in singleton pregnancies, demonstrate its clinical implications, and describe a practical approach to its management.

### Prenatal multidisciplinary counseling for fetal congenital anomalies: a narrative review [^1156BKop]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1.2 PMC for surgically correctable congenital anomalies

Several fetal anomalies are surgically correctable, depending on the nature and severity of the condition (Table 3). It is important to note that the decision to pursue surgical correction depends on factors such as the specific diagnosis and the overall health of the fetus. A multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including pediatric surgeons, neonatologists, and genetic counselors, typically collaborates to assess and plan the appropriate interventions for each individual case. Expertise in the surgical correction of congenital malformations can significantly impact the perinatal management of prenatally diagnosed anomalies. Previous research has underscored the beneficial effects of prenatal surgical consultation, with findings indicating that it influenced the site of delivery in 48% of cases, altered the mode of delivery by 10%, led to a decision to terminate a pregnancy in 4.6% of cases, and resulted in a change of diagnosis in 7% of cases. The advent of prenatal diagnosis has substantially enhanced our comprehension of surgically remediable congenital malformations. Standard ultrasound screening typically conducted at 18–20 weeks' gestation detects anomalies, categorizing these pregnancies as high risk. Further invasive diagnostic procedures like amniocentesis or CVS may be offered to high‐risk pregnancies. Structural abnormalities that are challenging to delineate via ultrasound, such as hindbrain lesions or cases of oligohydramnios, can be better visualized through MRI. With the increasing range of options and sophistication of diagnostic methods, parents today are faced with more information, choices, and decisions than ever before, which can create as well as solve dilemmas. The ideal purpose of prenatal diagnosis and testing is to achieve 100% accuracy without fetal loss or injury and with no maternal risk. Essential to PMC is the understanding of the specific surgical condition's prenatal natural history, the limitations of prenatal diagnosis, and the detection of associated anomalies. The parents receive information about the nature of congenital anomaly, timing of the surgery, the recommended surgical procedure, potential risks and benefits, the medical team involved, and the expected outcomes post‐surgery (Figures 2 and 3). In some cases, fetal surgical procedures may be indicated. The risks and indications of fetal intervention programs should be fully understood by parents. Developmental malformations amenable to fetal intervention can be usefully categorized into five evidence‐based groups of conditions that benefit from fetal therapy. These range from level I, where conditions are associated with significant mortality or very severe morbidity if left untreated (such as twin‐to‐twin transfusion syndrome, myelomeningocele, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia), to level V, where conditions for which the use of fetal therapy is still controversial, such as osteogenesis imperfecta and aqueductal stenosis. Fetal therapy must meet the following three criteria to be ethically acceptable:
It should be life‐saving or prevent or substantially alleviate serious or irreversible disease, injury, or disability in the fetus.
The proposed therapy should have a low risk of fetal death and a low or manageable risk of serious disease, injury, or handicap to the fetus.
The risk of mortality and morbidity (illness, injury, or disability) to the mother should be very low.

### Treatments during pregnancy targeting ERBB2 and outcomes of pregnant individuals and newborns [^111oDQPo]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of our case-control study present substantial evidence that anti-ERBB2 therapies are associated with the occurrence of kidney failure as well as oligohydramnios among fetuses or newborns. These conditions may further escalate into respiratory tract malformation, which includes lung aplasia. Nevertheless, delaying the mother's treatment might lead to severe outcomes, particularly in cases of hormone receptor–negative BCs. Furthermore, our research indicates that oligohydramnios may be associated with subsequent fetal and neonatal complications. Whenever delaying anti-ERBB2 therapy is not possible, continuous monitoring for oligohydramnios becomes imperative, and anti-ERBB2 drugs should be withdrawn in the case of oligohydramnios. This approach demands a thorough investigation to ascertain its safety, and dedicated research must be pursued to confirm the validity of this strategy. Our study also has revealed distinct pharmacologic and fetal toxicity profiles for lapatinib and trastuzumab-emtansine, leading us to advise against the use of these specific treatments in all pregnant individuals.

### Nontraditional sonographic pearls in estimating gestational age [^116nvzrn]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Accurate gestational dating is one of the most important assessments obstetrical providers make in pregnancy, given that all of the various management strategies are dependent on knowing where the patient is in gestation. In addition to traditional biometry, ancillary biometric and nonbiometric measurements can help narrow the biologic variability between fetuses. Moreover, one can employ these nontraditional measurements both in late gestation to assist in determining appropriate gestational age and fetal lung maturity, and in other specific clinical situations-such as oligohydramnios, in which compression of the fetal head and abdomen can lead to difficulty in obtaining an accurate biparietal diameter and abdominal circumference. This chapter focuses on nontraditional fetal ultrasound measurements, including the transverse cerebellar diameter, fetal foot length, ratios of biometric and nonbiometric measurements, epiphyseal ossification centers, amniotic fluid volume, placental grading, and other miscellaneous markers in the context of evaluating a fetus with possible intrauterine growth restriction.

### Reducing stillbirths: screening and monitoring during pregnancy and labour [^1154RNh1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Only one intervention RCT compared AFI to no amniotic fluid assessment. Comparing AFI on admission (intervention) to no AFI (controls), Chauhan et al found that women in the intervention group with a diagnosis of low AFI (measured as ≤ 5 cm or ≤ 5 th percentile) were no more likely to have Caesarean section for fetal distress, neonatal acidosis, or Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes than untested controls or women with normal AFI results; no perinatal mortality statistics were reported [LOE: 1+].

One intervention strategy to improve perinatal outcomes is to augment amniotic fluid volume in cases of oligohydroamnios. Hofmeyr and Gülmezoglu undertook a systematic review of RCTs (2 trials, N = 78 women) assessing the impact of maternal hydration status (requesting that women drink 2 litres of water prior to a repeat ultrasound) on AFI (Additional file 16). In women with and without oligohydramnios, drinking water was associated with an increase in amniotic volume (WMD for women with oligohydramnios = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.43–2.60; WMD for women with normal AFI = 4.5, 95% CI: 2.92–6.08). Intravenous hypotonic hydration in women with oligohydramnios was associated with an increase in amniotic fluid volume (WMD = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.36–3.24), but isotonic intravenous hydration had no measurable effect.

### Prognosis of remaining fetus in twin pregnancy after demise of one fetus according to its location [^111o8xsz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

This retrospective cohort study included twin pregnancies with one fetal demise after the first trimester (14 weeks of gestation) that were delivered at the tertiary center between September 2004 and September 2022. We excluded multiple pregnancies of a higher order, cases in which both twins died, cases with unavailable or incomplete neonatal outcomes, cases in which fetal death was first diagnosed at delivery, and cases of pregnancy termination before 20 weeks. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the center (no. B-1905/540–005) and followed the principles set forth in the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013.

Management strategies of twin pregnancy

The management strategies for twin pregnancies in our center are as follows: (1) In pregnancies conceived spontaneously, the larger of the two crown-rump lengths was used to estimate gestational age; (2) Chorionicity was determined before 14 weeks of gestation; (3) After one fetal death in monochorionic twins, the surviving twin was assessed for anemia, brain damage, and ongoing fetal compromise. If there was no evidence of anemia, brain damage, or ongoing fetal compromise, delivery was usually performed at 34–36 weeks of gestation; (4) In the case of fetal demise in a dichorionic twin, the well-being status of the surviving fetal was assessed to determine the appropriate management strategy.

Baseline characteristics and pregnancy outcomes

We collected data on the following maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes: age, parity, mode of conception, height, weight, chorionicity, history of selective fetal reduction, gestational age at the fetal demise, diabetes, pregnancy complications (pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, placenta previa, oligohydramnios, preterm labor, and preterm premature rupture of membranes), history of cerclage, antenatal corticosteroid administration, gestational age at delivery, time interval from one fetal demise to the delivery of the remaining fetus, and mode of delivery. Chorioamnionitis and funisitis were defined based on histopathological evidence.

### Reducing stillbirths: screening and monitoring during pregnancy and labour [^1137nyS8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Polyhydramnios is a clear risk factor for perinatal mortality, whether associated with congenital malformations, placental insufficiency, or of idiopathic origin. However, no studies reported the impact of interventions subsequent to a diagnosis of polyhydramnios after amniotic fluid assessment, so the impact on stillbirth of amniotic fluid screening for polyhydramnios remains unclear. Although robust RCTs are limited, very low AFI values (oligohydramnios) are frequently associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, and in these cases a reactive NST loses its usual reassuring value (Grade C evidence). Where feasible, amniotic fluid volume estimation may be helpful for identifying severe oligohydramnios, but further research is needed to document subsequent intervention and perinatal mortality outcomes to determine the cost-benefit ratio of utilizing amniotic fluid assessment procedures. Amniotic fluid assessment is complicated by high variability of sequential measurements and use of different measurement methods, which can compromise the accuracy of the test. No particular method of amniotic fluid volume assessment appears superior to another, though using maximum vertical pool depth rather than AFI appears to limit unnecessary inductions of labour and Caesarean section by reducing diagnoses of oligohydramnios. There is a need for further research to test the impact of interventions to prevent or treat oligohydroamnios, particularly in the antepartum period with intact membranes, on perinatal outcomes.

Home versus hospital bed rest and monitoring for high-risk pregnancies

Background

Women with high-risk pregnancies, especially multiple pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disorders, are frequently admitted to hospital for bed rest and monitoring. However, in some instances, more limited monitoring in facilities and home-based bed rest or reduced physical activity may be as effective as hospital-based monitoring. Home-based activity modification, accompanied by outpatient surveillance and hospital admissions only for complications, would offer cost savings over hospital admission, reduced burden on hospital resources and personnel, and reduced disruption to the life of the mother posed by lengthy hospital stays.

### Sildenafil citrate therapy for oligohydramnios: a randomized controlled trial [^115tqgHP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare sildenafil plus hydration with hydration alone in improving the amniotic fluid index and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by idiopathic oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index less than 5 cm without underlying maternal or fetal causes and with normal fetal growth).

Methods

This was an open-label randomized trial for women carrying singleton pregnancies at 30 weeks of gestation or more with idiopathic oligohydramnios detected during routine ultrasonogram. Women received either oral sildenafil citrate (25 mg every 8 hours) plus intravenous infusion of 2 L isotonic solution or fluids only until delivery. The primary study outcome was the amniotic fluid volume at 6 weeks of follow-up or the final volume before delivery, whichever occurred first. Secondary outcomes were duration of pregnancy prolongation, mode of delivery, and select neonatal outcomes. The study was powered to detect a 45% difference between groups, so, at an α level of 0.05 and 80% power, a sample size of 167 women was required.

Results

From February 24, 2015, through April 2016, 196 women were screened and 184 were randomized. Follow-up was completed in 166 (90%): 82 in the sildenafil group and 84 in the hydration group. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The amniotic fluid volume was higher in the sildenafil group at the final assessment (11.5 compared with 5.4 cm, P = 0.02). The sildenafil group delivered later (38.3 compared with 36.0 weeks of gestation, P = 0.001), had a lower rate of cesarean delivery (28% compared with 73%), and their neonates were less likely to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (11% compared with 41%, P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Sildenafil citrate increases amniotic fluid volume in pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios.

### A randomised controlled trial comparing standard or intensive management of reduced fetal movements after 36 weeks gestation – a feasibility study [^113vvW5e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Protocol adherence and professionals' views

All patients in the intensive management arm had an ultrasound assessment of fetal growth, liquor volume and umbilical artery Doppler as compared to 97% in the control group. All women in the intensive group had hPL measured in maternal serum compared to no patients in the control group (Table 3). Ultrasound scans showed reduced fetal growth, oligohydramnios or abnormal umbilical artery Doppler in 14% of cases, 20% of the intensive group and 8% of the control group; as randomisation occurred before the ultrasound scan was performed this discrepancy must be due to chance. hPL was < 0.8 MoM in 30% of women in the intensive management group. Overall, the frequency of induction of labour (IOL) was no different between groups (Table 3); 59% in control compared to 62% in intensive management group. However, the proportion of women being induced for RFM was higher in the intensive management group 50% vs. 26%. In the control group the majority of IOL were for prolonged rupture of membranes or prolonged pregnancy. There was no difference in gestational age at presentation or at delivery. There was no increase in instrumental or Caesarean birth rates. Perinatal outcomes are shown in Table 4. Overall, 20% of women had a poor perinatal outcome, with the most frequent outcome being birthweight < 10 th centile; there were no stillbirths in either group. Although the study was not powered to detect differences in outcomes, and no formal hypothesis tests were planned; there were fewer poor perinatal outcomes in the intensive management group. It is interesting that the increased number of abnormalities on the ultrasound scan observed in the intensive group did not translate into increased poor pregnancy outcomes.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the antenatal management of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: a systematic review [^112foFTr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

One CPG highlighted a 20% growth discordance as a marker to distinguish pregnancies at increased risk of adverse outcome. One CPG defined FGR as ≥ 20% difference in the estimated fetal weight while 2 other CPGs defined growth discordance as the presence of either a > 20% difference in estimated fetal weight or an absolute measurement difference in abdominal circumference. Recommendations differed in the type of surveillance for growth discordance and included increased surveillance, umbilical artery Doppler assessment, and biophysical profile, cardiotocography (CTG), growth monitoring every 14 days, and scans every 1–2 weeks with AFI, UAD and biophysical profile.

Eighteen recommendations across eight CPGs were specific to the DCDA twin management following the identification of sFGR or discordant growth. Two CPGs supported the involvement of a fetal medicine specialist following identification of a first trimester CRL discordance > 10%. Three CPGs supported seeking an underlying cause of the discordance with ISUOG detailing the search should include an anatomy scan, screening for viral infections, and an amniocentesis may be required to exclude chromosomal abnormalities. AWFM agrees with ISUOG but does not detail the method for genetic testing and includes a family history and doppler sonography as part of the investigations.

Five CPGs made recommendations on procedures following identification of discordant growth which varied from referral to tertiary hospitals, to specialist services with adequate facilities, intense ultrasound monitoring without specifying the location, to the same or next day referral to a fetal medicine specialist to advise on and coordinate care. Five CPGs recommend the appropriate calculation for EFW discordance and application of the same method to ascertain this (Supplementary File 3). The SOGC ultrasound in twin pregnancy guideline was the only guideline that provided a recommendation for defining oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios. Three CPGs referred to the appropriateness of fetal echocardiography in DCDA twin pregnancies; no consensus was reached with one CPG stating it should not be offered while two CPGs recommended it could be considered in certain circumstances.

Seven recommendations over six CPGs gave guidance on the use of fetal growth charts. FIGO is the only CPG supporting the use of a twin specific growth chart because 'it may reduce unnecessary medical intervention', while three CPGs supported using singleton growth charts (9,37,40,53). Another CPG supported the use of the singleton growth chart but only until 32–35 weeks gestation. Only one guideline specified the appropriate growth chart in the case of unknown gender (a singleton female growth chart is recommended).

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 71: management of previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [^111XjPKw]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Previable and periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) — clinical predictors of neonatal and maternal outcomes: Residual amniotic fluid volume after PPROM is associated with differential neonatal outcomes, and compared with nonsurvivors, survivors were less likely to be born following oligohydramnios or anhydramnios; however, anhydramnios does not definitively preclude survival, with reported rates among survivors ranging from 7% to 38%. Gestational age at PPROM and oligohydramnios were found to be independent factors associated with severe respiratory morbidity in a retrospective cohort at 20 0/7 to 28 6/7 weeks of gestation, and as an example of gestational-age effect, there were no surviving neonates after PPROM at < 16 weeks of gestation. Maternal risk factors have also been identified; in a case–control study at 14 0/7 to 22 6/7 weeks, maternal age > 35 years and twin gestation were associated with higher odds of composite maternal morbidity, with reported aOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 1.48–10.8; and aOR, 5.62; 95% CI, 2.21–14.2; respectively.

### Reducing stillbirths: screening and monitoring during pregnancy and labour [^116Q6tLn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Implications for programmes and clinical practice

A few monitoring approaches showed promise for use in high-risk pregnancies, including fetal movement monitoring and umbilical Doppler velocimetry. Before recommending these interventions for widespread use, further large RCTs of sufficient rigour to detect differences in stillbirth and perinatal outcomes are needed to determine the utility and effectiveness of these monitoring approaches and interventions used after positive tests.

This review identified several interventions – for example, amniotic fluid measurement for signs of oligohydramnios, especially as pregnancy approaches or exceeds term; routine ultrasound scanning, and intrapartum cardiotocography – that are in widespread use in high-resource settings, but for which rigorous evidence is lacking. For these interventions, their continued use is reasonable even though the evidence base for impact on stillbirths is lacking. Intrapartum cardiotocography in particular has been shown in RCTs to elevate the risk of operative delivery. Prevailing wisdom credits cardiotocography and available Caesarean section with the diminution of stillbirth rates in high-income countries in recent decades; however, the role of cardiotocography in reducing stillbirth should be confirmed with more rigorous evidence. Efforts to achieve glycaemic control in cases of maternal diabetes mellitus are also encouraged, despite the lack of strong evidence showing an impact of such interventions on stillbirth, on the grounds that women with good glycaemic control experience fewer complications and negative outcomes of pregnancy.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^113py648]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4.5 Strengths and limitations

The main strength of our study was the large cohort from two obstetrical centers with high annual delivery volumes, in a developed country with advanced medical services and relatively high rates of TOLAC attempts. This enabled us to evaluate this specific subgroup of patients with oligohydramnios. The uniformity in inclusion criteria, reflected by the strict definition of oligohydramnios only according to one method (MVP) and the timing of diagnosis by qualified ultrasound units within the hospital, along with consistent TOLAC management protocols in our centers, reduces the likelihood of confounders and increases the reliability and generalizability of our findings. The use of computerized medical records updated in real‐time provided comprehensive data and minimized bias.

Our study specifically assessed success rates and complications of TOLAC in the presence of oligohydramnios. Additionally, the diagnosis of oligohydramnios in our study was close to delivery, whereas, in the previous studies discussed above, the timing of diagnosis was not specified and relied on medical record ICD codes.

The main limitation of our study was its retrospective design, which carries inherent limitations. For instance, we did not have sufficient data to stratify according to the causes of oligohydramnios or the indications for the previous CD, which could be important factors in successful TOLAC. Additionally, the unique population in our centers, characterized by patients who tend toward large families and prefer vaginal delivery over CD, may influence both the physicians' and patients' preferences regarding the mode of delivery. Despite these limitations, we addressed this through the inclusion of a large sample size and comparison of our results with other studies conducted in different populations that showed similar success rates. The rates of maternal and neonatal complications were similar to those reported in previous worldwide publications, including uterine rupture, PPH, puerperal fever, maternal ICU admissions, and maternal respiratory complications. This similarity suggests that our study's conclusions may be generalizable to other populations.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^115hkHF3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The study included term (37–42 weeks) singleton viable pregnancies with a live fetus attempting the first trial of labor following a single low‐segment transverse CD, with a diagnosis of oligohydramnios. In all cases the diagnosis was given or confirmed by an ultrasound closes to delivery upon admission to Labor and Delivery. We excluded patients in which the oligohydramnios was resolved, patients with AFI < 5 cm but MVP > 2 cm, patients with two or more previous CDs, multifetal gestation, placenta‐accreta spectrum, out‐of‐hospital deliveries, malformed uterus fetal major malformations, and non‐vertex presentations.

Both SZMC and BHMC followed shared departmental protocols adhering to the TOLAC guidelines established by the Israeli Committee of Obstetrics and Gynecology which are aligned with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines.TOLAC was offered to those with previous single low‐segment transverse CD after a detailed consultation on the risks and benefits of TOLAC versus PRCD, and patients who attempted TOLAC signed an informed consent. Resident physicians managed TOLAC deliveries under the supervision of a board‐certified obstetrician, ensuring real‐time decisions on induction, labor augmentation, operative deliveries, and emergency CDs. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring was mandatory. Regarding the management of oligohydramnios, according to the Israeli guidelines, isolated oligohydramnios at term without additional signs of placental insufficiency, is not an indication for induction of labor. The decision between delivery and conservative monitoring is based on gestational age and clinical judgment. Delivery is considered in appearance of additional signs of placental insufficiency (IUGR, Doppler abnormalities), maximum amniotic fluid pocket less than 2 cm, any suspicion of fetal compromise, and 41 weeks' gestation or more. The mode of delivery is determined based on cervical conditions and obstetric history. Prostaglandins, balloon catheter, and oxytocin may be used as in other standard indications for labor induction.

The study received approval from SZMC's institutional ethics committee (IRB: 0346‐22‐SZMC) overseeing both medical centers' research activities, adhering to the Declaration of Helsinki. Given its retrospective and de‐identified nature, informed consent was waived. Demographic and obstetric data, along with delivery complications, were extracted from the electronic database to minimize retrospective study biases.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^112is15N]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of our study was to evaluate the correlation between isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery and adverse placental mediated complications in subsequent delivery. We therefore investigated a cohort of second deliveries at our institution as described, excluding previous deliveries with adverse placental mediated outcomes to avoid a confounding effect for subsequent delivery. We demonstrated a significantly higher rate of oligohydramnios, small for gestational age neonates and overall placental disorders in subsequent delivery, following isolated oligohydramnios in previous delivery, as the odds ratio was almost double than of controls. No additional differences were noted in other adverse outcomes.

A debate regarding the pathogenesis and significance of oligohydramnios exists. While some consider this to be a variant of common clinical presentation, especially in the context of term pregnancy, others regard this entity as abnormal, and view it as a form of placental insufficiency. In some studies, isolated oligohydramnios at term was found to be related to higher rates of adverse outcomes like meconium aspiration syndrome, cesarean delivery for fetal distress and admission to NICU. Yet, the interpretation of these results must also account for the effects of iatrogenic interventions and lower weight fetuses. In a different study, expectant management of isolated oligohydramnios at preterm was associated with similar neonatal outcomes as compared to pregnancies with normal AFI, although an increased risk of new onset fetal growth restriction and lower birthweight was noted. This finding may suggest that in women with isolated oligohydramnios, reduced amniotic fluid volume can be the first sign of placental insufficiency. Nevertheless, others did not demonstrate any adverse outcomes with isolated oligohydramnios. An important adverse outcome that could not be evaluated in most studies regarding oligohydramnios was the risk of intrauterine fetal death, due to its rarity and insufficient sample size to address this outcome. Casey et al. showed a significant association between stillbirth and oligohydramnios, that persisted after exclusion of malformed fetuses from the analysis. Yet, they couldn't confirm that intervention may reduce this risk. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a randomized interventional trial will ever be able to address this specific complication.

### Amniotic fluid abnormalities [^116BbPKR]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

The complex nature of amniotic fluid reflects contributions from many fetal systems, many functional roles, and multiple interactions with fetal maturation, obstetric, and maternal factors. Simple ultrasound measurement, probably done best with the maximum vertical pocket method, has a clinical role in fetal surveillance, substantiated by extensive level II and some level I evidence. Interventions (amnioinfusion for oligohydramnios, amnioreduction for polyhydramnios) have not been studied effectively in controlled fashion, with the exception of intrapartum applications, where effective reduction of cesarean delivery for fetal distress and perinatal impacts of meconium aspiration may follow amnioinfusion. A wealth of research opportunities exists into regulation of amniotic fluid constituents and their relation to preterm delivery.

### Polyhydramnios among women in a cluster-randomized trial of ultrasound during prenatal care within five low and low-middle income countries: a secondary analysis of the first look study [^112HG3bR]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Polyhydramnios, or an excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid, affects less than 2% of pregnancies in high-income countries. Polyhydramnios can be associated with adverse outcomes such as perinatal mortality, prematurity, shoulder dystocia, and respiratory distress syndrome, and is therefore an important health concern. Polyhydramnios can result from maternal conditions such as poorly controlled diabetes, infections and medication exposure. Fetal conditions that affect the fetus's ability to swallow or obstructive gastrointestinal pathologies can also result in polyhydramnios.

In many low and low-middle income countries (LMICs), the incidence of polyhydramnios is unknown. The use of ultrasound during prenatal care is limited in many LMICs due to the high cost of purchasing and maintaining ultrasound equipment, and lack of trained providers to perform and interpret these studies. As a result, certain pregnancy-related conditions that are usually detected by ultrasound go undiagnosed, including polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios and fetal growth abnormalities. These conditions can lead to adverse perinatal events, and therefore should be recognized in order to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. Maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with polyhydramnios may be worse in LMICs due to limitations in emergent obstetric care and intensive care for infants born prematurely. Understanding the epidemiology of polyhydramnios in LMICs might lead to strategies for reducing perinatal and peripartum morbidity and mortality.

Pregnant women in LMICs may have different underlying risk factors for polyhydramnios when compared to women in high-income countries. Women in LMICs have different nutritional status, infection exposures, prevalence of diabetes and incidence of fetal anomalies than women in high-income countries. These differences in exposure might alter the prevalence of polyhydramnios in these regions. These maternal characteristics might also contribute to worse perinatal outcomes.

In this paper, we report the incidence of polyhydramnios among women in five LMICs. We also report maternal characteristics associated with polyhydramnios and the pregnancy and neonatal outcomes among those affected.

### Effects of maternal isolated oligohydramnios on blood metabolic profile in term neonates: a retrospective observational study [^112qhvFj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid volume is an important indicator of fetal health, and its assessment is required during every ultrasound examination in the middle and third trimesters of pregnancy. The most commonly used techniques are the maximum vertical pocket (MVP) and amniotic fluid index (AFI) measurements. The MVP, also known as deepest vertical pocket (DVP) or single deepest vertical pocket (SDVP), is the maximal vertical pocket depth, which should not contain fetal limbs or umbilical cord, while the AFI is the summation of the vertical diameter of the largest pocket in each of the four quadrants, using the maternal umbilicus as a central reference point. The definition of oligohydramnios has been controversial for decades, including MVP < 2 cm, AFI < 5 cm, AFI < 8 cm, and or AFI < 5th percentile. In general, MVP < 2 cm or an AFI < 5 cm have been widely recognized, among which MVP is better than AFI in identifying oligohydramnios. The prevalence of oligohydramnios is 0.5–5%. However, less than half of the cases with oligohydramnios have no pathological factors and are called isolated oligohydramnios (IO). Currently, the cause of IO remains unclear. Changes in aquaporin expression may be among the pathophysiological mechanisms, and reduced placental perfusion and chronic hypoxia have been implicated.

IO is associated with increased labor induction and cesarean section rates. A meta-analysis identified increased risks of adverse outcomes at birth in low-risk pregnancies with IO, including meconium aspiration syndrome, cesarean section due to abnormal fetal heart rate, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. However, some studies have shown that IO has similar neonatal outcomes to those of normal amniotic fluid pregnancies. Therefore, the gestational management of full-term IO remains controversial. Notably, a retrospective cohort study on the long-term outcomes of children born with IO found a significant association between IO and long-term neurological disorders in the offspring, with common diseases such as movement disorders, pervasive developmental disorders and IO is an independent risk factor for long-term gastrointestinal morbidity in offspring, including gastroduodenal diseases and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The suspected increased risk of long-term neurodevelopmental abnormalities and gastrointestinal disease in these IO offspring suggests that there may be minor abnormalities during pregnancy that may not be detected by routine examination but potentially affect fetal health in the short or long term.

### Neonatal outcomes are similar between patients with resolved and those with persistent oligohydramnios [^1164hQPB]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Oligohydramnios (defined as amniotic fluid volume < 5cm or deepest vertical pocket < 2cm) is regarded as an ominous finding on prenatal ultrasound. Amniotic fluid, however, is not static, and to date, there have been no studies comparing perinatal outcomes in patients who are diagnosed with oligohydramnios that resolves and those who have persistent oligohydramnios.

Study Design

This is a secondary analysis of a National Institutes of Health-funded retrospective cohort study of singleton gestations delivered at a tertiary care hospital between 2002 and 2013 with mild hypertensive disorders and/or fetal growth restriction (FGR). Maternal characteristics, delivery, and neonatal information were abstracted by trained research nurses. Patients with a diagnosis of oligohydramnios were identified, and those with resolved versus persistent oligohydramnios at the time of delivery were compared. The primary outcome was a composite of neonatal resuscitation at delivery: administration of oxygen, bag-mask ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, intubation, chest compression, or cardiac medication administration. Secondary outcomes included FGR, timing, and mode of delivery.

Results

Of 527 women meeting study criteria, 42 had oligohydramnios that resolved prior to delivery, whereas 485 had persistent oligohydramnios. There were no significant differences in patient demographics between groups. The gestational age at diagnosis was significantly lower for patients with resolved versus persistent oligohydramnios (median: 33.0 [interquartile range, IQR: 29.1–35.9] vs. 38.0 [IQR: 36.4–39.3], p < 0.001). There was not a substantial difference in rate of neonatal resuscitation (41 vs. 32%, p = 0.31). Patients with resolved oligohydramnios were more likely to have developed FGR than those with persistent oligohydramnios (55 vs. 36%, p < 0.02). There were no significant differences for gestational age at delivery, birth weight, or neonatal intensive care unit admission.

Conclusion

Patients whose oligohydramnios resolved were diagnosed earlier yet had similar rates of neonatal resuscitation but higher rates of FGR than those who had persistent oligohydramnios.

Key Points

· When diagnosed earlier in pregnancy, oligohydramnios was more likely to resolve prenatally. · Patients who were diagnosed with oligohydramnios earlier in pregnancy had higher rates of FGR. · There were no differences in the rates of the composite outcome of need for neonatal resuscitation when comparing those with resolved versus those with persistent oligohydramnios. No differences in composite neonatal morbidity were noted between those with resolved versus persistent oligohydramnios.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^111iDGnZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk:

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions:

Use of drugs that act on the RAS in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: oligohydramnios, reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

In patients taking telmisartan and amlodipine tablets during pregnancy, perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue telmisartan and amlodipine tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^115QD4nH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, evaluation was undertaken as permitted for premature rupture of membranes, fetal growth, and fetal malformations/genetic abnormalities. FGR was determined in the presence of an estimated fetal weight of less than the 10th percentile using local population-based nomograms. In accordance with national guidelines, induction of labor in cases of isolated oligohydramnios is indicated at 41 + 0 weeks of pregnancy provided reassuring fetal and maternal status until then, although for women with a favorable Bishop score, induction of labor was offered as of 39 + 0 weeks. If expectant management was chosen, surveillance with biophysical testing and a non-stress test were undertaken twice a week until delivery. Mode of delivery was dictated by routine obstetrical indications. At our institution for all uncomplicated pregnancies induction of labor is offered at 41 weeks.

Gestational age was determined as based on last menstrual period and adjusted in case of a 5–7-day discrepancy from first trimester ultrasound assessment. Small for gestational age (SGA) neonates were defined as a neonatal birthweight of less than 10th percentile according to local normograms. Pregnancy induced hypertension included gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Gestational hypertension was diagnosed with an elevated systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or more or a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or more, or both, on two occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation in a woman with a previously normal blood pressure. Preeclampsia was defined with new onset hypertension with measurements as mentioned previously and proteinuria or an end-organ dysfunction with or without proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. Preterm birth was defined as a delivery which occurred prior to 37 weeks gestation. Diagnosis of placental abruption was made based on clinical presentation and confirmed postpartum by placental examination. We defined a composite of any placental complication, defined as one of – pregnancy induced hypertension, small for gestational age, preterm delivery and placental abruption.

Data collection

Data from the subsequent pregnancy and delivery were collected from patients' computerized medical records. The following demographic characteristics were obtained: maternal age, gravidity, parity, body mass index (BMI kg/m 2), assisted reproductive technique use, smoking, pregestational diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic hypertension and rate of uterine Mullerian anomalies. The following obstetric outcomes were assessed: gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and DM, placental abruption, recurrence of oligohydramnios and intrapartum or postpartum need for maternal blood transfusion. The following data were collected from the neonatal records: birthweight and Apgar scores at 5 mins.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^113ECbEZ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this multicenter study of patients with oligohydramnios, we found that the successful vaginal delivery rate for those who attempted TOLAC was 84.5%. We also compared the maternal and neonatal outcomes of patients with oligohydramnios between those who underwent TOLAC versus those who underwent PRCD, demonstrating similar maternal outcomes between the groups, with no increased risk of uterine rupture. The rate of hypoglycemia and composite adverse neonatal outcomes was higher among patients who underwent PRCD, and this association remained significant after even controlling for potential confounders. This relatively high success rate demonstrates that under the right conditions, TOLAC in pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios is an achievable and safe option, with potentially favorable outcomes.

These new findings enhance our understanding of this obstetric condition and may increase the rates of TOLAC in this subpopulation, thereby reducing the rates of PRCD and its associated early and late complications. Further studies from other medical centers are needed to strengthen these findings.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen injection (Combogesic iv) [^111B38QB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the general U.S. population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAID-containing products, including COMBOGESIC IV, in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including COMBOGESIC IV, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

If, after consideration of alternative treatments for pain management, an NSAID-containing product, including COMBOGESIC IV, is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If COMBOGESIC IV treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue COMBOGESIC IV and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

### SMFM consult series # 46: evaluation and management of polyhydramnios [^114kBYYs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Polyhydramnios, or hydramnios, is an abnormal increase in the volume of amniotic fluid. Identification of polyhydramnios should prompt a search for an underlying etiology. Although most cases of mild polyhydramnios are idiopathic, the 2 most common pathologic causes are maternal diabetes mellitus and fetal anomalies, some of which are associated with genetic syndromes. Other causes of polyhydramnios include congenital infection and alloimmunization. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on the evaluation and management of polyhydramnios. The following are Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we suggest that polyhydramnios in singleton pregnancies be defined as either a deepest vertical pocket of ≥ 8 cm or an amniotic fluid index of ≥ 24 cm (GRADE 2C); (2) we recommend that amnioreduction be considered only for the indication of severe maternal discomfort, dyspnea, or both in the setting of severe polyhydramnios (GRADE 1C); (3) we recommend that indomethacin should not be used for the sole purpose of decreasing amniotic fluid in the setting of polyhydramnios (GRADE 1B); (4) we suggest that antenatal fetal surveillance is not required for the sole indication of mild idiopathic polyhydramnios (GRADE 2C); (5) we recommend that labor should be allowed to occur spontaneously at term for women with mild idiopathic polyhydramnios; that induction, if planned, should not occur at < 39 weeks of gestation in the absence of other indications; and that mode of delivery should be determined based on usual obstetric indications (GRADE 1C); and (6) we recommend that women with severe polyhydramnios deliver at a tertiary center due to the significant possibility that fetal anomalies may be present (GRADE 1C).

### Short-term and long-term postnatal outcomes of expectant management after previable preterm premature rupture of membranes with and without persistent oligohydramnios [^1161SXx4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare postnatal outcomes in pregnancies managed expectantly after previable preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) in relation to amniotic fluid volume.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was performed in 92 women with amniotic fluid leakage for more than a week after previable preterm PROM (gestational age 14 1/7–24 0/7 weeks) who delivered a liveborn neonate at or after 24 1/7 weeks of gestation from 2002 to 2014. Short-term (sepsis, intracerebral hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, respiratory distress syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and long-term (cerebral palsy and developmental delay) outcomes were compared between women with (n = 58) and without persistent oligohydramnios (n = 34), defined as maximal vertical pocket less than 2 cm or amniotic fluid index less than 5 cm. We analyzed discrete data using the χ2 or Fisher's exact test and continuous variables using Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test. We also performed multivariable analyses.

Results

There was a significant difference in survival rate at discharge (44/58 [75.9%] compared with 34/34 [100%], P = 0.001) and developmental delay at a median age of 4 years after performing multiple regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 70.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.9–1,719.9, P = 0.009) between participants with persistent oligohydramnios and participants with normal amniotic fluid volume. A multiple regression analysis, performed to control for confounders, revealed that gestational age at delivery (adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.7, P = 0.008) and breech presentation (adjusted OR 90.8, 95% CI 2.2–3,778.1, P = 0.018) were significant factors affecting survival of children with persistent oligohydramnios.

Conclusion

The postnatal survival rate after previable preterm PROM was lower and developmental delay more frequent in participants with persistent oligohydramnios than in participants with normal amniotic fluid volume. Even so, most neonates born alive after previable preterm PROM and persistent oligohydramnios survived to discharge and were developmentally normal. The overall survival rate was higher than in previous studies.

### Perinatal outcome in pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios diagnosed before 37 weeks of gestation [^111Tn3eN]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze pregnancy outcome in cases of isolated oligohydramnios at preterm.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies diagnosed with isolated oligohydramnios at preterm (n = 108). Pregnancy outcome was compared with a matched control group of low-risk preterm pregnancies with normal levels of amniotic fluid in a 3:1 ratio (n = 324).

Results

Pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios were characterized by a higher rate of preterm deliveries (26.9% vs 12.3%, P < .001), most of which were iatrogenic, and a higher rate of labor induction and cesarean delivery. Neonates with isolated oligohydramnios were characterized by a lower birthweight and a higher rate of neonatal morbidity. These differences were eliminated when the analysis was limited to the subgroup of pregnancies with isolated oligohydramnios that were managed expectantly and delivered spontaneously at term.

Conclusion

Adverse pregnancy outcome in cases of isolated oligohydramnios diagnosed at < 37 weeks appears to be related to a considerable degree to iatrogenic prematurity.

### Reducing stillbirths: screening and monitoring during pregnancy and labour [^114CpBRZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Amniotic fluid protects and supports the fetus during pregnancy. Both low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) and high amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) are abnormal and potentially place the fetus at risk of adverse outcomes. Oligohydramnios can be associated with maternal conditions including pre-eclampsia, or with placental membrane rupture, fetal growth restriction, post-term pregnancy, fetal kidney problems, or fetal or placental abnormalities. Polyhydramnios is frequently associated with maternal diabetes mellitus, maternal cardiac problems, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, or fetal or placental malformations, but in 50–60% of cases, it is idiopathic. Until ultrasound became available, the invasive nature of amniotic fluid testing limited its clinical usefulness. Using ultrasound, multiple methods for measuring amniotic fluid have been developed and are used to identify at-risk pregnancies. The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is a measure of the amount of amniotic fluid which is calculated by summing centimeters of depth of 4 different pockets of fluid; alternatively, the single deepest vertical pocket or maximum pool depth may be used. At term, many clinicians will induce labour or perform Caesarean section after diagnosis of decreased amniotic fluid volume to prevent an adverse pregnancy outcome. However, using assessments of amniotic fluid volume to predict fetal complications is controversial, and the utility of amniotic fluid assessment is different when used prior to versus after the onset of labour. Here, we examine the potential for assessment of amniotic fluid volume, or interventions to achieve normal amniotic fluid volume, to effectively detect high-risk pregnancy or fetal distress and subsequent adverse perinatal outcomes. We also examined the impact of interventions to achieve normal amniotic fluid volume on perinatal outcomes

### European consensus guidelines on the management of respiratory distress syndrome: 2022 update [^115YVxob]. Neonatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Inhaled nitric oxide (INO) is a proven therapy for hypoxaemic respiratory failure in term babies with pulmonary hypertension. Although there is no significant effect of INO on mortality or BPD in preterm infants < 34 weeks of gestational age, it is still often used on a physiological rationale during hypoxic respiratory failure. INO should not be used as a panacea for infants with poor oxygenation since INO is a toxic oxidant. However, for a small subgroup of preterm infants, with a history of mid-trimester oligohydramnios, birth asphyxia, and documented pulmonary hypertension with severe respiratory distress, brief NO treatment can result in rapid improvement in oxygenation, allowing ventilator settings to be reduced to safer levels.

At initiation of MV, lung recruitment may be used to optimise PEEP, but there is little evidence it influences outcome; however, lung recruitment before surfactant administration may lead to successful early extubation. Once stabilised on MV and with demonstrable spontaneous breathing effort, clinicians should immediately start planning for weaning to NIV. Some infants require a very short period of ventilation, particularly those with RDS following surfactant therapy, and early extubation of even the smallest babies who achieve low ventilator settings should be encouraged. Infant's size, absence of growth restriction, oxygen requirement, and blood gases can all help determine extubation success. Delaying extubation does not improve the chance of success. Trials of endotracheal tube CPAP to predict extubation readiness are not that helpful. Mathematical models for predicting extubation success may be useful, but their potential to improve outcomes has yet to be evaluated. Extubation is possible from when MAP reaches about 7–8 cm H 2 O on conventional ventilation or a CDP of 8–9 cm H 2 O on HFOV. Extubating to a relatively higher CPAP pressure of 7–9 cm H 2 O or NIPPV will improve chance of success, although at present, there are no data to support any particular CPAP level in terms of influencing longer term outcomes.

### Assessment of amniotic fluid volume in pregnancy [^1135v6b5]. Radiographics (2023). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid (AF) is an integral part of the fetal environment and is essential for fetal growth and development. Pathways of AF recirculation include the fetal lungs, swallowing, absorption through the fetal gastrointestinal tract, excretion through fetal urine production, and movement. In addition to being a marker for fetal health, adequate AF is necessary for fetal lung development, growth, and movement. The role of diagnostic imaging is to provide a detailed fetal survey, placental evaluation, and clinical correlation with maternal conditions to help identify causes of AF abnormalities and thereby enable specific therapy. Oligohydramnios prompts evaluation for fetal growth restriction as well as genitourinary issues, including renal agenesis, multicystic dysplastic kidneys, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and bladder outlet obstruction. Premature preterm rupture of membranes should also be clinically excluded as a cause of oligohydramnios. Clinical trials evaluating amnioinfusion are underway as a potential intervention for renal causes of oligohydramnios. Most cases of polyhydramnios are idiopathic, with maternal diabetes being a common cause. Polyhydramnios prompts evaluation for fetal gastrointestinal obstruction and oropharyngeal or thoracic masses, as well as neurologic or musculoskeletal anomalies. Amnioreduction is performed only for maternal indications such as symptomatic polyhydramnios causing maternal respiratory distress. Polyhydramnios with fetal growth restriction is paradoxical and can occur with maternal diabetes and hypertension. When these maternal conditions are absent, this raises concern for aneuploidy. The authors describe the pathways of AF production and circulation, US and MRI assessment of AF, disease-specific disruption of AF pathways, and an algorithmic approach to AF abnormalities. © RSNA, 2023 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

### Valsartan [^112drnGV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Valsartan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Published reports include cases of anhydramnios and oligohydramnios in pregnant women treated with valsartan (see Clinical Considerations).

When pregnancy is detected, consider alternative drug treatment and discontinue valsartan as soon as possible.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

### Maternal hydration therapy improves the quantity of amniotic fluid and the pregnancy outcome in third-trimester isolated oligohydramnios: a controlled randomized institutional trial [^111GhCU9]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Amniotic fluid is important for the maintenance of fetal well-being; therefore, an amniotic fluid deficiency, ie, oligohydramnios, can have multiple impacts on the prognosis of the pregnancy. In some cases, there are no evident fetal or maternal causes, and the condition is called isolated oligohydramnios. The aim of our study was to validate maternal intravenous and oral hydration therapy as a means for improvement of isolated oligohydramnios in the third trimester of pregnancy.

Methods

We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study on pregnancies complicated by idiopathic oligohydramnios (group A, 66 women) with a control group of women with normal pregnancies without oligohydramnios (group B, 71 women). Oligohydramnios was diagnosed using the amniotic fluid index (AFI; < 5 cm). Sonographic examinations were performed with a convex 3.5-MHz probe. Group A underwent 6 days of intravenous infusion of 1500 mL of an isotonic solution per day. An AFI measurement, a nonstress test, and a fetal biophysical profile were performed at 0 and 7 days. Group A was randomized into subgroups A1 and A2. Subgroup A1 was prescribed home oral hydration therapy of 1500 mL/d and subgroup A2 2500 mL/d. We considered the AFI to compare the effectiveness of the therapy.

Results

General features did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups. In group A, the mean AFI ± SD at recruitment was 39.68 ± 11.11 mm; in group B, it was 126.92 ± 10.59 mm (P < .001). In group A, the mean AFI at 7 days was 77.70 ± 15.03 mm; in group B, it was unchanged. In subgroup A1, the mean AFI at birth was 86.21 ± 16.89 mm; in subgroup A2, it was 112.45 ± 14.92 mm (P < .001).

Conclusions

Our data show that in pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios, hydration therapy significantly improves the quantity of amniotic fluid.

### Reducing stillbirths: screening and monitoring during pregnancy and labour [^112KKyKB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Oligohydramnios

Observational studies of oligohydramnios cases demonstrated a consistent elevated risk of poor perinatal outcomes. Anandakumar et al. studied how AFI used with non-stress cardiotocography and fetal acoustic stimulation for non-reactive NSTs might predict adverse pregnancy outcome in high-risk pregnancies (N = 565 women). Of the 4 perinatal deaths in the group with low AFI, 3 had had a reactive NST within 7 days of fetal death [LOE: 2-]. In Italy, Locatelli et al. reported rates of oligohydramnios twice as high in pregnancies with poor perinatal outcome than pregnancies with no adverse outcome [LOE: 2-]. However, oligohydramnios identified during the intrapartum period did not appear associated with adverse perinatal outcome in high-risk pregnancies: Baron et al observed that women with low AFI were more likely to have Caesarean section for fetal distress than women with normal AFI, but the rates of neonatal complications were similar [LOE: 2+].

### Management of twin pregnancies: remaining challenges and unanswered questions [^114UybR3]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Several professional societies have published guidelines on twin pregnancies over the past few years. These documents provide recommendations on antenatal surveillance and management of twin pregnancies. At the same time, these guidelines identify several key areas where evidence is limited and additional research is needed. In the present review, we summarize available evidence regarding some of these key areas, including the screening and prevention of preterm birth, the definition and management of fetal growth restriction, the diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes, the optimal maternal gestational weight gain, and the mode and timing of delivery. In addition, we describe several online tools related to these areas that can empower individuals with twin pregnancies and assist care providers in counseling these patients.

Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) — obstetric complications and management considerations include that polyhydramnios and preterm birth occur frequently, with reported incidences as high as 29% and 66%, respectively; if polyhydramnios causes maternal respiratory symptoms, options have included a short course of a prostaglandin inhibitor or serial amnioreduction, but both lack evidence of benefit and have potential complications and should be used judiciously; tocolytic agents are a consideration < 24 weeks when contractions follow a known inciting event such as an invasive procedure; because prematurity is likely to worsen the prognosis, we recommend that preterm delivery be undertaken only for obstetric indications.

### A rare cause of echogenic kidneys with oligohydramnios in the fetus: report of two different cases [^1173U9W7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Fetal echogenic kidneys, identified by an abnormally bright appearance on ultrasound compared to the liver or spleen, can indicate underlying renal abnormalities and dysfunction. While echogenic kidneys may sometimes present as an isolated finding, their association with factors such as enlargement (greater than the 95th percentile), cystic changes, reduced amniotic fluid, or a family history of renal diseases increases the likelihood of significant renal issues in the fetus. One notable condition linked to echogenic kidneys is fetal autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), which typically manifests as bilaterally enlarged echogenic kidneys and oligohydramnios on prenatal imaging. Other rare conditions, such as glomerulocystic kidney disease(GCKD), are less frequently prenatally reported.

After 16 weeks of gestation, fetal kidneys excrete the fetal urine to the pathway of amniotic circulation, reach the plateau around 34 weeks, steady through the rest of gestation until term, and a little decrease after 40 weeks. The fetal kidneys provide over 90% of the amniotic fluid after 20 weeks and the amniotic fluid acts as a vital sign parameter for fetal well-being. The normality of the amount of amniotic fluid reflects the development and maturity of many organ systems. The fetal swallowing of amniotic fluid is essential for lung maturity, which causes growth and branching of the distal alveolar buds during gestation. Abnormal fetal kidney functions lead to a varying degree of decrease in the amount of amniotic fluid, oligohydramnios, and anhydramnios; this can result in pulmonary hypoplasia and early neonatal death. The management of fetuses with echogenic kidneys and oligohydramnios involves monitoring kidney function through amniotic fluid volume assessment, with decreased or absent fluid indicating a poorer prognosis.

Given the challenging prognosis associated with these conditions, decisions may sometimes be made to terminate the pregnancy, complicating family counseling and limiting opportunities for preimplantation and prenatal genetic diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies. Molecular genetic studies and renal pathology play crucial roles in confirming the diagnosis of a suspected case. In this reported case, we attempt to highlight an alternative differential diagnosis of a cause of fetuses presenting with prenatal ultrasound findings of bilaterally enlarged echogenic kidneys and oligohydramnios.

### The association of abnormal α-fetoprotein and adverse pregnancy outcome: does increased fetal surveillance affect pregnancy outcome? [^114UH346]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Our purpose was to investigate whether adverse outcomes associated with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels may be prevented by intensive antenatal monitoring.

Study Design

Records of patients with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values of ≥ 2.0 multiples of the median between 1995 and 1999 were reviewed. Pregnancy histories were analyzed to determine whether intensive antenatal monitoring (twice-weekly nonstress tests and determinations of the amniotic fluid index) would have detected the adverse outcomes when routine obstetric care would have missed them. Women with elevations explained by multiple gestations, structural abnormalities, or a fetal death were excluded.

Results

The study enrolled 136 patients. Twenty-three patients were excluded because of multiple gestations, structural or chromosomal abnormalities, or fetal death or for lack of available follow-up. Seventy-eight patients had no perinatal complications, but 12 of these patients underwent heightened surveillance. One of these patients was subjected to an induction of labor. Thirty-five pregnancies had complications (21 with preterm labor, 7 with pregnancy-induced hypertension, 6 with growth restriction or oligohydramnios, 1 with abruptio placentae, and 1 with vasa previa). Of these 35 pregnancies, 22 were followed up with routine obstetric care and 13 with heightened surveillance. Heightened surveillance did not achieve earlier or improved detection in this group. These results suggest that routine pregnancy management is an adequate strategy for providing care to pregnant patients with unexplained elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. Adverse outcomes were detected with routine pregnancy management or were undetectable even with intensive management.

Conclusion

Increased risks of pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine fetal death, oligohydramnios, and abruptio placentae are associated with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. However, in our study, routine pregnancy management was an acceptable method of detecting these adverse outcomes when they were detectable.

### Study protocol of SWEPIS a Swedish multicentre register based randomised controlled trial to compare induction of labour at 41 completed gestational weeks versus expectant management and induction at 42 completed gestational weeks [^112WxLmk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

According to World Health Organisation (WHO), postterm birth is defined as pregnancy duration of 294 days or longer, i.e.g.estational week (GW) 42 and 0 days (42 +0) or more, measured from the first day of the last menstrual period. This definition is arbitrary. Many studies that have analysed risks and management of postterm birth also include pregnancies from 41 +0 GW (late term). Globally, the prevalence of postterm birth is about 5–10% but the rate varies considerably between and within countries. Factors that influence the prevalence are characteristics of the population e.g. maternal age and number of primiparous women in the population, the rate of preterm birth, interventions such as caesarean section and induction of labour, the prevalence of routine ultrasound dating of pregnancy and pregnancy surveillance routines. If ultrasound is performed at 40 +0 or 41 +0 GW, fewer women will reach 42 +0 GW as some pregnancies will be diagnosed as risk pregnancies leading to induction (e.g. because of oligohydramniosis or small for gestational age foetuses). The prevalence of postterm birth (42 +0 GW or more) in Sweden was 8.4% between 1982 and 1991 and 6.9% in 2013.

The aetiology of postterm birth is largely unknown. Some rare, known causes of postterm birth are foetal anencephaly, foetal adrenal hypoplasia or insufficiency and placental sulphates deficiency. Risk factors for postterm birth include: primiparity, advanced maternal age, maternal obesity, heredity, previous postterm pregnancy, and a male foetus.

### Routine third-trimester ultrasound in low-risk pregnancies and perinatal death: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Pnr46]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether routine third-trimester ultrasounds in low-risk pregnancies decrease the rate of perinatal death compared with regular antenatal care with serial fundal height measurements.

Data Sources

This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials to identify relevant studies published from inception to October 2019. The databases used were Ovid, PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using a combination of key words related to "third trimester ultrasound" and "low-risk".

Study Eligibility Criteria

We included all randomized control trials of singleton, nonanomalous low-risk pregnancies that were randomized to either one or more third-trimester ultrasounds (ultrasound group) or serial fundal height (fundal height group). Exclusion criteria were patients with multiple gestations, maternal medical complications, or fetal abnormalities requiring a third-trimester ultrasound.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

The primary outcome was the rate of perinatal death. The secondary outcomes were rates of fetal growth restriction, suspected large for gestational age, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, fetal anomalies, antenatal interventions, stillbirth, neonatal death, cesarean delivery, induction of labor, and other neonatal outcomes. This meta-analysis was performed with the use of the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird to produce relative risk or mean difference with a corresponding 95% confidence interval.

Results

A total of 7 randomized control trials with 23,643 participants (12,343 in the ultrasound group vs 11,300 in the fundal height group) were included. The total rate of perinatal death was similar among the groups (41 of 11,322 [0.4%] vs 34 of 10,285 [0.3%]; relative risk, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.68–1.89). The rate of fetal growth restriction was higher in the ultrasound group (763 of 10,388 [7%] vs 337 of 9021 [4%]; relative risk, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.86–2.39) and the rate of suspected large for gestational age (1060 of 3513 [30%] vs 375 of 3558 [11%]; relative risk, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 2.6–3.2). Polyhydramnios was also significantly higher in the ultrasound group than the fundal height group (18 of 323 [6%] vs 4 of 322 [1%] relative risk, 3.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–11). The rates of the remainder of the secondary outcomes were similar among the groups.

Conclusion

Routine third-trimester ultrasounds do not decrease the rate of perinatal death compared with serial fundal height in low-risk pregnancies. Ideally, an adequately powered trial is warranted to determine whether perinatal mortality in the fundal height group can be reduced by one-third with third-trimester ultrasound.

### Ketoprofen [^112epGLM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios and, in some cases, neonatal renal

impairment. These adverse outcomes are seen, on average, after days to weeks of treatment,

although oligohydramnios has been infrequently reported as soon as 48 hours after NSAID

initiation. Oligohydramnios is often, but not always, reversible with treatment discontinuation.

Complications of prolonged oligohydramnios may, for example, include limb contractures and

delayed lung maturation. In some postmarketing cases of impaired neonatal renal function,

invasive procedures such as exchange transfusion or dialysis were required.

If NSAID treatment is necessary between about 20 weeks and 30 weeks gestation, limit

ketoprofen capsules use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. Consider

ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if ketoprofen capsules treatment extends beyond 48

hours. Discontinue ketoprofen capsules if oligohydramnios occurs and follow up according to

clinical practice [see PRECAUTIONS; Pregnancy].

### Clinical practice guidelines for the antenatal management of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: a systematic review [^117AMZwU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) criteria. The protocol for this systematic review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42021248586, registered 25 June 2021) and published in an open research online platform.

Eligibility criteria

For this review, clinical practice guidelines are "systematically developed statements informed by a systematic review of evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options with the aim of optimizing patient care", this definition is an adaptation of the definition from the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The PICAR (population, interventions, comparators, attributes of eligible CPGs and recommendations) framework was used to develop the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table 1).

Table 1
Eligibility Criteria Pertaining to the Population and Clinical Areas, Interventions, Comparators, Attributes of Clinical Practice Guidelines and Recommendation Characteristics (Picar) Statement

Information sources and search strategy

We systematically searched the following databases to identify eligible CPGs, published between 2000 and 2021: PubMed, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), MEDLINE, Web of Science and OpenGrey. Guideline repositories (n = 13) and the websites of professional organisations of high-income countries within the European Union (EU), Scandinavian countries and high-income English-speaking countries outside of the EU (n = 44). The search strategy was developed with the assistance of a specialist medical librarian. Information sources and search terms are detailed in Supplementary File 1 and in the published protocol.

Study selection criteria

Retrieved records were imported into Mendeley, and deduplicated using the "check for duplicates" function. They were then imported into Rayyan and screened. Two independent reviewers (COC, EOC) screened 50% of the results each and cross-checked 20% of decisions, there were no discrepancies. The PICAR framework was applied broadly in the first phase of screening to ensure relevant CPGs were included. Monochorionic twin pregnancy guidelines were included in this review if they contained any recommendation applicable to a DCDA twin pregnancy, in particular dating and chorionicity recommendations. The blind function was activated for the reviewers on Rayyan during the full text screen to eliminate bias. Once completed the blind function was removed and any disagreements were discussed and resolved with the input of a third reviewer (KOD).

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^112kV6cD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Oligohydramnios was detected in approximately one of every ten pregnancies beyond the gestational age of 36 weeks, in women seeking care at MRRH. Increasing gestational age, history of malaria in pregnancy, and prime gravidity were the factors significantly associated with oligohydramnios. We recommend increased surveillance for oligohydramnios in the third trimester, especially among prime gravidas, those with history of malaria in pregnancy, and those with post-term pregnancies, in order to enable prompt detection of this complication and plan timely interventions.

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^111vQPhw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Isolated oligohydramnios are associated with an increased risk of placental abnormalities. Zilberman et al. investigated the extent of oligohydramnios. Abnormally reduced amniotic fluid volume was associated with an increased rate of fetal cardiac arrhythmias, more frequent need for induction of labour, and worse neonatal outcome. Oligohydramnios are also associated with more frequent cesarean section in low-risk pregnancies and an increased rate of low birth weight neonates. Fetal weight estimation may also be confounded by lower than average amniotic fluid, and in oligohydramnios, birth weight may be overestimated even shortly before term. If the height of the uterine fundus is lower than expected based on the calculated gestational age, reduced volume of amniotic fluid should be considered, and measurement is recommended.

Severe oligohydramnios can trigger pulmonary hypoplasia. An international study found that children with reduced amniotic fluid volume had an 8% higher rate of clinical airway treatment and an 80% higher incidence of respiratory failure compared to children with no oligohydramnios detected. Severe oligohydramnios can also have long-term neurological consequences for the newborn, which may be reflected in movement disorders.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^116MLqQg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oligohydramnios is the commonest amniotic fluid disorder, characterized by reduced amniotic fluid or amniotic fluid volume that is less than expected for gestational age. Oligohydramnios is associated with poor maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction, fetal distress, birth asphyxia, prolonged labor, and increased risk of caesarean section, often arising from umbilical cord compression, meconium aspiration, or uteroplacental insufficiency. In low-and middle-income countries, oligohydramnios accounts for approximately up to 6.5% of still births.

Oligohydramnios occurs in about 1–5% of term pregnancies worldwide; however, the prevalence rises to more than 12% in post-term pregnancies. In Africa, prevalence rates of oligohydramnios ranging from 4 to 23% have been reported previously. Additionally, several maternal, placental, and fetal factors, including ruptured amniotic membranes, fetal abnormalities, genetic factors, maternal illnesses, nutrition status, multiple pregnancies, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and use of certain angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), have been found to be associated with oligohydramnios.

### Trial of labor following cesarean among patients with oligohydramnios at term: a multicenter retrospective study [^111MKH5v]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

Over the study duration, 352 term deliveries with oligohydramnios in patients with previous CD met the inclusion criteria. Among them, 278 (79%) chose to attempt a TOLAC, while 74 (21%) preferred a PRCD, as illustrated in Figure 1.

FIGURE 1
Study population schematic flow chart.

Demographic and obstetrical characteristics of the study groups are delineated in Table 1. Notably, those attempting TOLAC were younger (mean age 32.2 ± 5.6 vs. 33.7 ± 5, P = 0.038), at advanced gestational age (39.7 ± 1.2 vs. 39 ± 1.6, P < 0.001), and delivered larger birth weight neonates (3206.5 ± 475.9 vs. 3063.4 ± 538, P = 0.026). However, the incidence of small for gestational age neonates was comparable between the TOLAC and PRCD groups. Table 2 presents the maternal outcomes of both groups.

### Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil [^114KnP6a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death [see Clinical Considerations]. Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents.

When pregnancy is detected, discontinue amlodipine besylate and olmesartan medoxomil as soon as possible. Consider alternative antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%–4% and 15%–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Olmesartan medoxomil

Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death.

Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury.

Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to olmesartan for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to olmesartan, if oliguria or hypotension occur, utilize measures to maintain adequate blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and supporting renal function [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### The role of amniotic fluid assessment in indicated preterm delivery [^113hyLD4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Measuring amniotic fluid pockets with ultrasound is an efficient and reasonably reliable method of evaluating amniotic fluid volume and categorizing relative risk of perinatal morbidity. The most commonly used ultrasound criteria for oligohydramnios, SDP < 2 cm and AFI < 5 cm, assign approximately 2%-3% and 4%-5% of late preterm pregnancies into the "low amniotic fluid" category. The AFI offers somewhat greater sensitivity and greater precision but has less specificity for predicting perinatal morbidity than does the SDP. Thus, before 34 weeks, use of the AFI < 5 cm as a criterion for intensive fetal monitoring, but not as sole criteria for delivery, is recommended. In pregnancies beyond 34 weeks, use of either AFI or SDP to diagnose oligohydramnios can be expected to reliably identify fetuses at risk for compromised perinatal outcome especially if replicate measurements are confirmatory. In such cases, care must be taken to identify comorbid conditions that, together with oligohydramnios, may place the fetus at significant risk. In such cases, delivery is the recommended intervention.

### Serial third-trimester ultrasonography compared with routine care in uncomplicated pregnancies: a randomized controlled trial [^112qwpec]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Among uncomplicated pregnancies, serial third-trimester ultrasound examinations identified significantly more cases with a composite of fetal growth or amniotic fluid abnormalities (27%) than did routine fundal height measurements (8%).

Methods

Women without complications between 24 0/7 and 30 6/7 weeks of gestation were randomized (NCT0270299) to either routine care (control arm) or ultrasound examination every 4 weeks (intervention arm). The primary outcome was a composite of abnormalities of fluid volume and growth: oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios; fetal growth restriction; or large for gestational age. The secondary outcome was the presence of composite maternal or neonatal morbidity among the two groups. A total of 206 participants was needed to have 80% power to detect an increase in the primary composite outcome from 10% in control to 25% in the intervention group (baseline rate 10%; two-tailed; α = 0.05; loss to follow-up 5%). All women were included in the intent-to-treat analysis. Fisher exact, χ tests, or two-sample t tests were used to assess group differences.

Results

From July 11, 2016, to May 24, 2017, 852 women were screened for eligibility and 206 were randomized as follows: 102 in routine care and 104 in serial ultrasound examinations. The two groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. The primary composite outcome was significantly higher among women who were in the ultrasound examination group than the routine care group (27% vs 8%; relative risk 3.43, 95% CI 1.64–7.17); five women (95% CI 3–11) were needed to identify at least one of the composite ultrasound abnormalities. Although we were underpowered to detect a significant difference, the following secondary endpoints occurred with similar frequency in the ultrasound examination group than the routine care group: induction resulting from abnormal ultrasound examination findings (14% vs 6%), cesarean delivery in labor (5% vs 6%), and prespecified composite maternal morbidity (9% in both groups) and composite neonatal morbidity (1% vs 4%).

Conclusion

Among uncomplicated pregnancies between 24 0/7 and 30 6/7 weeks of gestation, serial third-trimester ultrasound examinations were significantly more likely to identify abnormalities of fetal growth or amniotic fluid than measurements of fundal height and indicated ultrasound examination. No differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes were noted, although we were underpowered for these endpoints.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If diclofenac sodium treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue diclofenac sodium and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

### Association of neonatal and fetal malformations with polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios-introduction of a new "association factor" [^117KgYdq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

To date, ultrasound screening and targeted ultrasound examinations have played the most important role in the detection of fetal malformations. Ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging procedure in the world, it is extremely safe, and with the development of ultrasound systems, it has been associated with increasing imaging performance. According to the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios are the two most commonly detected ultrasound abnormalities during pregnancy.

The possible causes of poly- and oligohydramnios are discussed in several publications. Polyhydramnios and oligohydramnios may be associated with fetal anatomical abnormalities, fetal chromosomal abnormalities. In a study spanning four years, Hentemann et al. investigated 140 pregnancies associated with various developmental abnormalities detected by ultrasound, the authors highlighted the importance of karyotyping from amniotic fluid in cases of detected developmental abnormalities and oligohydramnios. Kouamé et al. point out that when polyhydramnios is detected, particular care must be taken during ultrasound examination in order to detect any fetal abnormalities that may be present.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the antenatal management of dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies: a systematic review [^116eG6oM]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Preterm labour

Fifty-six recommendations (fourteen CPGs) specified views on screening and interventions for preterm labour (Supplementary File 8). There is no consensus across CPGs regarding the use of cervical length screening. Five guidelines recommended routine cervical length (CL) screening for twin pregnancies, however they differ in their definition of a short cervical length (20–25 mm). Four guidelines highlighted they do not advise routine cervical length screening. In women symptomatic of preterm labour one guideline recommended cervical length should not be used exclusively to direct the management.

One CPG recommended no intervention (CL, fetal fibronectin or any other rapid test) is appropriate for use in multiple pregnancy. Three CPGs agreed it is not appropriate to use fetal fibronectin testing alone to predict the risk of spontaneous preterm birth.

No CPG supports the untargeted administration of corticosteroids and seven CPGs specified appropriate gestation for corticosteroid administration (24–34 weeks), with FIGO also recommending they should also be administered if there is a planned caesarean section < 37 weeks. ACOG and FIGO differ in their recommendations for repeat corticosteroid courses; FIGO recommended it should be individualised rather than routine practice but ACOG specify a single repeat course should be considered in women < 34 weeks, at risk of delivery within the next 7 days, who had their initial course > 14 days ago.

CPGs agreed the use of prophylactic tocolysis is not routinely recommended, and two CPGs provided recommendations when a course of tocolysis may be considered. The use of progesterone, cervical pessary, cerclage and bed rest to prevent spontaneous preterm labour is not recommended in any included guideline. One guideline recommended the use of magnesium sulphate in the case of delivery prior to 32 weeks for fetal neuroprotection.

### Sulindac [^112Mn8TJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including sulindac tablets, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If sulindac tablets treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue sulindac tablets and follow up according to clinical practice (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity).

Data

Human Data

There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Sulindac should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The known effects of drugs of this class on the human fetus during the third trimester of pregnancy include: constriction of the ductus arteriosus prenatally, tricuspid incompetence, and pulmonary hypertension; non-closure of the ductus arteriosus postnatally which may be resistant to medical management; myocardial degenerative changes, platelet dysfunction with resultant bleeding, intracranial bleeding, renal dysfunction or failure, renal injury/dysgenesis which may result in prolonged or permanent renal failure, oligohydramnios, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, and increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.

The purpose of this study was to compare the use of an amniotic fluid index (AFI) less than 5 cm to the use of an AFI less than the fifth percentile for gestational age in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study from 1998 to 2008. Patients with an AFI less than 5 cm and those with an AFI less than the fifth percentile were compared to patients with a normal AFI. The primary outcome measure was neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission.

Results

A total of 17,887 patients had complete information for analysis. There were 145 NICU admissions in patients with an AFI less than 5 cm (relative risk, 2.2) compared to 235 in patients with an AFI less than the fifth percentile for gestational age (relative risk, 2.37). The sensitivity and specificity for NICU admission using an AFI less than 5 cm were 10.9% and 95.2% compared to 17.6% and 92.5% for an AFI less than the fifth percentile for gestational age.

Conclusions

Oligohydramnios defined as an AFI less than the fifth percentile better predicts fetuses at risk for adverse perinatal outcomes compared to an AFI less than 5 cm.

### Prognosis and outcome of pregnancies exposed to renin-angiotensin system blockers [^1128rBQ1]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To study pregnancy outcomes and fetal renal prognosis markers in cases of exposure to renin-angiotensin system blockers.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of a series of 21 patients exposed to blockers of the renin-angiotensin system during pregnancy. Two markers were prenatally studied, fetal serum β2-microglobulin and amniotic fluid volume. Poor renal prognosis evaluation was based on postnatal glomerular filtration rate or on the presence of renal histologic lesions.

Results

Of the 21 fetuses, only one had a normal postnatal renal function at birth (oligohydramnios regression and normal β2-microglobulin). All fetuses with persistent oligohydramnios or β2-microglobulin ≥ 5 mg/L presented an adverse renal outcome.

Conclusion

Exposure to renin-angiotensin system blockers complicated by oligohydramnios is associated with a very poor outcome. We propose a prenatal management based on amniotic fluid volume monitoring and fetal serum β2-microglobulin. However, our preliminary results have to be confirmed by a larger study.

### 'Perinatal outcome in preterm premature rupture of membranes with amniotic fluid index [^116gJprN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

Complications of preterm premature rupture of membranes count for approximately 25% to 33% of all preterm deliveries.

Approximately, 75% of women will be delivered within 1 weeks of presentation. More recent evidence suggests that membrane rupture is also related to biochemical processes, including disruption of collagen within the extracellular matrix of the amnion and the chorion and programmed death of cells in the fetal membranes. It has been proposed that the fetal membranes and the maternal uterine lining (decidua) respond to various stimuli, including membrane stretching and infection of the reproductive tract, by producing mediators, such as prostaglandins, cytokines, and protein hormones that govern the activities of matrix-degrading enzymes. When the fetal membranes rupture at term or before, the options are expectant management (with close observation for signs of labor, non reassuring fetal-heart-rate patterns, or intrauterine infection) or induction of labor.

Expectant management with antenatal antibiotics and corticosteroid administration are recommended the standard of care in the setting of PPROM at gestational ages of ≤ 34. Current evidence suggests adjunctive antibiotic therapy to reduced gestational age-dependent and infectious infant morbidity.

Amniocentesis and amniotic fluid volume have been advocated as a useful adjunct for identifying these patients Several studies have implicated oligohydramnios in patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes as a significant risk factor for perinatal infection, and fetal distress, cesarean delivery, and neonatal death. In our study the finding of an AFI < 5 cm after preterm premature rapture of the membranes was associated with the development of chorioamnionits. However, patients in the group with AFI < 5 did not have a shorter latency until delivery. Our study did not demonstrate an association between the development of chorioamnionitis and latency interval in patients with ruptured membranes (P = 0/783), because the latency period in our study were not significantly different between 2 groups.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of limited obstetric ultrasound examinations by advanced clinical providers [^113932Li]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Amniotic fluid assessment in limited obstetric ultrasound specifies that the pocket must be at least 1 cm in width; oligohydramnios is defined as a DVP less than 2 cm or AFI of 5 cm or less; polyhydramnios is defined as a single DVP of 8 cm or greater or AFI of 24 cm or greater; and the single DVP is the preferred method of assessment for oligohydramnios.

### Opioids in pregnancy and neonatal abstinence syndrome [^113QsTaR]. Seminars in Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Opiate use in pregnancy has increased dramatically over the past decade and now represents a major public health problem. More women are using prescription opioids, illegal opioids, and opioid-substitution therapy. These drugs have been associated with numerous obstetrical complications including intrauterine growth restriction, placental abruption, preterm delivery, oligohydramnios, stillbirth, and maternal death. Neonatal complications are also significant, such as an increased risk of mortality as well as neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS is a serious and highly variable condition characterized by central nervous system hyperirritability and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. The present review seeks to define current practices regarding the management of opiate dependence in pregnancy and care of the neonate with prenatal opiate exposure. Since genetic factors appear to be associated with the incidence and severity of NAS, opportunities for "personalized genomic medicine" and unique therapeutic interventions could be developed in the future.

### Amniotic fluid and the clinical relevance of the sonographically estimated amniotic fluid volume: oligohydramnios [^113997E6]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The amniotic fluid volume (AFV) is regulated by several systems, including the in-tramembranous pathway, fetal production (fetal urine and lung fluid) and uptake (fetal swallowing), and the balance of fluid movement via osmotic gradients. The normal AFV across gestation has not been clearly defined; consequently, abnormal volumes are also poorly defined. Actual AFVs can be measured by dye dilution techniques and directly measured at cesarean delivery; however, these techniques are time-consuming, are invasive, and require laboratory support, and direct measurement can only be done at cesarean delivery. As a result of these limitations, the AFV is estimated by the amniotic fluid index (AFI), the single deepest pocket, and subjective assessment of the AFV. Unfortunately, sonographic estimates of the AFV correlate poorly with dye-determined or directly measured amniotic fluid. The recent use of color Doppler sonography has not improved the diagnostic accuracy of sonographic estimates of the AFV but instead has led to overdiagnosis of oligohydramnios. The relationship between the fixed cutoffs of an AFI of 5 cm or less and a single deepest pocket of 2 cm or less for identifying adverse pregnancy outcomes is uncertain. The use of the single deepest pocket compared to the AFI to identify oligohydramnios in at-risk pregnancies seems to be a better choice because the use of the AFI leads to an increase in the diagnosis of oligohydramnios, resulting in more labor inductions and cesarean deliveries without any improvement in peripartum outcomes.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^1164PLt9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population and setting

We conducted this cross-sectional study at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) Maternity Ward and Antenatal Clinic from November 16, 2019 to March 12, 2020. MRRH is found in Mbarara District, 286 km southwest of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda. It is a public hospital under the Ministry of Health (MoH). It serves 11 districts with an estimated population of about five million individuals. The hospital also serves as a teaching hospital for undergraduate and postgraduate students of Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST). The maternity ward handles about 10,000 deliveries per year. At the antenatal admissions' area, an average of 40 pregnant women are attended to on a daily basis. The hospital also has antenatal clinic that attends to approximately 40 pregnant mothers per day.

We included mothers who sought care at MRRH at a gestation age of 37 weeks or beyond, and who consented to participate in the study. We excluded mothers who had ruptured membranes, those in active stage of labour, and those with multiple pregnancies.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^117FjFd2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer during pregnancy — taxanes, HER2-directed therapy, endocrine therapy, and radiation therapy (RT) — "There are limited data on the use of taxanes during pregnancy. If used, the NCCN Panel recommends weekly administration of paclitaxel after the first trimester if clinically indicated by disease status". Regarding trastuzumab, "There are only case reports of trastuzumab use during pregnancy", and some "indicated oligohydramnios or anhydramnios with administration of trastuzumab; fetal renal failure occurred in one case". Consequently, "If trastuzumab is otherwise indicated, it should be administered in the postpartum period; the Panel recommends against its use during pregnancy". Targeted therapy experience also includes "A single case report of first-trimester exposure to lapatinib during treatment for breast cancer reported an uncomplicated delivery of a healthy female neonate". Additionally, "Endocrine therapy and RT are contraindicated during pregnancy. Endocrine therapy and RT, if indicated, should thus not be initiated until the postpartum period", and coordination is emphasized: "Communication between the oncologist and maternal fetal medicine specialist is essential at every visit and for every treatment decision point for the patient".

### Valsartan [^111hCWvC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Oligohydramnios in pregnant women who use drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension and death. In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus.

In patients taking valsartan during pregnancy, perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. If oligohydramnios is observed, consider alternative drug treatment. Closely observe neonates with histories of in utero exposure to valsartan for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to valsartan, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function.

Data

Animal Data

No teratogenic effects were observed when valsartan was administered to pregnant mice and rats at oral doses of up to 600 mg/kg/day (9 and 18 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2basis) and to pregnant rabbits at oral doses of up to 10 mg/kg/day.

In rats, oral valsartan administered at maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during organogenesis or late gestation and lactation, resulted in decreased fetal and pup weight, pup survival and delayed developmental milestones. In rabbits administered maternally toxic doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg/day, fetotoxicity was observed.

### Prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios in pregnancies beyond 36 weeks of gestation at a tertiary hospital in southwestern Uganda [^116ixGhf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite the poor perinatal outcomes attributable to oligohydramnios, there are few data on prevalence and factors associated with oligohydramnios in the East African Region, and Uganda in particular. Establishing the prevalence of oligohydramnios and associated factors in the third trimester is crucial to inform the index of suspicion among healthcare workers during antenatal care so as to plan appropriate interventions, including mode and timing of deliveries. In Uganda, many missed opportunities for prompt detection of oligohydramnios exist; only 30% of pregnant women requiring ultrasonography services access them. When oligohydramnios is missed and patients do not receive appropriate and timely treatment, outcomes are often poor.

Prior to conducting this study, data from review of medical records for a six-month period (April–September 2018) in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) revealed that 45 mothers had oligohydramnios-related complications. All the 45 mothers had cesarean sections, 6% had fresh stillbirths, and 17% had babies with birth asphyxia (APGAR scores of < 7 at 5 min). Furthermore, oligohydramnios may be contributing to the high rates of cesarean section deliveries; fetal distress caused by oligohydramnios has been identified as one of the leading indications for cesarean section deliveries in Uganda. MRRH, in particular, has been found to have high cesarean section delivery rates of more than 25%. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of oligohydramnios among women attending antenatal care at > 36 weeks of gestation at MRRH in Southwestern Uganda.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (Hyzaar) [^113U76jB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk

Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section, post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Losartan:

Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy can result in the following: oligohydramnios, reduced fetal renal function leading to anuria and renal failure, fetal lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, including skull hypoplasia, hypotension, and death.

In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue HYZAAR, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may be appropriate, based on the week of gestation. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Closely observe neonates with histories of in utero exposure to HYZAAR for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. In neonates with a history of in utero exposure to HYZAAR, if oliguria or hypotension occurs, support blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and replacing renal function.

Hydrochlorothiazide:

Thiazides can cross the placenta, and concentrations reached in the umbilical vein approach those in the maternal plasma. Hydrochlorothiazide, like other diuretics, can cause placental hypoperfusion. It accumulates in the amniotic fluid, with reported concentrations up to 19 times higher than in umbilical vein plasma. Use of thiazides during pregnancy is associated with a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice or thrombocytopenia. Since they do not alter the course of pre-eclampsia, these drugs should not be used to treat hypertension in pregnant women. The use of hydrochlorothiazide for other indications in pregnancy should be avoided.

Obstetric Management

Evidence regarding obstetric management, monitoring, and timing of delivery in women with GDM is limited and recommendations are primarily based on consensus. A descriptive overview of National and International guidelines on diagnosis and management of GDM from 2021 included 7 guidelines: the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC 2019)), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG 2018), the ADA, and the Endocrine Society (ES 2013). Recent recommendations from the newly updated Danish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (DSOG 2024) on GDM management), as well as updated guidelines from NICE 2020 and ADA 2024 have been considered. Guidelines from ADIPS, ADA, and ES did not include recommendations regarding obstetric management.

Antenatal Monitoring of the Mother

GWG guidelines uniformly follow the recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, whereas protocols for measurement of blood pressure and urinalysis vary from every 1 to 2 weeks (ACOG 2018, FIGO 2015) to 4 weeks in uncomplicated diet-treated pregnancies (DSOG 2024).

Antenatal Fetal Surveillance

Ultrasound scans to evaluate fetal growth, amniotic fluid, and placental function are generally recommended from 28 weeks and until delivery, but recommendations regarding frequency vary from every 2 to 4 weeks (FIGO 2015), 4 weeks (NICE 2020, SOGC 2019), to 6 weeks in uncomplicated diet-treated pregnancies (DSOG 2024). ACOG 2018 recommends ultrasound scans from 32 weeks in poorly controlled and insulin treated cases. Monitoring fetal surveillance by cardiotocography (CTG) is generally recommended but protocols vary from routine weekly CTGs starting from 36 weeks (SOGC 2019) or 38 weeks (NICE 2020) to only on indication (DSOG 2024) or in poorly controlled cases from 32 weeks (ACOG 2018). In general, guidelines recommend intensified monitoring of the fetus in the presence of additional complications (eg, hypertension, polyhydramnios, LGA, SGA), but details are not specified.

### Diflunisal (dolobid) [^1122Q2LH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including Dolobid, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If Dolobid treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue diflunisal tablets and follow up according to clinical practice (see WARNINGS; Fetal Toxicity).

Multiple gestations — stillbirth risk indicates that the stillbirth rate among twin pregnancies is approximately 2.5 times higher than that of singletons (14.07 vs 5.65 per 1000 live births and stillbirths); the risk increases in all twins with advancing gestational age and is significantly greater in monochorionic than dichorionic twins, and the stillbirth rate for triplet and higher-order multiples is reported as 30.53 per 1000 live births and stillbirths, with higher rates due to complications specific to multiple gestation and increased risks of aneuploidy, congenital anomalies, and growth restriction.

### Isolated oligohydramnios in previous pregnancy is a risk factor for a placental related disorder in subsequent delivery [^111Ztprh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This was a historic cohort at a single university-affiliated center – the Edith Wolfson Medical Center between November 2008 and December 2019. The center serves a population of half a million citizens from the area, and, in similar to alternative center in the area, offers a maternal fetal division and neonatal intensive care if needed. Women with a first and second livebirth singleton delivery at our center during these years were included in the cohort. All singleton pregnancies with a diagnosis of isolated oligohydramnios were identified from electronic medical records and cases reviewed to exclude any secondary causes for oligohydramnios, including premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine fetal growth retardation (FGR), maternal chronic illness, fetal malformations and chromosomal anomalies. We excluded women with any delivery complicated by fetal chromosomal or genetic abnormalities, by birth before 24 weeks, women with lack of prenatal care and cases of current or past intrauterine fetal death. We also excluded women whose first delivery was complicated by small for gestational age, preeclampsia, preterm birth or placental abruption, all placental related complications that are known to recure in subsequent pregnancies.

We compared pregnancy and neonatal outcomes of two groups – second deliveries of women with isolated oligohydramnios in their first delivery (previous oligohydramnios group), and second deliveries of women without isolated oligohydramnios in their first delivery (control group).

As per institutional protocol, all women admitted to our obstetric emergency room and delivery ward underwent assessment of amniotic fluid amount by ultrasound as an integral part of obstetric evaluation. Amniotic fluid was assessed by obstetricians, with the use of abdominal probes (Voluson E8, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI). Oligohydramnios was determined in the presence of a DVP of less than two centimeters or an AFI of less than 5 cm, and coding was entered to the computerized system as per the ICD9 (code 658.03).

### Outcomes of fetal lower urinary tract obstruction based on timing of oligohydramnios onset [^111ELzW9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Fetal Lower Urinary Tract Obstruction (LUTO) is associated with oligohydramnios and significant fetal morbidity, resulting in poor lung development and perinatal death. However, oligohydramnios may develop at different gestational periods, and the impact of timing on fetal outcomes remains unknown. Our objective was to characterize the impact onset of oligohydramnios had on prenatal outcomes.

Methods

This study is a retrospective cohort study of all patients with a prenatal diagnosis of LUTO at our tertiary referral center from 2014 to 2023. All patients underwent detailed ultrasonography and interdisciplinary counseling and were subsequently delivered at our institution. Data were obtained from electronic medical records and complete extraction was required for final inclusion.

Results

During the study time period, 93 patients met inclusion criteria of which 68 (73.1%) developed oligohydramnios during their pregnancy. 63 (93%) of these pregnancies resulted in livebirths with 28 (41.1%) perinatal deaths. Onset of oligohydramnios was earlier in pregnancies with perinatal death (23 vs. 28 weeks, p = 0.004) and associated with pulmonary hypoplasia.

Conclusions

Our data show the impact of oligohydramnios timing in pregnancy on pulmonary hypoplasia and ultimately perinatal death. This allows for detailed patient counseling on the impact oligohydramnios may have on pregnancies by the gestational age of onset.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Premature Closure of Fetal Ductus Arteriosus:

Avoid use of NSAIDs in women at about 30 weeks gestation and later in pregnancy, because NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus (see Data).

Oligohydramnios/Neonatal Renal Impairment:

If an NSAID is necessary at about 20 weeks gestation or later in pregnancy, limit the use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible. If oxaprozin treatment extends beyond 48 hours, consider monitoring with ultrasound for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, discontinue oxaprozin and follow up according to clinical practice (see Data).

Labor or Delivery

There are no studies on the effects of oxaprozin during labor or delivery. In animal studies, NSAIDs, including oxaprozin, inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, cause delayed parturition, and increase the incidence of stillbirth.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^116JL16h]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Fetal bradycardia and fetal heart block — diagnosis, monitoring, and maternal therapy considerations are as follows: The presence of fetal bradycardia may suggest an underlying diagnosis of inherited arrhythmia syndromes (IAS); magnetocardiography, if available, can provide diagnostic confirmation, and prenatal evaluation includes monitoring for ventricular arrhythmias, with postnatal assessment of neonatal QT interval and mutational ion panels to confirm suspected IAS. Because fetal cardiac output is rate dependent, nonstress testing may be unreliable for assessing fetal status in fetal bradycardia, and a normal biophysical profile correlates with reassuring fetal oxygenation and acid/base status. Autoimmune heart block and cardiomyopathy can evolve between weekly fetal assessments, so periodic monitoring enables shared decision-making about interventions such as maternal steroid initiation, and steroids for fetal lung maturity can be given if further fetal deterioration prompts consideration of preterm birth depending upon gestational age. Evidence for antenatal fluorinated steroids is variable and largely nonrandomized and underpowered; third-degree heart block has not been demonstrated to be reversible although at least 1 study reports mild forms may be reversible, and chronic high-dose fluorinated steroids can cause fetal complications including growth restriction and oligohydramnios, necessitating detailed risk–benefit discussions. In maternal autoantibody-mediated fetal cardiomyopathy/endocardial fibroelastosis, dual therapy with fluorinated steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may improve outcomes, but data are limited and IVIG can cause maternal complications including infection and hypersensitivity reactions leading to premature delivery. While beta-adrenergic agents can increase fetal heart rate, overall fetal outcome improvement has not been documented, and chronic maternal administration can lead to severe maternal complications including pulmonary edema, electrolyte abnormalities, and maternal cardiac dysfunction.

### Strip of the month: term oligohydramnios and prolonged decelerations… [^111NAAaQ]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Electronic fetal monitoring is a popular technology used to establish fetal well-being. Despite its widespread use, the terminology used to describe patterns seen on the monitor has not been consistent until recently. In 1997, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Research Planning Workshop published guidelines for interpretation of fetal tracings. This publication was the culmination of 2 years of work by a panel of experts in the field of fetal monitoring and was endorsed in 2005 by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses. In 2008, ACOG, NICHD, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine reviewed and updated the definitions for fetal heart rate patterns, interpretation, and research recommendations. Following is a summary of the terminology definitions and assumptions found in the 2008 NICHD workshop report.

### Long-term survival in renal oligohydramnios… [^114xBCE6]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Pertinent data were abstracted from medical records, including presence of oligohydramnios or anhydramnios, type of renal disesase, presence of megacystitis, fetal interventions, associated anomalies, and long-term outcomes. Primary outcomes were termination of pregnancy, IUFD, neonatal death, and post-neonatal death. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival for infants who were live born. The most common type of renal disease was obstructive uropathy, occurring in 58 fetuses; 12 cases of renal agenesis and 13 cases of bilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney were identified. Fetal intervention was performed on 21 patients, including amnioinfusion and vesicoamniotic shunting. Among live born infants, the presence of anhydramnios was associated with an increased risk for neonatal death.

Among 21 patients with fetal intervention, 17 survived to the neonatal period. There were 48 infants who survived beyond the neonatal period, including 1 with bilateral renal agenesis and 2 with bilateral MCDK. Risk factors for post-neonatal death were birth weight < 2, 000 g and gastrointestinal comorbidity. Estimated 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 57%, 55%, and 51%, respectively. Of 48 patients surviving beyond the neonatal period, 16 required dialysis. At last follow-up, 14 children had received kidney transplantation, and 9 were receiving dialysis. The authors conclude that long-term survival is a feasible goal in fetuses diagnosed with renal oligohydramnios. Dr Beam has disclosed no financial relationship relevant to this commentary.
