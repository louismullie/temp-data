## Question

pain management in subacute rehab facilities

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about pain management in subacute rehabilitation facilities. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the subacute period and the typical rehab settings. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that guide care in this phase. Next, I will examine pharmacologic strategies, followed by nonpharmacologic and multidisciplinary approaches. After that, I need to consider special populations and settings, and finally, I should review monitoring, safety, and implementation considerations, including evidence quality and gaps, before synthesizing practical recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't anchor on a misleading premise. Subacute pain is generally defined as 1 to 3 months in duration, and subacute rehabilitation settings include skilled nursing facilities, inpatient rehabilitation units, and some home-based programs, where patients often transition after acute hospitalization and require structured therapy and medical oversight to restore function while managing ongoing pain [^a42601bb] [^6a208adc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment choices before establishing principles. I need to ensure the approach is multimodal, multidisciplinary, and function-focused, with explicit goals and careful risk–benefit assessment, especially for opioids, because this is consistently emphasized across high-credibility guidelines and aligns with the biopsychosocial model of pain care in rehabilitation [^c101aad0] [^27d5e55d] [^e25eb07f].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic management, but I need to be cautious about evidence quality. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: nonopioid multimodal regimens are preferred first-line, opioids are reserved for refractory cases with functional goals, and when used, they should be immediate-release, at the lowest effective dose, with a planned exit strategy and close follow-up; this is supported by CDC 2022 and occupational medicine guidance, and reinforced by RCTs showing no superiority of strong opioids over milder opioids in subacute post-fracture pain and by systematic reviews indicating that multimodal nonopioid regimens can reduce subacute pain after arthroplasty without increasing opioid exposure [^27d5e55d] [^783fce9e] [^cec71783] [^84a18011].

> I should double-check the specific nonopioid components that carry the best evidence in this window. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are foundational, with consideration of topical agents for localized pain; gabapentinoids have limited and mixed evidence postoperatively, so I need to avoid reflexively adding them without a clear neuropathic indication or documented benefit, particularly given adverse effects and lack of consistent analgesic advantage in some perioperative contexts [^e3f09fe1] [^7580230d].

> Now, I will examine nonpharmacologic strategies, since these are central in subacute rehab. Exercise therapy, including progressive resistance and aerobic conditioning, improves pain and function across musculoskeletal conditions, and psychological therapies such as CBT and mindfulness-based interventions yield durable benefits; manual therapy can be adjunctive, and for low back pain specifically, guidelines endorse spinal manipulation or massage in the subacute phase, while neurorehabilitation principles support task-specific training and neuromuscular re-education to restore function despite pain [^250b718e] [^465f8e54] [^b4af886e] [^a71eb562].

> Let me consider multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation explicitly. Evidence for MBR in subacute low back pain shows modest but meaningful improvements in pain, disability, and return-to-work versus usual care, though effect sizes vary and some comparisons with other active treatments are inconclusive; nonetheless, the model remains guideline-concordant and particularly relevant when pain persists beyond the expected trajectory or when psychosocial barriers impede recovery [^2311e46e] [^c101aad0].

> But wait, what if the patient is in a skilled nursing facility rather than a freestanding rehab hospital; does the same intensity apply? I should confirm that SNFs typically provide less intensive therapy and require adaptation of protocols, with emphasis on feasible exercise, medication reconciliation, and fall-risk mitigation; this means dosing strategies and functional targets must be scaled to tolerance and supervision levels while maintaining multimodal principles [^6a208adc].

> I need to check special populations and conditions that alter risk–benefit. In older adults, I should prioritize nonpharmacologic strategies, use the lowest effective medication doses, and apply geriatric pain assessment tools when cognition is impaired; in patients with substance use disorder or on chronic opioids, I should coordinate tapering, consider buprenorphine for analgesia when appropriate, and ensure naloxone distribution; after orthopedic surgery, I should reinforce multimodal nonopioid regimens and education to prevent persistent pain; after spinal cord injury, I should follow neuropathic pain guidelines that emphasize nonpharmacologic and carefully selected pharmacologic options within rehabilitation models [^ac2026f5] [^b25cb83f] [^84a18011] [^00c429d2].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety so I don't miss red flags. I should confirm that patients on opioids are reassessed within 1 to 4 weeks of initiation or dose escalation, with periodic reassessment thereafter, using functional goals and validated tools like PEG to guide continuation or tapering; I also need to screen for depression, sleep disturbance, and psychosocial stressors that worsen pain trajectories, and track pain trajectories to identify those at risk of chronification who merit intensified rehabilitation [^8b093533] [^4e4611dd] [^190610f9].

> Hold on, I should verify implementation barriers and practical levers. Access to nonpharmacologic care remains limited by coverage and workforce, so I should advocate for bundled payment models, embedded behavioral health, and telehealth where appropriate; education for staff and patients, standardized order sets, and medication reconciliation at transitions are low-cost, high-yield steps that reduce variation and adverse events [^c101aad0] [^7493f67e].

> I will now examine the strength of evidence so I don't overstate claims. Much of the subacute-specific pharmacologic literature is limited by small samples, heterogeneity, and high risk of bias, which tempers certainty; conversely, nonpharmacologic modalities like exercise and CBT have broader, higher-quality evidence bases, and opioid-related recommendations are grounded in large guidelines with extensive review, though direct head-to-head trials in subacute rehab are sparse, underscoring the need for better-designed studies [^7493f67e] [^250b718e] [^27d5e55d].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while keeping these limitations in mind. For most patients in subacute rehab, I should implement a multimodal nonopioid regimen with scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDs if not contraindicated, add topical agents for focal pain, and layer active therapies such as progressive exercise, CBT-based coping, and manual therapy as indicated; I should reserve short courses of immediate-release opioids for severe, refractory pain with explicit functional goals, reassess within 1 to 4 weeks, and taper promptly if goals are not met; throughout, I should monitor pain trajectories, screen for psychosocial drivers, and coordinate care across disciplines to prevent transition to chronic pain and optimize recovery [^c101aad0] [^250b718e] [^8b093533] [^190610f9].

---

Pain management in subacute rehab facilities should be **multimodal and multidisciplinary**, prioritizing nonpharmacologic therapies (physical therapy, occupational therapy, psychological interventions) and using medications only as adjuncts [^c101aad0] [^250b718e]. Opioids are **not first-line** and should be reserved for severe pain unresponsive to other measures, with strict monitoring and tapering plans [^27d5e55d] [^4e4611dd]. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are first-line pharmacologic options, and gabapentinoids or antidepressants are considered for neuropathic pain [^notfound]. Regular functional assessments and patient education are essential to optimize outcomes and minimize chronic pain risk [^190610f9] [^7493f67e].

---

## Multimodal and multidisciplinary approach

A multimodal approach combines pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions to address pain's physical, psychological, and social dimensions [^c101aad0]. Multidisciplinary care involves **collaboration among physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, nurses, and physicians** to deliver comprehensive care [^notfound].

---

## Nonpharmacologic interventions

Nonpharmacologic therapies are foundational in subacute rehab, with **strong evidence for effectiveness and safety**:

- **Physical therapy**: Exercise therapy, including aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training, significantly reduces pain and improves function in musculoskeletal conditions [^250b718e].

- **Occupational therapy**: Focuses on adaptive strategies, ergonomic training, and activity modification to enhance daily functioning and reduce pain interference.

- **Psychological interventions**: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) are effective in reducing pain intensity, improving coping, and enhancing quality of life [^5433ba64] [^250b718e].

- **Manual therapy**: Spinal manipulation and massage therapy provide short-term relief for subacute low back pain and neck pain [^465f8e54] [^fc291571].

---

## Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacologic treatments are used adjunctively, with **careful selection and monitoring**:

| **Medication class** | **Indications** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | - Musculoskeletal pain <br/> - Inflammation | - Gastrointestinal <br/> - Cardiovascular <br/> - Renal risks <br/> - Use lowest effective dose |
| Acetaminophen | Mild to moderate pain | - Hepatotoxicity risk <br/> - Monitor liver function |
| Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) | Neuropathic pain | - Sedation <br/> - Dizziness <br/> - Taper gradually |
| Antidepressants (duloxetine, TCAs) | - Neuropathic pain <br/> - Comorbid depression/anxiety | - Monitor for serotonin syndrome <br/> - Cardiac arrhythmias |
| Opioids | Severe pain refractory to other treatments | - High risk of dependence <br/> - Respiratory depression <br/> - Constipation <br/> - Strict monitoring and tapering required [^27d5e55d] [^4e4611dd] |

---

Opioids are **not first-line** and should be reserved for severe pain unresponsive to other measures, with strict monitoring, functional goals, and tapering plans [^27d5e55d] [^4e4611dd].

---

## Patient education and self-management

Education and self-management are critical to **empower patients**, improve adherence, and reduce chronic pain risk. Effective strategies include:

- **Pain education**: Teaching patients about pain mechanisms, triggers, and coping strategies.

- **Self-management programs**: Structured programs incorporating goal setting, activity pacing, and relapse prevention.

- **Technology-based interventions**: Mobile apps and telehealth platforms can enhance engagement and provide ongoing support [^068cdbf6].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular assessment and follow-up are essential to ensure **effective pain management** and adjust treatment plans. Functional assessments using validated tools (e.g. PEG, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) help track progress and guide care [^4e4611dd]. Clinicians should reassess pain, function, and quality of life at each visit and adjust interventions accordingly [^244df656].

---

## Challenges and barriers

Several challenges persist in subacute rehab pain management, including:

- **Limited access to multidisciplinary care**: Workforce shortages and reimbursement issues limit availability [^e25eb07f].

- **Variability in clinical practice**: Lack of standardized protocols leads to inconsistent care.

- **Patient-related factors**: Comorbidities, psychological factors, and low health literacy complicate management.

---

## Evidence-based recommendations

Based on current evidence, the following **recommendations are proposed**:

- **Prioritize nonpharmacologic interventions**: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and psychological therapies should be first-line.

- **Use medications adjunctively**: NSAIDs and acetaminophen are first-line; gabapentinoids and antidepressants for neuropathic pain; opioids only when necessary with strict monitoring [^27d5e55d].

- **Implement multidisciplinary care**: Collaborative, patient-centered care improves outcomes.

- **Emphasize education and self-management**: Empower patients to actively participate in their care.

- **Regularly monitor and adjust treatment**: Use functional assessments to guide care and prevent chronic pain [^190610f9].

---

Pain management in subacute rehab facilities should be **multimodal and multidisciplinary**, with nonpharmacologic interventions as the foundation and medications used adjunctively. This approach optimizes pain relief, improves function, and reduces the risk of chronic pain.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological-based interventions, including education and prescribing strategies, to reduce subacute pain after total hip or knee arthroplasty: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^7063eb4d]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) are cornerstone and cost-effective procedures to improve pain, mobility, and quality of life for people with severe knee and hip osteoarthritis, respectively. TKA and THA are among the most common elective surgeries performed worldwide. Due to rising rates of obesity and population aging, the burden of osteoarthritis and the subsequent need for these surgeries are projected to increase by 673% for TKA and 174% for THA by 2030 in the United States (US), with similar increases projected elsewhere, such as in Australia and the United Kingdom.

Adequate pain management after TKA and THA facilitates faster rehabilitation and reduced postoperative complications, hospital readmission rates, and overall health care costs. A prospective study of 87 patients showed that moderate to severe subacute pain is experienced by more than 40% of patients and is associated with an increased risk of persistent pain 12 months after orthopedic surgery; thus, it would appear that better early management could confer better long-term results. Although there is some literature describing pain management strategies in the immediate postoperative period after arthroplasty, the most effective strategies for the management of pain during the subacute period (from discharge to 3 months after surgery) are unclear. Uncertainty about the optimal strategy might contribute toward unwarranted practice variation and low-value or harmful care, which can adversely impact patient outcomes.

The most effective pharmacological-based interventions for subacute pain after TKA or THA have not been established, which represents a gap in evidence for providing care in the subacute postoperative period. Therefore, the present systematic review will examine the available evidence for postdischarge pharmacological interventions, including educational and prescribing strategies, and their effect on reducing pain during the subacute period after TKA or THA.

Scope and purpose

The scope and purpose of these guidelines are unchanged from the 2016 version. The target population to which these CPG apply includes adults living with SCI who are in the subacute phase of inpatient rehabilitation management to those living in the community. It excludes those being cared for in an acute care setting immediately after their initial injury. These guidelines are intended to be used by clinicians who care for those with SCI. Researchers and health policy experts will also find these guidelines valuable.

Multimodal Therapy for Subacute and Chronic Pain

Integrated pain management requires coordination of medical, psychological, and social aspects of health care and includes primary care, mental and behavioral health care, and specialist services when needed. Multimodal therapies and multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (e.g. combining psychological therapies with exercise) can reduce long-term pain and disability compared with usual care and compared with physical treatments (e.g. exercise) alone. Nonpharmacologic therapies also can provide synergistic benefits when nonopioid or opioid pain medications are used. When needed, medications should ideally be combined with nonpharmacologic therapy to provide greater benefits to patients in improving pain and function. Multimodal therapies are not always available or reimbursed by insurance and can be time consuming and costly for patients, and disparities in abilities to access multimodal care exist. Evidence exists that less-intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation can be similarly effective to high-intensity multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Multimodal therapies should be considered for patients not responding to single-modality therapy, and combinations should be tailored depending on patient needs, cost, convenience, and other individual factors.

Depending on patient comorbidities and benefit-to-risk ratios in individual patients, combinations of medications (e.g. two nonopioid medications with different mechanisms of action or a nonopioid with an opioid medication) also might be used. In some cases, medication combinations might provide complementary or synergistic benefits and facilitate lower dosing of individual medications, as has been demonstrated in trials of patients with neuropathic pain. However, this approach should be used with caution to avoid synergistic risks of medications. For example, combinations of medications that depress the central nervous system and cause sedation (see Recommendation 11), such as an opioid with gabapentin, have been associated with increased risk for overdose compared with either medication alone.

Selecting Opioids and Determining Opioid Dosages

Recommendation 3

When starting opioid therapy for acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids instead of extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioids (recommendation category: A; evidence type: 4).

Comparison with Other Reviews

Previous systematic reviews of interventions to reduce pain after TKA or THA have focused largely on acute or chronic pain, with limited research targeting the subacute period. A systematic review by Fischer et al. conducted in 2005 reported that effective interventions for the reduction of immediate postsurgical pain after THA included peripheral nerve block, intrathecal analgesia, and multimodal non-opioid analgesia. A systematic review on acute pain management after TKA reported similar recommendations. After hospital discharge, however, parenteral analgesic routes might have a limited role in pain management after TKA or THA. A systematic review of RCTs conducted by Wylde and colleagues in 2018 identified that interventions commenced within 3 months postoperatively to reduce chronic pain at 12 months or longer after TKA included physiotherapy, nurse-led, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and multidisciplinary interventions. Existing literature on interventions conducted during the subacute period predominantly focuses on rehabilitation or exercise-based strategies to reduce pain and/or improve physical function after THA or TKA. There remains a paucity of literature summarizing the available pharmacological interventions to reduce subacute pain after THA or TKA. Our systematic review adds to the limited literature by providing evidence that subacute pain can be reduced by improving the judicious use of analgesics upon hospital discharge and providing medication-related education after discharge. Our review indicates that interventions used for managing acute and chronic pain, such as the provision of multimodal analgesia and multidisciplinary care, also appear to be relevant for the subacute period. In particular, our findings reinforce existing literature on the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for their opioid-sparing effect and improved pain relief upon rest and movement after orthopedic surgery, provided clinical precautions are addressed. However, although low-dose gabapentin was used in the multimodal protocol by Fleischman et al. the literature does not support the use of gabapentinoids for postoperative pain because of the lack of a clinically significant difference in pain and an association with a higher incidence of adverse events. This represents an opportunity for practice improvement to ensure the judicious use of multimodal analgesia during the subacute postoperative period.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological-based interventions, including education and prescribing strategies, to reduce subacute pain after total hip or knee arthroplasty: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^7493f67e]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Educational interventions are often used for the management of musculoskeletal pain and thus also appear to be relevant during the subacute phase. The studies exploring educational interventions by Pronk et al. and Sindhupakorn et al. emphasize the importance of patient and clinician education alongside the provision of analgesia to facilitate the safe and appropriate use of medications given upon the transition of care during hospital discharge. Consistency in the management of pain across the acute, subacute, and chronic periods facilitates enhanced continuity of care and, in turn, is known to lead to improved health outcomes, higher patient satisfaction, and more cost-effective care.

Future Considerations

Definitions of the subacute period vary widely in the literature, ranging from 30 days to 90 days after hospital discharge. This variation presents a challenge in the generalizability of different interventions conducted in the subacute period reported across the literature. Furthermore, the lack of a clear and consistent definition of the subacute period might contribute toward ambiguity about the appropriate management of pain during this period. Given that subacute pain is experienced by more than 40% of patients after orthopedic surgery and is associated with an increased risk of persistent pain at 12 months postoperatively, adequate management of subacute pain could confer improved quality of life and long-term improvements in pain outcomes. Thus, future studies should ensure explicit reporting of the time period respective to surgery in which interventions were conducted to allow accurate conclusions on appropriate subacute pain management to be reached.

Strengths and Limitations

To our knowledge, this is the first review to examine the effect of pharmacological-based interventions on reducing pain during the subacute period after TKA or THA. We prospectively registered and adhered to the protocol of this systematic review. Only RCTs were included to improve the reliability of our findings.

However, there are several limitations to this study. Although we conducted a rigorous search across seven electronic databases, reference lists of included studies, and the gray literature, the search strategy was limited to articles written in the English language. Thus, relevant articles in other languages may not have been identified. We were unable to conduct a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneous nature of the included studies. As the number of included trials was relatively small, we were also unable to assess for publication bias with funnel plots. Finally, most included studies showed a high risk of bias. This reduces the confidence that the review findings reflect the true treatment effect of each intervention.

### AAAPT: assessment of the acute pain trajectory [^190610f9]. Pain Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Pain trajectory patterns in the subacute phase (i.e. beyond 7 days but less than 3 months) further impact clinical decision-making. Assessment of subacute pain trajectories can identify patients with ongoing treatment needs, optimize resource allocation, and detect early patterns of recovery that may indicate the emergence of pain persistence. Monitoring the pain trajectory into the subacute period to distinguish rapid or expected patterns of pain resolution from slower resolution (i.e. slower improvement or worsening pain) can identify patients who may benefit from intensive rehabilitative treatment. This can guide clinicians in treatment stratification — for example, matching more intensive physical and psychological therapies to these patients who demonstrate slower recovery.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^a42601bb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope and Audience

This clinical practice guideline is intended for clinicians who are treating outpatients aged ≥ 18 years with acute (duration of < 1 month), subacute (duration of 1–3 months), or chronic (duration of > 3 months) pain, and excludes pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. The recommendations are most relevant to clinicians whose scope of practice includes prescribing opioids (e.g. physicians, nurse practitioners and other advanced-practice registered nurses, physician assistants, and oral health practitioners). Because clinicians might work within team-based care, this clinical practice guideline also refers to and promotes integrated pain management and collaborative working relationships among clinicians (e.g. behavioral health specialists such as social workers or psychologists, pharmacists, and registered nurses). This guideline update includes recommendations for primary care clinicians (e.g. internists and family physicians) and other clinicians managing pain in outpatient settings (e.g. surgeons, emergency medicine clinicians, occupational medicine clinicians, physical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians, and neurologists). Applicable settings include clinician offices, clinics, and urgent care centers. The recommendations do not apply to care provided to patients who are hospitalized or in an emergency department or other observational setting from which they might be admitted to inpatient care. These recommendations do apply to prescribing for pain management for patients when they are discharged from hospitals, emergency departments, or other facilities.

### The effect of exercise referral schemes and self-management strategies on use of prescription analgesics among community-dwelling older adults: registry linkage with randomised controlled trials [^2e0a683f]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Physical activity is considered a vital element in retaining health and normal physiologic function during the life span, and several studies have shown positive effects on pain severity. Exercise referral schemes (ERS) are nationally regulated interventions in several countries. The main purpose of ERS is to serve as a primary care strategy to enhance physical activity at an individual level. ERS can be defined as a tailored program consisting of structured exercise, recommended by a primary healthcare professional. These customised exercise programmes incorporate ongoing supervision and monitoring, and are usually implemented within the community settings, like public recreational facilities, and facilitated by the local municipalities. A potential way to enhance the effectiveness of ERS is to combine them with self-management strategies (SMS), which involves behaviour changes techniques to increase exercise adherence and promote adoption of physically active behaviours. The concept of self-management is typically associated with an individual's capacity to handle chronic diseases. Consequently, the patient's proactive involvement is a fundamental element within the self-management framework. Lorig et al. highlights five principal self-management concepts yet notes that many studies incorporating SMS do not encompass all five concepts. These key concepts encompass (a) problem-oriented approaches, (b) decision-making processes, (c) assistance in identifying and utilising relevant resources (d) establishing a collaborative relationship between the individual and healthcare provider, and (e) initiating action and making progress. Previous studies have found that non-pharmacologic cognitive-behavioural therapy is associated with small to moderate efficacy for chronic or subacute lower back pain. In addition, a two-armed randomised controlled trial (RCT) that included individuals aged 18–75 years showed no between-group differences in pain intensity at 6–12 months follow-up, when comparing individuals randomised to cognitive functional therapy or group-based exercise. However, both intervention groups experienced a drop in pain intensity from baseline to follow-up.

While ERS and SMS alone may decrease pain levels, it is currently unknown whether these interventions may be capable of reducing the use of prescription analgesic among community-dwelling older adults, particularly when the interventions do not specifically target pain or analgesic use. We hypothesised that ERS, either utilised alone or in combination with self-management strategies, is more effective in reducing use of prescription analgesics compared with SMS only. This study aimed to investigate the effect of ERS alone or in combination with SMS, on use of analgesics in Danish community-dwelling older adults.

### Interventions for the management of acute and chronic low back pain: revision 2021 [^b4af886e]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Low back pain — 2012 exercise recommendations: The 2012 recommendations were not divided by patient subgroup. Physical therapists should consider (1) moderate- to high-intensity exercise for patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) without generalized pain, and (2) incorporating progressive, low-intensity, submaximal fitness and endurance activities into pain management and health promotion strategies for patients with chronic LBP with generalized pain. Physical therapists should consider utilizing trunk coordination, strengthening, and endurance exercises to reduce LBP and disability in patients with subacute and chronic LBP with movement coordination impairments and in patients post lumbar microdiscectomy. Physical therapists should consider utilizing repeated movements, exercises, or procedures to promote centralization to reduce symptoms in patients with acute LBP with related (referred) lower extremity pain, and should consider using repeated exercises in a specific direction determined by treatment response to improve mobility and reduce symptoms in patients with acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with mobility deficits.

Discussion

Summary of Main Findings

This systematic review identified four trials involving 660 randomized participants in which a pharmacological-based intervention, including educational or prescribing strategies, was conducted during the postdischarge (subacute) period and was tested against usual care for the reduction of subacute pain after TKA or THA. Interventions included changing analgesic prescribing practices upon hospital discharge and providing education on analgesic use during the subacute period through the use of mobile phone applications or during multidisciplinary home visits. Reducing the quantity of opioid analgesics supplied on hospital discharge did not lead to worse subacute pain levels. Furthermore, providing additional multimodal non-opioid analgesia (paracetamol, gabapentin, meloxicam) was associated with reduced subacute pain. Education on medication use provided through a personalized mobile application did not significantly impact subacute pain intensity. However, patients receiving education on medication use during multidisciplinary home visits reported reduced pain during the subacute period. The overall quality of the evidence was low, with one trial showing some risk of bias and three trials showing a high risk of bias. This was largely due to the inability to blind patients to their treatment allocation or blind outcome assessors, given the nature of the interventions. Because of significant heterogeneity in trial designs, interventions used, and outcome variables across studies, no meta-analysis was performed.

### Rehabilitation medicine approaches to pain management [^a71eb562]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Rehabilitation medicine offers strategies that reduce musculoskeletal pain, targeted approaches to alleviate movement-related pain, and interventions to optimize patients' function despite the persistence of pain. These approaches fall into four categories: modulating nociception, stabilizing and unloading painful structures, influencing pain perception, and alleviating soft tissue musculotendinous pain. Incorporating these interventions into individualized, comprehensive pain management programs offers the potential to empower patients and limit pain associated with mobility and required daily activities. Rehabilitative approach may be particularly helpful for patients with refractory movement-associated pain and functional vulnerability, and for those who do not wish for, or cannot, tolerate pharmacoanalgesia.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^c101aad0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A central tenet of this clinical practice guideline is that acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately and effectively treated regardless of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen. Clinicians should select nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic treatment modalities, or both, that maximize patient safety and optimize outcomes in pain, function, and quality of life. A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management that considers the biologic, psychological, and social characteristics of each person is critical. The care provided needs to be individualized and person centered. Clinicians and patients should work together to identify treatment goals, including functional goals, and tailor an approach that considers both the benefits and risks of available options. Progress should be monitored over time and treatment protocols adjusted accordingly. Health systems and payers can work to ensure multimodal treatment options are available, accessible, and reimbursed for patients. Public and private payers can support a broader array of nonpharmacologic interventions such as exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, mind-body interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, and certain complementary and integrative medicine therapies (e.g. acupuncture and spinal manipulation) that increasingly are known to be effective. Reimbursement often is cited as a principle barrier to why these nonpharmacologic treatments are not more widely used.

An integral part of providing access to and delivery of high-quality health care, including pain treatment, is understanding how the social determinants of health influence the health care provided and the differential outcomes observed. Social, economic, educational, and neighborhood-level factors might create and exacerbate health inequities that certain persons experience throughout their lives. These social determinants of health are borne out of historical and contemporary injustices that advantage some and disadvantage others in society, leading to the systemic marginalization or oppression of some groups. These inequities affect persons from some racial and ethnic groups, women, persons living in rural areas, persons experiencing homelessness, persons with disabilities, persons with substance use disorders, justice-involved populations, persons with diverse sexual orientation, identity, or gender, and non-U.S. born persons, among others.

### Neck pain: revision 2017 [^40c994f7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck pain with mobility deficits — general management notes emphasize a multimodal approach and exercise adherence: clinicians should utilize a multimodal approach in management of neck pain with mobility deficits; in the subacute to chronic stage, the benefit of manual therapy appears to decrease, and manipulation may not offer any benefit over mobilization and may be associated with transient discomfort; exercise targeting cervical and scapulothoracic regions is a necessary component of managing patients with subacute and chronic neck pain with mobility deficits; and available adherence strategies for adoption and maintenance of home exercise should be integrated to maximize clinical benefit over the long term.

Results

The search strategy generated a total of 5,753 articles, of which 73 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Refinement by the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in four studies being eligible for inclusion (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Study inclusion and exclusion criteria flow diagram.

Study Characteristics

One study was a three-arm, parallel-group, cluster RCT, and the remaining three studies were two-arm RCTs. In all studies, the intervention commenced upon hospital discharge, and participants were followed up for 1–3 months. Two studies included patients undergoing TKA only, one study included patients undergoing THA only, and one study included patients undergoing both THA and TKA.

Risk of Bias in Included Studies

Two of the four included studies used appropriate methods for random sequence generation and allocation concealment (Figure 2). Blinding of participants and personnel was not achieved in three studies because of the nature of the interventions. One study blinded outcome assessors to treatment allocation, two studies did not provide sufficient information, and one study did not blind outcome assessors. Some concerns for attrition bias due to incomplete outcome data secondary to loss to participant follow-up existed in one study. Two studies minimized selective outcome reporting by prospectively registering study protocols in a trial registry. Other risk of bias due to deviation from the intended intervention existed in one study. The full risk-of-bias assessments are available in Supplementary Data Table S4.

Quality of the Evidence for the Primary Outcome

Because of significant variation in the interventions used and outcome measures between studies, a GRADE analysis was not undertaken.

Types of Interventions

Studies used interventions that could be classified into two categories: 1) prescribing interventions to change analgesic prescribing practices upon hospital discharge (n = 2), and 2) patient education on analgesic use during the subacute period (n = 2). Of the educational interventions, one study provided patient-specific advice through a mobile phone application. Another study provided patient education during multidisciplinary patient home visits (Table 1).

### Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for subacute low back pain [^2311e46e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Low back pain (LBP) is associated with enormous personal and societal burdens, especially when it reaches the chronic stage of the disorder (pain for a duration of more than three months). Indeed, individuals who reach the chronic stage tend to show a more persistent course, and they account for the majority of social and economic costs. As a result, there is increasing emphasis on the importance of intervening at the early stages of LBP. According to the biopsychosocial model, LBP is a condition best understood with reference to an interaction of physical, psychological, and social influences. This has led to the development of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs that target factors from the different domains, administered by healthcare professionals from different backgrounds. This review is an update of a Cochrane Review on MBR for subacute LBP, which was published in 2003. It is part of a series of reviews on MBR for musculoskeletal pain published by the Cochrane Back and Neck Group and the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of MBR for subacute LBP (pain for a duration of six to 12 weeks) among adults, with a focus on pain, back-specific disability, and work status.

Search Methods

We searched for relevant trials in any language by a computer-aided search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and two trials registers. Our search is current to 13 July 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with subacute LBP. We included studies that investigated a MBR program compared to any type of control intervention. We defined MBR as an intervention that included a physical component (e.g. pharmacological, physical therapy) in combination with either a psychological, social, or occupational component (or any combination of these). We also required involvement of healthcare professionals from at least two different clinical backgrounds with appropriate training to deliver the component for which they were responsible.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. In particular, the data extraction and 'risk of bias' assessment were conducted by two people, independently. We used the Cochrane tool to assess risk of bias and the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included a total of nine RCTs (981 participants) in this review. Five studies were conducted in Europe and four in North America. Sample sizes ranged from 33 to 351. The mean age across trials ranged between 32.0 and 43.7 years. All included studies were judged as having high risk of performance bias and high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding, and four of the nine studies suffered from at least one additional source of possible bias. In MBR compared to usual care for subacute LBP, individuals receiving MBR had less pain (four studies with 336 participants; SMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.21, moderate-quality of evidence due to risk of bias) and less disability (three studies with 240 participants; SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.01, low-quality of evidence due to risk of bias and inconsistency), as well as increased likelihood of return-to-work (three studies with 170 participants; OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.46 to 6.98, very low-quality of evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision) and fewer sick leave days (two studies with 210 participants; SMD -0.38 95% CI -0.66 to -0.10, low-quality of evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision) at 12-month follow-up. The effect sizes for pain and disability were low in terms of clinical meaningfulness, whereas effects for work-related outcomes were in the moderate range. However, when comparing MBR to other treatments (i.e. brief intervention with features from a light mobilization program and a graded activity program, functional restoration, brief clinical intervention including education and advice on exercise, and psychological counselling), we found no differences between the groups in terms of pain (two studies with 336 participants; SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.07, low-quality evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias), functional disability (two studies with 345 participants; SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.18, low-quality evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias), and time away from work (two studies with 158 participants; SMD -0.25 95% CI -0.98 to 0.47, very low-quality evidence due to serious imprecision, inconsistency and risk of bias). Return-to-work was not reported in any of the studies. Although we looked for adverse events in both comparisons, none of the included studies reported this outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

On average, people with subacute LBP who receive MBR will do better than if they receive usual care, but it is not clear whether they do better than people who receive some other type of treatment. However, the available research provides mainly low to very low-quality evidence, thus additional high-quality trials are needed before we can describe the value of MBP for clinical practice.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^4e4611dd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical evidence reviews found no instrument with high accuracy for predicting opioid-related harms, such as overdose or opioid use disorder. For clinicians, predicting whether benefits of opioids for chronic pain will outweigh risks of ongoing opioid treatment for individual patients can be challenging. Therefore, opioid therapy should only be initiated with consideration by the clinician and patient of an exit strategy that could be used if opioid therapy is unsuccessful in improving pain and pain-related function.

Before opioid therapy is initiated for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should determine with patients how functional benefit will be evaluated and establish treatment goals. Some patients have reported treatment goals are effective in increasing motivation and functioning. Goals ideally include improvement in function (including social, emotional, and physical dimensions), pain, and quality of life. Goals can be tailored to specific patient and clinical circumstances. For example, for some patients with diseases typically associated with progressive functional impairment or catastrophic injuries such as spinal cord trauma, reductions in pain without improvement in physical function might be more realistic. Clinicians can assess and then follow function, pain severity, and quality of life using tools such as the three-item PEG (Pain average, interference with Enjoyment of life, and interference with General activity) assessment scale (see Recommendation 7). Clinically meaningful improvement has been defined as a 30% improvement in scores for both pain and function. Clinicians can ask patients about functional goals that have meaning for them (e.g. walking the dog or walking around the block, returning to part-time work, and attending family events or recreational activities), and then use these goals in assessing benefits of opioid therapy and weighing benefits against risks of continued opioid therapy for individual patients (see Recommendation 7).

Patients with subacute pain might be at a particularly critical point, both for potential transition to chronic pain and potential transition to long-term opioid therapy. Clinicians should reevaluate patients with subacute pain and their treatment course, ensure that potentially reversible causes of ongoing pain are addressed, and optimize pain management as needed. For patients with subacute pain who started opioid therapy for acute pain and have been treated with opioid therapy for ≥ 30 days, clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid prescribing simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after informed discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological-based interventions, including education and prescribing strategies, to reduce subacute pain after total hip or knee arthroplasty: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^84a18011]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) surgeries are among the most common elective procedures. Moderate to severe postoperative pain during the subacute period (defined here as the period from hospital discharge to 3 months postoperatively) is a predictor of persistent pain 12 months postoperatively. This review aimed to examine the available postdischarge pharmacological interventions, including educational and prescribing strategies, and their effect on reducing pain during the subacute period after TKA or THA.

Methods

We searched seven electronic databases from inception to April 22, 2021. Published randomized controlled trials of adults who underwent TKA or THA and received a pharmacological-based intervention commencing within 1 week after hospital discharge and conducted for up to 3 months postoperatively were compared with any treatment. Two reviewers independently extracted data on the primary outcome, pain intensity. This review was registered prospectively on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021250384).

Results

Four trials involving 660 participants were included. Interventions included changing analgesic prescribing practices upon hospital discharge and education on analgesic use. Providing multimodal non-opioid analgesia in addition to reduced opioid quantity was associated with lower subacute pain (coefficient –0.81; 95% confidence interval –1.33 to –0.29; P = 0.003). Education on analgesic use during multidisciplinary home visits was effective for reducing pain intensity during the subacute period (6.25 ± 10.13 vs 35.67 ± 22.05; P < 0.001) compared with usual care.

Conclusions

Interventions involving the provision of multimodal non-opioid analgesia and education on analgesic use show positive effects on reducing pain intensity during the subacute period after TKA and THA.

CONCLUSIONS

Balancing comfort and patient safety following acute musculoskeletal injury is possible when using a true multimodal approach including cognitive, physical, and pharmaceutical strategies. In this document, we attempt to provide practical, evidence-based guidance for clinicians in both the operative and nonoperative settings to address acute pain from musculoskeletal injury. We also organized and graded the evidence to both support recommendations and identify gap areas for future research.

Patient Education Interventions

Two studies evaluated the effect of providing tailored patient education after hospital discharge. An RCT conducted by Pronk et al. randomized 71 patients to receive either 1) a personalized pain management smartphone application involving patient pain score input, personalized advice on pain medication use, physiotherapy exercise, and nonpharmacological pain management (n = 38) or 2) usual care (n = 33) for 14 days after hospital discharge after primary TKA. No significant difference in VAS pain scores was reported between the intervention and control groups. However, the authors noted that patients who used the application at least 12 times in total over the 14-day intervention period (n = 19) reported a 4.1 times faster reduction in VAS pain scores during activity compared with controls (95% CI –7.5 to –0.8; P = 0.02). Patients allocated to receive the personalized pain management smartphone application used 23.2% less opioids (95% CI –38.3 to –4.44; P = 0.02) and 14% more paracetamol (95% CI 8.2 to 21.3; P < 0.01) than did control subjects at 14 days after hospital discharge. Physical function was assessed with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score — Physical Function Short-Form (KOOS-PS) and Oxford Knee Score. No significant differences in KOOS-PS or Oxford Knee Scores between the total pain management mobile phone application group and controls were reported. However, active use of the pain management mobile application among patients in the intervention group (total application use at least 12 times; n = 19) was associated with significantly lower KOOS-PS scores than those of controls at 1 month postoperatively (33.5 [standard deviation 8.4] vs 39.6 [standard deviation 9.8]; P = 0.048). Finally, no significant between-group differences in quality of life measured by the EuroQol-5 Dimensions 3-level version questionnaire were reported at 14 days after hospital discharge.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^27d5e55d]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioids for pain, more specifically with respect to indications for initiation, CDC 2022 guidelines recommend to consider initiating opioid therapy for acute,
subacute, or chronic pain if the benefits are anticipated to outweigh the risks to the patient and only after maximization of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies. Discuss the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy with patients before prescribing opioid therapy for pain management.
Cooperate with patients with subacute or chronic pain to establish treatment goals for pain and function, and develop a plan on how opioid therapy will be discontinued if the benefits do not outweigh the risks.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^88c280fd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately assessed and treated independent of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen.
Recommendations are voluntary and are intended to support, not supplant, individualized, person-centered care. Flexibility to meet the care needs and the clinical circumstances of a specific patient is paramount.
A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management attending to the physical health, behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and expected health outcomes and well-being of each person is critical.
Special attention should be given to avoid misapplying this clinical practice guideline beyond its intended use or implementing policies purportedly derived from it that might lead to unintended and potentially harmful consequences for patients.
Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities; provide culturally and linguistically appropriate communication, including communication that is accessible to persons with disabilities; and ensure access to an appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic pain management regimen for all persons.

Determining Whether or Not to Initiate Opioids for Pain

All patients with pain should receive treatment that provides the greatest benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 1 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for acute pain [i.e. pain lasting < 1 month] and Recommendation 2 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for subacute pain [i.e. pain lasting 1–3 months] or chronic pain [i.e. pain lasting > 3 months].)

Recommendation 1

Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).

### Neck pain: revision 2017 [^4d8313ff]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Medium credibility.

Neck pain with movement coordination impairments (WAD) — intervention strategies are stratified by prognosis and stage. For acute cases if prognosis is for a quick and early recovery, options include education with advice to remain active and act as usual, home exercise with pain-free cervical ROM and postural element, monitoring for acceptable progress, and minimizing collar use. For subacute cases if prognosis is for a prolonged recovery trajectory, options include education with activation and counseling; combined exercise with active cervical ROM and isometric low-load strengthening plus manual therapy (cervical mobilization or manipulation) plus physical agents such as ice, heat, and TENS; and supervised exercise including active cervical ROM or stretching, strengthening, endurance, and neuromuscular exercise with postural, coordination, and stabilization elements. For chronic cases, options include education addressing prognosis, encouragement, reassurance, and pain management; cervical mobilization plus individualized progressive exercise including low-load cervicoscapulothoracic strengthening, endurance, flexibility, functional training using cognitive behavioral therapy principles, vestibular rehabilitation, eye-head-neck coordination, and neuromuscular coordination elements; and TENS.

### Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for subacute low back pain among working age adults [^023246ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation programs are widely applied for chronic low back pain patients. The biopsychosocial approach can also prevent chronicity, by providing rehabilitation for patients who still have pain past the initial acute phase. Nevertheless, multidisciplinary treatment programmes are often laborious and long processes and require good collaboration between the patient, the rehabilitation team and the work place. By using workplace visits and developing close relationships with occupational health care providers, one might expect patients' working ability to improve.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for subacute low back pain among working age adults.

Search Strategy

The reviewed studies for this review were electronically identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLIT, CENTRAL, Medic, the Science Citation Index, reference checking and consulting experts in the rehabilitation field. The original search was planned and performed for the broader area of musculoskeletal disorders. Trials on subacute low back pain were separated afterwards. The literature search was last updated in November 2002 in EMBASE and MEDLINE.

Selection Criteria

From all references identified in our original search, we selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Trials had to assess the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for working age patients suffering from subacute low back pain (more than four weeks but less than three months). The rehabilitation program was required to be multidisciplinary, i.e., it had to consist of a physician's consultation plus either a psychological, social or vocational intervention, or a combination of these.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four reviewers blinded to journal and author selected trials that met the specified inclusion criteria. Two experts in the field of rehabilitation evaluated the clinical relevance and applicability of the findings of the selected studies for actual clinical use. Two other reviewers blinded to journal and author extracted the data and assessed the main results and the methodological quality of the studies, using standardized forms. Finally, a qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation.

Main Results

After screening 1808 abstracts, and the references of 65 reviews, we found only two relevant studies that satisfied our criteria on subacute low back pain. No more studies were found during the updates. Both studies were considered to be methodologically low quality RCTs. The clinical relevance of included studies was sufficient. There was moderate scientific evidence showing that multidisciplinary rehabilitation, which includes a workplace visit or more comprehensive occupational health care intervention, helps patients to return to work faster, results in fewer sick leaves and alleviates subjective disability.

Reviewer's Conclusions

We conclude that there is moderate evidence of positive effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for subacute low back pain and that a workplace visit increases the effectiveness. But because this evidence is based on trials that had some methodological shortcomings, and several expensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes are commonly used for uncomplicated/non-specific subacute low back problems, there is an obvious need for high quality trials in this field.

### Management of chronic low back pain in 2007–2008 [^e9113c72]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To report and critically appraise the current state of managing chronic (and subacute) low back pain as reflected in recently published guidelines and results from latest trials.

Recent Findings

Although occurrence rates of and social benefits for back pain are apparently on the decline (at least in Germany), it is still one of the most frequent and costly health disorders in Western countries. Ten percent of the adult German population suffers from chronic disabling back pain. For this group, a plethora of interventions is recommended. The most recent guideline from the US alone enumerates eight different treatments based on 'moderate-quality evidence'. Latest (often high-quality) trials from 2006 to 2007 strengthen the evidence base, only modestly, owing to their conflicting and/or confusing results.

Summary

Recommendations for the management of chronic disabling nonspecific back pain have made little progress over the past 10 years. The field still suffers from a 'strong weakness' due to a generally weak body of evidence. Progress can be expected when the effects of an intervention can be reliably calibrated against comparators of known (in)effectiveness. At present, an individualized clinical approach seems most appropriate. Patients and doctors are free to choose, according to their experiences and preferences, from recommended treatments.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^ea60bed1]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Nonpharmacologic pain management in trauma — Nonpharmacologic pain management strategies are recommended as adjuncts for pain and anxiety management in trauma to minimize opioid usage and chronic pain development, and the evidence base is stronger for cognitive rather than physical strategies. Although the evidence supporting the use of many nonpharmacologic pain management strategies in the setting of acute injury is not expansive, the interventions themselves are generally low-risk. It is recommended that these strategies be considered as adjuncts for pain and anxiety management in trauma across the entire age spectrum from children to adults, particularly in an effort to minimize opioid usage and chronic pain development. Tailor the specific treatments chosen to the needs of patients and resources available in each facility. A clear role exists for nonpharmacologic pain management in children, and multiple small, single center studies reported beneficial effects of music therapy, virtual reality environments, hypnosis, and other techniques to reduce pain and distress. However, as in adults, minimal high-quality evidence exists.

### Effectiveness of treatments for acute and subacute mechanical non-specific low back pain: a systematic review with network meta-analysis [^14a07cc5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain is a common symptom in people of all ages and socioeconomic status. The worldwide point prevalence of low back pain (acute, subacute and chronic) was 7.83% (95% CI 7.04 to 8.64) in 2017, with 577 million people affected at any one time. In 2017, low back pain was responsible for around 65 million years lived with disability, representing a deterioration of about 17.5% since 2007 mainly owing to population growth and ageing, with the greatest increase recorded for low-income and middle-income countries. People more often leave their job because of low back pain than diabetes, hypertension, neoplasm, asthma, heart and respiratory disease combined. About one in four adults in the USA had low back pain that lasted for at least 24 hours within the previous 3 months, with 7.6% adults reporting at least one episode of severe acute low back pain within a 1-year period. Moderate-to-severe pain and impairment of motor and psychological functions due to low back pain are the primary reasons for seeking medical consultation from a general practitioner.

Despite its high prevalence, low back pain has a generally good prognosis. While a specific cause of low back pain can seldom be identified, the most prevalent type is mechanical, non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP). Most episodes of acute and subacute NS-LBP improve significantly within 6 weeks, and the average pain intensity is moderate (6 on a 100-point scale; 95% CI 3 to 10) by 12 months. However, two-thirds of people with low back pain still experience pain at 3 months (67%, 95% CI 50% to 83%) and at 12 months (65%, 95% CI 54% to 75%).

Most guidelines agree on the first line of care in case of acute episode: advice, reassurance and encouragement to engage in light physical activity. When second-line treatment is needed, a range of therapeutic interventions (pharmacological and physiotherapy) for acute NS-LBP are available. The relative effects of various treatment options, when each option is compared against all others, are not well known. This uncertainty is reflected in the variety of recommendations in recent guidelines for acute NS-LBP. We explored the relative efficacy of currently available treatments for acute and subacute mechanical NS-LBP in terms of benefit and harm via a systematic review of the literature and network meta-analysis (NMA).

### Spinal pain: current understanding, trends, and the future of care [^003bcb07]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

The biopsychosocial model of care, which is characterized by multidisciplinary, multimodal care, is now a widely accepted strategy for the management of persistent pain. For example, a systematic review suggested that there was moderate evidence that multidisciplinary rehabilitation was effective for subacute low back pain. This multidisciplinary approach with "whole person engagement" is now gaining acceptance as an important way of connecting with and managing persons with pain because there are interdependent relationships between the physical and psychological factors associated with painthat require a holistic approach. Epidemiological studies have also highlighted that the psychosocial factors linked with low back pain can be used as prognostic indicators, eg, depression. These studies highlight the need to target care toward both the deleterious physical and psychosocial aspects of pain.

The management of pain is a bit like a jigsaw puzzle, with medications or procedures only representing one of the pieces of a multipiece jigsaw of cocare, multimodal options. So far, current care services may not be measuring all the pieces of this jigsaw puzzle entirely. For example, Froud et al, in a systematic review and meta-analysis, indicated that the impact of the experience of persistent pain on the affected person is profound, yet they found that despite the suffering being significant, core outcomes often did not capture what was important. Froud et alsuggest a move toward a biopsychosocial model that covers core sets of relevant outcomes. Cocare, via multidisciplinary working teams, implies coordinated care between knowledgeable consumers and a range of health care providers, each representing pieces of the puzzle, with a view to bring the pieces together and develop a beneficial management plan tailored to the individual person with pain.

Now, more than ever, coordinated action is needed to plan for the short- and long-term care needs of persons with pain. In the past, care services for pain have been quite discrete and have not taken full advantage of the benefits of the multidisciplinary approach to care. Contemporary management of pain is evolving toward this multidisciplinary way, with a view to obtain better outcomes. However, there are still barriers, including local health care politics, workforce capacity, funding mechanisms, and the gap in explicit MoC that are designed to guide care in real-world practice.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^5bd7f6d0]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine's guidelines have been updated to develop more detailed guidance for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain with opioids.

Methods

Literature searches were performed using PubMed, EBSCO, Cochrane Review, and Google Scholar without publication date limits. Of 264,617 articles' titles screened and abstracts reviewed, 263 articles met inclusion criteria. Of these, a total of 157 were of high and moderate quality addressing pain treatment. Comprehensive literature reviews were accomplished with article abstraction, critiquing, grading, evidence table compilation, and guideline finalization by a multidisciplinary expert panel to develop evidence-based guidance.

Recommendations

No quality evidence directly supports histories, physical examinations, and opioid treatment agreements, although they are thought to be important. No quality trials were identified showing superiority of opioids, compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and other medications for treatment of chronic, noncancer pain. The use of opioid-sparing treatments associated with lower doses of postoperative opioids is also associated with better long-term functional outcomes. Selective use of opioids is recommended for patients with acute and postoperative pain. Consensus recommendations also include consideration of carefully conducted trials of chronic opioid treatment for highly select patients with subacute and chronic pain and to maintenance opioid prescriptions only if documented objective functional gain(s) results. A strong and reproducible dose-response relationship identifies a recommended morphine equivalent dose limit of no more than 50 mg/day. Higher doses should be prescribed only with documented commensurately greater functional benefit(s), comprehensive monitoring for adverse effects, informed consent, and careful consideration of risk versus benefit of such treatment. Chronic opioid use should be accompanied by informed consent, a treatment agreement, tracking of functional benefits, drug screening, and attempts at tapering.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^d265e212]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute pain (up to 4 weeks) — recommended measures include comprehensive history and physical; opioids for treatment of acute, severe pain uncontrolled by other agents with functional deficits, with allowance that they may be indicated at the initial visit for a brief course when anticipated pain accompanies severe injuries, and that a Schedule IV opioid may be indicated when alternatives are not usable; the panel states, "Recommend to taper off opioid use in 1 to 2 weeks". Screening should be intensified for patients "requiring continuation of opioids beyond 2 weeks", and discontinuation is advised after meaningful functional recovery; for opioid-naive patients on continuous opioids, those "over 50-mg MED for longer than 3 weeks' duration may benefit from brief tapering over 3 to 7 days". Items not recommended include "Acute or chronic opioid use for patients who perform safety-sensitive jobs" and "Routine opioid use for treatment of nonsevere acute pain (eg, LBP, sprains, or minor injury without signs of tissue damage)".

### Preventing progression to chronicity in first onset, subacute low back pain: an exploratory study [^331323e4]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of a behavioral medicine intervention, relative to an attention control, in preventing chronic pain and disability in patients with first-onset, subacute low back pain (LBP) with limitations in work-role function.

Design

A 2-group, experimental design with randomization to behavioral medicine or attention control groups.

Setting

Orthopedic clinic at a Naval Medical Center.

Participants

Sixty-seven participants with first-onset LBP of 6 to 10 weeks of duration and impairment in work function, of whom 50 completed all 4 therapy sessions and follow-up 6 months after pain onset.

Intervention

Four 1-hour individual treatment sessions of either behavioral medicine, focused on back function and pain education, self-management training, graded activity increases, fear reduction, and pain belief change; or attention control condition, focused on empathy, support, and reassurance.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was proportion of participants classified as recovered, according to pre-established clinical cutoffs on standardized measures, signifying absence of chronic pain and disability at 6 months after pain onset. Secondary analyses were conducted on pain, disability, health status, and functional work category. Intervention credibility and pain belief manipulation checks were also evaluated.

Results

Chi square analyses comparing proportions recovered at 6 months after pain onset for behavioral medicine and attention control participants found relative rates of 52% versus 31% in the modified intent-to-treat sample (P = 0.09) and 54% versus 23% for those completing all 4 sessions and 6-month follow-up (P = 0.02). At 12 months, 79% of recovered and 68% of chronic pain participants still met criteria for their respective groups (P < .0001). Recovered participants also had higher rates of functional work status recovery at 12 months (recovered: 96% full duty and 4% light duty; chronic pain: 61% full duty, 18% light duty, and 21% medical discharge, respectively; P = 0.03).

Conclusions

Early intervention using a behavioral medicine rehabilitation approach may enhance recovery and reduce chronic pain and disability in patients with first-onset, subacute LBP. Effects are stronger for participants attending all 4 sessions and the follow-up assessment.

### Systematic review of conservative interventions for subacute low back pain [^50604651]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of conservative interventions on clinically relevant outcome measures for patients with subacute low back pain. This is particularly important because effective treatment for subacute low back pain will prevent the transition to chronic low back pain, a condition that is largely responsible for the high health care costs of low back pain.

Design

Systematic review of randomized controlled trials.

Main Outcome Measures

Methodological quality of each trial was assessed. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for pain and disability and risk ratios for return to work.

Results

Thirteen trials were located, evaluating the following interventions: manipulation, back school, exercise, advice, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), hydrotherapy, massage, corset, cognitive behavioural treatment and co-ordination of primary health care. Most studies were of low quality and did not show a statistically significant effect of intervention. For the strict duration of low back pain (six weeks to three months), no evidence of high internal validity was found but when other methodological criteria were considered, evidence was found for the efficacy of advice. Furthermore, there is evidence that when a broader view is taken of the duration of subacute low back pain (seven days to six months), other treatments (e.g. manipulation, exercise, TENS) may be effective.

Conclusions

Our review identified a major gap in the evidence for interventions that are currently recommended in clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of subacute low back pain. Lack of a uniform definition of subacute low back pain further limited current evidence.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^d4fcc305]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Subacute (1–3 months) and chronic pain (> 3 months) — recommended measures include comprehensive history and physical; screening of patients prior to consideration of initiating a trial of opioids; and use of an opioid trial if other evidence-based approaches for functional restorative pain therapy have been used with inadequate improvement in function, with opioids then recommended for function impaired by severe conditions such as chronic severe radiculopathy, chronic severe peripheral neuropathies, complex regional pain syndrome, and severe arthroses. Additional recommendations include use of an opioid treatment agreement to document understanding and expectations, and baseline and random urine drug screening, qualitative and quantitative, to evaluate drug presence or other substance use. Not recommended are "Acute or chronic opioid use for patients who perform safety-sensitive jobs", "Opioids for the routine treatment of breakthrough suppression of chronic pain in the absence of overt trauma or acute nociceptive pathology (eg, fracture, myocardial infarction, tooth abscess)", and "Intrathecal drug delivery systems for chronic nonmalignant pain conditions".

### Comparison of physical treatments versus a brief pain-management programme for back pain in primary care: a randomised clinical trial in physiotherapy practice [^0e88ac04]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Recommendations for the management of low back pain in primary care emphasise the importance of recognising and addressing psychosocial factors at an early stage. We compared the effectiveness of a brief pain-management programme with physiotherapy incorporating manual therapy for the reduction of disability at 12 months in patients consulting primary care with subacute low back pain.

Methods

For this pragmatic, multicentre, randomised clinical trial, eligible participants consulted primary care with non-specific low back pain of less than 12 weeks' duration. They were randomly assigned either a programme of pain management (n = 201) or manual therapy (n = 201). The primary outcome was change in the score on the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire at 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Findings

Of 544 patients assessed for eligibility, 402 were recruited (mean age 40.6 years) and 329 (82%) reached 12-month follow-up. Mean disability scores were 13.8 (SD 4.8) for the pain-management group and 13.3 (4.9) for the manual-therapy group. The mean decreases in disability scores were 8.8 (6.4) and 8.8 (6.1) at 12 months (difference 0 [95% CI -1.3 to 1.4], p = 0.99), and median numbers of physiotherapy visits per patient were three (IQR one to five) and four (two to five), respectively (p = 0.001). One adverse reaction (an exacerbation of pain after the initial assessment) was recorded.

Interpretation

Brief pain management techniques delivered by appropriately trained clinicians offer an alternative to physiotherapy incorporating manual therapy and could provide a more efficient first-line approach for management of non-specific subacute low back pain in primary care.

### A descriptive study of older adults with persistent pain: use and perceived effectiveness of pain management strategies [^e463d4c7]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

Study participants and procedures

Data for this study were collected in the baseline assessment of participants in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of a pain self-management group intervention. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Swedish Medical Center (Seattle, WA). All study participants provided written informed consent.

The study sample was recruited from adults residing in 43 for-profit and not-for-profit senior housing or retirement communities in the greater Seattle, Washington, area. Participants were recruited through newsletter announcements, flyers, and presentations at the communities. Although most facilities offered exclusively or predominantly independent living, some also provided assisted living. Fourteen communities offered continuing care ranging from independent living apartments to skilled nursing facilities, and eight provided subsidized housing. The majority of study participants lived independently.

Study inclusion criteria were age 65 years or older, pain of more than three months' duration that interfered with daily activities, average pain in the past week greater than 2 on a 0–10 numerical rating scale, ability to complete study questionnaires, and ability to attend seven weekly sessions at the participant's retirement facility (due to the nature of the larger RCT). Exclusion criteria were current cancer and surgery within the past six months or planned in the next six months.

Among the 362 individuals screened for the study, 44 (12%) were ineligible (Figure 1). Of the 318 eligible individuals, 256 (80.5%) enrolled and completed the baseline assessment, and 62 (19.5%) declined to participate or did not complete the baseline assessment. Among the 256 study participants, 21 (8%) were not included in analyses for this report due to missing data. The 235 individuals included in the current report did not differ significantly from the 83 individuals who were eligible but declined to enroll or did not complete all of the baseline measures in age, race, income, proportion living alone, average pain in the past week, average pain interference with activity in the past week, or average pain interference with enjoyment of life in the past week. However, the sample included in the current report, as compared with those eligible but not included, had more males (16% vs. 6%, chi-square test, p = .02) and a trend toward more participants with education past high school (77% vs. 66%, chi-square test, p = .05).

### Work disability prevention and management [^ab78932e]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Injection therapies — such as glucocorticoid injections for carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger digit, and radiculopathy from a herniated disc — have quality evidence of efficacy for specific disorders, typically during the secondary work disability prevention phase and/or subacute period. In such cases, injections may be curative or reduce pain and inflammation to facilitate participation in active rehabilitative programs focused on functional restoration, yet they are generally thought to have relatively little value in tertiary prevention and may inadvertently increase work disability by externalization, reliance on others for treatment, avoidance of performing an active rehabilitative program, and lack of development of an active rehabilitative strategy and mindset. If not previously tried for a disorder with quality evidence, an injection to ascertain potential benefits may be indicated including for secondary or tertiary prevention, and attention to objective functional improvement is particularly important.

Noninvasive Nonpharmacologic Approaches to Subacute and Chronic Pain

Many noninvasive nonpharmacologic approaches, including physical therapy, weight loss for knee osteoarthritis, and behavioral therapies (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction), can improve pain and function without risk for serious harms. High-quality evidence exists that exercise therapy (a prominent modality in physical therapy) for back pain, fibromyalgia, and hip or knee osteoarthritis reduces pain and improves function immediately after treatment and that the improvements are sustained for at least 2–6 months (,–). Previous guidelines have recommended aerobic, aquatic, or resistance exercises for persons with chronic pain, including osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, back pain, and fibromyalgia. Other noninvasive nonpharmacologic therapies that improve pain, function, or both for at least 1 month after delivery without apparent risk for serious harm include cognitive behavioral therapy for knee osteoarthritis; manual therapies for hip osteoarthritis; psychological therapy, spinal manipulation, low-level laser therapy, massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for low back pain; mind-body practices (e.g. yoga, tai chi, and qigong), massage, and acupuncture for neck pain; cognitive behavioral therapy, myofascial release massage, mindfulness practices, tai chi, qigong, acupuncture, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation for fibromyalgia; and spinal manipulation for tension headache. For temporomandibular disorder pain, patient education and self-care can be effective, as can occlusal splints for some patients and biobehavioral therapy for prevention of disabling symptoms. Exercise, mind-body interventions, and behavioral treatments (including cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness practices) can encourage active patient participation in the care plan and help address the effects of pain in the patient's life; these active therapies have somewhat more robust evidence for sustained improvements in pain and function than more passive treatments (e.g. massage), particularly at longer-term follow-up. In addition, physical activity can provide additional health benefits, such as preventing or reducing symptoms of depression. Active approaches that engage the patient should be used when possible, with a supplementary role for more passive approaches, to reduce pain and improve function.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^219caf59]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Each of the 12 recommendation statements is followed by considerations for implementation and a rationale for the recommendation. The implementation considerations offer practical insights, context, and specific examples meant to further inform clinician-patient decision-making for the respective recommendation and are not meant to be rigidly or inflexibly followed.

The recommendations are grouped into four areas:

Determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain
Selecting opioids and determining dosages
Deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up
Assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use

In addition, these five guiding principles should broadly inform implementation across recommendations (Box 4):

BOX 4
Guiding principles for implementation of the CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain — United States, 2022 recommendations

Acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately assessed and treated independent of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen.
Recommendations are voluntary and are intended to support, not supplant, individualized, person-centered care. Flexibility to meet the care needs and the clinical circumstances of a specific patient is paramount.
A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management attending to the physical health, behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and expected health outcomes and well-being of each person is critical.
Special attention should be given to avoid misapplying this clinical practice guideline beyond its intended use or implementing policies purportedly derived from it that might lead to unintended and potentially harmful consequences for patients.
Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities; provide culturally and linguistically appropriate communication, including communication that is accessible to persons with disabilities; and ensure access to an appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic pain management regimen for all persons.

### Effectiveness of oxycodone hydrochloride (strong opioid) vs combination acetaminophen and codeine (mild opioid) for subacute pain after fractures managed surgically: a randomized clinical trial [^69c0263d]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Opioids have been used for centuries and are the most potent analgesic agents. Evidence supports the use of opioids to relieve moderate to severe pain, particularly acute and cancer pain. In these latter situations, the efficacy of opioids is extensively documented and broadly accepted. However, the evidence does not support using opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain. The prescribing of opioids for chronic pain has increased despite evidence of the association of their long-term use with adverse outcomes. While there is little debate over the short-term use of opioids, their use longer term is controversial, with increasing reluctance among some physicians to prescribe these medications. The most powerful opioid analgesics are also the most liable to be associated with abuse and addiction. With global attention on increased opioid prescription and the opioid abuse epidemic, reconsideration and reexamination of opioid pain management are being undertaken.

Orthopedic surgeons are among the top prescribers of opioid analgesics. Severe postoperative pain is common after orthopedic surgical treatment, and safe and effective management of this pain can be challenging for everyone on the health care team. Adequate relief of pain is a measure of patient satisfaction and may be associated with decreased chronic postsurgical pain; however, taking opioids for acute pain is associated with increased likelihood of long-term opioid use. Furthermore, increased initial opioid exposure (ie, increased total dose or longer-duration prescription) is associated with increased risks of long-term use, misuse, and overdose, suggesting that strong opioid prescription following discharge from the hospital should be considered carefully. Many choices are available for postoperative pain, but evidence to inform clinical choice after discharge in the subacute setting is sparse. However, patients with surgically managed fractures are commonly (and in many places, routinely) discharged home from the hospital with a strong opioid prescription.

In the interest of minimizing the potential problems associated with long-term opioid use, we propose that discharge from the hospital signifies the most suitable time to transition people down the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder from step 3 (strong opioid) to step 2 (mild opioid) analgesics if strong opioids are not shown to be superior. With this in mind, we undertook a superiority trial to determine if a strong opioid (as per current practice) provided better analgesia than a mild opioid (a combination acetaminophen and low dose codeine) when taken postdischarge among patients who received orthopedic surgical treatment.

Update on the research evidence

Recommendations on treatments for acute and chronic spinal pain are published elsewhere in numerous reviews and clinical guidelines. We emphasize that guidelines seldom offer a full account of either 1) exactly how each recommended treatment should be applied, or 2) if a specific combination of these treatments would be more useful than another. In this regard, more recent research is showing that treatments previously believed to be equivocal are now emerging as clearly beneficial. For example, in a randomized controlled trial testing guidelines-based care, Bishop et alshowed that significantly greater improvement for acute mechanical low back pain of 16 weeks, or less, was achieved with spinal manipulative therapy compared with usual medical care. Patients receiving usual medical care had inferior functional outcomes in conjunction with higher rates of prescribed opioid analgesics (80%). The COST B13 European guidelinesdifferentiate between supporting the use of weak opioids (eg, tramadol), for acute and chronic back pain, and do not mention strong opioids for acute back pain. The COST B13 guideline indeed comments on the limited evidence for strong opioids in chronic back pain.

There is strong evidence that weak opioids (eg, tramadol) relieve pain and disability in the short-term in chronic low back pain patients (level A). There is limited evidence that strong opioids relieve pain in the short-term in chronic low back pain patients (level C).

Furthermore, medically managed patients received a high percentage (60%) of guideline-discordant treatment, like bed rest, X-rays, and back supports. Goertz et aldemonstrated that spinal manipulative therapy in conjunction with standard medical care offers a significant advantage for decreasing pain and improving physical functioning when compared with standard care alone for men and women between 18 and 35 years of age with acute low back pain. In contrast, Hay et alshowed that a brief pain management program for back pain delivered by appropriately trained clinicians offers an alternative to physiotherapy-incorporating manual therapy and could provide an efficient first-line approach for subacute low back pain in primary care. The inferences from these trials–are that there are various effective treatments for nonmalignant spinal pain, and that a multimodal approach, combining interventions, is likely to yield better outcomes – in this case patient education with both active and passive treatments. Such studies, among others, also firmly support the early access of patients with nonmalignant spinal pain to assessment, with an emphasis on triage and diagnosis, and appropriate treatment, to achieve the best possible outcome.–

Implementation Considerations

Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1).
Opioids are sometimes needed for treatment of acute pain (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For many common causes of nontraumatic, nonsurgical pain, when opioids are needed, a few days or less are often sufficient, and shorter courses can minimize the need to taper opioids to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of a course of opioids. However, durations should be individualized to the patient's clinical circumstances.
Clinicians should generally avoid prescribing additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected.
For postoperative pain related to major surgery, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of actual use and refills and on consensus).
To minimize unintended effects on patients, clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills by ensuring all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment, as needed.
Longer durations of opioid therapy are more likely to be needed when the mechanism of injury is expected to result in prolonged severe pain (e.g. severe traumatic injuries).
Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain.
If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy.
If patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.
If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids.
If a taper is needed, taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription (see Supporting Rationale for this recommendation for additional details).
Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before hospital discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

Abstract

The World Health Organisation has recognised the importance of accessible and effective rehabilitation for people with musculoskeletal pain disorders. However, most current rehabilitation interventions provide only modest short-term benefits. In this article, we discuss opportunities for optimisation of rehabilitation to improve health outcomes for people with musculoskeletal pain. We argue that greater consideration for the mechanisms explaining how rehabilitation interventions work has the potential to improve intervention effectiveness, efficiency, and implementation. We also discuss improvements that could be made to identifying whom interventions are most beneficial for and the stratification of patients based on outcome risk, particularly regarding the management of patients deemed at high risk of poor recovery.

Skilled nursing facility postacute care — A skilled nursing facility (SNF) provides medical care and less intensive rehabilitation therapy after hospitalization. Generally, patients receive 45–60 minutes of therapy per day and are examined by a physician or nurse practitioner within the first 2 weeks following admission, and the average length of stay (LOS) in a SNF is 26 days. SNF care may be provided by registered nurses, licensed practical or vocational nurses, and nursing assistants, as well as rehabilitation therapists (e.g., physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) providers). Nursing care includes the basics of hygiene and skin care, assistance with meals, medication administration, and care coordination, and the goals of PT are to promote mobility and relieve pain through exercise and complementary therapies.

### A descriptive study of older adults with persistent pain: use and perceived effectiveness of pain management strategies [^7432ad18]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent pain is a common, often debilitating, problem in older adults; however, few studies have focused on the experiences of older adults in managing their pain. The objective of this study was to describe the use and perceived effectiveness of pain management strategies in a sample of older adults and to explore the associations of these variables with demographic and psychosocial characteristics.

Methods

Adults ≥ 65 years old and living in retirement facilities who reported persistent pain (N = 235, mean age = 82 years, 84% female, 94% white) completed measures of demographics, pain, depression, self-efficacy for managing pain, and a Pain Management Strategies Survey. Participants identified current and previous-year use of 42 pain management strategies and rated helpfulness of each on a 5-point scale.

Results

Acetaminophen, regular exercise, prayer, and heat and cold were the most frequently used pain management strategies (61%, 58%, 53%, and 48%, respectively). Strategies used by > 25% of the sample that were rated moderately or more helpful (i.e., > 2 on a 0 to 4 scale) were prayer [mean (SD) = 2.9 (0.9)], opioids [2.6 (0.8)], regular exercise [2.5 (1.0)], heat/cold [2.5 (1.0)], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [2.4 (1.0)], and acetaminophen [2.3 (1.0)]. Young-old (65–74 years) study participants reported use of more strategies than did old-old (85+ years) participants (p = .03). Perceived helpfulness of strategy use was significantly associated with pain intensity (r = -.14, p < .0001), self-efficacy (r = .28, p < .0001), and depression (r = -.20, p = .003).

Conclusion

On average, older adults view the strategies they use for persistent pain as only moderately helpful. The associations between perceived helpfulness and self-efficacy and depression suggest avenues of pain management that are focused less on specific treatments and more on how persons with persistent pain think about their pain.

### The assessment of pain in older people: UK national guidelines [^ac2026f5]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Australia

The Australian Pain Society addresses the issue of pain in its first ever publication focused exclusively on older adults; it is entitled Pain in Residential Aged Care Facilities: Management Strategies. It presents strategies and guidance to assist in identifying and assessing residents' pain effectively across a range of areas that includes managing pain using a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options. It also examines issues of quality management and organisational structure related to pain management. An additional document, the Pain Management Guidelines (PMG) Kit for Aged Care has been designed to be used with the Australian Pain Society's document to assist in the implementation of best practice for pain management in aged care facilities.

The APS document draws upon relevant international best practice approaches, expert opinion and published research evidence up to 2004 – particularly from the American Geriatric Society and the American Medical Directors and Health Care Associations. The document is evidence based and should be used to guide decision making about changes to current practice. The pain management guidelines are a summary only and should not be used in isolation to guide practice.

United Kingdom (UK)

In 2007 the Royal College of Physicians, British Pain Society and British Geriatric Society published their guidelines on the assessment of pain in older adults. The emphasis of the document is on chronic pain management and it is a comprehensive guide to the methods of assessment and the tools available. The guidelines recommend that for older adults with mild to moderate dementia, the numerical rating scale and the verbal rating scales can be applied. However, as the level of cognitive impairment becomes more severe, specific behavioural scales should be used, of which there are 11, to measure pain intensity. The guidelines suggest that the Abbey Pain Scale appears to be the most user-friendly. They are designed to allow clinicians to make rapid, informed decisions based wherever possible on synthesis of the best available evidence and expert consensus gathered from practising clinicians and service users. A key feature of the series is to provide both recommendations for best practice, and where possible practical tools with which to implement it.

### How does reduction in pain lead to reduction in disability in patients with musculoskeletal pain? [^943dba1b]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain treatment program

Patients referred to the pain treatment center were enrolled in an inpatient multidisciplinary program lasting 15 consecutive days on average. The main goal of the intervention was to teach patients to cope with pain and to reduce the interference of pain with daily living. Based on a multidisciplinary approach, every patient was assessed by every specialty participating in the program. The multidisciplinary team involved specialized therapists including orthopedic physicians, rheumatologists, neurologists, psychotherapists and physiotherapists, as well as occupational therapists and social workers. The treatment included pharmacotherapy, physical approaches (such as exercise, physiotherapy, physical therapy and rehabilitation), psychological strategies including psychological counseling, cognitive-behavioral interventions, self-help strategies and the acquisition of pain management skills (eg, goal setting, structuring of daily activities, pacing strategies). The status of each patient, the extent of his/her recovery and the decision about his/her discharge time were regularly discussed at regular team meetings consisting of all members of the treatment team.

Before the start of program, patients were requested to complete the baseline assessment: demographic features, pain intensity, disability and psychological variables (T0). Immediately at the end of treatment program (T1) and three months after the end of the treatment (T2), the instruments for pain, disability assessment and the psychological instruments were reapplied and the posttreatment and follow-up scores were obtained.

### Testing an educational nursing intervention for pain assessment and management in older people [^db88b988]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a structured educational nursing intervention on pain assessment and management in older hospitalized people.

Design

A non-equivalent control group interventional design.

Setting

Geriatric evaluation and management units in two metropolitan Australian hospitals.

Patients

In total, 192 patients participated, with 32 different patients recruited consecutively for the pre-intervention, intervention, and 3-month post-intervention stages from each unit.

Interventions

Nurses in the intervention group received a structured intervention comprising 6 hours of instruction and 2 hours of clinical demonstration. Nurses in the control group received "usual" staff development activities.

Outcome Measures

Five assessment tools for pain were used: the visual analog scale, the Faces Pain Scale-Revised, the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia Tool, and the Abbey Pain Scale. Data were also collected on nurses' use of pain assessment tools and their use of non-pharmacological and pharmacological methods of managing pain.

Results

Improvements were observed in pain intensity at rest and on movement in the intervention unit at the post-intervention stage and at the 3-month post-intervention stage. There was also a trend for patients to be prescribed analgesics on a fixed dose schedule following implementation of the program in the intervention unit.

Conclusions

The comprehensive intervention enabled change in practice and improvements in pain intensity, and the assessment and management of pain. Future research is needed on implementing the intervention with a multidisciplinary team of health professionals in a subacute environment.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^244df656]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients who started opioid therapy for acute pain and are continuing to receive opioids for subacute pain might be at a particularly critical point for potential transition to chronic pain and potential transition to long-term opioid therapy. Clinicians should follow up with and evaluate patients with subacute pain who have been treated with opioid therapy for 30 days. Clinicians should ensure that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment, but only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient. Clinicians should reassess the patient's pain, function, and treatment course; ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed; and optimize pain management as needed (see Recommendation 2).

In analyses of placebo-controlled trials, the clinical evidence reviews found that effects of opioids on mean improvement in pain and in function were greater at 1–3 months than at 3–6 months. A cohort study found an association between longer duration of therapy and increased risk for new-onset depression. Because of potential changes in the balance of benefits and risks of opioid therapy over time, clinicians should regularly reassess all patients receiving long-term opioid therapy, including patients who are new to the clinician but on long-term opioid therapy, with a suggested interval of every 3 months or more frequently. Clinicians seeing new patients already receiving opioids should establish treatment goals, including functional goals, for continued opioid therapy (see Recommendation 2). Clinicians should reevaluate patients who are at greater risk for opioid use disorder or overdose (e.g. patients with depression or other mental health conditions, a history of substance use disorder, a history of overdose, taking ≥ 50 MME/day, or taking other central nervous system depressants with opioids) more frequently than every 3 months. Clinicians should regularly screen all patients for these conditions, which can change during the course of treatment (see Recommendation 8). Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize unintended effects on patients by ensuring all patients can access and afford follow-up evaluation. In addition, policymakers can consider evidence-based methods of minimizing barriers to care (e.g. paid sick leave). In practice contexts where virtual visits are part of standard care (e.g. in remote areas where distance or other context makes follow-up visits challenging), or for patients for whom in-person follow-up visits are challenging (e.g. frail patients), follow-up assessments that allow the clinician to communicate with and observe the patient through telehealth modalities might be conducted when available.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for rehabilitation of individuals with lower limb amputation [^9078c31d]. DoD/VA (2024). High credibility.

Lower limb amputation rehabilitation — chronic pain management recommends, "We suggest offering a multi-modal, transdisciplinary individualized approach to pain management including transition to a non-narcotic pharmacological regimen combined with physical, psychological, and mechanical modalities throughout the rehabilitation process". It further states, "For the treatment of chronic pain, the 2017 VA/DOD CPG for the Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain recommends alternatives to opioid therapy such as self-management strategies, other non-pharmacological treatments, and non-opioids over opioids (see the 2017 VA/DOD OT CPG)". The 2017 CPG strength of recommendation is "Weak for", with 2017 CPG recommendation category "Reviewed, New-replaced", and 2024 CPG recommendation category "Reviewed, New-added".

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^ff767dfb]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline expands and updates the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline to provide evidence-based recommendations for prescribing opioid pain medication for acute, subacute, and chronic pain for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years, excluding pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care (Boxes 1 and 2). Lessons learned from the development of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline informed the process used to generate this update. This update leverages new data to expand content on prescription opioids for acute and subacute pain throughout the recommendations. Importantly, the update also aims to clearly delineate recommendations that apply to patients who are being considered for initial treatment with prescription opioids and patients who have been receiving opioids as part of their ongoing pain management.

BOX 1
Executive summary of the CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain — United States, 2022

This clinical practice guideline updates and expands the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain — United States, 2016 (MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;65[No. RR-1]:1–49]) and provides evidence-based recommendations for primary care and other clinicians (including physicians, nurse practitioners and other advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, and oral health practitioners) providing pain care, including those prescribing opioids, for outpatients aged ≥ 18 years with acute (duration of < 1 month) pain, subacute (duration of 1–3 months) pain, or chronic (duration of > 3 months) pain. Recommendations on use of opioids for acute pain and on tapering opioids for patients already receiving opioid therapy have been substantially expanded in this update. These recommendations do not apply to patients experiencing pain associated with the following conditions or settings: pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. Applicable outpatient settings include clinician offices, clinics, and urgent care centers. The recommendations do not apply to providing care to patients who are hospitalized or in an emergency department or other observational setting from which they might be admitted to inpatient care. These recommendations do apply to prescribing for pain management when patients are discharged from hospitals, emergency departments, or other facilities.

Multimodal: Exercise and manual therapy — acute, subacute, and chronic movement coordination impairments: For patients with acute neck pain with movement coordination impairments, there was a benefit in using an intensive physical therapy program including manual therapy, cervical range of motion (ROM) and isometric strengthening exercise, advice, and physical agents, when compared to 1 session of physical therapy consisting of home active exercise instruction and advice, for reducing pain and work days lost, and improving self-perceived benefit over the intermediate term. For acute cases, cervical mobilization or manipulation combined with active cervical ROM exercise, when compared to rest, use of a collar and/or analgesic medications and/or advice, reduced pain but there was no difference in function over the short term. Additional acute benefits included massage, active and resisted exercise of the neck and shoulder, and heat when compared to collar use for reducing pain and disability over the intermediate term, and cervical mobilization plus low intensity active kinesthetic, postural and ROM exercise, when compared to a self-managed exercise and education program, for reducing pain and disability over the immediate term. For acute neck pain, there was no benefit in using massage plus mobilization, when compared to collar use or advice to stay active, over the short and intermediate term for reducing pain and disability and improving function. For patients with acute neck pain with movement coordination impairments who received intensive multimodal physical therapy, a higher percentage reported symptom resolution after 2 years, as compared with those who received a single session of physical therapy consisting of home active cervical ROM exercise and advice. Subacute evidence indicates no update evidence identified. For patients with chronic neck pain with movement coordination impairments, there was a benefit in using cervical mobilization combined with low load cervical and scapular muscle activation and kinesthetic training, when compared to a booklet on education and exercise, for reducing pain and improving function over the immediate term.

### Are chronic pain fellowships disguised as acute pain fellowships which manage chronic pain? How to recognize and repair [^a325b866]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Building a Better Future for Pain Medicine

Advancing Pain Medicine requires a fundamental shift in how fellowship education is designed, with a stronger emphasis on longer-term chronic pain management. A paradigm shift in the design and funding of training programs is essential to address the growing complexity of chronic pain treatment. Central to this transformation is the proposal to extend the duration of Pain Medicine fellowships. This adjustment would enable trainees to follow patients over extended periods, fostering a deeper understanding of the long-term dynamics of chronic pain and its management. Developing dedicated 4-year residencies in Pain Medicine as a distinct discipline would help our trainees achieve this longitudinal expertise even better than requiring fellowships of increased duration.

An interdisciplinary approach to training is equally critical. By integrating rotations in specialties such as behavioral health, physical medicine, rehabilitation, neurology, radiology, spine surgery and rheumatology, fellowship programs can broaden trainees' perspectives and enhance their ability to deliver comprehensive care. This interdisciplinary exposure is crucial for equipping future pain specialists with the diverse tools needed to address the multifaceted nature of chronic pain. Fellowship programs and fellows alike recognize the importance of interventional pain management. The education of the procedures used in this space is essential for fortifying of our field. However, fellowship education should emphasize on non-pharmacologic therapies, as they are the gateway for insurance approval of many interventional procedures and salvage therapy for interventions that may not have met the expectations of the clinician or patient. Given that the evidence-based durability of most of our procedures has an end date of 1–2 years, managing patient symptoms beyond that point may rely on our field's ability to sensibly integrate physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and mindfulness-based interventions to make chronic pain care genuinely comprehensive. We posit that fellows should be trained to follow as many patients as possible from the first visit until pain has stabilized. For many patients, this requires several months to years. Following a patient during that timeframe will build an awareness of the different strategies fellows can incorporate into their treatment plans, recognizing their role as an aspect of a multimodal pain management strategy.

### Pain experiences in adult burn survivors during rehabilitation and recovery: a qualitative systematic review [^b733b59a]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

To apply these findings in clinical settings, burn clinicians may wish to consider developing specific pain management protocols/pathways that address both the physical and psychological aspects of burn pain. For example, interventions could include structured psychological support programs to complement physical pain management techniques, ensuring a holistic approach to treatment. Education and training programs for clinical staff on the nuances of burn pain and its psychosocial components could improve patient care outcomes. Implementing such strategies may facilitate patient satisfaction, reduce the incidence of chronic pain, and promote recovery and rehabilitation. It may be best to adopt a person-centered approach and understand pain from the perspective of burn survivors and employ patient-reported experience measures throughout the recovery process. This respects the subjective experience of the individual and provides deeper insights from those experiencing the pain, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of their ongoing discomfort.

Given the extensively documented and often enduring experiences of both physical and psychological pain, data collection strategies beyond the existing pain scales are required to capture diverse experiences of pain effectively. Qualitative approaches that utilize semistructured interviews enable the collection of in-depth data that would provide details and insights into individual experiences. While one-on-one interviews are time-consuming to conduct, they provide a depth of data that does not emerge from the use of quantitative tools alone. The results of this qualitative systematic review found that both physical and psychological pain continued for months to years after the original burn injury. Further comprehensive longitudinal qualitative studies are recommended.

### The canPain SCI clinical practice guideline for rehabilitation management of neuropathic pain after spinal cord: recommendations for model systems of care [^800d2664]. Spinal Cord (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical practice guidelines.

Objectives

The project objectives were to develop the first Canadian recommendations on a model of care for the management of at- and below-level neuropathic pain in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).

Setting

The guidelines are relevant for inpatient and outpatient SCI rehabilitation settings in Canada.

Methods

On the basis of a review of the Accreditation Canada standards, the Steering Committee developed questions to guide the CanPainSCI Working Group when developing the recommendations. The Working Group agreed on recommendations through a consensus process.

Results

The Working Group developed five recommendations for the organization of neuropathic pain rehabilitation care in people with SCI.

Conclusions

The Working Group recommendations for a model of care for at- and below-level neuropathic pain after SCI should be used to inform clinical practice.

### Updated centers for disease control and prevention guidelines on opioid prescribing: what should surgeons know? [^df527bf1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently published a 2022 guideline on opioid prescribing for acute, subacute, and chronic pain. This information is relevant to surgeons because many patients receive their first opioid prescription after surgery. When prescribing opioids, surgeons walk the line between benefit and harm. Many of the CDC recommendations mirror the AAO-HNS Clinical Practice Guideline: Opioid Prescribing for Analgesia After Common Otolaryngology Operations. For example, opioids are not recommended as first-line therapy for acute pain from otolaryngology-head, and neck surgery procedures. New insights include safeguards and strategies to mitigate the risk of complications in patients with chronic pain undergoing surgical procedures. Consultation with a pain specialist should be considered for patients transitioning from acute to chronic pain, cognizant of the risks of abrupt discontinuation of opioids in patients with opioid use disorder. This article summarizes key considerations for providing individualized, evidence-based perioperative pain management.

### Guidelines abstracted from the department of veterans affairs / department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of stroke rehabilitation [^5012cd36]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assist facilities in identifying those evidence-based processes of poststroke care that enhance measurable patient outcomes. The guideline(s) should be used by facilities (hospitals, subacute-care units and providers of long-term care) to implement a structured approach to improve rehabilitative practices and by clinicians to determine best interventions to achieve improved patient outcomes.

Options

The guideline considers five elements of poststroke rehabilitation care: interdisciplinary teams; use of standardized assessments; intensity, timing, and duration of therapy; involvement of patients' families and caregivers in decision-making; and educational interventions for patients, families, and caregivers. Evidence, benefits, harms, and recommendations for each of the five designated elements and specific annotated recommendations for poststroke managements are presented separately.

Outcomes

The overall guideline considers improvement in functional status measures as the primary outcome. Achieving community-dwelling status and preventing complications, death, and rehospitalization are also important outcomes. Costs are not specifically addressed.

Participants

The Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Stroke Rehabilitation Working Group consisted of 28, largely VA and military hospital, representatives of medical and allied professions concerned with stroke diagnosis, management, and rehabilitation. Nine additional members with similar credentials served as the editorial committee. Technical consultation was contracted from ACS Federal Health Care, Inc, and the Center for Evidence-Based Practice, State University of New York-Upstate Medical University, Department of Family Medicine conducted evidence appraisal. Consensus was achieved over several years of facilitated group discussion and iterative evaluation of draft documents and supporting evidence.

Sponsor

The guideline was prepared under the auspices of the VA/DoD. No other source of support was identified in the document, or supporting documents.

### Economic analysis of patient-related effects of an interdisciplinary pain self-management program [^7d8666be]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

There was also reduced number of medications taken by patients at 1-month follow-up which was consistent with previous findings.

Before this study, there was limited economic analysis related to interdisciplinary pain management programs. A small number of previous studies have reported increased labour force participation for subacute and acute pain management interventions that were also found to be cost-effective and cost-beneficial.

Schofield et al. (2012) suggested that it is important to maintain the labour force participation of patients with chronic pain to maintain their living standards at levels comparable with others who do not suffer from this condition where possible. Patients who work limited hours due to pain or retire early due to pain have lower income available which also reduces their long-term capacity for wealth accumulation. This increases their dependence on their family members and welfare payments. Thus, any intervention that can improve a person's capacity to work should be of interest to both the patients, their families, and to those responsible for funding treatments.

### APA clinical practice guideline for psychological and other nonpharmacological treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^cd86a1d1]. APA (2024). High credibility.

American Psychological Association (APA) chronic musculoskeletal pain guideline — comparisons with other guidelines are as follows: SIGN recommends referring patients to a pain management program and engaging in exercise and exercise therapies, advises that patients with chronic LBP remain active, and recommends clinicians offer self-management interventions while noting insufficient evidence for clinician advice alone. NICE 2021 guidance on chronic primary pain recommends exercise programs and physical activity and notes to consider ACT or CBT; this was inconsistent with the APA panel's conclusions that insufficient evidence exists to recommend for or against ACT for chronic musculoskeletal pain, and NICE notes that more research is needed on mindfulness, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and relaxation therapy. Kaiser Permanente's 2021 guideline focuses on nonspecific back pain, organizes recommended interventions by patient pain severity (low, medium, high pain) based on the STarT back scoring, reaches similar conclusions to APA regarding the goal that the patient is an active participant and that interventions focus on improving quality of life and functioning, yet differs by including acute, subacute, and chronic pain levels whereas APA includes only chronic musculoskeletal pain. A chiropractic guideline by Hawk and colleagues (2020) develops recommendations from literature review and expert consensus and includes similar recommendations, emphasizing a biopsychosocial approach, combining active and passive interventions, and the patient being an active participant in treatment.

Post-acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) pain — assessment and treatment: Chronic pain is sometimes interwoven with co-occurring conditions such as sleep disorders, anxiety, MDD, or PTSD, and providers may consult the VA/DoD CPG for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain for assessment of persistent pain. Pain management is a priority and thus all individuals presenting with a history of mTBI and complaints of pain should be thoroughly assessed, with the underlying cause determined and treated, if possible. The use of non-pharmacologic therapies should be considered as first-line, rehabilitation therapies may be beneficial for the management of pain in individuals with a history of mTBI, and the use of opioid agents in chronic pain conditions should be avoided until other avenues of pain control have been given appropriate treatment trials. Providers may also consult the VA/DoD CPG for the Management of Chronic Multisymptom Illness or the VA/DoD CPG for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain for additional strategies to manage persistent pain.

### Interdisciplinary rehabilitation [^29268456]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation programs are infrequently used in the United States in the treatment of chronic pain. Comprehensively addressing the contributors to chronic pain, which include behavioral, psychological, and physical dimensions, has shown evidence-based efficacy in improving functioning and reducing pain-related distress. This approach also holds the potential for reducing the escalating costs of chronic pain care.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^b25cb83f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Box 7 The RIOSORD

Clinicians should consider additional strategies for mitigating risk, including using the lowest effective doses of BZD and opioid analgesic medications and optimizing non-opioid interventions to manage pain. As emphasized in the 2022 CDC Clinical Practice Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Pain (11):

When opioids are initiated for opioid-naïve patients with acute, subacute, or chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe the lowest effective dosage. If opioids are continued for subacute or chronic pain, clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids at any dosage, should carefully evaluate individual benefits and risks when considering increasing dosage, and should avoid increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients.

The CGC recommends that clinicians use the lowest effective dose of BZDs and follow the CDC guidelines for minimizing risks related to opioid prescribing. This includes minimizing opioid doses where possible and optimizing non-opioid interventions for managing pain, such as nonpharmacological treatments for pain management, including exercise, mindfulness-based interventions, and CBT. The CDC guideline, and the joint US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and US Department of Defense (DoD) Guideline on Chronic Pain Prescribing also recommend that clinicians consider using buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist with reduced risk of overdose, to manage pain in patients at risk of withdrawal or overdose, including those who are co-prescribed BZDs. Patients at risk of opioid overdose should be provided with or prescribed opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g. naloxone; see "Harm Reduction").

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^783fce9e]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

ACOEM opioids guideline — clinical recommendations emphasize selective short‑acting use, risk assessment, agreements, and a dose limit: The panel recommends that quality evidence currently fails to demonstrate superiority of opioids to other medications and treatments for treatment of pain, and it recommends comprehensive history and physical examinations. Selective use of the lowest effective, short‑acting opioid dose is recommended as adjunctive treatment for patients with acute and postoperative pain that is inadequately treated with NSAIDs or other treatments. The strongest risk factors for overdose and deaths include concomitant use of benzodiazepines, illicit substances, unemployment status, psychiatric disorders, and a substance(s) abuse history. Opioid consent and treatment agreements are recommended for treatment of subacute and chronic pain with opioids, and opioid maintenance only with documented functional gain(s) is recommended. A strong and reproducible dose–response relationship identifies a recommended MED limit of 50 mg/day for acute or chronic pain, and higher doses are recommended to require documented commensurately greater functional benefit(s).

### Nonspecific lower-back pain: surgical versus nonsurgical treatment [^1a15cc05]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

We review evidence-based treatments for patients seeking care for lower-back pain and patients who have been diagnosed with nonspecific lower-back pain. The review is based on selected systematic reviews and national and international guidelines for the treatment of lower-back pain. Additional randomized controlled trials (ie, possibly those not previously included in the latest systematic reviews) were reviewed and added based on recommended procedures for the evaluation of methodological quality (ie, strong, moderate, and weak). In acute nonspecific lower-back pain (0–4 weeks duration of pain) there is moderate to strong evidence that self-care with over-the-counter medication and maintaining activity as tolerated or treatment with a limited number of sessions of manipulative therapy is effective for pain relief. In subacute nonspecific lower-back pain (4–12 weeks duration of pain) there is weak to moderate evidence that a graded activity program including exercises and cognitive behavioral treatment in combination is more efficient than usual care with regard to return to work. There is strong evidence that these programs reduce work absenteeism. In cases of chronic nonspecific lower-back pain (> 12 weeks duration of pain) a variety of treatments are available with limited and similar efficacy on pain and disability reduction. There is moderate evidence that surgery in chronic nonspecific lower-back pain is as effective as cognitive behavioral treatment with regard to pain, function, mood and return to work. Surgical indications for chronic nonspecific lower-back pain remain ill defined.

### ACOEM practice guidelines: opioids for treatment of acute, subacute, chronic, and postoperative pain [^f9f0da1d]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

ACOEM opioids guideline — selective use of opioids is recommended for patients with acute and postoperative pain; a strong and reproducible dose-response relationship identifies a recommended morphine equivalent dose limit of no more than 50 mg/day; higher doses should be prescribed only with documented commensurately greater functional benefits, comprehensive monitoring for adverse effects, informed consent, and careful consideration of risks versus benefit of such treatment; and chronic opioid use should be accompanied by informed consent, a treatment agreement, tracking of functional benefits, drug screening, and attempts at tapering. The guideline also notes that no quality was identified showing superiority of opioids, compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and other medications for treatment of chronic, noncancer pain.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^25a96aa5]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD low back pain guideline — technology-based self-management modalities state that for the self-management of low back pain (LBP), "there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against technology-based modalities" and this is categorized as "(Neither for nor against | Reviewed, New-added)". The systematic evidence review identified "four studies" of technology-based modalities (mobile health [mHealth], online/web-based applications, Nintendo Wii, phone applications, and telephone-based) compared with usual care in patients with LBP, but limitations included pragmatically delivered multimodal components, small numbers of trials with variability in design and populations, and restricted outcomes; specifically, "the interventions included several pragmatically delivered components such as health coaching activity trackers and mobile technology (IMPACT App)", one SR "was limited to a small number of trials, and there was variability in design, contact, populations investigated, and measurement of outcomes", and "The study's quantitative synthesis was limited to the outcomes of pain and disability". Additional methodological concerns included that a study "must be interpreted with caution because loss-to-follow-up rate was higher for the intervention group than the control group", and "The overall quality of the evidence for most of the outcomes assessed was rated low to very low". Patient preferences may vary, as "some patients may value a technology-based option that would allow them to avoid traveling to receive care", and the scope note clarifies that recommendations for "patients with low back pain" include acute, subacute, or chronic LBP with or without neurological symptoms.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^9ea2c137]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical evidence reviews identified an observational study finding long-term (> 90 days' supply) opioid prescription to be associated with considerably increased risk for a new opioid use disorder diagnosis for all dosages of long-term (> 90 days' supply) opioids prescribed compared with no opioids prescribed, with adjusted odds ratios of 15, 29, and 122 at low (1–36 MME/day), medium (36–120 MME/day), and high (≥ 120 MME/day) opioid dosages, respectively. Compared with no opioid use, opioid use was associated with increased risk for opioid use disorder, overdose, all-cause deaths, fractures, falls, and myocardial infarction.

Multiple experts from OWG stated that they appreciated this recommendation because of the importance of highlighting both pain and function, sharing realistic expectations with patients before initiating treatment, and paying attention to tapering and exit strategies. Although some experts reasoned the recommendation statement could state nonopioid therapies "may be preferred" or "may be effective" for chronic pain, others agreed with language that nonopioid therapies "are preferred" for chronic pain because opioid therapies are associated with small short-term benefits compared with placebo, comparable or reduced short-term benefits compared with nonopioid therapies, uncertain long-term benefits, and potential for serious harms.

Opioids should not be considered first-line or routine therapy for subacute or chronic pain. Although evidence on long-term benefits of nonopioid therapies also is limited, these therapies also are associated with short-term benefits, no evidence exists for attenuated benefit over time or difficulty stopping therapy when benefits do not outweigh risks, and risks for serious harms are usually lower. This does not mean that patients should be required to sequentially fail nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy or be required to use any specific treatment before proceeding to opioid therapy. Rather, expected benefits specific to the clinical context should be weighed against risks before initiating therapy. In some clinical contexts (e.g. serious illness in a patient with poor prognosis for return to previous level of function, contraindications to other therapies, and clinician and patient agreement that the overriding goal is patient comfort), opioids might be appropriate regardless of previous therapies used. In other situations (e.g. headache or fibromyalgia), expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to outweigh risks regardless of previous nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies used.
