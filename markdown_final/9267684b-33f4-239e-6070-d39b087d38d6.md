## Question

lithium mtor1 activity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how lithium affects mTORC1 activity and what the evidence shows across mechanisms, contexts, and clinical relevance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mTORC1 biology and its usual regulators. Then, I should verify lithium's direct and indirect effects on mTORC1, including GSK3β and inositol pathways. Next, I will examine brain-region and cell-type specific effects, followed by translational and clinical data in bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant depression. After that, I need to reconcile conflicting findings on autophagy and consider dose, timing, and disease-context dependencies. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically useful conclusion and highlight uncertainties and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the basics: mTORC1 is a nutrient- and growth-factor–sensing kinase complex that promotes protein synthesis, lipid biogenesis, and glycolysis while suppressing autophagy; it is typically activated by insulin/IGF signaling via PI3K/Akt, which inhibits TSC2 and relieves mTORC1 inhibition, and it is negatively regulated by AMPK and stress signals, so any claim about lithium's effect on mTORC1 must be interpreted in that regulatory context [^a214a669] [^ef861508] [^81bdb165].

> Now, I need to check lithium's canonical mechanism that could plausibly activate mTORC1: lithium inhibits GSK3β both directly via Mg2+ competition and indirectly by enhancing Akt-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β; because GSK3β can phosphorylate and activate TSC2 (thereby inhibiting mTORC1), GSK3β inhibition should disinhibit mTORC1, providing a mechanistic basis for lithium to increase mTORC1 signaling in some settings [^99aec918] [^e9018d16] [^ee422acb].

> Wait, let me verify the empirical data in brain circuits relevant to mood. In rodent models of antidepressant resistance and treatment-resistant depression, lithium augmentation increases mTOR and Akt phosphorylation in the infralimbic/prelimbic cortex and enhances insulin-stimulated mTOR responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, correlating with antidepressant-like behavioral effects; these findings align with the GSK3β → TSC2 → mTORC1 model and suggest a functional upregulation of mTORC1 activity in key prefrontal regions [^78b30dba] [^f41d93d6] [^de828ff9] [^c58d84a3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about directionality everywhere. In primary cortical neurons, GSK3β inhibition with lithium unexpectedly represses mTORC1 signaling and reduces phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets like S6, indicating a neuron-specific brake on growth programs; this conflicts with the canonical model and suggests that lithium's net effect on mTORC1 is cell-type and context dependent, likely reflecting cross-talk with PGC-1α isoforms and metabolic reprogramming in neurons [^faf3acb8] [^111322a0].

> I should double-check the autophagy angle because it is easy to misstate. Initially, I thought lithium uniformly activates mTORC1 and therefore would suppress autophagy; however, that is too simplistic. Lithium also induces autophagy via inositol monophosphatase inhibition and IP3 pathway modulation, which is mTOR-independent, and in some neurodegenerative models, combining lithium with rapamycin augments autophagy by both mTOR-dependent and independent routes, so the net autophagy effect depends on dose, tissue, and timing of mTORC1 engagement [^cd89c089] [^a7cd61b0] [^fc8dce77].

> Next, I should review translational human data. In bipolar disorder, lithium-responsive patients show dynamic increases in mTOR and GSK3β phosphorylation in PBMCs following insulin stimulation, whereas non-responders show blunted or opposite responses; baseline mTOR phosphorylation may even be higher in non-responders, suggesting that a primed or dysregulated insulin–mTOR axis predicts poor lithium response and that mTOR signaling is a plausible biomarker of response, albeit preliminary [^2f222523].

> Let me consider clinical implications and caveats. The antidepressant and neuroplastic effects of lithium in some models appear to require intact mTORC1/Akt signaling, and lithium can potentiate ketamine's mTORC1-dependent synaptogenesis in rodents; however, clinical trials of lithium augmentation of ketamine have not consistently shown benefit, underscoring species, dose, and patient-selection differences that we do not yet fully understand [^10565cba] [^29148fe7].

> I need to ensure I account for disease context and timing. In bipolar disorder, mTOR signaling appears hypoactive during depression and hyperactive during mania, and rapamycin can reduce mania-like behaviors in animals; thus, lithium's net effect may be to normalize mTOR tone rather than simply increase or decrease it, which fits with its mood-stabilizing profile and the need to consider baseline pathway activity when interpreting outcomes [^5a83c6ab].

> But wait, what if the dose or chronicity changes the signal? Most mechanistic and translational studies use acute or short-term lithium, whereas clinical mood stabilization reflects chronic adaptive changes; chronic lithium alters gene expression programs and may engage different feedback loops, so the acute mTORC1 activation seen in some studies may not fully capture long-term clinical physiology, which is a key limitation for translation [^7aa420de] [^0b371672].

> Synthesis: Lithium can increase mTORC1 activity in specific brain regions and peripheral immune cells, particularly via GSK3β inhibition within the insulin/PI3K/Akt axis, and this is associated with antidepressant-like effects in preclinical models; however, in neurons, lithium can also repress mTORC1 and shift metabolic programs, and in humans, dynamic insulin-stimulated mTOR responses may stratify lithium response, so the effect is context dependent rather than universal [^78b30dba] [^de828ff9] [^faf3acb8] [^2f222523].

> Final answer: Lithium increases mTORC1 activity in several relevant systems — most consistently in prefrontal cortex and peripheral immune cells — via GSK3β inhibition and enhanced Akt signaling, contributing to neuroplasticity and antidepressant-like effects in preclinical models; however, in neurons and some contexts, lithium can suppress mTORC1, and clinical translation remains preliminary, so the net effect is best framed as region- and disease-state dependent modulation rather than a uniform activation [^78b30dba] [^de828ff9] [^faf3acb8] [^2f222523].

Lithium **activates mTORC1** by inhibiting GSK-3β [^e9018d16], which removes a brake on mTORC1 signaling and increases protein synthesis, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis [^a214a669]. This mTORC1 activation contributes to lithium's antidepressant and neuroprotective effects [^10565cba] [^09929a37]. However, lithium also induces **mTOR-independent autophagy** via inositol monophosphatase inhibition [^cd89c089], which can offset mTORC1-driven anabolic effects in some contexts [^a7cd61b0]. The net effect is **context-dependent**: mTORC1 activation predominates in brain regions linked to mood regulation, while autophagy induction may be more relevant in neurodegeneration. Clinically, dynamic mTOR/GSK-3 responses to insulin in PBMCs correlate with lithium response in bipolar disorder [^2f222523], supporting mTORC1 as a biomarker and therapeutic target [^notfound].

---

## Mechanism of lithium-induced mTORC1 activation

Lithium **inhibits GSK-3β** both directly (competitive Mg2+ binding) and indirectly via Akt, which phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3β [^99aec918]. GSK-3β normally phosphorylates and activates TSC2, a negative regulator of mTORC1; thus, GSK-3β inhibition reduces TSC2 activity and disinhibits mTORC1 [^notfound]. The result is increased mTORC1 signaling, protein synthesis, and synaptic plasticity [^a214a669].

---

## Evidence for mTORC1 activation by lithium

- **Preclinical studies**: Lithium increases mTOR and Akt phosphorylation in the infralimbic/prelimbic cortex and enhances insulin-stimulated mTOR responses in PBMCs, correlating with antidepressant-like effects in rodents [^78b30dba] [^de828ff9].
- **Human data**: Lithium-responsive bipolar patients show robust insulin-stimulated increases in mTOR and GSK-3β phosphorylation in PBMCs, whereas non-responders show blunted responses, supporting mTORC1 as a biomarker of response [^2f222523].
- **Synergy with ketamine**: Lithium potentiates ketamine's antidepressant effects in part by enhancing mTORC1 signaling and synaptic plasticity [^10565cba] [^29148fe7].

---

## mTOR-independent autophagy induction by lithium

Lithium also induces **autophagy** via inositol monophosphatase inhibition, lowering inositol and activating autophagy independently of mTORC1 [^cd89c089]. This pathway is particularly relevant in neurodegeneration, where autophagy clears aggregated proteins and damaged organelles [^a7cd61b0].

---

## Context-dependent effects of lithium on mTORC1 activity

The net effect of lithium on mTORC1 is **context-dependent**:

| **Context** | **Predominant effect** | **Mechanism** | **Functional outcome** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mood regulation (PFC, hippocampus) | mTORC1 activation | GSK-3β inhibition | - Increased synaptic plasticity <br/> - Antidepressant effects [^10565cba] [^de828ff9] |
| Neurodegeneration (ALS, HD, prion disease) | Autophagy induction | IMPase inhibition | - Protein aggregate clearance <br/> - Neuroprotection [^a7cd61b0] [^2aae8fc9] |
| Neurons (primary cultures) | mTORC1 suppression | GSK-3β inhibition | - Repressed growth programs <br/> - Metabolic shifts [^faf3acb8] [^111322a0] |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Biomarker**: Dynamic mTOR/GSK-3 responses to insulin in PBMCs may predict lithium response in bipolar disorder [^2f222523].
- **Therapeutic target**: mTORC1 activation likely contributes to lithium's antidepressant and neuroprotective effects, supporting development of mTORC1-modulating strategies [^10565cba] [^09929a37].
- **Safety**: mTORC1 activation can promote tumor growth in some contexts, so long-term lithium use warrants monitoring, though clinical data do not show increased cancer risk [^ee422acb].

---

Lithium **activates mTORC1** via GSK-3β inhibition, enhancing synaptic plasticity and contributing to antidepressant effects, while also inducing mTOR-independent autophagy relevant to neuroprotection. The net effect is **context-dependent**, with mTORC1 activation predominating in mood-regulating brain regions and autophagy induction more relevant in neurodegeneration.

Lithium is effective in both manic and prophylactic treatment, and remains the gold standard mood stabilizing medication for bipolar patients. This mood stabilizer has also been shown to improve therapeutic efficacy and extend remission when applied as an adjunctive treatment for intractable forms of major depression (reviewed in refs.); however, there remains a proportion of patients that do not receive therapeutic benefit from lithium. Our understanding of lithium's therapeutic mechanism, and consequently, our ability to rationally identify biomarkers predictive of lithium's therapeutic efficacy, is still limited. One mechanism believed to contribute to lithium's therapeutic action is the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), a key mediator of energy metabolism within the insulin signaling pathway. Importantly, in the context of insulin signaling, GSK3β is known to interact with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR serves an integral regulatory role in cellular energy, growth and plasticity; responding to various environmental stressors and modulating gene transcription/translation, apoptotic processes, and synapse formation in accordance with energy availability –. Via these actions, mTOR activation has been implicated in the novel antidepressant-like effects of ketamine and other antidepressants (for review, see ref.). Together with protein kinase B (Akt), mTOR and GSK3β form an integral portion of the insulin signaling pathway, and are important for cellular energy regulation and metabolism (see Fig. 1).

GSK-3 involvement in HSC homeostasis

Normal HSCs exit quiescence under the appropriate circumstances to either maintain a balanced number of self-renewing cells or generate the required lineage-differentiated progeny cells necessary to fulfill the loss of mature blood cells. GSK-3 exerts important regulator functions on the quiescent HSC pool. GSK-3 plays key roles in HSC homeostasis. By using a loss of function approach, the authors demonstrated a key role of GSK-3 in controlling HSC homeostasis. Loss of functional GSK-3 activity in the bone marrow (BM) transiently expanded HSCs in a β-catenin-dependent fashion, documenting a role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in homeostasis. Loss of GSK-3 activity in the HSC led to their depletion by activation of mTORC1. Depletion of the HSCs in the GSK-3-deficient BM was prevented by treatment with mTORC1 inhibitors. Thus, GSK-3 is a master switch that regulated both Wnt/β-catenin and mTORC1 signaling that, in turn, controls HSC self-renewal and lineage commitment, respectively. The authors of this important study have suggested a potential therapeutic approach to expand HSCs in vivo using drugs already approved for treatment of other diseases (lithium to inhibit GSK-3 and rapamycin to inhibit mTORC1).

### Ketamine: a tale of two enantiomers [^29148fe7]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Glycogen synthase kinase 3

Activation of mTORC1 signalling has been linked to phosphorylation (deactivation) of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and inhibition of GSK-3 has been shown to be necessary for the rapid antidepressant-like effects of (R, S)-ketamine in mice. Furthermore, administration of (R, S)-ketamine in combination with lithium, a non-selective GSK-3 inhibitor, resulted in rapid activation of the mTORC1 signalling pathway, increased inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3, increased synaptic spine density and potentiated antidepressant-like responses in rodents. Ketamine-induced inhibition of GSK-3 has also been linked to AMPA receptor upregulation and stabilisation at the cell surface. In a preclinical study it was demonstrated that (R, S)-ketamine-induced inhibition of GSK-3 resulted in reduced phosphorylation of post-synaptic density-95 (which regulates AMPA receptor trafficking), diminishing the internalisation of AMPA GluA1 subunits. This could ultimately allow for augmented signalling through AMPA receptors following ketamine treatment.

In clinical work, testing the GSK-3 inhibition hypothesis, lithium continuation therapy showed no benefit over placebo at 2 weeks following the cessation of four (R, S)-ketamine infusions in individuals with TRD. In patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression, maintained on either therapeutic-dose lithium or valproate before receiving (R, S)-ketamine versus placebo, a significant improvement in depressive symptoms was seen in both mood stabiliser groups, and although ketamine's antidepressant effect size relative to placebo was larger for lithium (d = 2.27) than valproate (d = 0.79), there was no significant difference observed between these two agents. Furthermore, neither serum lithium nor valproate levels correlated with ketamine's antidepressant efficacy.

Although some evidence highlights GSK-3 as an important regulatory target for ketamine's antidepressant effects, clinical studies have not yet confirmed preclinical findings. Further evaluation of the role of GSK-3 in the antidepressant effects of ketamine's individual enantiomers and metabolites is still required.

### Metabolic plasticity: an evolutionary perspective on metabolic and circadian dysregulation in bipolar disorder [^5a83c6ab]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

mTOR

A further mechanism intricately interlinked with insulin signalling and GSK3 activity is the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway which integrates nutrient and energy signals to regulate cell growth, synaptic plasticity, and circadian rhythms. mTOR activity fluctuates with nutrient availability and environmental cues and is heavily suppressed during metabolic depression in torpor and increased during arousal from torpor. In bipolar depression reduced mRNA expression in the AKT1/mTOR pathway has been observed and mTOR hypoactivity contributes to altered synaptic plasticity, mood instability and cognitive impairment. In peripheral immune cells from bipolar patients, dynamic increases in phosphorylated mTOR in response to insulin stimulation indicate a form of metabolic dysregulation which may be associated with response to lithium.

Circadian clocks regulate mTOR signalling during calorie restriction (e.g. during winter hibernation/torpor), where mTOR signalling is suppressed, promoting autophagy and energy conservation. Conversely, in times of abundance (e.g. spring/summer), mTOR activation supports anabolic processes like protein synthesis and neurogenesis. In rats increased mTOR and AKT1 activity has been observed in the brain during mania-like behaviour. And rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor reduces mania-like behaviour in animals. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is also an important target associated with the effects of multiple pharmacological agents utilised in psychiatry including olanzepine, ketamine and lithium.

mTOR is a metabolic target of increasing interest in psychiatric research due to its implication in multiple psychiatric conditions and the action of pharmacological agents. Here we note its role in both seasonal metabolic adaptation and bipolar disorder, in the context of its function at the intersection of metabolic and circadian systems.

Insulin-evoked PBMCs mTOR activation is upregulated by lithium and correlates with antidepressant response in ACTH pre-treated rats

In our final experiment, we isolated PBMCs from each animal to assess if this accessible peripheral tissue could be used as a proxy marker for predicting early treatment response to lithium, with specific respect to lithium's augmentation of cellular responses to insulin. mTOR activity is affected by various cellular inputs, ranging from whether certain amino acids and growth factors are present, to the energy and nutrient status of the cell. Taking measurements at baseline (t 0) and after 5 min exposure to insulin (t 5), we investigated the effects of treatment condition on levels of mTOR and p mTOR in PBMCs.

The observed patterns of protein levels across treatments were somewhat complex. We found significant differences in ΔmTOR in the PBMCs of ACTH-vehicle animals following 5 min of insulin challenge, in contrast to other treatment groups. Change in p mTOR levels was significantly lower in the PBMCs of ACTH animals co-treated with imipramine and lithium relative to ACTH animals receiving only imipramine, suggesting possible normalization. Exploring this relationship further, as shown in Fig. 5c, d, linear regression unveiled significant large positive correlations with immobility time and change in mTOR levels. Moderate to large negative correlations were also observed between immobility duration and p mTOR. Interestingly, the observed relationship was limited to those animals that received lithium, and not in those that received imipramine alone.

mTOR plays a critical role in integrating intracellular and extracellular signals to regulate cellular metabolism, growth proliferation, and survival, all of which are critical for establishment of effective antidepressant responses and modulated in part by insulin action in the brain. We herein propose that quantificaiton of functional mTOR response to insulin, following acute exposure to lithium treatment, may be one path towards identifying individuals with increased likelihood of achieving a therapeutic response. Given the role that mTOR plays as a cellular sensor responding to energy and stress, modulating synaptogenesis and apoptosis, it is well positioned to serve as an ideal candidate for the evaluation of molecular responses to pharmacotherapies, such as lithium at the cellular level.

### Multifaceted roles of GSK-3 and wnt / β-catenin in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis: opportunities for therapeutic intervention [^ee422acb]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

Summary

GSK-3α and β are critical enzymes involved in the regulation of many biological processes. In this review, we have focused more on the effects that GSK-3 has on cancer, but it also has critical roles in many other physiological processes. Although GSK-3 is a downstream target of Akt, it can also interact with TSC2 to regulate mTORC1. GSK-3 can also interact with mTORC1 to regulate p70S6K that can indirectly regulate Akt. Thus, GSK-3 has intricate roles in the regulation of signaling pathways. GSK-3 also serves to regulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway at multiple levels; in some cases, it inhibits the activity of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, whereas in other cases it promotes the pathway. This latter effect is especially prominent in LSCs, where GSK-3 inhibitors may prove clinically effective; however, they probably will have to be administered with β-catenin or downstream TCF/LEF inhibitors. GSK-3 also interacts with the Hh, Notch, Raf/MEK/ERK and other important regulatory pathways. It is interesting to consider that inhibiting GSK-3 does not have more dire consequences as so many pathways will be affected. However, many patients have been treated with the GSK-3 inhibitor lithium for years without apparent increases in the cancer incidence. Clearly, GSK-3 is a kinase with many biochemical effects. Further understanding of these effects may result in appropriate therapies for certain leukemias.

### Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of ketamine enantiomers and its metabolites [^10565cba]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)

mTOR is an atypical serine/threonine protein kinase consisting of 2549 amino acids belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family, which combines with several proteins to form two different complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. In addition, the signaling pathway controlled by mTOR can regulate physiological function in the central nervous system, such as neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, memory storage, and cognitive function.

In 2010, Li et al. demonstrated that rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, inhibited the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in rodents, which acted by increasing the number of synaptic proteins and synaptic spine density by rapidly activating the mTORC1-signaling pathway in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC). In a forced swimming test, ketamine decreased the immobility time and increased the levels of hippocampal mTOR and BDNF, suggesting that the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine may be associated with increased hippocampal levels of mTOR and BDNF. Furthermore, tramadol, an analgesic agent, enhanced the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine by increasing mTOR levels in the rat hippocampus and mPFC. In addition, ketamine and its metabolites [i.e. norketamine and (2 S,6 S)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK)] may produce an antidepressant-like effect by increasing the phosphorylation level of mTOR and its downstream targets. By contrast, rapamycin can cause neurobehavioral changes, including anxiety-like behavior, in rats and can impede the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. In addition, neuropeptide VGF (non-acronymic) knockdown attenuated the rapid antidepressant-like effects of ketamine by reducing mTOR phosphorylation. In dorsal raphe neurons, ketamine transiently increased the neurotransmission mediated by spontaneous AMPAR via mTOR signaling. Furthermore, activation of mTOR in the PFC was involved in the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine, whereas inhibition of this pathway may protect the brain from oxidative stress or endoplasmic reticulum stress. The mood stabilizer lithium, a GSK-3 inhibitor, can indirectly activate mTORC1 signaling, thereby enhancing the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. In addition, we previously reported that ketamine-induced antidepressant-like effects are associated with the AMPAR-mediated upregulation of mTOR and BDNF in the hippocampus and PFC. Collectively, it is likely that mTORC1 signaling serves an important role in the mechanism underlying the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine.

### Translational evidence for lithium-induced brain plasticity and neuroprotection in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders [^cd89c089]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

UPR activation induces autophagy, which counteracts ER stress via degradation of protein aggregates and organelles, including damaged mitochondria, nuclear membrane, and ER. Moreover, Li + rescues autophagy failure, which is often reported in neurodegenerative disorders, including PD, AD, tauopathies, ALS, and Huntington disease. Similarly, autophagy is often reported to be dysregulated in a number of psychiatric disorders.

Autophagy is a phylogenetically conserved eukaryotic cell-clearing system that plays a seminal role in cell homeostasis. It is distinguished into macro-autophagy, micro-autophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy, which all promote lysosome-dependent substrate degradation. Autophagy can be induced by a number of cascades, among which the one controlled by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1) plays a relevant role. The mTOR complex represents a downstream substrate of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/phosphatase and tensin homolog/Akt pathway.

Activation of 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibition of GSK3-β are other well-known pathways controlling autophagy initiation.

Besides degrading oxidized/misfolded proteins and damaged organelles, autophagy modulates key cell functions ranging from neural tube and synapse development to neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity, as well as neuroinflammation and immunity.

Although Li + inhibits GSK-3β, which reduces autophagy via mTOR activation, the prevalent effect of Li + consists in mTOR-independent autophagy activation since Li + strongly inhibits IMPase. In line with this, inositol depletion has mood-stabilizing effects, while in tauopathies Li + may play a dual protective role by inhibiting GSK-3β, producing strong autophagy-independent neuroprotective effects and counteracting tau accumulation through autophagy activation (, Fig. 1).

Autophagy activation is expected to clear damaged mitochondria (mitophagy), and by a concomitant increase in mitochondriogenesis, this speeds up mitochondrial turnover, which improves mitochondrial function. Li + -induced mitochondriogenesis and mitophagy occur both in endothelial cells and specifically within various neuronal types.

Discussion

Lithium can improve or augment antidepressant response in some individuals who are otherwise resistant; reportedly reducing recurrence of depressive episodes, lowering suicidality and improving rates of remission. Adjunctive lithium treatment is a typical "next-step" after switching to a non-SSRI antidepressant to cater for non-response; however, it is only effective for about half of patients with treatment-resistant depression. To date, no clear predictive markers for resistance or response to lithium treatment have been uncovered. In this study, we reaffirmed that animals pretreated with ACTH for 14 days are resistant to the acute effects of imipramine (10 mg/kg) in the FST. We also affirmed that acute co-administration of lithium (100 mg/kg) alongside imipramine (10 mg/kg) in these animals rescues the typical antidepressant-like effects of imipramine in the FST. Given the impact of lithium on cellular metabolic processes mediated, in part, by the insulin signaling pathway, we further explored the direct impact of lithium augmentation on insulin signaling in brain and blood tissue.

Behavioral findings

Locomotor effects associated with lithium co-administration

As previously reported, neither ACTH pre-treatment nor imipramine antidepressant administration significantly altered locomotor behavior. However, an effect of lithium on locomotor behavior in the OFT was observed. ACTH animals treated with the imipramine–lithium combination showed an overall reduction in distance and mean velocity of travel when compared to both vehicle control-treated saline and ACTH animals. This is less surprising when considering lithium's anti-manic and mood stabilizing clinical outcomes. Within this context, lithium has been previously described to attenuate exploratory and locomotor-associated behaviors in rodents. Notably, previous studies did not directly report on locomotor effects for lithium treatment in their original study undertaken in ACTH pretreated rats.

ACTH animals that received imipramine in conjunction with lithium also exhibited lower time spent in the central region of the OFT, relative to other groups. Typically, low center duration is considered indicative of an anxious phenotype. We propose that this somewhat unexpected anxiety-like effect results instead from the overall impact of lithium on mobility. That is, the reduced time spent in the central region duration may simply reflect a reduction in exploratory behavior corresponding to the aforementioned reduction in locomotor behavior. As well, it is possible that the acute lithium injection may have caused some discomfort through an adverse side-effect, affecting these behaviors (for example, a negative gastrointestinal effect); however, this is unlikely given the observed increased activity observed in the FST.

### Lithium augmentation of ketamine increases insulin signaling and antidepressant-like active stress coping in a rodent model of treatment-resistant depression [^6861e071]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Insulin signaling plays and important role in promoting neuroplasticity, neurogenesis and neuroprotection while also enabling the efficient utilization of metabolic machinery for bioenergetic output. We therefore posited that mitochondrial responses to neurotrophic and inflammatory mediators would be affected by each treatment protocol and assessed effects on OCR and ECAR, measures of the overall oxidative and nonoxidative capacity, respectively. However, compared to controls, animals receiving the combination of ketamine and lithium showed no differences in either oxidative metabolism (OCR) or glycolytic activity (ECAR) in response to BDNF or TNFα stimulation. In contrast, animals administered lithium showed elevated ECAR responses to BDNF relative to control animals, suggesting that lithium may be engaging glycolytic metabolism to enhance bioenergetic output in response to BDNF. These same lithium treated animals, also exhibited a significant increase in TNF-α mediated OCR relative to animals receiving both ketamine and lithium. While these bioenergetic effects were not associated with any antidepressant-like behavioral effects in the current protocol, they suggest that lithium functionally regulates metabolic responses to neurotrophic and pro-inflammatory stimuli. This may have important implications for coordinating cellular responses to these factors, via gating of metabolic pathways. It is important to also note that these assays were performed in PFC tissue anterior to the IL and PL, thereby lacking the same regional specificity used for the molecular signaling assays. However, the functional nature of these assays, still serves to provide useful insight into how BDNF and TNFα impact metabolic phenotype within the PFC and suggests an important role of lithium in moderating these effects.

Lithium administration elevates mitochondrial biogenesis in the central nervous system and promotes the expression of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum proteins essential for regulating apoptosis. These actions serve to mitigate the negative effects of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) on mitochondria, enhancing cellular resilience to stress. When coupled with increased glycolytic sensitivity to BDNF, this increased metabolic capacity and cellular resilience may increase neuronal capacity for plasticity following ketamine. While promotion of synaptic plasticity is tied to the antidepressant effects of ketamine, the lack of behavioral response to lithium and the lack of metabolic response to ketamine in the present study may indicate that ketamine's promotion of synaptic plasticity arrives via cellular mechanisms that do not directly engage mitochondria and/or glycolytic rate — perhaps instead involving the promotion of peripheral insulin and consequent moderation of insulin signaling (upregulation of mTOR and Akt phosphorylation) in the IL and PL, a regional mechanism of promoting antidepressant-like responsivity in the ACTH-pretreated model of TRD.

### Inhibiting cytosolic translation and autophagy improves health in mitochondrial disease [^37661716]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) disease therapies directed at intra-mitochondrial pathology are largely ineffective. Recognizing that RC dysfunction invokes pronounced extra-mitochondrial transcriptional adaptations, particularly involving dysregulated translation, we hypothesized that translational dysregulation is itself contributing to the pathophysiology of RC disease. Here, we investigated the activities, and effects from direct inhibition, of a central translational regulator (mTORC1) and its downstream biological processes in diverse genetic and pharmacological models of RC disease. Our data identify novel mechanisms underlying the cellular pathogenesis of RC dysfunction, including the combined induction of proteotoxic stress, the ER stress response and autophagy. mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin partially ameliorated renal disease in B6. Pdss2(kd/kd) mice with complexes I-III/II-III deficiencies, improved viability and mitochondrial physiology in gas-1(fc21) nematodes with complex I deficiency, and rescued viability across a variety of RC-inhibited human cells. Even more effective was probucol, a PPAR-activating anti-lipid drug that we show also inhibits mTORC1. However, directly inhibiting mTORC1-regulated downstream activities yielded the most pronounced and sustained benefit. Partial inhibition of translation by cycloheximide, or of autophagy by lithium chloride, rescued viability, preserved cellular respiratory capacity and induced mitochondrial translation and biogenesis. Cycloheximide also ameliorated proteotoxic stress via a uniquely selective reduction of cytosolic protein translation. RNAseq-based transcriptome profiling of treatment effects in gas-1(fc21) mutants provide further evidence that these therapies effectively restored altered translation and autophagy pathways toward that of wild-type animals. Overall, partially inhibiting cytosolic translation and autophagy offer novel treatment strategies to improve health across the diverse array of human diseases whose pathogenesis involves RC dysfunction.

### A rational mechanism for combination treatment of Huntington's disease using lithium and rapamycin [^a7cd61b0]. Human Molecular Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine expansion mutation in the huntingtin protein that confers a toxic gain-of-function and causes the protein to become aggregate-prone. Aggregate-prone proteins are cleared by macroautophagy, and upregulating this process by rapamycin, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), attenuates their toxicity in various HD models. Recently, we demonstrated that lithium induces mTOR-independent autophagy by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) and reducing inositol and IP3 levels. Here we show that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), another enzyme inhibited by lithium, has opposite effects. In contrast to IMPase inhibition that enhances autophagy, GSK3beta inhibition attenuates autophagy and mutant huntingtin clearance by activating mTOR. In order to counteract the autophagy inhibitory effects of mTOR activation resulting from lithium treatment, we have used the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in combination with lithium. This combination enhances macroautophagy by mTOR-independent (IMPase inhibition by lithium) and mTOR-dependent (mTOR inhibition by rapamycin) pathways. We provide proof-of-principle for this rational combination treatment approach in vivo by showing greater protection against neurodegeneration in an HD fly model with TOR inhibition and lithium, or in HD flies treated with rapamycin and lithium, compared with either pathway alone.

### Lithium augmentation of ketamine increases insulin signaling and antidepressant-like active stress coping in a rodent model of treatment-resistant depression [^de828ff9]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Lithium, a mood stabilizer and common adjunctive treatment for refractory depression, shares overlapping mechanisms of action with ketamine and enhances the duration of ketamine's antidepressant actions in rodent models at sub-therapeutic doses. Yet, in a recent clinical trial, lithium co-treatment with ketamine failed to improve antidepressant outcomes in subjects previously shown to respond to ketamine alone. The potential for lithium augmentation to improve antidepressant outcomes in ketamine nonresponders, however, has not been explored. The current study examined the behavioral, molecular and metabolic actions of lithium and ketamine co-treatment in a rodent model of antidepressant resistance. Male Wistar rats were administered adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 100µg/day, i.p. over 14 days) and subsequently treated with ketamine (10mg/kg; 2 days; n = 12), lithium (37mg/kg; 2 days; n = 12), ketamine+lithium (10mg/kg+37mg/kg; 2 days; n = 12), or vehicle saline (0.9%; n = 12). Rats were subjected to open field (6min) and forced swim tests (6min). Peripheral blood and brain prefrontal cortical (PFC) tissue was collected one hour following stress exposure. Western blotting was used to determine the effects of treatment on extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK); mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), phospho kinase B (Akt), and glycogen synthase kinase-3ß (GSK3ß) protein levels in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) subregions of the PFC. Prefrontal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) were also determined in anterior PFC tissue at rest and following stimulation with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Blood plasma levels of mTOR and insulin were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Overall, rats receiving ketamine+lithium displayed a robust antidepressant response to the combined treatment as demonstrated through significant reductions in immobility time (p < 0.05) and latency to immobility (p < 0.01). These animals also had higher expression of plasma mTOR (p < 0.01) and insulin (p < 0.001). Tissue bioenergetics analyses revealed that combined ketamine+lithium treatment did not significantly alter the respiratory response to BDNF or TNFα. Animals receiving both ketamine and lithium had significantly higher phosphorylation (p)-to-total expression ratios of mTOR (p < 0.001) and Akt (p < 0.01), and lower ERK in the IL compared to control animals. In contrast, pmTOR/mTOR levels were reduced in the PL of ketamine+lithium treated animals, while pERK/ERK expression levels were elevated. Taken together, these data demonstrate that lithium augmentation of ketamine in antidepressant nonresponsive animals improves antidepressant-like behavioral responses under stress, together with peripheral insulin efflux and region-specific PFC insulin signaling.

### Translational evidence for lithium-induced brain plasticity and neuroprotection in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders [^09929a37]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Lithium in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders

Neurodegenerative disorders: AD and PD and ALS/FTD

A growing body of evidence points to the neuroprotective effects of Li +. Subjects with BD administered with long-term Li + have a lower risk to develop dementia including AD. A meta-analysis study shows that Li + treatment significantly decreases cognitive decline as compared with placebo, thus indicating that Li + may be beneficial in promoting cognitive performance in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.

Li + may act at multiple steps within the biochemical cascades involved in the onset and progression of AD (Fig. 1). For instance, GSK-3β inhibition may counteract the pathological increased enzyme activity occurring in patients affected by MCI and AD. GSK-3β is involved in amyloidogenesis and tau phosphorylation, which at the preclinical level are inhibited by Li + administration. Again, Li + -induced autophagy may counteract autophagy suppression, which is expected in AD patients due to a progressive increase in mTOR activity during the disease course. Moreover, Li + promotes the synthesis and release of neurotrophic factors, in particular BDNF and VEGF whose increased availability protects neurons against neurotoxic insults, stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis, and increases synaptic plasticity. Indeed, BDNF polymorphisms were reported to moderate Aβ-related cognitive decline in preclinical AD, and BDNF reduces Aβ in the brain. However, a short half-life and inability to cross the blood–brain barrier impair the therapeutic potential of BDNF.

### Insulin-stimulated mTOR activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with early treatment response to lithium augmentation in rodent model of antidepressant-resistance [^d63cf377]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations and concluding remarks

In summary and consistent with previous studies, ACTH pre-treatment was found to block the immobility reducing effects of imipramine (10 mg/kg) in the FST. The effects of imipramine were rescued by the co-administration of lithium (100 mg/kg) in these animals. mTOR and Akt phosphorylation ratios were increased in the ILPFC of lithium-treated animals. Insulin stimulation (10 mg/mL for 5 min) of isolated PBMCs yielded some interesting differences in protein response. ACTH pretreated animals that received imipramine exhibited increased total p mTOR activation following insulin challenge. Augmentation with lithium normalized p mTOR levels, distinguishing responsive lithium-treated animals from those resistant to imipramine. Moreover, immobility duration was highly correlated with insulin-stimulated mTOR and p mTOR levels in lithium-treated animals' PBMCs. We propose that PBMC insulin challenge may be a useful probe for predicting antidepressant response to lithium, and potentially other therapies.

Lithium inhibits GSK3β both directly and indirectly (via Akt facilitation), which can have subsequent downstream effects on mTOR activity

Post-mortem human brain studies comparing unipolar MDD patients to healthy controls have demonstrated abnormalities in both mTOR and GSK3β levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Reduced levels of phosphorylated GSK3β have also been previously reported in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of bipolar patients, correlating with symptom severity. Additionally, Machado-Vieira and colleaguesreported lowered Akt1 and mTOR mRNA expression in the blood of bipolar patients during depressive episodes, where changes in Akt1 expression following lithium treatment were associated with clinical improvement.

Given that a direct and interdependent relationship exists between the neuroendocrine response to stress and energy regulation and metabolism, we propose that long-term aberrant HPA activity may impair metabolic functions under stress, contributing to poor antidepressant efficacy at the molecular and behavioral level. Such metabolic consequences may be particularly pertinent for antidepressant action in regions of the depression network known to be hypermetabolic, such as the infralimbic cortex (ILPFC). The ILPFC region of the medial PFC plays a critical role in regulating behavioral responses to stress, particularly in the FST. The ILPFC is considered to be the rodent homolog of Brodmann's area 25 (BA25) in humans. Notably, BA25 is metabolically overactive in patients with depression; and normalizing this metabolic disturbance has been associated with antidepressant responses across multiple modalities. Failure to normalize this metabolic hyperactivity through antidepressant treatment is, by contrast, associated with poor clinical outcomes in treatment-resistant depression.

### Insulin-stimulated mTOR activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with early treatment response to lithium augmentation in rodent model of antidepressant-resistance [^5615a28b]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

In this study, we have investigated but a few key proteins in a broad pathway; therefore more in depth investigation of related upstream and downstream targets is warranted for future studies. To our knowledge, this is the first time PBMC insulin-challenge has been used for the purpose of delineating cellular antidepressant response mechanisms, and its utility as a biomarker for brain and behavioral effects that predict treatment response warrants further investigation. First, it would be worthwhile investigating how other brain regions compare in their insulin signaling profile in ACTH animals. For example, the ILPFC and prelimbic PFC are known to have discrete and often contrasting functional roles (e.g.). It would be interesting to investigate whether distinct, or even inverse patterns of insulin signaling emerge across regions dependent on their relative activity during the FST paradigm. Second, it would be most interesting to evaluate whether a similar observation can be made in PBMCs of animals in response to other treatments, especially those dependent on mTOR activation — such as ketamine. We previously reported a divergent response to ketamine (10 mg/kg) in FST for ACTH animals, deemed responders/non-responders; in a differentiable cohort such as this we could appropriately assess whether PBMC mTOR challenge might predict FST behaviors. Finally, it is worth mentioning the significant clinical potential of this assay. In future, clinical researchers might assess whether findings such as these translate to patients receiving lithium augmentation therapy.

### Translational evidence for lithium-induced brain plasticity and neuroprotection in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders [^5eac42f3]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion, limitations, and conclusions

In the present manuscript, we focused on the therapeutic effects of Li + to highlight common mechanisms of action in different neuropsychiatric disorders. These mechanisms provide valuable information to help to understand the etiology of disorders on which they are involved and point to possible therapeutic developments. Li + modulates a number of biochemical pathways in the brain involved in neuroplasticity and neuroprotection.

Li + neuroprotective action relies on the modulation of several intracellular pathways involved in ER stress, mitochondrial function, Ca 2+ toxicity, UPR, and autophagy. The effects on the autophagy machinery remain the key molecular mechanisms to explain the protective effects of Li + for neurodegenerative diseases, which indicates how Li + exploits similar molecular machinery to modify the course of different disorders belonging to different domains.

Such molecular machinery may have a neuroprotective and neurotrophic action on AD and other degenerative dementias. In fact, upregulation of GSK-3β activity, which is inhibited by Li +, occurs in AD.

A failure of autophagy-dependent handling of misfolded proteins impedes the clearance of these substrates that accumulate within the cell. Therefore, a common pathogenesis underlying neurodegenerative disorders has been linked to autophagy inhibition due to mTOR activation. Common mechanisms are involved in Li + protective effects in neurodegenerative ALS/FTD disease as shown by significant improvement of motor function by treatment with Li + during the past two decades in clinical and preclinical studies.

Li + property to modulate autophagy offers potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and emphasizes a crossroad linking autophagy, neurodegenerative disorders, and mood stabilization (antimanic activity). Remarkably, the molecular events in the progression of mania concern neuroplastic mechanisms implicated in neurotransmission as well as mechanisms of neurodegeneration.

Sensitization being a neuroplastic process that is crucial in the pathogenesis of main affective disorders, even slight differences in the sensitization process between these disorders may help to identify why some of them are sensitive to Li +, which is the case of BD1. Sensitization by psychostimulants is driven by molecular pathways linked to DA transmission and points to a number of mechanisms involved in psychopathology, most also crucial in neurodegenerative disorders.

### Glycogen synthase kinase-3 and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways contribute to DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and proliferation in human islets [^1541d19f]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The focus of this study was to identify signaling pathways and potential therapeutic agents that would allow reproducible stimulation of DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and proliferation in human β-cells. We found that glucose, mTOR activity, and inhibition of GSK-3 together stimulated these regenerative processes in a highly reproducible manner in adult human β-cells regardless of sex, age, BMI, or isolation center.

Both LiCl and 1-Akp significantly enhanced DNA synthesis above that of 8 mmol/l glucose, and LiCl-mediated DNA synthesis was more sensitive to rapamycin than 1-Akp. This finding suggested that a component of 1-Akp–stimulated DNA synthesis in human islets is mTOR independent. Although lithium at higher concentrations decreased DNA synthesis in human islets, this did not appear to be due to apoptosis because cell cycle analysis (Fig. 3 A and B) failed to detect a significant degree of apoptosis under similar conditions. Mussmann et al. reported that lithium produces toxic effects at concentrations > 3 mmol/l in the cell line, INS-1E, but this is not the case in human or rodent islets. Our studies also determined that the increase in DNA synthesis induced by lithium and 1-Akp in human islets was not due to the effects of endogenous insulin through the insulin signaling pathway (Fig. 2 A).

### Neuron-specific isoform of PGC-1 α regulates neuronal metabolism and brain aging [^faf3acb8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

GSK3β plays an integrating role in growth regulation

Prior studies in suggested that growth and metabolism networks might be interconnected via the GSK3β/ PGC-1α axis, but the effect in primary neurons was not investigated. Here, treatment with LiCl resulted in higher levels of inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate -1 (IRS-1) in the phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K) binding domain (S632) and lower levels of activating phosphorylation of AKT (T308) and S6 ribosomal protein (S240) (Fig. 6A). These differences in post-translational modification are consistent with the repression of the insulin/IGF and mTOR Complex 1 signaling pathways. Although levels of activating phosphorylation of ERK1/2 were numerically higher in LiCl treated neurons the difference was not significant, arguing that some but not all aspects of growth regulation are responsive to lithium. These data and the activation of CREB and AMPK (Fig. 4C) place GSK3β at the center of an interwoven growth and metabolism regulatory network (Fig. 6B).

### Lithium as a disease-modifying agent for prion diseases [^7dabe9eb]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by multiple neuropathological hallmarks. Therefore, lithium could counteract some of the prion-induced alterations through its various effects and modulation of different signaling pathways. Several papers have described lithium as an autophagy-inducing drug, partly on the basis of the observation that in some cell culture models of HD and PD, lithium increases autophagy through GSK3β activity inhibition and mTOR activation. However, other studies demonstrated that lithium does not positively regulate autophagy in all pathological conditions. For instance, in cerebral ischemia and AD, lithium negatively regulates autophagy –. In our study, this could also be the case for the NP03-160 group where the number of LC3-II-positive cells was significantly diminished in the striatum. Only mice in the lithium-gavage group presented significantly increased levels of autophagy in the striatum, probably due to mTOR activation via GSK3β inactivation by high doses of lithium. On the other hand, no effect was observed in the NP03-40 group, possibly because the very low lithium dose administered did not have any effect on the autophagy-signaling pathway. Moreover, we did not observe any significant autophagy changes in the cortex in any of the three treatment groups, as previously reported in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alexander disease. The discrepancy between treatment groups and brain regions concerning lithium effects on autophagy is not surprising if we consider autophagy as a multistep cellular process that is dysregulated in the multifactorial prion diseases.

In NP03-160 mice, the significant autophagy reduction in the striatum could be correlated with the lower astrogliosis levels due to inactivation of STAT3, which is also considered as an autophagy regulator. In the cytoplasm, STAT3 interacts with the PKR kinase to inhibit eIF2a phosphorylation and reduce autophagy. Upon activation and nuclear translocation, STAT3 cannot interact with the PKR kinase, and this leads to eIF2A activation and autophagy induction. Therefore, lithium-induced inactivation of STAT3 in NP03-160 mice could lead to (i) decreased GFAP expression and (ii) autophagy reduction. In the other groups, where autophagy was increased while astrocyte numbers were reduced, autophagy might not be regulated by STAT3 but by other signaling pathways such as mTOR/GSK3β.

Figure 6 shows the multiple signaling pathways that could be modulated by lithium. These pathways are known to contribute to the amelioration of neuropathology, for instance, astrogliosis reduction through STAT3 inactivation, limitation of neuronal loss through activation of Wnt target genes, and autophagy activation by STAT3 or GSK3β.

### Multifaceted roles of GSK-3 and wnt / β-catenin in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis: opportunities for therapeutic intervention [^8084047b]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of inhibition of GSK-3 by lithium treatment has been examined in clinical trial with AML patients treated with cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin. This clinical study demonstrated that the percentage of AML patients with complete remission was significantly lower in those patients who received lithium (75% vs 49%). These results suggest that more potent GSK-3 inhibitors might have greater anticancer effects, at least with some cancers. However, there remains concern that inhibiting GSK-3 may promote the growth of certain cancer types.

Another mechanism by which GSK-3 may impair differentiation in AML is its interaction with the retinoic acid receptor (RAR).RAR is impaired by rearrangement in the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) subtype (acute PML), which is characterized by the translocation t(15;17), RARA-PML. APL can be differentiated and cured by the RAR ligand all- trans retinoic acid. GSK-3 can phosphorylate and inactivate RAR, and GSK-3 inhibition enhances the differentiation potential of all- trans retinoic acid even in non-APL AML.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that there are complex interactions between Akt and FOXO3 levels in maintaining LICs. Low levels of Akt were associated with elevated levels of Forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) that were required to maintain the functionality and immature status of the LICs. Decreased levels of FOXO3 promoted differentiation, maturation and apoptosis of the MLL-AF9 LICs and improved animal survival. Decreased levels of FOXO were associated with increased levels of JNK/c-Jun activation in the resistant leukemia cells that persisted despite reduced levels of FOXO. JNK inhibitors could potentiate the effects of Akt activation or FOXO3 depletion and induce differentiation of the AML LICs. The authors have suggested that mTORC1 and GSK-3β may provide important signals between Akt and FOXOs that abrogated the effects of FOXO suppression.

### Lithium augmentation of ketamine increases insulin signaling and antidepressant-like active stress coping in a rodent model of treatment-resistant depression [^f9ee5846]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Critical to ketamine's mechanism of action is the rapid upregulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and BDNF to promote neurotrophic signaling via activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 ß (GSK3ß). These molecular cascades, in turn, have been shown to functionally promote the development of new synaptic connections to enhance connectivity between mood-related brain regions. Lithium also activates this molecular pathway, which in addition to BDNF, is stimulated by other endogenous growth factors, including insulin. Consequently, lithium is a promising candidate for adjunctive treatment to ketamine and has shown potential as an augmentative agent for other antidepressant approaches for TRD. In a rodent model of TRD, lithium augmentation of imipramine was shown to promote central and peripheral insulin signaling, which was directly correlated with antidepressant behavioral response. Lithium, a monovalent cation is well-established to activate neuroprotective and neurotrophic cellular cascades, including the direct modulation of bioenergetic factors (i.e. increased insulin-like growth factor (IGF) expression, protection of mitochondrial health, cellular energy metabolism and antioxidant defense, and stimulation of neurotrophic molecular cascades (mTOR and GSK3ß)). Collectively, these actions work together to promote cell growth and antiapoptotic effects. Downstream of these mechanisms, both lithium and ketamine initiate neurotrophic cascades via activation of MAPK kinase (MEK)/extracellular-receptor kinase (ERK) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which provide bioenergetic stimuli for neural and synaptic plasticity, and play a critical role in enabling antidepressant response to ketamine.

Given the overlapping physiological impacts of these treatments, we have examined whether adjunctive lithium would enhance antidepressant response to ketamine, in a subset of ketamine nonresponsive rodents. Although the interactive effects of ketamine and lithium have been examined in prior research, this study is the first to investigate ketamine and lithium's additive antidepressant-like effects in a rat model of ketamine treatment resistance. We further characterize bioenergetic and neurotrophic biomarkers associated with antidepressant response outcomes.

### Insulin signaling as a therapeutic mechanism of lithium in bipolar disorder [^06f20234]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

We hypothesize that in a proportion of BD patients insulin resistance acts as a chronic stressor leading to impairment of PI3K/Akt insulin signaling in the brain. The resultant chronic overactivation of GSK3 and dysregulation of glucose metabolism in neurons leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and energy dysregulation, manifesting as manic or depressive symptoms. Lithium acts on several stages of the PI3K/Akt insulin signaling pathway to restore sensitivity to insulin, resulting in improvements in downstream glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function. The targets of lithium action discussed in this paper lie at the intersection of many signaling pathways and mechanisms which regulate metabolism, inflammation and immune response. There may therefore be a wide variety of immuno-metabolic stressors which play a role in BD onset in those who are genetically susceptible. Increased IR appears to be the most significant environmental shift which could explain increasing burden of disease of BD worldwide. This hypothesis merits further study since these pathways may be amenable to dietary and/or other therapeutic interventions as an adjunct to current treatments in BD.

It is now possible to assess neuronal insulin signaling using extracellular vesicles and a study in bipolar patients has established preliminary evidence for impaired PI3K/Akt insulin signaling. We suggest that future studies consider measuring biomarkers related to mitochondrial function and glucose metabolism (lactate, pyruvate, and citric acid cycle metabolites) as well as markers of insulin signaling (IRS, PI3K, Akt, GSK3β, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)) in neuronal-enriched extracellular vesicles to gain insight into the effects of lithium on insulin signaling. A recent randomized, quadruple-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial by Calkin et.al noted significant improvement of bipolar depression in patients given insulin sensitizer metformin over 26 weeks. Based on the high prevalence of IR in BD and the effects of lithium on key components of the PI3K/Akt insulin signaling pathway, insulin-sensitizing agents should be considered for further study in BD, both for their metabolic health effects and for their potential to stabilize mood.

Total and phosphorylated mTOR

A significant interaction effect was observed for mTOR across treatments (p = 0.0019; F = 10.94). Post hoc multiple comparisons revealed that ACTH-controls had significantly greater expression levels of mTOR compared to animals administered ketamine (p = 0.0186) (Fig. 3G). No significant main effects were observed for p mTOR (Fig. 3H). In contrast, a main effect for ketamine (p < 0.0001; F = 27.55) and lithium (p = 0.0017; F = 11:31) was observed for p mTOR/mTOR levels, together with a significant interaction effect (p = 0.0015; F = 11:50). Multiple comparisons revealed that relative to control animals the ratio of p mTOR/mTOR, indicative of mTOR activation, was significantly elevated in animals treated with ketamine (p < 0.0001), lithium (p = 0.0002), or the combination of ketamine with lithium (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3I).

Total and phosphorylated GSK3ß

When examining GSK3ß, a main interaction effect of treatment was observed (p < 0.0001; F = 27.16). Post hoc multiple comparisons revealed that ACTH-pretreated control animals had significantly higher GSK3ß compared to animals treated with ketamine (p = 0.001) and lithium (p = 0.003). Animals treated with the combination (ketamine + lithium) also exhibited significantly elevated levels of GSK3ß compared to animals treated only with ketamine (p = 0.0041) or lithium (p = 0.011) (Fig. 3J). An interaction main effect was also present for p GSK3ß (p = 0.0041; F = 9.149), with post hoc analyses revealing expression was significantly reduced in ketamine treated animals relative to controls (p = 0.0359), with a trend apparent relative to those animals co-treated with ketamine and lithium (p = 0.0543) (Fig. 3K). Similarly, an interaction main effect was present for p GSK3ß/GSK3ß (p = 0.0016; F = 11.52), with expression levels significantly increased in lithium treated animals relative to controls (p = 0.0133), and animals receiving the combination of ketamine and lithium (p = 0.011) (Fig. 3L).

### Neuron-specific isoform of PGC-1 α regulates neuronal metabolism and brain aging [^895170aa]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

GSK3β participates in various growth regulatory pathways, including Wnt, insulin/IGF, MAPK, and mTOR signaling. In mouse brains, GSK3β protein abundance increases with age, and one of the unexpected outcomes of this study was the impact of GSK3β inhibition on primary neurons and astrocytes. The repression of PGC-1α at the brain promoter in response to LiCl or GSK3β inhibitor VIII is opposite to what is observed at the canonical and alternate promoters in neurons and in other cell types where the brain promoter is not active. This raises the possibility that PGC-1α is part of a broader molecular strategy that allows different brain-resident cells to independently modulate cellular energetics in response to extracellular stimuli. The importance of GSK3β as a regulatory effector in central metabolism and growth signaling is underscored by the primary neuron and in vivo brain response to LiCl (neurons) and Li 2 CO 3 (mice). In the cortex, the changes in PGC-1α isoforms were not a straightforward linear response to increasing lithium dose and are likely to be highly influenced by the fact that (a) multiple cell types are represented in the RNASeq data and (b) that cells act as communities and engage in cross-talk in their response to a given stimulus, a feature that cannot be captured in isolated primary cells. It will be important to dissect how the neuronal PGC-1α response to GSK3β might be influenced by juxtacrine effects, particularly whether contributions from astrocytes and microglia might modify the response reported here for neurons in primary culture.

### Insulin-stimulated mTOR activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with early treatment response to lithium augmentation in rodent model of antidepressant-resistance [^f41d93d6]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

ILPFC insulin signaling upregulated in ACTH pre-treated rats administered adjunctive lithium

Here we assessed levels of insulin signaling proteins: mTOR, Akt, and GSK3β, as well as p Akt, p GSK3β, and p mTOR in the ILPFC, using Western blot. The ILPFC p Akt/Akt ratio was significantly elevated in lithium-treated ACTH animals. ILPFC p mTOR/mTOR ratios were significantly lower in ACTH animals administered vehicle saline, and were significantly elevated again in animals co-administered lithium. p mTOR and p Akt levels were significantly reduced in the ILPFC of ACTH pretreated animals administered imipramine alone; while animals co-administered lithium had similar levels of activation to the control saline groups.

ILPFC GSK3β levels were significantly lower in ACTH animals co-administered lithium and imipramine compared to those that received imipramine alone. While p GSK3β levels and pGSK3β/GSK3β ratio were very slightly elevated in lithium-treated animals, this effect was non-significant. As such, the expected pattern of increased phosphorylation (and deactivation) of GSK3β consistent with the purported mechanisms of lithium, was less evident. It is interesting that fewer significant differences or patterns emerged for GSK3β protein levels across treatment conditions, despite previous research establishing that lithium inhibits GSK3β activity, both directly and indirectly. It is important to note that lithium may not be acting exclusively via GSK3β given inhibition of inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) is an additional putative mechanism of lithium action that occurs independent of insulin signaling, yet contributes directly to therapeutic response. Further, other brain regions may show differential insulin signaling responses to lithium with respect to FST outcomes. For example, imipramine co-administered with lithium was previously reported to normalize cell proliferation in the hippocampus of ACTH pretreated animals. This effect was similarly associated with FST antidepressant efficacy, yet the effect of lithium on hippocampal GSK3 and/or IMPase function, and its contribution to these effects remains to be determined.

Nevertheless, lithium is known to inhibit GSK3β both directly (via competition with Mg 2+), and indirectly via Akt, promoting mTOR activation. The observed increased levels of mTOR and Akt phosphorylation in the ILPFC of lithium-treated animals are indeed consistent with insulin signaling pathway activation, and both Akt and mTOR activation have been implicated in treatment response previously, making them important candidates for further investigation.

### Translational evidence for lithium-induced brain plasticity and neuroprotection in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders [^c457ef8b]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Such an effect, which is overtly crucial in neurodegeneration, also applies to mood disorders since mitochondrial dysfunction is reported in bipolar patients.

Thus, even considering Li+ strong therapeutic effects on mood disorders, it is likely that autophagy takes a center stage in its antimanic and antidepressant action. This is not surprising when considering that a number of autophagy-inducing drugs, which are on-label with other therapeutic indications, possess mood-stabilizing effects (i.e. valproate, rapamycin). Similarly, the specific efficacy on mood disorders of a variety of psychotropic drugs may partly relate to autophagy-inducing effects.

### Glycogen synthase kinase-3 and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways contribute to DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and proliferation in human islets [^93288676]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) derives its name from its ability to phosphorylate glycogen synthase and to suppress glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle, but since this initial observation, a myriad of other GSK-3 targets have been identified. Two isoforms of GSK-3, α and β, exist and have overlapping functions. Lithium, an agent used as a mood stabilizer for decades, was first connected to GSK-3 inhibition for its ability to mimic Wnt signaling in Xenopus development. Lithium also inhibits inositol monophosphatase and other related phosphomonoesterases. Recently, more specific and potent small molecule GSK-3 inhibitors have been developed, of which 1-azakenpaullone (1-Akp) is among the most potent and selective.

Our previous studies demonstrated that glucose, leucine, cAMP, and modulation of ATP-sensitive K + (K ATP) channels stimulate mTOR-dependent DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in rat islets in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. In contrast to rat islets, human islets exhibited a variable response to these same stimuli, based on mTOR/S6K1 phosphorylation, and rarely increased DNA synthesis or entered the cell cycle. Because our previous studies on nutrient regulation of mTOR in rat islets identified a substantial dependence on mitochondrial metabolism, we extended our studies to nutrient metabolites. In preliminary experiments with the palmitate metabolite acetoacetate, we determined that the lithium component in commercially available acetoacetate salt significantly enhanced DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in rodent and human islets in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. These effects of lithium were consistent with earlier findings by Sjoholm et al. demonstrating that lithium triggered DNA synthesis in fetal rat islets, although the mechanism responsible for this effect was not identified. Here, we show that LiCl and the highly potent and specific GSK-3 inhibitor, 1-Akp, in combination with glucose, possess the ability to stimulate mTOR-dependent DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and proliferation of β-cells in human islets.

In this study, we sought to verify that lithium augmentation restores the antidepressant-like effects of imipramine in ACTH-pretreated animals as measured by the FST and to determine if such effects were associated with the expression of insulin signaling pathway proteins. ACTH pre-treatment is expected to block the typical immobility-reducing effects of imipramine in the FST, while a reduction in immobility duration and corresponding increase in active coping strategies, such as climbing is expected following co-administration of lithium and imipramine in ACTH animals.

Following behavioral experiments, we quantify levels of insulin signaling proteins (Akt, mTOR, and GSK3β) in the ILPFC. Consistent with clinical data described above, we expect protein expression in the ILPFC of ACTH animals to reflect a deficit in this signaling pathway, which will be rescued by imipramine when co-administered with lithium, but not when delivered as a monotherapy. Finally, we aim to affirm the potential for insulin-mediated signaling in PBMCs to serve both as a behaviorally relevant proxy marker of insulin signaling in the brain, and as a potential peripheral marker for early treatment response to lithium.

Roles of mTORC1

mTORC1 catalyzes its substrates and subsequent effectors, promoting the biosynthesis of lipids, proteins, nucleotides, and ATP; but reducing the autophagic breakdown of cellular components. mTORC1 has four major functions:

(1) Activation of 5′ cap-dependent translation and protein synthesis. mTORC1 tightly regulates 5′ cap-dependent translation and protein synthesis by phosphorylating p70S6 kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), an essential component of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) cap-binding complex. As a result of mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, eIF4E is released from the cap-binding complex, allowing 5′ cap-dependent translation of mRNAs and protein synthesis. mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K1 which subsequently acts on its substrate ribosomal protein S6, leading to phosphorylation of S6, an essential component of the 40S subunit. mTORC1-mediated S6K1 phosphorylation activates eIF4B, which enhances cap-dependent translation and protein synthesis.

(2) Promotion of lipid synthesis and accumulation. mTORC1 promotes lipid synthesis and accumulation primarily through two axes involving two transcription factors: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1/2 (SREBP1/2). mTORC1 promotes the translocation of PPARγ and SREBP1/2 to the nucleus where these transcription factors up-regulate the expression of genes that encode lipid synthesis.

(3) Enhancement of glycolysis and energy production. mTORC1 directly activates transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), through which it enhances glycolysis to alter the metabolic fate of glucose, and to facilitate energy production via oxidative phosphorylation.

(4) Suppression of autophagy. mTORC1 plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of autophagy through two effectors, autophagy-related protein 13 (ATG13) and unc-51-like autophagy-activating kinase 1 (ULK1) that are required for the formation of autophagosomes. mTOR, by phosphorylating ULK1 and ATG13, suppresses autophagy.

Roles of mTORC2

Compared to mTORC1, mTORC2 is poorly understood; its direct effectors and substrates remain largely unknown. mTORC2 phosphorylates protein kinases in the AGC kinase family, consisting of members of cAMP-dependent protein kinases A, cGMP-dependent protein kinases G, and phospholipid-dependent protein kinases C [e.g. Akt, also known as protein kinase B (PKB); and protein kinase C (PKC)]. mTORC2 phosphorylates the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt on Ser473, and exerts a central role in the regulation of glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism.

### Mechanical loading and hyperosmolarity as a daily resetting cue for skeletal circadian clocks [^5b87266f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

PLD2-mTORC2-AKT-GSK3β as a convergent pathway for loading- and hyperosmolarity- induced clock resetting

Based on the IPA analysis we selected several candidate pathways for further analysis. Pharmacological inhibition of pathways such as cAMP/CREB, calcium channels, Rho/ROCK, p38 and ERK failed to block clock responses in tissues to osmolarity and mechanical loading (Fig. S8-S11). One pathway that featured prominently in Upstream Regulators analysis was mTOR (Fig. 4l). Therefore, we tested two mTOR inhibitors, Torin1 (blocking both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complex) and Rapamycin (primarily blocking mTORC1). While Torin1 completely blocked the increase in amplitude following hyperosmotic challenge in cartilage and IVD explants, Rapamycin had no effect (Fig. 5a, b), indicating involvement of mTORC2. AKT is a known phosphorylation target of mTORC2and can be activated by hyperosmolarity in renal cells. Indeed, pre-treatment of cartilage explants with an AKT inhibitor prevented the increase in circadian amplitude following hyperosmotic challenge (Fig. 5c). Western blotting showed an increase in phosphorylation of AKT at the mTORC2 site 8 h after an increase in osmolarity. Pre-treatment with Torin1 but not with rapamycin prevented this phosphorylation (Fig. 5d and Fig. S12). AKT is a known upstream regulator of GSK3β activity, a key clock-regulating kinase implicated in the regulation of the stability and/or nuclear translocation of PER2, CRY2, CLOCK, REV-ERBα and BMAL1. Indeed, inhibition of GSK3β activity by lithium had a synchronizing effect on IVD clocks similar to that of hyperosmolarity (Fig. 5e). Concordantly, hyperosmotic challenge increased GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9 and Ser389 (corresponding to reduced activity) (Fig. 5f). Pre-treatment with Torin1 (but not Rapamycin) or an AKT inhibitor decreased GSK3β phosphorylation at Ser9 and Ser389 following hyperosmotic challenge (Fig. 5f and Fig. S10). We next verified whether the above mechanisms were also involved in clock resetting by mechanical loading. Pre-treatment with the mTORC2 or AKT inhibitor (but not Rapamycin) completely blocked the mechanical loading-induced increase in circadian clock amplitude (Fig. 5g, h, Fig. S10). Consistent with our findings, mechanical strain in mesenchymal stem cells initiates a signaling cascade that is uniquely dependent on mTORC2 activation and phosphorylation of AKT at Ser-473, an effect sufficient to cause inactivation of GSK3β.

### Metabolic plasticity: an evolutionary perspective on metabolic and circadian dysregulation in bipolar disorder [^e9018d16]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The PI3K/Akt pathway and downstream targets encompass several mechanisms of central interest to bipolar disorder research including the primary targets of Lithium: the phosphatidylinositol cycle and GSK3β, as well as closely interlinked metabolic mechanisms Akt, mTOR and AMPK. The phosphatidylinositol cycle is a focus of significant research into the mechanism of action of Lithium and generates second messengers such as diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (PIP3) which are important mediators of insulin signaling to diverse metabolic systems. In response to insulin stimulation, PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphonate (PIP2) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate (PIP3) which activates Akt. In turn Akt phosphorylates Ser21 of GSK3α and Ser9 of GSK3β resulting in inhibition of GSK3β. This pathway connects metabolic status to environmental and nutritional signals mediated by insulin. Lithium also leads to inhibition of GSK3β through competitive inhibition at the binding site of the GSK3 cofactor magnesium. We have proposed that the effects of lithium may therefore be partly explained through its effects on insulin signalling pathways and have noted that lithium has demonstrated effects on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. A recent study reported findings supporting this perspective in neurons derived from bipolar patients. The study reported that lithium upregulated the insulin signalling Akt pathway in neurons from lithium responsive bipolar patients and that an activator of Akt reproduced similar effects to Lithium in reducing hyperexcitability in BD neurons.

### Mechanistic / mammalian target of rapamycin and side effects of antipsychotics: insights into mechanisms and implications for therapy [^aac55a4d]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

mTORC1 is found in multiple subcellular locations, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mammalian mTORC2 was first reported in 2004, and its different versions have different subcellular locations. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate cellular processes and differences as shown in Fig. 1. mTORC1 is better understood than mTORC2, primarily because of studies utilizing rapamycin, a natural compound that inhibits the yeast homolog of mTORC1 but not that of mTORC2. However, rapamycin inhibits the assembly of mTORC2 in mammals; consequently, rapamycin therapy may suppress both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in humans.

mTOR signaling pathway in the maintenance of metabolic and energy homeostasis

More than two decades of research have yielded substantial evidence of critical roles of the mTOR signaling pathway in the maintenance of metabolic and energy homeostasis. Following activation of mTOR, cells enter into a growth mode, in which mTORC1 and mTORC2 orchestrate a wide range of diverse functions during embryonic development, aging, and diseases (e.g. cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders) by initiating biosynthetic cascades. Here, we review the distinct roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2.

### Translational evidence for lithium-induced brain plasticity and neuroprotection in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders [^3147b576]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Methamphetamine (METH), as well as other psychostimulants, commonly produces psychoses with positive symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia. Such an effect makes METH use/abuse to be commonly considered as an experimental model of schizophrenia. High pre-synaptic DA synthesis and release are peculiar of schizophrenia; likewise, the psychostimulant effects of METH rely on increased DA synthesis and massive DA release within limbic and dorsal striatal areas, as well as abnormal stimulation of postsynaptic DA receptors (DARs), mainly the D1 subtype (D1Rs). On the other hand, schizophrenic patients are oversensitive and overresponsive to AMPHs.

METH dysregulates a number of susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, such as DISC1, NRG1/ErbB4, and CRMP2, which are known to be involved in the regulation of presynaptic DA release or post synaptic D1R-related cascades. Noteworthy, they all converge on mTOR signaling, thus abnormal stimulation of D1Rs activates significantly mTOR, which inhibits the autophagy machinery. This suggests that altered mTOR and impaired autophagy pathway represent a common hub between psychostimulant-induced neuroplasticity and schizophrenia.

Mean levels of total protein, phosphorylated protein, and ratio of phosphorylated:total for Akt (a – c), mTOR (d – f), and GSK3β (g – i) in the ILPFC by treatment group, as measured by Western blot (n = 7–12 per group). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M; ✱ p < 0.05; ✱✱ p < 0.01, ✱✱ p < 0.001

No significant main effect of treatment was observed for p GSK3β: F (4,50) = 0.3817, p = 0.82; or GSK3β: F (4,47) = 2.535, p = 0.0524. Closer inspection of GSK3β data however, indicated post-tests were appropriate. Post-tests unveiled a significant reduction in GSK3β for ACTH animals co-administered lithium compared to those that received imipramine alone (p = 0.034) (see Fig. 4g).

The Brown–Forsythe test for homogeneity of variance was significant for p Akt/Akt: F (4,44) = 5.841, p < 0.001; p mTOR/mTOR, F (4,48) = 5.442, p = 0.001; and p GSK3β/GSK3β: F (4,42) = 4.1, p = 0.007. Kruskal–Wallis one-way tests indicated significant main effects for pAkt/Akt: H (4) = 10.94, p = 0.027; p mTOR/mTOR: H (4) = 16.75, p = 0.002; but not p GSK3β/GSK3β: H (4) = 5.055, p = 0.282. Dunn's post-tests indicated significant group differences for p Akt/Akt and p mTOR/mTOR, shown in Fig. 4c and f, respectively.

### Gene-gene interaction of glycogen synthase kinase 3-β and serotonin transporter on human antidepressant response to sleep deprivation [^957352a2]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3-β) is involved in the control of cell behavior and in the mechanism of action of lithium and serotonergic antidepressants, and in humans a promoter variant (rs334558*C) was associated with reduced activity and better antidepressant response. The short form of a polymorphism in the promoter in the serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR) has been consistently associated with worse antidepressant response. In animals the knockout of GSK3-β counteracts the depressive-like behavioral effects of 5-HT inhibition.

Methods

With a translational approach, we studied the effect of 5-HTTLPR and rs334558 on antidepressant response to sleep deprivation in a unique sample of 122 patients affected by a major depressive episode in course of bipolar disorder. Mood was self rated on Visual Analog Scales, and severity of depression was rated on Montgomery-Asberg rating scale.

Results

We observed a triple interaction of 5-HTTLPR, rs334558 and treatment on severity of depression. While among rs334558 T/T homozygotes the best antidepressant response was associated with 5-HTTLPR l/l homozygosity, among the rs334558 C carriers the 5-HTTLPR s/s showed the best response to treatment.

Conclusions

A gene promoter polymorphism which reduces the activity of GSK3-β counteracts the detrimental influence of the short form of the 5-HT promoter on antidepressant response. A key component of Wnt pathway, and upstream of the mTOR signaling cascade, GSK3-β influences synaptic plasticity and cell resilience. Gene-gene interactions between components of the monoaminergic signal transduction pathways and of plasticity related pathways can shape the individual antidepressant response.

Total and phosphorylated Akt

When examining total Akt, a significant treatment interaction effect observed (p = 0.0087; F = 7.582), however lithium main effect was not significant (p = 0.0714; F = 3.42). Post hoc analyses revealed levels of Akt were significantly higher in ketamine and lithium co-treated animals relative to those only treated with ketamine (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3D). When examining p Akt expression, a significant main effect was observed for ketamine (p = 0.0006; F = 13.64), together with a significant treatment interaction (p = 0.0077; F = 7.815). Post hoc tests demonstrated the animals receiving both ketamine and lithium exhibited significantly higher levels of p Akt relative to control saline (p = 0.0358) and ketamine (p = 0.0003) treated groups (Fig. 3E). When examining the ratio of p Akt to Akt, a main effect of lithium (p = 0.006; F = 8.374) and ketamine (p = 0.0154; F = 6.373) treatment was observed. Post hoc multiple comparisons revealed that ACTH pretreated animals receiving both ketamine and lithium had significantly greater p Akt/Akt compared to those animals receiving only vehicle (p = 0.0025) (Fig. 3F).

### The contribution of mTOR to the immunopathology of bipolar disorder [^4e5bf96b]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2025). Medium credibility.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has a role in immune regulation and neuroplasticity within the brain, influencing various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder. mTOR signaling, via two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, modulates immune responses by regulating microglial activation, cytokine production, and T-cell function. Dysregulation of these pathways leads to neuroinflammation, a hallmark of several neurological conditions. In bipolar disorder, mTOR affects neuroplasticity by modulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and synaptic remodeling, essential for mood stabilization. Reduced mTOR signaling during depressive episodes and increased activity during manic phases have been observed, with potential links to the cognitive and emotional deficits characteristic of bipolar disorder. This review aims to compile the contribution of mTOR signaling to the immunopathology of bipolar disorder, focusing on its role in immune modulation, neuroinflammation, and neuroplasticity.

### Insulin-stimulated mTOR activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with early treatment response to lithium augmentation in rodent model of antidepressant-resistance [^78b30dba]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Lithium has been shown to have some therapeutic efficacy as an adjunctive treatment for intractable forms of major depression. Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) have been implicated in its putative mechanisms of action. These proteins are integral components of the insulin signaling pathway, which may serve as a critical co-regulator of drug action. Utilizing an animal model of tricyclic antidepressant resistance, we investigated the relationship between insulin signaling and antidepressant response to lithium augmentation. Pre-treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH 100 µg/day i.p.) for 14 days effectively blocked the immobility-reducing effects of an acute dose of imipramine (10 mg/kg i.p.) in the forced swim test (FST). Lithium augmentation (100 mg/kg i.p.) rescued the antidepressant-like effects of imipramine in this model. Total and phosphorylated (p) levels of protein kinase B (Akt), mTOR, and GSK3β protein were quantified in the infralimbic cortex (ILPFC) following FST stress via Western blot. Levels of mTOR and p mTOR were further quantified in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following insulin stimulation (10 mg/mL for 5 min) via ELISA. Elevated levels of phosphorylated insulin signaling proteins were present in the ILPFC of ACTH-pretreated animals that received both imipramine and lithium, together with a concurrent increase in mTOR activation in PBMCs. Large correlations were observed between immobility time and insulin-stimulated mTOR levels in PBMCs. We propose that PBMC insulin challenge may be a useful probe for predicting antidepressant response to lithium administration, and potentially other therapies acting via similar mechanisms of action.

### Lithium as a disease-modifying agent for prion diseases [^ab2adde7]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 6
Schematic representation of the signaling pathways implicated in the improvement of the neuropathology following treatment with NP03-lithium in C57BL/6J mice inoculated with ME7 prion-infected brain homogenates.

Lithium (Li) inhibits the activation of the transcription factor STAT3, a regulator of GFAP transcription and astrogliogenesis. This pathway explains the decrease of astrogliosis in mice following treatment with lithium. Lithium also restores Wnt/β-catenin signaling that is impaired in prion diseases (PrP Sc) through inactivation of GSK3β. This leads to transcription activation of Wnt target genes, and consequently to the limitation of neuronal loss. Lithium also increases autophagy by activation of mTOR via inactivation of GSK3β. Autophagy regulation is also affected by STAT3 activation that disrupts the interaction with PKR kinase, resulting in eIF2A activation and subsequently induction of autophagy

Altogether, these results demonstrated that the Aonys ® NP03-lithium formulation ameliorates the neuropathology in prion models even at late stages of the disease. These results are very encouraging because the low doses of lithium delivered through the Aonys ® formulation were as or even more effective than the conventional high dose of lithium. Therefore, lithium delivered with the advanced NP03 formulation could be suitable for chronic treatment, while avoiding lithium-related toxicity and could help to overcome problems with toxic overdosing in human therapy.

### IP3 accumulation and / or inositol depletion: two downstream lithium's effects that may mediate its behavioral and cellular changes [^aaf3e983]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Li has been shown to induce autophagy in an mTOR-independent manner accompanied by reduced IP 3 levels, both reversed by inositol supplementation. Rapamycin and trehalose, autophagy inducers, have recently been shown to induce an antidepressant-like decreased immobility in the FST. Our results indicate that similarly to Li-treated WT mice and IMPA1 KO mice (data submitted for publication), IP 3 administration upregulated hippocampal but not frontal cortex BECN1 mRNA levels 45 min after the administration and elevated Beclin-1/p62 protein level ratio both in the hippocampus and frontal cortex 24 h following the administration. Simplistically, these results contradict those of Sarkar et al.who showed that decreased, rather than elevated, IP 3 levels promote autophagy. However, it is conceivable that the high dose of IP 3 that we administered resulted in desensitization of the IP 3 Rs, which have previously been shown to inhibit autophagy by binding Beclin-1. Thus, similarly to decreased IP 3 levels, IP 3 administered ICV led to changes in autophagy markers indicative of enhanced autophagy. Multiple reviews (for example, Morris et al. Scheuing et al. and Motoi et al.) hypothesize the beneficial effects of Li treatment in neurodegenerative disorders based on the reports in animal models and cells in culture of Li-induced enhanced autophagy as a mechanism of the drug's neuroprotective characteristic (for example, Fornai et al. Fabrizi et al. and Sarkar et al.). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no clinical studies where Li's effect on autophagy was assessed in relation to clinical efficacy.

The fact that the Beclin-1/p62 protein level ratio was elevated 24 h but not 45 min following IP 3 administration suggests that IP 3 -induced Li-like changes in the levels of autophagy-related proteins occur in parallel rather than upstream to IP 3 -induced Li-like behaviors. However, as demonstrated by Vicencio et al.in addition to the role of IP3 3 Rs as ion channels, they also function as scaffold proteins for the interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl2, an interaction that inhibits Beclin-1-induced autophagy. If IP 3 administration indeed leads to desensitization and internalization of IP 3 Rs, reduced availability of IP 3 Rs would result in decreased interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl2, and in enhanced autophagy without affecting Beclin-1 levels. Hence, we cannot unequivocally rule out the possibility that 45 min following IP 3 administration autophagy was increased but not reflected in an increased beclin1/p62 ratio.

### Metabolic plasticity: an evolutionary perspective on metabolic and circadian dysregulation in bipolar disorder [^81bdb165]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)

AMPK is a regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, activated under conditions of low energy (high AMP/ATP ratio) and plays a significant role in the metabolic adaptation to states of metabolic depression. AMPK promotes energy conservation by inhibiting anabolic processes (e.g. via mTOR suppression) and enhancing catabolic pathways such as fatty acid oxidation. During hibernation phosphorylation of AMPK is enhanced throughout the brain indicating a role of AMPK mediated metabolic adaptation. AMPK is also intricately interlinked with circadian mechanisms facilitating seasonal adaptation, modulating clock component cryptochrome 1 (CRY1). In bipolar disorder, cerebral AMPK activity is implicated in neuronal excitability. In a recent study an AMPK activator reduced hyperexcitability in lithium responsive neurons and this effect was mediated by Akt signalling, implicating the insulin signalling pathway. There are some early indications that modulating AMPK may be beneficial in psychiatric conditions. For example, an RCT of metformin in bipolar patients - an activator of AMPK - reported improvements in metabolic and psychiatric symptoms alongside reversal of insulin resistance.

AMPK is a critical regulator of metabolic adaptation in torpor and hibernation and emerging evidence indicates a role in neuronal excitability and mood regulation in bipolar disorder. During episodes of depression, which often peak in winter, AMPK overactivation may mimic energy-conserving states, leading to reduced neuronal activity and anhedonia.

### Lithium response in bipolar disorder is associated with focal adhesion and PI3K-akt networks: a multi-omics replication study [^dd67e97f]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic psychiatric illness that presents with episodes of mania, depression, and sometimes psychosis. Globally, it is the sixth leading cause of medical disability among people from 15 to 44 years old. Patients with BD are at a higher risk of suicide than those with any other psychiatric or medical illness. Some studies report that roughly 50% of patients will attempt suicide, and up to 20% of untreated patients will complete suicide, while treatment by lithium reduces that risk significantly. Unfortunately, misdiagnosis is common and often delays an accurate treatment. Up to 70% of patients are initially misdiagnosed, usually with major depressive disorder. On average, there is a delay of 8 years before the correct diagnosis of BD is made. During this time, patients continue to suffer, may be treated with medications that make their illness course worse, and are at risk of suicide.

Lithium is the gold standard treatment for BD. Its mechanism of action is still not completely understood. Many studies have investigated the neurotrophic effect of lithium. One theory posits that chronic administration of lithium inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3β), a serine/threonine kinase. This leads to anti-apoptotic effects and improved cell structural stability. GSK3β has also been shown to exhibit interactions with many pathways, including phosphorylation of several components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling network, as well as regulation of transcription for proteins bound to microtubules. Another theory involves the phosphoinositol (PI) cycle. In the PI cycle, lithium inhibits inositol monophosphatase, which ultimately downregulates protein kinase C isozymes such as myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS). MARCKS is an actin-binding protein found in neuronal processes that is implicated in cytoskeletal restructuring. Its downregulation stabilizes the neuronal membrane and results in neurotrophic effects. A more recent theory proposes that lithium alters the phosphorylation state of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2). CRMP2 regulates cytoskeletal organization, particularly in dendritic spines. Finally, a study using polygenic score modeling has indicated that the cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways may potentially serve as targets for lithium. It is possible that lithium exerts its effects through multiple or all of these pathways. A single definitive model remains elusive, but interactions with neuronal cytoskeleton are possibly involved.

### Translational evidence for lithium-induced brain plasticity and neuroprotection in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders [^bc4db2bd]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

METH impairs the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) activity, which is largely dependent on DA. Proteasome regulates DA presynaptic release and receptors and postsynaptic DARs. Activation of DAD2 receptor subtype (D2Rs) contributes to the expression of DA-dependent METH-induced behavioral alterations also via a signaling complex composed of β-arrestin 2 (β-arr2), AKT, and protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), which activates GSK-3β.

Li + is a direct inhibitor of GSK-3 and also inhibits GSK-3 activity in the cell through an indirect mechanism that involves Akt activation. Li + 's ability to disrupt β-arr2-mediated Akt/GSK-3 signaling contributes to suppressing the behavioral effects of enhanced DA transmission (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Lithium, amphetamine-related sensitization, and cell-clearing systems.

Lithium inhibits IMPase and IPPase, as well as PKC and GSK3β, which are triggered downstream of dopamine GPCRs. This results in reduced production and phospho-tau/misfolded proteins and the rescue of cell-clearing systems, which are impaired by mTOR hyperactivation placed downstream of D1 DA receptors and/or by abnormal amounts of phospho-tau. At the same time, lithium disassembles the GSK3-β-activating proteins β-ARR and PP2A from the complex they form with GPCRs/AKT meanwhile targeting them for degradation by the cell-clearing systems. In this way, lithium adjusts dopamine imbalances that occur following psychostimulant intake/administration and abnormal activation of GPCRs and related downstream signaling pathways.

### Metabolic plasticity: an evolutionary perspective on metabolic and circadian dysregulation in bipolar disorder [^9852edb0]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

The emerging field of metabolic psychiatry has brought mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction into focus in bipolar disorder research. In this manuscript, we propose that the metabolic features of bipolar disorder provide a new vector from which to understand the role of circadian dysfunction in this condition. A notable feature of bipolar disorder is the photoperiod driven, seasonal occurrence of symptoms and episodes mediated by circadian systems, with mania occurring more frequently in the spring and autumn at times of rapid rate of change in photoperiod, and depression being more prevalent in the winter when photoperiod is attenuated. In this manuscript we note that seasonal adaptations in metabolism are highly conserved evolutionary traits across diverse taxa. Several of the underlying mechanisms mediating seasonal changes in metabolism are conserved in human biology and are implicated in bipolar disorder pathophysiology. Such mechanisms encompass targets of lithium involved in insulin signaling (the phosphatidylinositol cycle, GSK3β and Akt), clock genes (CLOCK and BMAL1), targets of psychiatric and metabolic medications (mTOR and AMPK) and hormonal signaling (melatonin and cortisol). We propose that bipolar disorder may represent a dysregulation of conserved mechanisms of chronometabolic regulation and provide a discussion of the evolutionary context of such mechanisms. Genetic predisposition coupled to novel environmental inputs to human biology including artificial light at night and sustained refined sugar and carbohydrate intake may contribute to states of metabolic and circadian dysregulation in bipolar disorder underlying episodes of mania and depression.

### Epileptogenesis in tuberous sclerosis complex-related developmental and epileptic encephalopathy [^152eac26]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Cannabidiol

CBD has broad spectrum anticonvulsive efficacy in animal model of seizures and epilepsy (including acute pentylenetetrazol and maximal electroshock for generalized seizures, acute pilocarpine and penicillin for focal seizures, audiogenic model of genetic epilepsy, chronic lithium-pilocarpine for generalized epilepsy and Scn1a +/− for developmental and epileptic encephalopathy). Additionally, CBD has improved survival and behavioural comorbidity outcomes in a mouse model of Dravet syndromeand in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy.

The mechanism of action of CBD remains to be fully elucidated. CBD has very poor affinity for CB1 receptors and lacks euphoric side effects, and no direct effects seem to be mediated via cannabinoid receptors. CBD is hypothesized to act at a synaptic level by reducing excitatory neurotransmission through at least three possible mechanisms: blocking GPR55 receptors, desensitization of TRPV1 channels or inhibition of ENT1 adenosine reuptake pumps.

Other potential mechanisms for CBD in epilepsy include the reduction of signalling in the mTOR pathway observed in zebrafish. Different effects of CBD on signalling within the mTOR pathway have been reported across diverse experimental models. This may suggest a potential pro-homeostatic mechanism for CBD, whereby it counteracts the disease-associated perturbation in mTOR signalling.

Everolimus

Everolimus, a derivative of rapamycin (sirolimus), is a potent mTOR inhibitor. Its major effects are related to immunosuppression and antiangiogenic properties, and it was first approved as an immunosuppressant to prevent the rejection of organ transplants.

Everolimus acts only on the mTORC1 protein and not on the mTORC2 protein. It binds with high affinity to the FK506 binding protein-12 (FKBP-12), forming a drug complex that can inhibit the activation of mTOR, resulting in inhibition of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation.

Reduction of neuronal excitability by everolimus (the antiepileptic activity) is mediated by a prolonged opening of Ca 2+ and K + channels, via an increased expression of K v 1.1 in cortical and hippocampal neurons and reduced expression of AMPA receptors. Everolimus also has some neuroprotective activities exerted via the modulation of synaptic plasticity, regulation of neuronal death and regulation of neurogenesis. Chronic treatment leads to changes in synaptic membranes, with reduced excitability and increased GABA-mediated synaptic activity.

### Dynamic insulin-stimulated mTOR / GSK3 signaling in peripheral immune cells: preliminary evidence for an association with lithium response in bipolar disorder [^2f222523]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A key mechanism of lithium is the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), two contributors to insulin signaling. We explored the relationship between these markers and clinical response to lithium in bipolar disorder (BD).

Methods

Thirty-four subjects with BD who had been taking lithium for ≥ 2 years and had a maintenance lithium Alda score defined as either high (≥ 7; n = 20) or low (≤ 2; n = 14) were included in the study. Baseline protein expression of GSK3β and mTOR (total and phosphorylated (p)) was obtained from a buffy coat. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a subset of each group (n = 11) were stimulated with insulin (10 µg) and change in protein expression was determined using Western blot.

Results

In buffy coat samples, significantly higher levels of pmTOR were present in subjects with an Alda score ≤ 2 (lithium non-responsive), relative to those with scores ≥ 7 (lithium-responsive). No differences were observed for pGSK3β. In contrast, functional PBMC responses to 5 min of insulin stimulation demonstrated robust increases in pGSK3β (87.05 ± 43.41%) and pmTOR (105.7 ± 66.48%) in the lithium responsive group only. This contrasted observed decreases in pGSK3β (34.08 ± 16.12%) and pmTOR (37.84 ± 14.39%) 5 mins post-insulin in non-responders.

Conclusions

Dynamic increases in pmTOR and pGSK3β post-insulin stimulation may reflect an immunometabolic state that facilitates lithium response. Further prospective analyses are needed to replicate and extend these preliminary findings and further investigate the role of insulin signaling in lithium response in BD.

### Genomics of lithium action and response [^2737b427]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Archetypal Mediators of Lithium's Therapeutic Effects

In terms of lithium's therapeutic action, there are a number of classically studied proteins and pathways that are definitive lithium targets. These have been reviewed extensively elsewhere; only 2 will be briefly summarized here. First is lithium's known inhibition of the protein GSK3β. This protein is a component of the WNT signaling pathway, inhibition of which allows the accumulation of β-catenin protein and consequent downstream gene regulation. GSK3β also regulates other proteins (e.g. arrestins) and is itself regulated by other pathways (e.g. Akt). Second, an excess of inositol is believed to be a biochemical pathology in bipolar disorder affecting multiple cellular systems, including mitochondrial function, autophagy, growth cone function, and calcium signaling. Lithium depletes this excess signaling by directly inhibiting inositol monophosphatase 1 — diverting the metabolic pathway that generates inositol.

### Lithium augmentation of ketamine increases insulin signaling and antidepressant-like active stress coping in a rodent model of treatment-resistant depression [^888fb49c]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Lithium, a commonly prescribed mood stabilizer, may be useful for clinicians as an augmentative tool to improve antidepressant outcomes to ketamine. Here, we have presented evidence in support of the potential for lithium to enable antidepressant response to ketamine in a rodent model of TRD, using a cohort primarily nonresponsive to ketamine alone. Moreover, we present important new data demonstrating that, in combination, these treatments upregulated insulin signaling in the IL, indicating that this may be an important molecular therapeutic target. These results hold promise for clinical application and highlight the need to move forward with individualized target engagement studies that will enable progress towards precision medicine for psychiatry. By enabling individualized targeting of key rate limiting molecular mechanism, this approach has the potential to reshape our understanding of TRD, suggesting that failed drug efficacy may have more to do with misalignment of drug target with physiology. The capacity to enable response to the rapid acting antidepressant actions of ketamine in otherwise 'treatment resistant' individuals, remains an important goal for future research.

Drug Interactions

Neprilysin Inhibitors:

Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema.

Interactions Common for Both Benazepril and Hydrochlorothiazide

Potassium Supplements and Potassium -Sparing Diuretics: Concomitant use with Lotensin HCT may effect potassium levels. Monitor potassium periodically.

mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor s: Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS).

Lithium: Renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides and increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Monitor lithium levels when used concomitantly with Lotensin HCT.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual Blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypertension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on Lotensin HCT and other agents that affect the RAS.

### Rapamycin: one drug, many effects [^93a4cd82]. Cell Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Deregulation of the mTOR pathway has been implicated in a number of human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, neurological diseases, and genetic disorders. Rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, has been shown to be useful in the treatment of certain diseases. Here we discuss its mechanism of action and highlight recent findings regarding the effects and limitations of rapamycin monotherapy and the potential utility of combination therapy with rapamycin.

### Lithium: a potential therapeutic strategy in obsessive-compulsive disorder by targeting the canonical WNT / β pathway [^508702c8]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Glutamate excitotoxicity has been associated with the upregulation of Bax and p53 and the downregulation of Bcl-2. The apoptosis attributed to glutamate was preceded by the increase in activator protein-1 (AP-1) caused by the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and phosphorylation of c-Jun and p53.

By inhibiting GSK-3β activity, lithium acts as a powerful regulator of EAAT3 and thus of the regulation of NMDA receptors. Moreover, a direct potential way could be the inhibition of presynaptic NMDA receptors and thus the activation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors by the release of glutamate. This mechanism is followed by the activation of the influx of calcium and secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Lithium stimulated the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, from cerebral cortex slices. This release was accompanied by an increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5) P 3] accumulation. The increase in Ins(1,4,5) P 3 accumulation was caused by the selective activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor/channel by glutamate. Activation of the NMDA receptor is known to cause increased Ins(1,4,5) P 3 accumulation. Thus, BDNF stimulates the receptor tyrosine kinase B (TrkB), leading to neuronal survival and differentiation.

Activated BDNF-TrkB signaling leads to stimulation of the Akt/mTOR pathway, causing activation of the WNT/β-catenin pathway and enhancing synaptic proteins. The few therapeutic levels of lithium activate the BDNF-TrkB signaling and then the Akt/mTOR signaling to protect neurons from glutamate excitotoxicity. Lithium inhibits excessive glutamate, NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx in neurons and reduces NR2B subunit tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src/Fyn kinase.

PPARγ antagonists can block the increase of PPARγ DNA binding activity and antioxidant enzymatic activities (SOD), inhibiting the protection of PPARγ activation in OGD-exposed neurons. Other mechanisms by which these PPARγ agonists prevent oxidative stress include a decrease in iNOS activity, NFκB blockade, inhibition of TNF-α release, or activation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). By the negative crosstalk between WNT and PPARγ, lithium administration, by inhibiting the GSK-3β could act as a PPARγ antagonist and lead to an increase in the WNT pathway, resulting in diminution of oxidative stress.

### The effects of lithium on cognition in humans: a systematic review [^bc72fc55]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Lithium, a cornerstone in the pharmacotherapy of bipolar disorders (BDs), manifests its therapeutic effects through pleiotropic neurobiological mechanisms. In practice, lithium's efficacy extends to treating and preventing manic and depressive episodes, mitigating aggressive behaviours and anti-suicidal properties. Beyond affective disorders, lithium also exhibits promise for its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI;).

The multifaceted neurobiological impact of lithium includes modulation of cell membrane properties, ion transport and distribution, neurotransmitter signalling and an increase in grey matter volume; thus, it is often perceived as being neuroprotective. It is stipulated that the neuroprotective effects emerge through the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), leading to enhanced cAMP response element-binding protein activity. This, in turn, regulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2, fostering neuroprotection and neuronal survival. Additionally, lithium's modulation of the phosphoinositide cycle engages neuronal autophagy, impacting beta-amyloid and tau protein clearance linked to neurodegeneration. In the context of clinical findings, this is corroborated by the increased cerebral grey matter volume and putatively reduced risk of dementia in bipolar patients treated with lithium.

### Autophagy, lithium, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^2aae8fc9]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

In this article we provide an overview of the intersection between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the autophagy pathway and discuss the potential protective effects of lithium through mechanisms that recruit autophagy and other effects. The autophagy pathway is recruited during motor neuron (MN) death both in vitro and in vivo. Despite a few controversial issues concerning the significance (detrimental/protective) of autophagy in ALS, recent findings indicate a protective role. Lithium in low doses is a well-known autophagy inducer that clears misfolded proteins and altered mitochondria from MNs. Moreover, lithium preserves mitochondria and sustains their genesis. This effect is replicated by rapamycin, which is an autophagy inducer but with a different mechanism from lithium. Lithium also increases the number of Renshaw cells that are affected early during the progression of experimental ALS. Again, lithium has been reported to decrease glial proliferation in the ALS spinal cord and induces sprouting in corticospinal fibers. Muscle Nerve 40: 173–194, 2009.

### Role of the mTOR signaling pathway in epilepsy [^224c577f]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2013). Low credibility.

Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder and cause of significant morbidity and mortality, places an enormous burden on the individual and society. Presently, most drugs for epilepsy primarily suppress seizures as symptomatic therapies but do not possess actual antiepileptogenic or disease-modifying properties. The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway is involved in major multiple cellular functions, including protein synthesis, cell growth and proliferation and synaptic plasticity, which may influence neuronal excitability and be responsible for epileptogenesis. Intriguing findings of the frequent hyperactivation of mTOR signaling in epilepsy make it a potential mechanism in the pathogenesis as well as an attractive target for the therapeutic intervention, and have driven the significant ongoing efforts to pharmacologically target this pathway. This review explores the relevance of the mTOR pathway to epileptogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target in epilepsy treatment by presenting the current results on mTOR inhibitors, in particular, rapamycin, in animal models of diverse types of epilepsy. Limited clinical studies in human epilepsy, some paradoxical experimental data and outstanding questions have also been discussed.

### Lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder: pharmacology and pharmacogenetics [^0b371672]. Molecular Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

After decades of research, the mechanism of action of lithium in preventing recurrences of bipolar disorder remains only partially understood. Lithium research is complicated by the absence of suitable animal models of bipolar disorder and by having to rely on in vitro studies of peripheral tissues. A number of distinct hypotheses emerged over the years, but none has been conclusively supported or rejected. The common theme emerging from pharmacological and genetic studies is that lithium affects multiple steps in cellular signaling, usually enhancing basal and inhibiting stimulated activities. Some of the key nodes of these regulatory networks include GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3), CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) and Na(+)-K(+) ATPase. Genetic and pharmacogenetic studies are starting to generate promising findings, but remain limited by small sample sizes. As full responders to lithium seem to represent a unique clinical population, there is inherent value and need for studies of lithium responders. Such studies will be an opportunity to uncover specific effects of lithium in those individuals who clearly benefit from the treatment.

### Differential expression of gene co-expression networks related to the mTOR signaling pathway in bipolar disorder [^98dd3fce]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Cell type enrichment

We next compared the genes of the modules to the list of cell-type-specific marker genes derived from 5 different brain cells from human cortex to identify specific cell types that may be associated with the modules. The up-regulated PFC_M4 module was highly enriched with genes for markers specific to endothelial cells (P = 1.2e-14) (Supplementary Table 9). Interestingly, mTOR is involved in the four signaling pathways enriched in the PFC_M4 module, e.g. PI3K-Akt signaling pathway can activate mTOR sigaling by direct phosphorylation as well as inhibition of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2) which is an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway. JAK-STAT signaling can regulate the mTOR signaling pathway and the HIF-1 signaling pathway, and proteasome and fatty acid degradation are known to interact with mTOR signaling. Thus, mTOR signaling appears to be up-regulated in the endothelial cells of the PFC in BPD.

While there were no cell-specific markers significantly enriched in the PFC_M5 module, it was enriched for the KEGG pathways ribosome and metabolism, which are regulated by the mTOR pathway. Thus, the mTOR signalling pathway may also be up-regulated in other cells of the PFC in BPD.

The down-regulated PFC_M23 module, was significantly enriched for neuronal markers (P < 2.2e-16) (Supplementary Table 9). Interestingly, the mTOR signaling pathway and several signaling pathways downstream of mTOR, such as autophagy and HIF-1 signaling were also enriched in the PFC_M23 module. This suggests that the mTOR signaling pathway may be differentially regulated within the different cell types i.e. up-regulated in the endothelial and down-regulated in the neurons of the PFC in BPD.

We also examined whether antidepressant and/or mood stabilizer medications effect mTOR activation. We examined the associations between module eigengenes and lithium, other mood stabilizers and antidepressants. There were no significant associations between any modules and any of these treatments (Supplementary Table 5).

### A small molecule inhibitor of rheb selectively targets mTORC1 signaling [^b4c26415]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The mTORC1 signaling complex is a central integrator of both growth factor and nutrient signals and directly regulates anabolic and catabolic activities in the cell, thereby maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Hyperactive mTORC1 that is no longer responsive to growth factor or nutrient signaling has been linked to multiple chronic diseases and directly contributes to the process of aging. Thus, the therapeutic potential of mTORC1 inhibitors is widely acknowledged. However, to date, the only compounds targeting the mTOR signaling pathway that have found clinical utility have been in two classes: rapamycin and various analogs (rapalogs) or direct mTOR kinase inhibitors, both of which have adverse effects resulting from the suppression of mTORC2 activity following chronic therapy.

Rapamycin and rapalogs bind to a cellular accessory protein FKBP12 to form a complex that allosterically inhibits mTORC1, resulting in the selective inhibition of certain downstream substrates. While selective for mTORC1 following short-term exposure, this mechanism of inhibition also downregulates the formation of the mTORC2 complex in particular cell types and tissues. The resultant reduction of mTORC2 activity has been linked to adverse effects observed clinically with chronic use of approved doses of rapamycin/rapalogs. Likewise, the use of direct inhibitors of the mTOR kinase, which equally inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, have also been associated with significant adverse effects when used clinically, limiting the broader use of this class of compounds beyond certain oncology indications –.

### Upstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin: do all roads pass through mTOR? [^ef861508]. Oncogene (2006). Low credibility.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that controls many aspects of cellular physiology, including transcription, translation, cell size, cytoskeletal organization and autophagy. Recent advances in the mTOR signaling field have found that mTOR exists in two heteromeric complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The activity of mTORC1 is regulated by the integration of many signals, including growth factors, insulin, nutrients, energy availability and cellular stressors such as hypoxia, osmotic stress, reactive oxygen species and viral infection. In this review we highlight recent advances in the mTOR signaling field that relate to how the two mTOR complexes are regulated, and we discuss stress conditions linked to the mTOR signaling network that have not been extensively covered in other reviews. Given the diversity of signals that have been shown to impinge on mTOR, we also speculate on other signal-transduction pathways that may be linked to mTOR in the future.

### MTORC2, but not mTORC1, is required for hippocampal mGluR-LTD and associated behaviors [^a25d294b]. Nature Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) has been reported to be necessary for metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). Here we found that mTORC1-deficient mice exhibit normal hippocampal mGluR-LTD and associated behaviors. Moreover, rapamycin blocks mGluR-LTD in mTORC1-deficient mice. However, both rapamycin and mGluR activation regulate mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) activity, and mTORC2-deficient mice show impaired mGluR-LTD and associated behaviors. Thus, mTORC2 is a major regulator of mGluR-LTD.

### Molecular basis of lithium action: integration of lithium-responsive signaling and gene expression networks [^7aa420de]. Molecular Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The clinical efficacy of lithium in the prophylaxis of recurrent affective episodes in bipolar disorder is characterized by a lag in onset and remains for weeks to months after discontinuation. Thus, the long-term therapeutic effect of lithium likely requires reprogramming of gene expression. Protein kinase C and glycogen synthase kinase-3 signal transduction pathways are perturbed by chronic lithium at therapeutically relevant concentrations and have been implicated in modulating synaptic function in nerve terminals. These signaling pathways offer an opportunity to model critical signals for altering gene expression programs that underlie adaptive responses of neurons to long-term lithium exposure. While the precise physiological events critical for the clinical efficacy of lithium remain unknown, we propose that linking lithium-responsive genes as a regulatory network will provide a strategy to identify signature gene expression patterns that distinguish between therapeutic and nontherapeutic actions of lithium.

### CaMKK2 as an emerging treatment target for bipolar disorder [^5488a25a]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Mood stabilising drugs increase CaMKK2 activity and abundance

Mood stabilisers are a class of drugs that are used to treat and manage both the manic and depressive phases of bipolar disorder. Two of the most widely used drugs in this class are lithium and valproate, despite the fact that their primary targets and mechanisms of action still remain unclear. Signalling pathways and enzymes commonly affected by both lithium and valproate are more likely to be clinically relevant in bipolar disorder. Therefore, identifying molecular targets that are shared between the two drugs is crucial, as it will provide some understanding of the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder, and inform the development of new, mechanism-based therapies with improved efficacy and better side-effect profiles.

Since the discovery of its therapeutic properties over seven decades ago, lithium remains the gold standard treatment for acute mania and prevention of recurrent bipolar disorder episodes. Multiple targets of lithium have been identified including inositol monophosphatase, phosphoglucomutase, and a family of four related phosphomonoesterases; however, the most convincing evidence to date suggests that GSK3 is a major effector of the therapeutic effects of lithium. Genetic deletion of GSK3 in mice results in behaviours that mimic the mood-stabilising effects of lithium, as well as causing cognitive deficits similar to those associated with chronic lithium treatment in humans. On the other hand, mice overexpressing GSK3 display behaviours that correlate with bipolar disorder and are desensitised to the mood-stabilising effects of lithium. Together, these data provide strong evidence that GSK3 is an in vivo target of lithium. GSK3 directly regulates at least forty known downstream substrates that participate in a diverse range of cellular processes. The substrates that link GSK3 to bipolar disorder and lithium action are not yet clear; however, there is growing evidence that CaMKK2 could be a key effector. As described above, lithium increases CaMKK2 activity by inhibiting GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of the S3-node (Fig. 2). In addition, lithium increases CaMKK2 expression in the striatum, an area of the brain that displays structural abnormalities in bipolar disorder. These dual, function-enhancing effects of lithium are noteworthy, given the connection between CaMKK2 loss-of-function and bipolar disorder. Increased CaMKK2 activity in the brain leads to CaMK4 activation and increased expression of BDNF, which in mice is indispensable for the anti-manic actions of lithium. Furthermore, a recent study of genetic variants associated with lithium responsiveness in bipolar disorder patients found a significant enrichment of genes involved in glutamatergic synapse neurotransmission, which included GSK3 and CAMK4. Collectively, these data raise the possibility that the GSK3-CaMKK2-CaMK4 signalling axis is a principal site of action through which lithium increases BDNF expression and exerts its anti-manic effects. Also, since lithium increases both CaMKK2 activity and protein abundance, it is possible that CaMKK2 may be involved in mediating the acute as well as longer-term effects of lithium such as preventing episode recurrence.

### The neurology of mTOR [^1329d887]. Neuron (2014). Low credibility.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a crucial cellular signaling hub that, like the nervous system itself, integrates internal and external cues to elicit critical outputs including growth control, protein synthesis, gene expression, and metabolic balance. The importance of mTOR signaling to brain function is underscored by the myriad disorders in which mTOR pathway dysfunction is implicated, such as autism, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders. Pharmacological manipulation of mTOR signaling holds therapeutic promise and has entered clinical trials for several disorders. Here, we review the functions of mTOR signaling in the normal and pathological brain, highlighting ongoing efforts to translate our understanding of cellular physiology into direct medical benefit for neurological disorders.

### Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide (Zestoretic) [^3bc367fd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Agents: Lisinopril has been used concomitantly with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. No meaningful clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol, digoxin, or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril.

Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated, because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.

Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium.

mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors

Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS).

Neprilysin Inhibitors

Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS).

### Lithium for bipolar disorder and thyroid dysfunction and chronic kidney disease… [^866dd0b5]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

We repeated Cox regression models within the lithium group to assess the associations of risk of thyroid and kidney outcomes with lithium treatment characteristics, including mean lithium serum levels, cumulative treatment duration, and number of toxicity episodes. These lithium treatment characteristics were median-split for analyses, with patients having values below the median as the reference. We then conducted the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analyses to calculate area under the curve, taking into consideration the person-year exposure in Cox proportional hazards regression models, and Youden index was calculated to determine the optimal cutoffs of mean lithium serum levels associated with thyroid dysfunction and CKD3+ in patients treated with lithium.

Although lithium was associated with increased risk of hyperthyroidism in the sensitivity analyses when restricting the sample to lithium users with lithium as their first-used mood stabilizer and with mean lithium serum levels greater than median serum levels of the entire lithium group, these associations became nonsignificant after Bonferroni correction. Our findings concur, at least partially, with a systematic review21 and a recent study6 indicating hyperthyroidism as a lithium-related adverse effect despite its comparatively lower prevalence rate. Intriguingly, consistent with an earlier, large-scale UK study, 11 our results showed that shorter lithium exposure duration was associated with increased risk of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, suggesting that thyroid dysfunction might occur early after initiation of lithium treatment. Our data showed a 1.

35-fold higher risk of CKD3+ in lithium users than nonlithium users, which is slightly lower than the

1. 5- to 2-fold increased risk generally reported in prior research. 7, 23 The attenuated CKD risk estimate in our study might partly be attributable to the minimized confounding due to our adjustment for a more comprehensive array of covariates than used previously, encompassing physical comorbidities, substance and alcohol use disorders, and other psychotropics and nephrotoxic medications, which were not adequately controlled for in most previous studies.

### Insulin signaling as a therapeutic mechanism of lithium in bipolar disorder [^87183ed6]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In this paper, we propose that lithium may exert its therapeutic effect in bipolar disorder by acting on insulin signaling pathways. Specifically, we assess the importance of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/Akt) insulin signaling pathway and we assess how the action of lithium on both glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) and the phosphatidylinositol cycle may lead to mood stabilization mediated by PI3K/Akt insulin signaling. We also highlight evidence that several other actions of lithium (including effects on Akt, Protein kinase C (PKC), and sodium myo-inositol transporters) are putative mediators of insulin signaling. This novel mode of action of lithium is consistent with an emerging consensus that energy dysregulation represents a core deficit in bipolar disorder. It may also provide context for the significant co-morbidity between bipolar disorder, type 2 diabetes, and other forms of metabolic illness characterized by impaired glucose metabolism. It is suggested that developments in assessing neuronal insulin signaling using extracellular vesicles would allow for this hypothesis to be tested in bipolar disorder patients.

### Converging evidence for functional connections between the lithium response and PI3K-akt signaling [^c7b4a430]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Recently, Ou et al. reported in Translational Psychiatry the replication and extension of previous findings by this group concerning mechanisms involved in the response to lithium. Collectively, GWAS, multi-omics, and network-assisted genomic analysis identified the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway as a major contributor to lithium responsiveness in bipolar disorder (BD). Importantly, these new findings confirm earlier studies from 2011 of lithium's effects in Caenorhabditis elegans and validate the relevance of this model organism for psychiatric research.

Previously, we used molecular genetics approaches to explore non-traditional targets of antipsychotic drugs. We reported that the drugs activated Akt in both cultured neuronal cells and C. elegans; the latter finding was discovered independently by Buttner and colleagues. Furthermore, we determined that clozapine stood apart from other antipsychotic drugs in terms of its molecular targets, and that lithium resembled clozapine in this regard. Drugs were evaluated for their ability to cause phosphorylation of a Forkhead box O (FOXO) protein in C. elegans, DAF-16, thus preventing its entry into the nucleus in response to short-term starvation. Using various genetic mutant strains, we showed that the insulin receptor gene (daf-2) and G proteins were required for activation of Akt via phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, PDK-1. In stark contrast to most of the antipsychotics, clozapine and lithium also required β-arrestin and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 (sgk-1) to affect DAF-16. The lithium pathway that we originally constructed is shown in modified form in Fig. 1 and is remarkable for the overlap with the top 25 reprioritized genes identified by Ou et al. The similarities are striking, although they require corroboration, and they furnish additional validation for using C. elegans in psychiatry research. This approach is further supported by observations that risk genes for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression are highly conserved during evolution, including expression in C. elegans. The various risk gene sets are enriched for genes that are essential for life, which may help to explain their evolutionary conservation.

### Raptor preys on mTOR imbalance in tuberous sclerosis [^506b31e0]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

Targeting ubiquitous cellular pathways with precision therapies is extremely challenging; the mTOR signaling pathway is one such with multiple downstream targets. Crosstalk between upstream regulators and feedback pathway loops to maintain signaling homeostasis add another layer of difficulty in modulating the highly complex mTOR pathways, highlighted by the examples of TSC/PTEN. Additionally, the task of regulating mTOR signaling not only entails identifying a target that can be easily genetically modulated but also evaluating the dosage effects of this target. Overall, Karalis et al demonstrate that reduction of the mTORC1 protein Raptor is an effective approach at improving mTOR signaling imbalance and TS-related phenotypes using mouse models, including postnatally. As the authors acknowledge, Raptor downregulation alone cannot be effective in restoring mTOR signaling in therapy and must be considered in conjunction with modulating other targets of this signaling pathway. However, as the authors elegantly elucidate, a more mechanistic dissection of mTOR signaling, and identification of specific modulators, is much more likely to be an effective strategy than broad inhibition strategies such as rapamycin.

No meaningful clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol, digoxin, or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril.

Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated, because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium.

Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium.

### Insulin signaling as a therapeutic mechanism of lithium in bipolar disorder [^60000fdb]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Metabolic effects of lithium

Lithium is not generally considered to exert therapeutic action through metabolic pathways. However, it has been demonstrated to have metabolic effects. Notably, it has been demonstrated to restore insulin sensitivity in animal models of insulin resistance, as summarized by Lee and Kim. Insulin-mediated glucose transport into the cell can be increased 2.5-fold in the presence of lithium. And small molecule inhibitors of GSK3β have been demonstrated to lead to improvements in whole-body insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant animals. Impaired suppression of GSK3 is an established feature of insulin resistance both in peripheral tissues and in the CNS. There are several indications in the literature that the action of lithium in suppressing GSK3 and stabilizing mood may be mediated through insulin signaling. In addition to lithium directly inhibiting GSK3 through competitive binding with magnesium, it also acts through an independent effect on Akt, which is upstream of GSK3 in the PI3K/Akt insulin signaling pathway. It has been demonstrated that Akt kinase activity is required for lithium to modulate mood-related behaviors in mice, suggesting that the therapeutic effect may occur via a larger signaling system as opposed to GSK3 alone. Phosphorylation of insulin signaling proteins has been shown to increase in response to lithium treatment in an animal model of tricyclic antidepressant resistance, indicating increased insulin sensitivity. In humans, insulin stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) resulted in phosphorylated GSK3 levels rising by 87% in those who respond strongly to lithium, compared to a 37% reduction in lithium non-responders. The inability of insulin to suppress GSK3 as observed in the strong lithium responders may serve as an indication of a unique form of lithium-responsive metabolic dysfunction in bipolar disorder patients.

GSK3 is an important node at the intersection of multiple signaling pathways involved in metabolism, inflammation and cellular signaling. These include the Wnt pathway which regulates cell fate determination and migration and toll-like receptor signaling pathways which regulate inflammation. It is not possible therefore, to say conclusively that the effects of lithium on GSK3 necessarily imply an action on insulin signaling. However, the effects of lithium on the PI-Cycle and several other important insulin signaling mechanisms which will be discussed here provide further evidence that this pathway is an important mediator of GSK3 dysfunction in BD.

Table 3
Therapies targeting autophagy pathways in CNS WMDs.

Although lithium was the first drug found to induce autophagy in an mTOR‐independent manner by lowering inositol synthesis [133], other FDA‐approved drugs may also regulate autophagy in mTOR‐independent manners [124]. Two of these, carbamazepine and sodium valproate, act similarly to lithium, whereas xestospongin B decreased intracellular IP3 levels [152]. The compounds rilmenidine and clonidine reduce cAMP levels by inhibiting G‐protein signalling pathways that in turn inhibit adenylyl cyclase, after which autophagy is initiated [124]. Rilmenidine is known for its positive characteristics and safe long‐term use in chronic diseases and has been tested in neuronal cell cultures [125]. The cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2R) inhibits adenylyl cyclase directly, which reduces cAMP levels similarly to the working mechanism of rilmenidine, clonidine and H89 [124, 126]. Activation of CB2R with HU‐308 alleviated clinical signs of EAE through activation of autophagy and restoring the reduced LC3‐II/LC3‐I ratio [127]. Cannabis, which targets CB2R, is used to treat MS and has been reported to reduce disease progression via autophagic‐related pathways [153]. Additionally, cAMP‐dependent PKA inhibitor H89 was found to induce autophagy through downstream modulation of Akt [126].

### Targeted therapy for mTORC1-driven tumours through HDAC inhibition by exploiting innate vulnerability of mTORC1 hyper-activation [^0057f073]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

HDACi specifically target tumour cells with mTORC1 hyper-activation

To further explore the vulnerability of mTORC1 hyper-activated tumours to HDACi in other cancer cells, a human glioblastoma cell line LN229 was stably transfected with constitutively active Rheb (S16H), an upstream activator of mTOR, which activated mTOR signalling in neurons. As expected, the overexpression of Rheb (S16H) increased mTORC1 signalling, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of both p70 S6K and rpS6 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Interestingly, LN229 tumour cells with active Rheb showed increased sensitivity to cell death induced by SAHA or CL994 as measured by cleaved capase-3 levels. We next assessed the effects of HDACi on rat renal carcinoma cells named LEF2, which has a Tsc2 loss-of-function mutation, with or without re-expression of Tsc2 to suppress mTORC1 activation. We found that while SAHA and CI994 both induced cell death of LEF2 control cells, they did not induce cell death for LEF2 cells with re-expression of Tsc2 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Collectively, these data provide further support that HDACi could target mTORC1 hyper-activated tumours and had anti-tumour efficacies in mTORC1-driven/hyper-activated tumours without affecting mTORC1 activation per se.

Because Akt transcription in Tsc1 iΔEC was down-regulated by HDACi (see Fig. 3a), we also assessed the effects of combination treatments with SAHA and PI3K-Akt inhibitors (LY294002 or MK2206, respectively). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S6, we found that both combination treatments induced more cell death than single treatment by SAHA alone, and MK2206 showed stronger synergistic effect with SAHA for inducing tumour cell death. These data suggest that the combination of HDAC and Akt inhibitors treatment could have greater efficiency for the therapeutics of mTORC1-driven tumour cells.

### The enigma of rapamycin dosage [^7b79db06]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

The mTOR pathway is a critical regulator of cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and survival. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been observed in most cancers and, thus, the mTOR pathway has been extensively studied for therapeutic intervention. Rapamycin is a natural product that inhibits mTOR with high specificity. However, its efficacy varies by dose in several contexts. First, different doses of rapamycin are needed to suppress mTOR in different cell lines; second, different doses of rapamycin are needed to suppress the phosphorylation of different mTOR substrates; and third, there is a differential sensitivity of the two mTOR complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 to rapamycin. Intriguingly, the enigmatic properties of rapamycin dosage can be explained in large part by the competition between rapamycin and phosphatidic acid (PA) for mTOR. Rapamycin and PA have opposite effects on mTOR whereby rapamycin destabilizes and PA stabilizes both mTOR complexes. In this review, we discuss the properties of rapamycin dosage in the context of anticancer therapeutics.

### MTOR complexes in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders [^da1e145c]. Nature Neuroscience (2013). Medium credibility.

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) acts as a highly conserved signaling "hub" that integrates neuronal activity and a variety of synaptic inputs. mTOR is found in two functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that crucially control long-term synaptic efficacy and memory storage. Dysregulation of mTOR signaling is associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this Review, we describe the most recent advances in studies of mTOR signaling in the brain and the possible mechanisms underlying the many different functions of the mTOR complexes in neurological diseases. In addition, we discuss the medical relevance of these findings.

### Mechanistic / mammalian target of rapamycin and side effects of antipsychotics: insights into mechanisms and implications for therapy [^83d6cde1]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin

Biology of mTOR and its associated protein complexes

mTOR is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinase [molecular weight 289 kDa)] in the family of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-related protein kinases, and is encoded by the MTOR gene located in chromosome 1p36. Through interacting with its protein partners, mTOR protein kinase forms two structurally and functionally distinct protein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). A schematic illustration of the structural assembly of the two complexes is provided in Fig. 1. The protein subunits of mTORC1 include mTOR, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR), proline-rich AKT1 substrate 1 (PRAS1), DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), and target of rapamycin complex subunit LST8 (mLST8). As a core component of mTORC1 (mTOR-mLST8-RAPTOR), RAPTOR plays an essential role in recruiting substrates and in the subcellular localization of mTORC1, while mLST8 stabilizes the kinase domain of mTOR. In contrast to the structural assembly of mTORC1, mTORC2 comprises the following subunits: mTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR), DEPTOR, mLST8, and target of rapamycin complex 2 subunit mapkap1 (MAPKAP1), with mTOR, mLST8, and RICTOR as the core of the complex (mTOR–mLST8–RICTOR).

Proposed mechanisms of antipsychotic-induced metabolic side effects.

Antipsychotic drugs (e.g. olanzapine) increase plasma levels of-glutamine (Gln) and-leucine (Leu), two validated activators of the mTOR pathway. Gln and Leu are transported into hepatocytes by amino acid transporter solute carrier (SLC) SLC38A2 and SLC7A5, respectively. High levels of Gln and Leu cause a pseudo-fasted state, and activate the hepatic mTOR pathway. Activation of mTORC1 disturbs lipid and glucose metabolism, leading to upregulated lipid synthesis, accumulation of triglycerides, storage of nutrients, hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance, weight gain, MetS, and other metabolic side effects. 4EBP1 eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, Gln-glutamine, Leu-Leucine, mTORC1 the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, MetS metabolic syndrome, pS6 ribosomal protein S6, p70s6K/S6K1 p70S6 kinase, SLC38A2 solute carrier 38A2, SLC7A5 solute carrier 7A5.

### Double agent mTOR [^9bbe4d9f]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

Commentary

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates neuronal plasticity, increases cell metabolism, and promotes neuronal growth. Mutations that increase mTOR signaling can cause tumor formation, but are also associated with a range of neurological disorders including autism, cortical dysplasia, and epilepsy. Increased mTOR pathway activation has also been observed in tissue collected from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, but without identified mTOR pathway mutations, consistent with animal research indicating that mTOR signaling is enhanced in acquired epilepsy. Research in the mTOR field was originally driven by the chance discovery of the bacterial metabolite rapamycin in a soil sample from Easter Island, located in the South Pacific Ocean. Rapamycin is a powerful inhibitor of the mTOR pathway and has served as a useful pharmacologic tool. Clinical trials with rapamycin analogues have achieved promising results in controlling seizures and central nervous system tumor formation in tuberous sclerosis complex, a disease caused by inactivating mutations in the mTOR pathway suppressors TSC1 and TSC2. Preclinical studies in animal models of acquired epilepsy — predicated on the observation that epileptogenic brain insults increase mTOR pathway activation — have also achieved promising results, often producing dramatic reductions in severe frequency. Intriguingly, however, a number of well-designed studies found no effect of rapamycin in several common seizure models.

Work by Jiang and colleagues has unexpectedly led to a potential explanation for these discrepant effects of mTOR antagonism. They examined epilepsy-causing mutations in the gene encoding the α1 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels CaV2.1. Prior work from the group demonstrated that CaV2.1 loss from interneurons (INs) was sufficient to reproduce an epileptic phenotype in mice. In the present study, they sought to identify which specific IN populations were critical. Mutations affecting both parvalbumin (PV)-expressing and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing γ-aminobutyric acidergic INs led to epilepsy in the animals, while mutations affecting just PV-expressing INs produced a milder epilepsy phenotype. Mutations affecting just SOM-expressing INs didn't produce seizures at all. Loss of CaV2.1 from PV INs impaired their synaptic efficiency, leading to a net reduction in inhibitory control of their targets: excitatory pyramidal cells. It makes sense, therefore, that loss of CaV2.1 from PV INs would be proconvulsant. Somatostatin-expressing INs, on the other hand, primarily target other INs, so it also makes sense that mutations targeted to just this population would not produce seizures. More curious, however, is why targeting the mutation to both PV- or SOM-expressing INs would produce a more severe epilepsy that targeting PV alone.

### The mechanistic target of rapamycin: the grand conducTOR of metabolism and aging [^5cec7ca6]. Cell Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Since the discovery that rapamycin, a small molecule inhibitor of the protein kinase mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), can extend the lifespan of model organisms including mice, interest in understanding the physiological role and molecular targets of this pathway has surged. While mTOR was already well known as a regulator of growth and protein translation, it is now clear that mTOR functions as a central coordinator of organismal metabolism in response to both environmental and hormonal signals. This review discusses recent developments in our understanding of how mTOR signaling is regulated by nutrients and the role of the mTOR signaling pathway in key metabolic tissues. Finally, we discuss the molecular basis for the negative metabolic side effects associated with rapamycin treatment, which may serve as barriers to the adoption of rapamycin or similar compounds for the treatment of diseases of aging and metabolism.

### MTOR is a key modulator of ageing and age-related disease [^169a7e0e]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

Many experts in the biology of ageing believe that pharmacological interventions to slow ageing are a matter of 'when' rather than 'if'. A leading target for such interventions is the nutrient response pathway defined by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Inhibition of this pathway extends lifespan in model organisms and confers protection against a growing list of age-related pathologies. Characterized inhibitors of this pathway are already clinically approved, and others are under development. Although adverse side effects currently preclude use in otherwise healthy individuals, drugs that target the mTOR pathway could one day become widely used to slow ageing and reduce age-related pathologies in humans.

### Maintaining glycogen synthase kinase-3 activity is critical for mTOR kinase inhibitors to inhibit cancer cell growth [^69e7d8be]. Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

mTOR kinase inhibitors that target both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are being evaluated in cancer clinical trials. Here, we report that glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is a critical determinant for the therapeutic response to this class of experimental drugs. Pharmacologic inhibition of GSK3 antagonized their suppressive effects on the growth of cancer cells similarly to genetic attenuation of GSK3. Conversely, expression of a constitutively activated form of GSK3β sensitized cancer cells to mTOR inhibition. Consistent with these findings, higher basal levels of GSK3 activity in a panel of human lung cancer cell lines correlated with more efficacious responses. Mechanistic investigations showed that mTOR kinase inhibitors reduced cyclin D1 levels in a GSK3β-dependent manner, independent of their effects on suppressing mTORC1 signaling and cap binding. Notably, selective inhibition of mTORC2 triggered proteasome-mediated cyclin D1 degradation, suggesting that mTORC2 blockade is responsible for GSK3-dependent reduction of cyclin D1. Silencing expression of the ubiquitin E3 ligase FBX4 rescued this reduction, implicating FBX4 in mediating this effect of mTOR inhibition. Together, our findings define a novel mechanism by which mTORC2 promotes cell growth, with potential implications for understanding the clinical action of mTOR kinase inhibitors.

### Neuron-specific isoform of PGC-1 α regulates neuronal metabolism and brain aging [^111322a0]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Neuronal metabolic response to GSK3β inhibition with Lithium

The consequences of the PGC-1α B1E2 isoform repression were investigated further via RNA-seq of LiCl-treated primary cortical neurons compared to untreated controls (n = 4 per group). Transcripts representing 15,370 genes were identified. Five thousand four hundred eighty were identified as differentially expressed using an FDR of 0.01. Top LiCl-responsive genes included ATF3, Aquaporin 9, Slc20a3 (synaptic vesicle-linked zinc transporter), and homeobox transcription factors (Supplementary Data 6). Differentially expressed genes were subject to pathway analysis via GSEA (Fig. 5A). Enriched and activated pathways included those associated with growth, such as cell cycle, Hippo signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling that is part of the insulin and mTOR signaling pathway. Ordinarily, GSK3β is inhibited by growth signaling, but these data indicate that GSK3β inhibition as an initiating event might stimulate growth pathways, at least in neurons. The most highly enriched and suppressed pathways include ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, proteosome, and several neurodegenerative disease pathways. Notably, many pathways that LiCl repressed were among those activated by aging in the brain, including oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 5B) and ribosome (Fig. 5C). Focusing on established targets of PGC-1α transcriptional co-activation, a suite of genes associated with the electron transport chain (Cox4i1, Ndiufb8, Cycs, Vdac1, Cox5b), TCA cycle (Sdhb, Idh3a), and antioxidant maintenance (Sod2 and Cat) appear downregulated in response to LiCl, while expression of other PGC-1α associated factors including Nrf1, Ppara, Ucp2 were induced (Fig. 5D). Genes associated with the neuronal function (Syt1 and Cplx1) appear to be the most downregulated, supporting PGC-1α B1E2's role in modulating neuron-specific functions.

### Everolimus (Torpenz) [^cc6dbd87]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers and in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation with mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. S6K1 is a substrate of mTORC1 and phosphorylates the activation domain 1 of the estrogen receptor which results in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g. HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.

Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner.

Two regulators of mTORC1 signalling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 (TSC1, TSC2). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signalling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death.

### Genomics of lithium action and response [^5d237560]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Lithium is the most successful mood stabilizer treatment for bipolar disorder. However, unlike conventional drugs that are designed to interact with a specific molecular target, the actions of lithium are distributed across many biological processes and pathways. Treatment response is subject to genetic variation between individuals and similar genetic variation may dictate susceptibility to side effects. Transcriptomic, genomic, and cell-model research strategies have all been deployed in the search for the genetic factors and biological systems that mediate the interaction between genetics and the therapeutic actions of lithium. In this review, recent findings from genome-wide studies and patient cell lines will be summarized and discussed from a standpoint that genuine progress is being made to define clinically useful mechanisms of this treatment, to place it in the context of bipolar disorder pathology, and to move towards a time when the prescription of lithium is targeted to those individuals who will derive the greatest benefit.

### PARVing the way to cap translation for seizure control [^e5f0cf22]. Epilepsy Currents (2021). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Dysregulated signaling through mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) has long been associated with neuronal dysfunction and epilepsy. Mutations within this pathway lead to syndromic epilepsy disorders like Tuberous Sclerosis and are frequently found in focal cortical dysplasia. Mechanistic target of rapamycin is a signaling hub that functions through two major complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and controls cell proliferation and survival, among many other processes. In particular the mTORC1-dependent arm of the pathway has drawn a lot of interest in the epilepsy field because of the availability of mTORC1-inhibiting drugs approved for use in humans, such as everolimus, that reduce seizures in mouse models and have shown some success in ameliorating the seizure phenotype in patients. Not all patients are responders, though, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the development of epilepsy when the mTOR pathway is overactive are still not fully understood. In fact, a few recent studies painted a more nuanced picture of mTOR signaling in epilepsy: Chen et al challenged the "mTORC1-centric" view of epilepsy by showing that genetic reduction of the other arm of mTOR signaling, mTORC2, rescues seizure phenotypes in a mouse model of epilepsy, while inhibiting mTORC1 was less effective. In another study, Huang and colleagues illustrated the importance of cell type by demonstrating that mTOR signaling in microglia is neuroprotective during epileptogenesis, opposing the traditional view of overactive mTOR in the brain as a risk factor for seizures.

### Leucine regulates autophagy via acetylation of the mTORC1 component raptor [^70208ed0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Macroautophagy ("autophagy") is the main lysosomal catabolic process that becomes activated under nutrient-depleted conditions, like amino acid (AA) starvation. The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a well-conserved negative regulator of autophagy. While leucine (Leu) is a critical mTORC1 regulator under AA-starved conditions, how Leu regulates autophagy is poorly understood. Here, we describe that in most cell types, including neurons, Leu negatively regulates autophagosome biogenesis via its metabolite, acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA). AcCoA inhibits autophagy by enhancing EP300-dependent acetylation of the mTORC1 component raptor, with consequent activation of mTORC1. Interestingly, in Leu deprivation conditions, the dominant effects on autophagy are mediated by decreased raptor acetylation causing mTORC1 inhibition, rather than by altered acetylation of other autophagy regulators. Thus, in most cell types we examined, Leu regulates autophagy via the impact of its metabolite AcCoA on mTORC1, suggesting that AcCoA and EP300 play pivotal roles in cell anabolism and catabolism.

### Raptor preys on mTOR imbalance in tuberous sclerosis [^6ebb183d]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

Commentary

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is an important signaling pathway that regulates cellular metabolism, proliferation, growth, and survival. Pathogenic variants in genes that regulate mTOR signaling cause a broad spectrum of malformations of cortical development, collectively called mTORopathies. These include tuberous sclerosis (TS), the most well-characterized mTORopathy, caused by loss-of-function variants in TSC1 and TSC2. Tuberous sclerosis is characterized by nonmalignant tumors in various organs of the body, including tubers in the brain. Clinically, TS is characterized by uncontrolled seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Due to the uncontrolled nature of these seizures, novel precision therapeutics are urgently needed.

Mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling is effectuated by two protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. Both complexes have a common member, mTOR. The proteins that primarily distinguish the two complexes are Raptor (Rptor) in mTORC1 and Rictor (Rictor) in mTORC2. mTOR signaling is up- or down-regulated as necessary to maintain cellular homeostasis. However, in TS, mTOR signaling is constitutively active due to loss of the upstream regulators encoded by TSC1/2. While mTORC1 hyperactivity in TS is well-known, recent findings point to abnormal mTORC2 signaling as well. There has thus been much interest in mTOR inhibition to treat TS via rapamycin and its derivatives, and these inhibitors have shown some efficacy in reducing seizures. However, chronic usage of mTOR inhibitors results in severe side effects including immunosuppression. This warrants the search for alternate strategies for more precise modulation of mTOR signaling. In this study, Karalis et al dissect the mechanisms of aberrant mTOR signaling in TS and discover that downregulation of mTORC1 protein, Raptor, was effective not only at restoring mTOR balance but also in rescuing some TS phenotypes in a mouse model.

### Translational evidence for lithium-induced brain plasticity and neuroprotection in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders [^99aec918]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

General overview of molecular mechanisms of Li +

Some effects of Li + are related to the physical–chemical reversible competition with magnesium ion (Mg2 +) within specific catalytic protein domains involved in substrate phosphorylation. Evidence shows Li + 's ability to inhibit Mg2 + -dependent enzymes by displacing Mg2 + from its binding sites, thereby reducing enzyme stability and activity. Thus, pharmacological actions of Li + mostly depend on the reciprocal Li + /Mg2 + ratio. These mechanisms of action add on the multifaceted pharmacology of Li +, as well as its multiple targets.

The binding competition between Li+ and Mg2+ at substrate enzyme sites modulates the activity of several enzymes within intracellular pathways involved in biochemical effects, which are relevant both for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. These include inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), Akt/β-arrestin-2, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). There are two closely related forms of GSK-3, termed alpha (GSK-3α) and beta (GSK-3β), which are equivalently inhibited by Li +. Li + inhibits GSK-3 by competing with Mg 2+ for an essential binding site. In addition to Mg 2+ competition, Li + inhibits GSK-3β activity by increasing its phosphorylation. Li + also decreases GSK-3β levels by inhibiting its transcription. It is worth noting that, of all the kinases, GSK-3 influences the largest number of substrates. Thus, Li + has been estimated to act at several hundreds of GSK3-dependent substrates through the modulation of a number of GSK-3-dependent pathways. Since Li + affects other Mg 2+ -dependent proteins, the occurrence of > 3000 human proteins has been estimated that can be affected by Li +. This ability to act on a plethora of molecules, each one owning a functional relevance, makes Li + a powerful pharmacological agent and a valuable tool in clinical and preclinical research.

### Beneficial effects of early mTORC1 inhibition after traumatic brain injury [^b6a78a2f]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2016). Low credibility.

The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway mediates many aspects of cell growth and regeneration and is upregulated after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The significance of this increased signaling event for recovery of brain function is presently unclear. We analyzed the time course and cell specificity of mTORC1 signal activation in the mouse hippocampus after moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) and identified an early neuronal peak of activity that occurs within a few hours after injury. We suppressed this peak activity by a single injection of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin 1h after CCI and showed that this acute treatment significantly diminishes the extent of neuronal death, astrogliosis, and cognitive impairment 1–3 days after injury. Our findings suggest that the early neuronal peak of mTORC1 activity after TBI is deleterious to brain function, and that acute, early intervention with mTORC1 inhibitors after injury may represent an effective form of treatment to improve recovery in human patients.

Postmortem and brain imaging studies have revealed structural changes and cell loss in cortico-limbic regions of the brain in bipolar disorder and major depression. Consistent with these findings, mood stabilizers such as lithium ion and valproic acid, which are used to treat bipolar disorder, as well as antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy have recently been shown to activate interconnected intracellular signaling pathways that promote neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. These insights should assist in understanding the pathophysiology of severe mood disorders as well as aid in the development of more effective treatments.

In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g. HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.

Constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway can contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer. In vitro studies show that estrogen-dependent and HER2+ breast cancer cells are sensitive to the inhibitory effects of everolimus, and that combination treatment with everolimus and Akt, HER2, or aromatase inhibitors enhances the anti-tumor activity of everolimus in a synergistic manner.

Two regulators of mTORC1 signaling are the oncogene suppressors tuberin-sclerosis complexes 1 and 2 (TSC1, TSC2). Loss or inactivation of either TSC1 or TSC2 leads to activation of downstream signaling. In TSC, a genetic disorder, inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or the TSC2 gene lead to hamartoma formation throughout the body as well as seizures and epileptogenesis. Overactivation of mTOR results in neuronal dysplasia, aberrant axonogenesis and dendrite formation, increased excitatory synaptic currents, reduced myelination, and disruption of the cortical laminar structure causing abnormalities in neuronal development and function. Treatment with an mTOR inhibitor in animal models of mTOR dysregulation in the brain resulted in seizure suppression, prevention of the development of new-onset seizures, and prevention of premature death.

### Catalytic mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors as antineoplastic agents [^03f51ed6]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2015). Low credibility.

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a major therapeutic target in the treatment of hematological malignancies, as it controls cellular events of high importance for regulation of mRNA translation and protein production. Rapalogs, or first-generation mTOR inhibitors, have produced only modest clinical benefits so far. Limitations to rapalogs likely result from the partial inhibition of mTORC1 substrates and lack of effects on mTORC2. Efforts toward the development of agents with more potent and complete inhibitory effects on the mTOR pathway have resulted in the development of catalytic mTOR inhibitors. Key preclinical and early clinical investigations of several catalytic mTOR inhibitors and potential resistance mechanisms to their activities are summarized here.
