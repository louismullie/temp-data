## Question

Causes how high elevated Lactic acidosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of high lactate and lactic acidosis, organized by mechanism and with practical interpretation and management cues. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core classification framework distinguishing type A (hypoxic) from type B (non-hypoxic) mechanisms. Then, I should verify the major type A drivers such as shock, hypoxemia, and anemia. Next, I will examine type B etiologies including drugs, toxins, metabolic derangements, malignancy, and organ dysfunction. After that, I need to check special contexts like sepsis where both mechanisms coexist, and metformin-associated lactic acidosis where causality is debated. Finally, I will integrate diagnostic interpretation, prognostic implications, and management principles, making sure I double-check areas of controversy and correct any outdated assumptions as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational classification, because everything else hinges on it. Lactic acidosis is traditionally divided into type A, due to inadequate oxygen delivery and anaerobic glycolysis, and type B, due to impaired clearance or altered metabolism without systemic hypoxia; I should confirm that this dichotomy remains clinically useful while acknowledging modern nuances about aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction, which it does, though the paradigm has evolved to include non-hypoxic overproduction and clearance failure as key contributors [^116kvqZe] [^112cdM3e].

> Now, I will examine type A causes, and I need to ensure I prioritize the most common and lethal. Shock states — septic, cardiogenic, hemorrhagic, and distributive — are the leading causes of high lactate via tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic glycolysis; sepsis in particular often produces marked hyperlactatemia, and guidelines endorse lactate measurement in suspected sepsis as a risk stratifier, not a diagnostic test, which I should emphasize to avoid misinterpretation [^111BdPwn] [^112fEYSZ] [^114jA46a]. Severe hypoxemia from respiratory failure, profound anemia, and carbon monoxide poisoning also drive type A physiology, and I should remember that even after hemodynamic normalization, tissue-level hypoxia may persist, so lactate can remain elevated despite "normal" vitals, which means I must not anchor on initial stabilization alone [^115HSs6C] [^1134BsJv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sepsis being purely type A; I should double-check the mixed mechanisms. In sepsis, both impaired oxygen delivery and bioenergetic failure with accelerated aerobic glycolysis contribute, so lactate elevation is not exclusively hypoxic; this mixed model explains why lactate can be high even when global oxygen delivery appears adequate, and it reinforces the need to treat the source while using lactate trends to gauge response rather than assuming persistent elevation equals ongoing hypoxia [^114RPu15] [^112cdM3e].

> Next, I should review type B causes, and I need to be systematic. Drugs and toxins are prominent: metformin can cause lactic acidosis via mitochondrial effects and impaired lactate clearance, especially with accumulation in renal or hepatic dysfunction; beta-agonists like albuterol increase glycolytic flux and can produce hyperlactatemia without hypoxia; nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors can cause mitochondrial toxicity; and propylene glycol excipients in high-dose lorazepam infusions are a recognized culprit, so I should actively check medication lists and timing of exposures [^116q9XRK] [^1151hYvf] [^113wCuWW] [^112hz3TN].

> Wait, let me verify the metformin signal because it is often overcalled. Large meta-analyses and population data show that metformin-associated lactic acidosis is rare and that overall lactate levels are not higher than with other glucose-lowering therapies when renal function is preserved; however, risk rises with renal impairment, high dose, and intercurrent illness, and when MALA occurs, it can be severe, so I should confirm eGFR, hold metformin in acute illness, and consider early hemodialysis if acidosis is significant and metformin accumulation is suspected [^112TWKig] [^114Qnnii] [^116q9XRK].

> I will now examine metabolic and systemic contributors to type B lactic acidosis, and I need to ensure I include the less obvious ones. Thiamine deficiency impairs pyruvate dehydrogenase and can cause profound lactic acidosis, particularly in malnutrition, alcohol use disorder, or malignancy; liver failure reduces lactate clearance; renal failure impairs both clearance and acid-base handling; and malignancy-related Warburg metabolism can generate very high lactate even in hemodynamically stable patients, so I should actively look for these when the clinical picture does not fit hypoperfusion alone [^112nzUo8] [^116kvqZe] [^113F3PGr] [^1175cXTT].

> But wait, what if the lactate is high and the patient looks "stable"? I should double-check for catecholamine-driven overproduction. Endogenous or exogenous catecholamines stimulate glycolysis and can transiently raise lactate without tissue hypoxia; this is common in shock resuscitation with high-dose vasopressors and in respiratory distress with beta-agonist therapy, so I must interpret lactate in the context of adrenergic tone and drug exposure before concluding there is occult hypoperfusion [^112tXwNA] [^1151hYvf].

> Next, I should review special contexts where both type A and B mechanisms coexist, and I need to ensure I do not oversimplify. In sepsis, as noted, both hypoxic and non-hypoxic pathways operate; in cardiogenic shock, reduced cardiac output drives type A hypoxia while adrenergic stimulation and mitochondrial dysfunction add type B components; and in metformin toxicity, impaired clearance plus mitochondrial inhibition compound any concurrent hypoperfusion, so lactate in these settings reflects integrated injury rather than a single mechanism [^114RPu15] [^116Wodat] [^116xZzQf].

> I should confirm the diagnostic thresholds and interpretation strategy, because misclassification leads to mismanagement. Hyperlactatemia is commonly defined as lactate greater than 2 mmol/L, while lactic acidosis is typically lactate greater than 4–5 mmol/L with pH less than 7.35; however, I need to remember that lactate alone is neither sensitive nor specific for sepsis, so serial measurements and clinical context are essential, and in suspected sepsis, repeating lactate after initial resuscitation helps risk-stratify and guide ongoing care [^1134BsJv] [^112fEYSZ] [^114jA46a].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic implications and avoid overinterpreting single values. Elevated lactate correlates with mortality across critical illness, and in cardiogenic shock, lactate levels at or above 5 mmol/L independently predict higher 30-day mortality beyond shock stage; even mild hyperlactatemia within the "normal" range has been associated with worse outcomes, so trends and clearance matter as much as absolute values, and persistent elevation should prompt escalation of source control and perfusion support rather than reassurance [^112UKkrr] [^114ugaki] [^116pBiWw].

> I need to ensure management advice aligns with causation rather than chasing lactate per se. The cornerstone is to treat the underlying cause: restore perfusion in shock, stop the offending drug, correct thiamine deficiency, provide dialysis for metformin accumulation or severe acidemia, and support failing organs; symptomatic bicarbonate remains controversial, with guidelines advising against routine use for pH greater than 7.15 and no clear benefit even below that threshold in many contexts, so I should reserve buffers for select scenarios and prioritize etiologic therapy and supportive care [^112hz3TN] [^116q9XRK] [^113bMrZm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "lactic acidosis" meant lactate itself generated protons and caused the acidosis; let me reconsider that mechanistic assumption. Modern acid-base physiology clarifies that lactate production consumes protons and is better viewed as a marker of proton-generating ATP hydrolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction rather than the direct acid source, so the acidosis reflects cellular energetics and buffering failure while lactate signals metabolic stress; this does not change clinical interpretation of high lactate as a danger sign, but it corrects a common biochemical misconception [^1115rWWr].

> Let me synthesize the causal landscape succinctly, and I should double-check that I have not omitted key entities. High lactate arises from increased production, decreased clearance, or both; type A drivers include shock, severe hypoxemia, anemia, and carbon monoxide poisoning; type B drivers include metformin, beta-agonists, NRTIs, propylene glycol, thiamine deficiency, liver failure, renal failure, and malignancy; sepsis and cardiogenic shock often blend both, and medications or endogenous catecholamines can amplify lactate even without overt hypoperfusion, so accurate classification and targeted therapy are essential to improve outcomes [^116kvqZe] [^1134BsJv] [^114RPu15].

---

High lactate acidosis is caused by **increased lactate production** (type A) from tissue hypoxia in shock, sepsis, or severe anemia [^114RPu15] [^112cdM3e], and by **impaired lactate clearance** (type B) from hepatic or renal dysfunction, mitochondrial toxins (e.g. metformin, NRTIs), or metabolic disorders [^1134BsJv] [^113wCuWW]. Common triggers include sepsis, cardiogenic or hemorrhagic shock, liver failure, renal impairment, metformin accumulation, and beta-agonists [^114RPu15] [^116q9XRK] [^1151hYvf]. Management focuses on **correcting the underlying cause**, restoring perfusion, and supportive care; sodium bicarbonate is reserved for severe acidemia (pH < 7.1) and does not improve outcomes in most cases [^113bMrZm] [^112hz3TN].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Lactic acidosis arises from **two main mechanisms**:

- **Type A lactic acidosis**: Increased lactate production due to tissue hypoxia from impaired oxygen delivery or utilization [^114RPu15] [^112cdM3e].
- **Type B lactic acidosis**: Impaired lactate clearance or altered metabolism without significant tissue hypoxia, often due to hepatic or renal dysfunction, mitochondrial toxins, or metabolic disorders [^116kvqZe] [^1134BsJv].

## Clinical conditions associated with high lactate acidosis

| **Category** | **Clinical conditions** |
|-|-|
| Type A (hypoxic) | - Sepsis and septic shock [^114RPu15] [^112cdM3e] <br/> - Cardiogenic shock [^112UKkrr] <br/> - Hemorrhagic shock [^notfound] <br/> - Severe anemia [^1134BsJv] <br/> - Carbon monoxide poisoning [^notfound] <br/> - Severe hypoxemia [^1134BsJv] |
| Type B (non-hypoxic) | - Hepatic failure [^1134BsJv] <br/> - Renal failure [^112tXwNA] <br/> - Metformin accumulation (MALA) [^116q9XRK] <br/> - Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) [^113wCuWW] <br/> - Thiamine deficiency [^112nzUo8] <br/> - Malignancy (Warburg effect) [^113F3PGr] <br/> - Propylene glycol toxicity [^notfound] <br/> - Beta-agonists (e.g. albuterol) [^1151hYvf] |

## Medications and substances associated with lactic acidosis

Several **medications and substances** can cause lactic acidosis:

- **Metformin**: Rare but serious; risk increases with renal impairment, hepatic dysfunction, or acute illness [^116q9XRK] [^112TWKig].
- **NRTIs**: Zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, and zalcitabine can cause mitochondrial toxicity and lactic acidosis [^112hz3TN].
- **Propylene glycol**: Solvent in some medications (e.g. lorazepam, diazepam) can cause lactic acidosis, especially in renal impairment [^112hz3TN].
- **Beta-agonists**: Albuterol and other beta-agonists can increase lactate via enhanced glycolysis [^112Va9M8].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

Lactic acidosis is **defined by**:

- **Serum lactate**: > 5 mmol/L [^1136Xc5t].
- **Arterial pH**: < 7.35 [^1134BsJv].
- **Anion gap**: Elevated (> 12 mEq/L) [^notfound].
- **Lactate/pyruvate ratio**: Increased (> 20:1) [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptoms

Patients with lactic acidosis may present with:

- **Nonspecific symptoms**: Malaise, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dyspnea, altered mental status [^116q9XRK].
- **Severe cases**: Hypotension, shock, organ dysfunction, and multi-organ failure [^115gPdzD].

---

## Prognostic implications

Elevated lactate levels are strongly associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients, particularly in sepsis, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock [^113se4Sq] [^112UKkrr]. Persistent **hyperlactatemia** or a **failure to clear lactate** is linked to worse outcomes [^116pBiWw].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on:

- **Identify and treat the underlying cause**: Sepsis, shock, organ failure, medication toxicity [^114iHNUk].
- **Supportive care**: Oxygen, fluids, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation as needed [^116pBiWw].
- **Sodium bicarbonate**: Controversial; reserved for severe acidemia (pH < 7.1) and does not improve outcomes in most cases [^113bMrZm] [^112hz3TN].
- **Dialysis**: For metformin or propylene glycol toxicity, or severe renal impairment [^116q9XRK].

---

High lactate acidosis results from **increased production or impaired clearance of lactate**, with common causes including sepsis, shock, organ failure, and medication toxicity. Management centers on **treating the cause**, restoring perfusion, and supportive care, with bicarbonate reserved for severe acidemia.

LACTIC ACIDOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH METFORMIN THERAPY

Even though elevated metformin concentrations have been proposed to lead to lactic acidosis, there are few data regarding the level predisposing to hyperlactatemia. In fact, multiple studies suggest that elevated circulating lactate levels, often attributed to metformin, may actually not be caused by the drug. First, lactic acidosis occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes more frequently than in the general population; in some reports, the observed rate appears to be similar in patients on metformin versus other glucose-lowering agents. Second, metformin and lactate levels do not necessarily appear to correlate, such that higher metformin concentrations do not consistently occur in those with more severe degrees of lactic acidosis. Finally, metformin levels are not linked to mortality in those who develop lactic acidosis, perhaps reflecting the primary effect of the underlying cause of the acidosis (e.g. hypoxia, hemodynamic compromise) on outcomes rather than incriminating metformin itself.

Although lactic acidosis remains a recognized, albeit rare, adverse event associated with metformin, the number of lactic acidosis cases continues to be very small, particularly when one considers the widespread use of this drug. In the largest updated Cochrane meta-analysis, Salpeter et al. pooled data from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies. Not a single case of lactic acidosis was found in > 70,000 metformin patient-years or > 55,000 nonmetformin person-years. In this analysis, 53% of prospective studies allowed for inclusion of renal insufficiency, but patient-level serum creatinine concentrations were not available for review. Based on statistical inference, the estimated upper limit of true incidence was 4.3 and 5.4 cases per 100,000 patient-years in the metformin and nonmetformin groups, respectively. This investigation suggests that lactic acidosis is extremely rare and the incidence does not differ in those treated with metformin versus other agents.

### Lactic acidosis in sepsis: It's not all anaerobic: implications for diagnosis and management [^114RPu15]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Increased blood lactate concentration (hyperlactatemia) and lactic acidosis (hyperlactatemia and serum pH < 7.35) are common in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, most of the lactate that is produced in shock states is due to inadequate oxygen delivery resulting in tissue hypoxia and causing anaerobic glycolysis. However, lactate formation during sepsis is not entirely related to tissue hypoxia or reversible by increasing oxygen delivery. In this review, we initially outline the metabolism of lactate and etiology of lactic acidosis; we then address the pathophysiology of lactic acidosis in sepsis. We discuss the clinical implications of serum lactate measurement in diagnosis, monitoring, and prognostication in acute and intensive care settings. Finally, we explore treatment of lactic acidosis and its impact on clinical outcome.

### Sepsis-associated hyperlactatemia [^112cdM3e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Why has the tissue hypoxia paradigm emerged and dominated until now?

The clinical syndrome of lactic acidosis was popularized by Huckabee and Weil over five decades ago. These authors proposed that elevated blood lactate levels during experimental and clinical shock states served as a measure of the degree of oxygen deficit and the severity of injury. It became widely believed that, in critically ill patients, when oxygen delivery failed to meet oxygen demand an oxygen debt with global tissue hypoxia and lactic acidosis would ensue. Furthermore, classic teaching describes type A lactic acidosis, which occurs due to inadequate oxygen delivery with the presence of anaerobic glycolysis, and type B lactic acidosis, which occurs in the absence of anaerobic glycolysis and is secondary to altered clearance, malignancy, or drugs. It is widely assumed that type A lactic acidosis is the cause of an elevated lactate concentration in the critically ill patient with an overt or occult hemodynamic disturbance. An increased blood lactate concentration is therefore regarded as evidence of anaerobic metabolism and tissue hypoxia. It follows from this reasoning that patients with an elevated blood lactate level should be treated by increasing oxygen delivery.

### Metabolic acidosis in the critically ill: part 2. causes and treatment [^114iHNUk]. Anaesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

The correct identification of the cause, and ideally the individual acid, responsible for metabolic acidosis in the critically ill ensures rational management. In Part 2 of this review, we examine the elevated (corrected) anion gap acidoses (lactic, ketones, uraemic and toxin ingestion) and contrast them with nonelevated conditions (bicarbonate wasting, renal tubular acidoses and iatrogenic hyperchloraemia) using readily available base excess and anion gap techniques. The potentially erroneous interpretation of elevated lactate signifying cell ischaemia is highlighted. We provide diagnostic and therapeutic guidance when faced with a high anion gap acidosis, for example pyroglutamate, in the common clinical scenario 'I can't identify the acid — but I know it's there'. The evidence that metabolic acidosis affects outcomes and thus warrants correction is considered and we provide management guidance including extracorporeal removal and fomepizole therapy.

Strengths and Limitations

The strengths of the analysis are its inclusion of 2 independent, large, unselected cohorts of patients with CS. Independent validation in prospective cohorts is warranted. The thresholds for categorized analysis were taken from clinical experience rather than calculating optimal cutoff values. The fact that lactate level and blood pH were predictors of mortality when considered as continuous parameters validates their relevance. While it is tempting to speculate on the mechanisms leading to early death, the study merely describes associations. It remains entirely unclear whether interventions targeting blood pH or lactate levels can improve outcomes in CS. Ideal interventions would target upstream drivers of hemodynamic and metabolic compromise (ie, hypoperfusion) rather than their consequences, such as lactic acidosis and systemic acidemia. While the analysis of 2 large cohorts validates our findings, performing separate analyses within each cohort has some shortcomings, such as decreased statistical power compared with combining the cohorts. We did not have data on treatments for acidosis, nor did we have comprehensive data regarding all measurements reflecting acid‐base balance or serial measures of acidosis; we combined both arterial and venous lactate and pH measurements, leading to some variability.

In conclusion, severe lactic acidosis and systemic acidemia are important predictors of short‐term mortality in patients with CS independent of the severity of shock using the SCAI shock stages. Patients with CS and higher lactate level or lower blood pH are more likely to die across the spectrum of shock severity. As measured by the lactate level, the severity of hypoperfusion appears more important for predicting mortality than the extent of intrinsic compensation, as measured by the blood pH. Arterial pH and lactate levels should be routinely measured in patients with CS and reported in clinical studies. The presence of severe lactic acidosis or severe systemic acidemia should be considered risk modifiers that can identify high‐risk patients when added to the SCAI shock classification.

### Do patients die with or from metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA)? Systematic review and meta-analysis of pH and lactate as predictors of mortality in MALA [^114fMnJo]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) may occur after acute metformin overdose, or from therapeutic use in patients with renal compromise. The mortality is high, historically 50% and more recently 25%. In many disease states, lactate concentration is strongly associated with mortality. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate the utility of pH and lactate concentration in predicting mortality in patients with MALA.

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from their inception to April 2019 for case reports, case series, prospective, and retrospective studies investigating mortality in patients with MALA. Cases and studies were reviewed by all authors and included if they reported data on pH, lactate, and outcome. Where necessary, authors of studies were contacted for patient-level data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for pH and lactate for predicting mortality in patients with MALA.

Results

Forty-four studies were included encompassing 170 cases of MALA with median age of 68.5 years old. Median pH and lactate were 7.02 mmol/L and 14.45 mmol/L, respectively. Overall mortality was 36.2% (95% CI 29.6–43.94). Neither lactate nor pH was a good predictor of mortality among patients with MALA. The area under the ROC curve for lactate and pH were 0.59 (0.51–0.68) and 0.43 (0.34–0.52), respectively.

Conclusion

Our review found higher mortality from MALA than seen in recent studies. This may be due to variation in standard medical practice both geographically and across the study interval, sample size, misidentification of MALA for another disease process and vice versa, confounding by selection and reporting biases, and treatment intensity (e.g., hemodialysis) influenced by degree of pH and lactate derangement. The ROC curves showed poor predictive power of either lactate or pH for mortality in MALA. With the exception of patients with acute metformin overdose, patients with MALA usually have coexisting precipitating illnesses such as sepsis or renal failure, though lactate from MALA is generally higher than would be considered survivable for those disease states on their own. It is possible that mortality is more related to that coexisting illness than MALA itself, and many patients die with MALA rather than from MALA. Additional work looking solely at MALA in healthy patients with acute metformin overdose may show a closer relationship between lactate, pH, and mortality.

Clinical Scenarios

Lactic Acidosis

Unbalanced lactate production or consumption leads to elevated lactate levels, known as hyperlactatemia (lactate > 2 mmol/L). Lactic acidosis is defined by a serum lactate > 4 mmol/L and pH < 7.35. Hyperlactatemia can be further subdivided based on the etiology of the elevated lactate level. Type A hyperlactatemia includes states of dysoxia and decreased tissue perfusion, as seen in shock, significant anemia, and severe hypoxia. Type B hyperlactatemia broadly encompasses disorders of oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria, sepsis, ineffective lactate clearance in the liver, and congenital inborn errors of metabolism. Septic shock is a common cause of hyperlactatemia in critically ill patients encountered in the ED. Hypotension leads to increased anaerobic glycolysis (type A) and decreased hepatic clearance of lactate. Acidemia also shunts excess pyruvate towards lactate production and prevents lactate from entering the Cori cycle for gluconeogenesis. Sepsis can cause significant hyperlactatemia in the absence of hypoperfusion through accelerated glycolysis in the absence of hypotension (type B).

DISCUSSION

Main Findings

This 2‐center cohort study identifies strong and independent associations of blood lactate levels and blood pH with short‐term mortality in patients with CS, including those with and without ACS or CA. This effect was present even when accounting for the severity of CS using the SCAI shock classification, which is notable because lactate levels were used to define the SCAI shock stages in both cohorts. Despite substantial differences in the clinical characteristics of the cohorts reflecting higher shock severity in the UHZ cohort, the associations between lactate levels and blood pH and survival were remarkably consistent in these 2 large, unselected cohorts of patients with CS from various etiologies. These findings suggest that both pH and lactate concentrations should be considered to estimate mortality in patients with CS, independent from shock severity per se. Because these commonly available laboratory biomarkers provide added risk stratification on top of shock severity, it may be useful to incorporate these variables into clinical definitions of the SCAI shock stages.

Lactate and Mortality in Cardiogenic Shock

Our finding that an elevated lactate ≥ 5 mmol/L is strongly associated with short‐term mortality is consistent with the published literature. Lactate levels are an essential marker of hypoperfusion that have been incorporated into the 2 most widely used CS risk stratification scores. Lactate levels are a major predictor of mortality in patients with CS and have recently been identified as one of the most important blood biomarkers for predicting CS outcomes. Although both lactate levels and blood pH were strongly associated with mortality individually, the relationship was more robust for lactate when both were incorporated into the same multivariable model. This implies that the severity of lactic acidosis, reflecting the magnitude and duration (area under the curve) of hypoperfusion, is the more important physiologic variable. This mirrors a prior analysis of patients with CS from an overlapping MCR cardiac intensive care unit cohort, which found that the lactate level alone outperformed a composite acidosis score including blood pH, base excess, and anion gap. Lactic acidosis is a critical diagnostic criterion for hypoperfusion used widely to assign the SCAI shock stage, as in our study. Nonetheless, patients with CS with higher lactate levels are more likely to die in every SCAI shock stage, implying that lactate levels provide a graded relationship with mortality risk beyond other measures of shock severity. Patients with CS with severe lactic acidosis in a given SCAI shock stage are at elevated risk and might be more appropriately considered as having a higher SCAI shock stage.

### L-lactic acidosis: pathophysiology, classification, and causes; emphasis on biochemical and metabolic basis [^116kvqZe]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

L-lactic acidosis (L-LA) is the most common cause of metabolic acidosis in the critical care setting, which has been associated with a large increase in mortality. The purpose of this article is to provide clinicians with an overview of the biochemical and metabolic background required to understand the different pathophysiological mechanisms that may lead to the development of L-LA. We propose a classification based on whether the pathophysiology of L-LA is due predominantly to increased production or decreased removal of L-lactic acid. In this article, we provide an overview of the biochemical and metabolic aspects of glucose oxidation, the production and removal of L-lactic acid, and a discussion of the pathophysiology of the various causes of L-LA.

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^116pBiWw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypoperfusion and Hemometabolic Shock

While the severity of lactic acidosis is clearly an important prognostic marker in CS, it remains uncertain how to use this information to tailor therapy. Impaired lactate clearance (defined as a persistently elevated or rising lactate over time) may be an even more powerful prognostic marker than an elevated admission lactate level alone. Indeed, both MCR and UHZ incorporated a rising lactate level into our definitions of SCAI shock stage D, and patients in SCAI shock stage D had substantially higher mortality than patients with lower CS severity. For this reason, worsening lactic acidosis in patients with CS should trigger an escalation of therapy to alleviate ongoing hypoperfusion. Severe systemic acidemia is known to compromise the cardiovascular response to catecholamines and therefore may directly contribute to worsening or refractory shock; this explains the high prevalence of low blood pH among patients in SCAI shock stage E.

Hypoperfusion causes systemic acidemia directly via lactic acidosis and often causes kidney injury that further compromises acid‐base homeostasis and buffering of the metabolic acid load; in addition, respiratory failure is common and can further impair compensation. These metabolic derangements contribute to a worsening shock state termed hemometabolic shock. Breaking this shock‐acidosis‐shock vicious cycle using alkali therapy (such as sodium bicarbonate) to reverse systemic acidemia seems logical, but this approach remains controversial and has not been clearly demonstrated to improve outcomes in critically ill patients. Greater benefits of alkali may be observed in patients with acute kidney injury, and we anticipate that patients with CS with lower blood pH might more likely to benefit. Alternatively, adjustments in mechanical ventilator settings to improve alveolar ventilation and clear carbon dioxide may be necessary. For this reason, routine measurement of arterial pH (ideally a full arterial blood gas analysis) in addition to the lactate level is appropriate for initial risk stratification and management of patients with CS. A therapeutic trial of alkali therapy can be considered for patients with CS with severe systemic acidemia from metabolic acidosis if they are not responding appropriately to standard doses of vasopressors, but future studies are need to determine the benefit of this approach.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^11791jsY]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, subgroup analysis of patients with metabolic acidosis revealed that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve the survival outcomes for pediatric patients, regardless of whether they have lactic acidosis or non-lactic acidosis. However, it was observed that sodium bicarbonate treatment effectively reduces the mortality risk of patients with hyperchloremia (chloride ≥ 113 mmol/L) in both types of patients, while it increases the mortality risk of patients without hyperchloremia (chloride < 107 mmol/L). This indicates that the level of lactate does not influence the impact of chloride levels on sodium bicarbonate treatment.

Among non-LA patients with a chloride level of ≥ 113 mmol/L, there was no statistically significant difference in the in-hospital mortality risk between patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment after matching and those who did not. This is because the mortality rate of non-LA patients themselves is relatively low, and the reduction in sample size after matching leads to a decrease in statistical power. Nevertheless, the mortality rate of patients who received sodium bicarbonate treatment was still lower. Findings of this study suggest that in pediatric metabolic acidosis, if chloride is markedly elevated, sodium bicarbonate therapy might be considered even if lactate is high. Whereas if chloride is normal, clinicians should be more cautious and ensure other treatments are prioritized.

The categorization of metabolic acidosis patients based on the presence of lactic acidosis divides them into two groups with potentially distinct acidosis mechanisms. There is a considerable difference in the acidic components contributing to pH reduction in these two group patients. In vitro cytological studies have demonstrated that the body's response to acidosis induced by lactate or hydrochloric acid involves different cytokine reactions, suggesting that the response to and harm caused by various acid components may vary. Research on prognostic indicators for patients has shown that the severity of acidosis, as measured by pH or standard base excess, is not independently linked to hospital mortality when controlling for the causal anion (lactate, chloride, or others). The anion causing the metabolic acidosis may play a more significant role in determining outcomes than the pH itself. Different levels or categories of causal anions can result in significantly diverse prognoses, although the importance of the acidosis cause has been emphasized in previous research. Nevertheless, this study found that sodium bicarbonate can decrease the mortality risk in patients with both lactic and non-lactic acidosis with hyperchloremia. This suggests that the mechanism of action of sodium bicarbonate may not be dependent on the components causing the acidosis and is effective in correcting acidosis resulting from multiple pathological mechanisms in hyperchloremia.

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^1122C8Ft]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) is associated with poor survival despite optimal contemporary therapy. CS exists on a spectrum of severity, with a greater degree of hemodynamic compromise correlating to worse outcomes. The degree of hemodynamic compromise during CS can be graded using the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) shock classification. Shock severity defined by the SCAI shock classification is associated with mortality in patients with CS and unselected patients treated in cardiac intensive care units. Despite the potential to improve hemodynamics, an array of increasingly sophisticated percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices have failed to improve survival in randomized trials. Selection of appropriate patients, that is, those in whom the restoration of cardiac output will reverse CS, seems paramount to improve outcomes with mechanical circulatory support.

Noncardiovascular factors influence both prognosis and response to treatment in patients with CS, affecting the observed efficacy of tested therapies independent of shock severity. During CS, tissue hypoperfusion and organ failure lead to metabolic deficiencies and a treatment‐resistant hemometabolic CS phenotype. Simple blood biomarkers can capture this, as lactic acidosis (defined as an elevated blood lactate level) is a well‐established predictor of mortality in patients with CS. Likewise, systemic acidemia (defined as a low blood pH) predicts mortality in patients with CS and may quantify the severity of the hemometabolic disturbance. To determine whether lactic acidosis (elevated lactate level) and systemic acidemia (low blood pH) reflect different aspects of hypoperfusion and metabolic compromise, or whether they are markers for similar biological processes, we analyzed associations between the severity of systemic acidemia and lactic acidosis on 30‐day mortality in 2 cohorts of patients with CS from mixed etiologies stratified on the basis of the SCAI shock severity scheme.

### Endpoints of resuscitation [^115HSs6C]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the multiple causes of the shock state, all causes possess the common abnormality of oxygen supply not meeting tissue metabolic demands. Compensatory mechanisms may mask the severity of hypoxemia and hypoperfusion, since catecholamines and extracellular fluid shifts initially compensate for the physiologic derangements associated with patients in shock. Despite the achievement of normal physiologic parameters after resuscitation, significant metabolic acidosis may continue to be present in the tissues, as evidenced by increased lactate levels and metabolic acidosis. This review discusses the major endpoints of resuscitation in clinical use.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^116kvFRd]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Deleterious hemodynamic effects of severe lactic acidosis are largely suggested by experimental data, although not fully confirmed by human studies. Pending the effectiveness of an etiological treatment, there is no efficient and validated symptomatic therapy at hand to correct a life-threatening metabolic acidosis. Upcoming research in this field should be focused on the optimal strategy to treat severe metabolic acidosis, including symptomatic therapy.

### Metformin and lactic acidosis during shock: just the tip of the iceberg? [^116xZzQf]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Letter

Doenyas-Barak et al. concluded recently in Critical Care that with similar high lactate levels (> 10 mmol/L) the prognosis of metformin users compared with non-users was favorable during admission to the emergency department with septic shock (in-hospital mortality, 57% versus 88%, P < 0.001). This observation and similar findings reported previously are suggestive of a role for metformin as a lactate generation amplifier. However, in this study, causality cannot be proven, since without metformin concentration measurements a dose-response analysis is not possible.

Despite the dramatic clinical presentation of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), this study also underlines the fact that its prognosis is better than that of similarly severe lactic acidosis of other origins. With an incidence of approximately 5 cases per 100,000 patient-years, MALA is considered an exceedingly rare complication of chronic metformin therapy. Metformin is excreted unchanged by the kidneys, predisposing patients with renal insufficiency to the development of MALA. Several authors suggest that the inclusion of renal impairment as a contraindication for metformin use should be reconsidered, and this may increase the number of patients at risk for developing MALA.

The findings reported in this study shed new light on our current understanding of the impact of metformin on lactate production. Given the large difference in mortality between the two groups, it can be concluded that the prognostic value of lactate is largely altered by metformin use in patients presenting with shock. Evidently, a relatively small sample size of patients (44 metformin users and 118 non-users) is sufficient to observe differences of such a magnitude in survival. Although the effect may not be as pronounced as in the present study, we believe that metformin may also elevate lactate levels in patients presenting with less severe lactic acidosis. Therefore, a study comparing the prognosis of critically ill metformin users with non-users in a large matched cohort based on increasing lactate levels seems useful.

Because the effect of metformin on lactate levels in such a population may not be immediately obvious, we suspect that hyperlactatemia partly induced by metformin is often not considered by physicians caring for patients presenting with critical conditions. This study might therefore have identified only the tip of the iceberg regarding the effect of metformin on lactate levels. For clinicians to be able to identify and treat MALA in a more timely manner, lactate levels should always be measured in the emergency department or even in the prehospital setting.

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^115ArMsh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis is associated with mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). Elevated lactate levels and systemic acidemia (low blood pH) have both been proposed as drivers of death. We, therefore, analyzed the association of both high lactate concentrations and low blood pH with 30‐day mortality in patients with CS.

Methods and Results

This was a 2‐center historical cohort study of unselected patients with CS with available data for admission lactate level or blood pH. CS severity was graded using the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention (SCAI) shock classification. All‐cause survival at 30 days was analyzed using Kaplan‐Meier curves and Cox proportional‐hazards analysis. There were 1814 patients with CS (mean age, 67.3 years; 68.5% men); 51.8% had myocardial infarction and 53.0% had cardiac arrest. The distribution of SCAI shock stages was B, 10.8%; C, 30.7%; D, 38.1%; and E, 18.7%. In both cohorts, higher lactate or lower pH predicted a higher risk of adjusted 30‐day mortality. Patients with a lactate ≥ 5 mmol/L or pH < 7.2 were at increased risk of adjusted 30‐day mortality; patients with both lactate ≥ 5 mmol/L and pH < 7.2 had the highest risk of adjusted 30‐day mortality. Patients in SCAI shock stages C, D, and E had higher 30‐day mortality in each SCAI shock stage if they had lactate ≥ 5 mmol/L or pH < 7.2, particularly if they met both criteria.

Conclusions

Higher lactate and lower pH predict mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock beyond standard measures of shock severity. Severe lactic acidosis may serve as a risk modifier for the SCAI shock classification. Definitions of refractory or hemometabolic shock should include high lactate levels and low blood pH.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^113bMrZm]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a very common biological issue for shock patients. Experimental data clearly demonstrate that metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis, participates in the reduction of cardiac contractility and in the vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors through various mechanisms. However, the contributions of each mechanism responsible for these deleterious effects have not been fully determined and their respective consequences on organ failure are still poorly defined, particularly in humans. Despite some convincing experimental data, no clinical trial has established the level at which pH becomes deleterious for hemodynamics. Consequently, the essential treatment for lactic acidosis in shock patients is to correct the cause. It is unknown, however, whether symptomatic pH correction is beneficial in shock patients. The latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend against the use of buffer therapy with pH ≥ 7.15 and issue no recommendation for pH levels < 7.15. Furthermore, based on strong experimental and clinical evidence, sodium bicarbonate infusion alone is not recommended for restoring pH. Indeed, bicarbonate induces carbon dioxide generation and hypocalcemia, both cardiovascular depressant factors. This review addresses the principal hemodynamic consequences of shock-associated lactic acidosis. Despite the lack of formal evidence, this review also highlights the various adapted supportive therapy options that could be putatively added to causal treatment in attempting to reverse the hemodynamic consequences of shock-associated lactic acidosis.

### Lactate in the intensive care unit: pyromaniac, sentinel or fireman? [^112PViFC]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Lactate, indispensable substrate of mammalian intermediary metabolism, allows shuttling of carbons and reducing power between cells and organs at a high turnover rate. Lactate is, therefore, not deleterious, although an increase in its concentration is often a sensitive sign of alteration in energy homeostasis, a rise in it being frequently related to poor prognosis. Such an increase, however, actually signifies an attempt by the body to cope with a new energy status. Hyperlactatemia, therefore, most often represents an adaptive response to an acute energy disorder. Investigation of lactate metabolism at the bedside is limited to the determination of its concentration. Lactate metabolism and acid-base homeostasis are both closely linked to cellular energy metabolism, acidosis being potentially a cause or a consequence of cellular energy deficit.

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin- associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin- associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112TWKig]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent that has been shown to reduce total mortality compared to other anti-hyperglycemic agents, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin, however, is thought to increase the risk of lactic acidosis, and has been considered to be contraindicated in many chronic hypoxemic conditions that may be associated with lactic acidosis, such as cardiovascular, renal, hepatic and pulmonary disease, and advancing age.

Objectives

To assess the incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis, and to evaluate blood lactate levels, for those on metformin treatment compared to placebo or non-metformin therapies.

Search Strategy

A comprehensive search was performed of electronic databases to identify studies of metformin treatment. The search was augmented by scanning references of identified articles, and by contacting principal investigators.

Selection Criteria

Prospective trials and observational cohort studies in patients with type 2 diabetes of least one month duration were included if they evaluated metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, compared to placebo or any other glucose-lowering therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

The incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis was recorded as cases per patient-years, for metformin treatment and for non-metformin treatments. The upper limit for the true incidence of cases was calculated using Poisson statistics. In a second analysis lactate levels were measured as a net change from baseline or as mean treatment values (basal and stimulated by food or exercise) for treatment and comparison groups. The pooled results were recorded as a weighted mean difference (WMD) in mmol/L, using the fixed-effect model for continuous data.

Main Results

Pooled data from 347 comparative trials and cohort studies revealed no cases of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis in 70,490 patient-years of metformin use or in 55,451 patients-years in the non-metformin group. Using Poisson statistics the upper limit for the true incidence of lactic acidosis per 100,000 patient-years was 4.3 cases in the metformin group and 5.4 cases in the non-metformin group. There was no difference in lactate levels, either as mean treatment levels or as a net change from baseline, for metformin compared to non-metformin therapies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from prospective comparative trials or from observational cohort studies that metformin is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, or with increased levels of lactate, compared to other anti-hyperglycemic treatments.

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: a systematic review of case reports and case series [^112FXMtV]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings are well consistent with a recent comprehensive review by Calello et al. in which a decision making algorithm for RRT in MALA was proposed. The decision to initiate RRT is mainly triggered by serum lactate level and refractory severe acidosis. The proposed cut-off value of lactate, 20 mmol/L, coincides with our dose-response analysis indicating a linear increase in mortality, particularly at lactate concentrations greater than 20 mmol/L. The role of serum lactate in metformin-related acidosis remains controversial from the diagnostic perspective as the elevation of lactate are usually induced from mutually reinforcing factors, for instance, predisposing impaired kidney function and resultant acidemia-related circulatory failure. But reversely, serum lactate could serve as a useful integrated marker to guide the initiation and adjustment of RRT. Compared to the general intensive care unit (ICU) population in which baseline serum lactate level is a reliable predictor of ICU mortality, the proposed lactate threshold for an increased mortality risk, 20 mmol/L, is much higher than the usual alarming lactate range of 2.0–4.0 mmol/L in patient's lactemia mainly due to hypo-perfusion (e.g. sepsis and trauma). Such discrepancy may reflect the unique pathogenesis of MALA – cellular energy failure and impaired redox state. More than half of the study population had hypothermia on arrival at the care hospital. This provides indirect evidence of cellular energy failure, as thermogenesis driven by ATP turnover would be compromised in MALA. In the era of practicing individualized medicine, the bottom-line is that the modality of RRT should match to the patient's hemodynamic stability and the dosing of RRT has to properly correct acidosis and avoid iatrogenic hypernatremia, and should be adjusted to meet patient's metabolic demand (exemplified in Additional file 1: Figure S4). To address this current knowledge gap regarding the RRT prescription in MALA patients with severe acute kidney injury (e.g. Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) stage 3), an international consortium is needed to prospectively enroll patients worldwide using a standardized case report form to record detailed information about the metformin toxicokinetics and the three domains of RRT including mode, dose, and timing.

### Blood lactate monitoring in critically ill patients: a systematic health technology assessment [^112Ld1ix]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To decide whether the use of blood lactate monitoring in critical care practice is appropriate. We performed a systematic health technology assessment as blood lactate monitoring has been implemented widely but its clinical value in critically ill patients has never been evaluated properly.

Data Source

PubMed, other databases, and citation review.

Study Selection

We searched for lactate combined with critically ill patients as the target patient population. Two reviewers independently selected studies based on relevance for the following questions: Does lactate measurement: 1) perform well in a laboratory setting? 2) provide information in a number of clinical situations? 3) relate to metabolic acidosis? 4) increase workers' confidence? 5) alter therapeutic decisions? 6) result in benefit to patients? 7) result in similar benefits in your own setting? 8) result in benefits which are worth the extra costs?

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We concluded that blood lactate measurement in critically ill patients: 1) is accurate in terms of measurement technique but adequate understanding of the (an)aerobic etiology is required for its correct interpretation; 2) provides not only diagnostic but also important prognostic information; 3) should be measured directly instead of estimated from other acid-base variables; 4) has an unknown effect on healthcare workers' confidence; 5) can alter therapeutic decisions; 6) could potentially improve patient outcome when combined with a treatment algorithm to optimize oxygen delivery, but this has only been shown indirectly; 7) is likely to have similar benefits in critical care settings worldwide; and 8) has an unknown cost-effectiveness.

Conclusions

The use of blood lactate monitoring has a place in risk-stratification in critically ill patients, but it is unknown whether the routine use of lactate as a resuscitation end point improves outcome. This warrants randomized controlled studies on the efficacy of lactate-directed therapy.

Lactate — initial ED testing, thresholds, and repeat strategy are specified as follows: We support initially measuring blood lactate levels in the ED (venous or arterial) and repeating lactate measurement after initial resuscitation only if elevated above 4 mmol/L or if there is suspicion of clinical deterioration, and we endorse the use of venous lactate specimens. Convenient thresholds used to note abnormal elevation are more than 2.0 mmol/L and more than 4.0 mmol/L; the most convincing data of benefit from repeat measurements studied those with an initial lactate level of at least 4 mmol/L, with a common practice of measuring lactate in 2-hour intervals and using a 10% relative decline between measurements to indicate improvement. Blood lactate level is not a specific diagnostic test for sepsis, and elevations correlate with a higher risk of short-term mortality.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^117Kc6Vh]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The use of alkaline agents to correct acidosis in pediatric patients is common in clinical practice, with sodium bicarbonate being a widely used alkaline drug. However, it is concerning that the results of multi-center randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews suggest that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not improve overall patient survival. Treating metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate in the absence of severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.15) not only lacks benefits but may also be harmful.

Chloride plays a crucial role in acid–base balance and metabolism. Plasma pH results from kidney bicarbonate synthesis and excretion of chloride, maintaining the homeostatic balance of the blood CO₂/bicarbonate buffer. Bicarbonate deficiency and chloride excess are essentially two sides of the same coin. Theoretically, it is reasonable to assume that sodium bicarbonate treatment could benefit patients with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Promisingly, recent findings of Liu et al. have supported this hypothesis regarding pediatric patients' survival for the first time. They identified that sodium bicarbonate treatment significantly improves the survival rate of metabolic acidosis patients with hyperchloremia (chloride ≥ 113 mmol/L). Still, it increases the risk of death in non-hyperchloremic (chloride < 107 mmol/L) metabolic acidosis patients.

Lactic acidosis is a common form of metabolic acidosis, representing half of all cases. Elevated lactate levels strongly correlate with mortality. Research indicates that mortality rates are twice as high in lactic acidosis cases compared to those without, which has attracted considerable attention from researchers. Therefore, building on the work conducted by Liu et al. this study aimed to analyze the prognosis of pediatric patients treated with sodium bicarbonate and its interaction with chloride levels by classifying them into two subgroups: lactic acidosis and non-lactic acidosis.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^114YK54L]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Rationale

Our intent was to identify a cohort of patients in which lactic acidosis was suspected but for whom other acid–base abnormalities might be present. Focusing on this group of patients permitted us to limit our analysis to a subgroup with a high incidence of metabolic acidosis and a high risk of death. Describing the incidence and impact of various forms of acidosis in this cohort is potentially more clinically relevant than in the entire intensive care unit (ICU) population.

We divided this cohort into two groups depending on the presence or absence of a metabolic acidosis, where SBE < −2 mEq/L determined metabolic acidosis. The metabolic acidosis group was further subdivided into groups depending on the anion contributing to the majority of the acidosis.

Data abstraction

After approval from the Investigational Review Board of the University of Pittsburgh we searched the database of Medical Archival Systems Inc. (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) from 1 January 2001 to 30 June 2002 for all ICU admissions at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Oakland, PA. We selected cases on the following criteria. First, clinicians caring for each patient suspected the presence of lactic acidosis and obtained an analysis for arterial blood gas (ABG) and serum lactate. In the hospitals included in this study, to obtain a lactate level a physician has to order one specifically. There are no routine, standing orders or protocols for lactate measurement. Thus, blood lactate measurements are usually obtained only when there is a suspicion of lactic acidosis. Next, to account for all ions, electrolytes had to be drawn within four hours (0.8 ± 2, mean ± SD) hours), and calcium, magnesium and phosphorus within 24 hours (mean 1.3 ± 4.6 hours) of the referenced ABG and an albumin level at some time during the hospitalization. If more than one albumin value was recorded, the lowest value was used to avoid spurious elevations due to possible resuscitation with albumin. If the patient had more than one ABG that fitted these criteria, the ABG with the highest lactate level was used. Finally, if there was more than one data set of electrolytes that fitted around the index ABG, the data set with an absolute time frame closest to the indexed ABG was used. Data could be collected at any time that the patient fitted these criteria. A few patients might have actually had the highest lactate level while in the Emergency Department or on the general wards; however, we included only patients who were ultimately admitted to an ICU.

### Lactic acidosis in a critically ill patient: not always sepsis [^112a62Ar]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis in the emergency department and other hospital settings is typically due to tissue hypoxia with sepsis being the most common cause. However, in patients with persistently elevated lactate without evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery, type B lactic acidosis should be considered. We report the case of a 12-year-old boy with relapsed and refractory pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who presented in distress with tachycardia, history of fever, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. The patient had severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate upon arrival to the emergency department. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and intravenous antibiotics, the patient's acidosis worsened. Serial blood cultures were negative, and he was eventually diagnosed with type B lactic acidosis secondary to relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^116HnEKA]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Is lactic acidosis harmful for cardiovascular function?

Regulation of the intracellular and extracellular pH of cardiac or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is essential for the maintenance of a stable hemodynamic status. As alluded to above, regardless of the mechanism involved, lactate generation in shock states leads to a drop in intracellular and extracellular pH and most often to hemodynamic failure. Whether this severe lactic acidosis is a causal contributor to multiple organ failure or simply a biomarker of the patient's critical state remains an ongoing debate. In this situation, severe lactic acidosis in experimental studies always causes negative effects on cardiovascular function while its correction negates its protective effects. Again, no human study has so far clearly replicated these same experimental findings.

In the following sections, the hemodynamic consequences of lactic acidosis at both the cellular and functional level are described. However, a cautious interpretation must be made of the available data. In fact, a large portion of the published experimental data used non-organic acid to induce metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the number of relevant and published studies centered on the effects of acidosis induced by an accumulation of extracellular lactate reducing SID and lowering extracellular pH by proton generation is somewhat limited. By hypothetical reasoning, it is usually accepted that the effects of lactic acidosis may overlap with those of metabolic acidosis. Nevertheless, in the following sections, the manner in which acidosis is induced will be specified for each included reference; that is, the hypoxic lactic acidosis model (LAM) or non-organic acidosis model (NOAM). It is likely that some of the hemodynamic effects reported in hypoxic LAMs are also induced in part by hypoxia. However, the latter remains the most widely used model to induce an endogenous and homogenous shock-associated lactic acidosis. In addition, when acidosis is induced via NOAM, the cited text will systematically carry the mention that the study involved metabolic acidosis including lactic acidosis.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113qwkTi]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

An inconsistent relationship has been reported between acid–base abnormalities, their treatment, and outcomes in critically ill patients. Some studies have suggested an independent association between low pH or standard base excess (SBE) and mortality, whereas others have not.

We have recently shown that hemodynamically stable rats with sepsis become hypotensive after infusion of dilute HCl. Similarly we have found decreased survival time in rats with elevated serum chloride levels that were exposed to lethal doses of lipopolysaccharide, as well as different cytokine responses to acidosis induced by lactate or HCl in cell cultures. We therefore propose that the etiologic anion of metabolic acidosis (lactate, chloride, or others) may be a more important determinant of outcome than the pH itself.

Although lactic acidosis has attracted considerable study in critically ill patients, metabolic acidosis can result from a variety of conditions. Although the existing literature does not suggest a strong relationship between the type of acidosis and outcome, traditional methods of classifying and analyzing acid–base abnormalities have significant limitations, especially in critically ill patients. In particular, studies have usually failed to identify the effects that causative anions (for example lactate, chloride, or all others) have on their resulting pH and SBE. Data may be reported as 'non-lactate metabolic acidosis' or 'anion gap metabolic acidosis' without identifying a predominant source. By using a physical–chemical approach to quantify unmeasured anions accurately, coupled with multivariable logistic regression, we believe that a more rigorous characterization of acid–base disorders and their clinical significance can be achieved. Our objective was to determine the effect of different etiologies of metabolic acidosis on hospital mortality and length of stay in critically ill patients suspected of having lactic acidosis. The hypothesis was that the various etiologies of metabolic acidosis have unique mortality and morbidity rates associated with them.

### Lactic acidosis and severe septic shock in metformin users: a cohort study [^1136Xc5t]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis, defined as plasma lactate concentration greater than 5 mM and blood pH lower than 7.35, is common among emergency room (ER) and intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Lactic acidosis generally results from marked tissue hypoperfusion in shock or follows cardiopulmonary arrest; and as such, serves as an indicator of increased mortality risk. Elevated serum lactate is associated with increased mortality, independent of organ failure and shock. Metformin, which is currently considered the first choice for oral treatment of type 2 diabetes, may interfere with lactate metabolism. However, the prognosis among metformin users, compared to nonusers, of severe sepsis, with highly elevated lactate, is unclear.

The causes of lactic acidosis can be divided into those associated with obviously impaired tissue oxygenation (type A) and those in which systemic impairment in oxygenation does not exist or is not readily apparent (type B). The accumulation of lactate is usually due to enhanced pyruvate production; reduced pyruvate conversion to carbon dioxide and water, or to glucose; and an altered redox state within the cell, in which the pyruvate/lactate ratio shifts toward lactate. Lactic acidosis induced by metformin is typical, but a rare form of type B lactic acidosis, termed metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA). When lactic acidosis is diagnosed in a patient treated with metformin, but metformin overdose is not detected, the term metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) better describes the condition. The exact cellular mechanism responsible for lactate accumulation under metformin treatment was unclear for many years, but a recent trial revealed that metformin selectively inhibits the mitochondrial isoform of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glycerophosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). As a result, cytosolic DHAP is reduced and the cytosolic NAD–NADH ratio is increased. Cellular accumulation of NAD inhibits the conversion of lactate to pyruvate (limits the use of lactate as gluconeogenic precursors) and culminates in increased plasma concentration of lactate. Metformin also interacts in a dose-dependent manner with hepatic and extrahepatic mitochondrial enzymes, and this inhibits global oxygen consumption.

### Type A versus type B lactic acidosis in the context of undiagnosed B-cell lymphoma [^113F3PGr]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lactic acidosis, characterised by an imbalance between lactate production and clearance, is classified into type A and type B. Type A is associated with tissue hypoxia and shock, while type B occurs without hypoxia, often due to metabolic disturbances, such as cancer-related metabolic reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect. This case series presents two patients with undiagnosed B-cell lymphoma who exhibited distinct forms of lactic acidosis. The first patient, with septic shock and end-organ hypoperfusion, developed type A lactic acidosis, with escalating lactate levels despite aggressive resuscitation. The second patient, with stable haemodynamics but persistently elevated lactate, exhibited type B lactic acidosis, likely due to the Warburg effect of lymphoma. These cases underscore the importance of differentiating between type A and type B lactic acidosis, as the underlying aetiology guides treatment strategies. Early recognition of the cause is crucial for optimal management and patient outcomes, particularly in malignancy-associated metabolic disturbances.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^1151hYvf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea and elevated lactate levels, prompting a comprehensive differential diagnosis to determine the underlying cause of lactic acidosis. Sepsis was initially suspected due to elevated lactate, but negative blood and urine cultures, normal inflammatory markers and haemodynamic stability ruled it out. Acute heart failure exacerbation was considered given the history of congestive heart failure, but the absence of pulmonary oedema, orthopnoea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea reduced this likelihood. Pulmonary embolism was another concern due to the patient's atrial fibrillation history; however, a CT angiogram was negative. COPD exacerbation-induced hypoxia was evaluated, but oxygen saturation improved with supplemental oxygen, mitigating severe tissue hypoxia as the primary cause. Metabolic disorders and drug toxicity were excluded based on normal metabolic panels and the absence of evidence for overdose. Ultimately, the elevated lactate was linked to frequent albuterol administration.

Treatment

The patient was diagnosed with a COPD exacerbation and initially received an hour-long nebulised albuterol treatment in the emergency department, along with intravenous fluid boluses and broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime. Upon hospital admission, he was treated with intravenous steroids, supplemental oxygen and scheduled albuterol/ipratropium treatments. After excluding common causes of lactic acidosis, albuterol-induced lactic acidosis was diagnosed. The frequency of albuterol nebuliser treatments was reduced from every 4 to 8 hours. Over the next 48 hours, his lactate level decreased to 2.1 mmol/L (figure 3).

### Risk of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^117A6Wd6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The results of the UK Prospective Diabetes Study indicate that metformin treatment is associated with a reduction in total mortality compared to other anti-hyperglycemic treatments. Metformin, however, is thought to increase the risk of lactic acidosis, and is considered to be contraindicated in many chronic hypoxemic conditions that may be associated with lactic acidosis, such as cardiovascular, renal, hepatic and pulmonary disease, and advancing age.

Objectives

To assess the incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis with metformin use compared to placebo and other glucose-lowering treatments in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A secondary objective was to evaluate the blood lactate levels for those on metformin treatment compared to placebo or non-metformin therapies.

Search Strategy

A search was performed of The Cochrane Library (up to 8/2005), MEDLINE (up to 8/2005), EMBASE (up to 11/2000), OLD MEDLINE, and REACTIONS (up to 8/2005), in order to identify all studies of metformin treatment from 1966 to August 2005. The Cumulated Index Medicus was used to search relevant articles from 1959 to 1965. The search was augmented by scanning references of identified articles, and by contacting principal investigators. Date of latest search: August 2005.

Selection Criteria

Prospective trials in patients with type 2 diabetes that lasted longer than one month were included if they evaluated metformin, alone or in combination with other treatments, compared to placebo or any other glucose-lowering therapy. Observational cohort studies of metformin treatment lasting greater than one month were also included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials to be included, assessed study quality and extracted data. The incidence of fatal and nonfatal lactic acidosis was recorded as cases per patient-years, for metformin treatment and for placebo or other treatments. The upper limit for the true incidence of cases in the metformin and non-metformin groups were calculated using Poisson statistics. In a second analysis lactate levels were measured as a net change from baseline or as mean treatment values (basal and stimulated by food or exercise) for treatment and comparison groups. The pooled results were recorded as a weighted mean difference (WMD) in mmol/L, using the fixed effect model for continuous data.

Main Results

Pooled data from 206 comparative trials and cohort studies revealed no cases of fatal or nonfatal lactic acidosis in 47,846 patient-years of metformin use or in 38,221 patients-years in the non-metformin group. Using Poisson statistics with 95% confidence intervals the upper limit for the true incidence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis was 6.3 cases per 100,000 patient-years, and the upper limit for the true incidence of lactic acidosis in the non-metformin group was 7.8 cases per 100,000 patient-years. There was no difference in lactate levels, either as mean treatment levels or as a net change from baseline, for metformin compared to placebo or other non-biguanide therapies. The mean lactate levels were slightly lower for metformin treatment compared to phenformin (WMD -0.75 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.15).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence from prospective comparative trials or from observational cohort studies that metformin is associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis, or with increased levels of lactate, compared to other anti-hyperglycemic treatments if prescribed under the study conditions.

### Even mild hyperlactatemia is associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients [^114ugaki]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Among critically ill patients with lactate levels within the reference range (0.01 to 2.00 m M), we found lactate of 1.35 m M to be the best cutoff threshold that discriminated between survivors and nonsurvivors. Relative hyperlactatemia was an independent predictor of hospital and ICU mortality.

The first demonstration of lactate in human blood was in shock patients, by Johann Joseph Scherer in 1843. Subsequent work led to the demonstration that tissue hypoxia was associated with increased lactate level. Elevated lactate is frequently seen in critically ill patients and is primarily a consequence of inadequate oxygen delivery, usually associated with significant cardiopulmonary compromise, as seen in cardiogenic, hypovolemic, and septic shock.

In an unstressed individual, the basal lactate concentration is 1.0 ± 0.5 m M. In critically ill patients, a lactate level of ≤ 2 m M is considered to be within the reference range, and therefore, hyperlactatemia is defined as lactate of > 2 m M. A wealth of literature exists on hyperlactatemia (> 2 m M) but not on lactate within the reference range.

### Metformin hydrochloride (Riomet) [^115hSEva]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

5.1 Lactic Acidosis

There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin‑associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (> 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate: pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk.
If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of RIOMET. In RIOMET treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery.
Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and, if these symptoms occur, instruct them to discontinue RIOMET and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider.
For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below:
Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m²[see Contraindications (4)].
Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m².
Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m², assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.
Renal impairment — The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment.
The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]:
Before initiating RIOMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
RIOMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2[see Contraindications (4)].
Initiation of RIOMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking RIOMET. In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently.
In patients taking RIOMET whose eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy.
Drug interactions — The concomitant use of RIOMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance, or increase metformin accumulation. Consider more frequent monitoring of patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].
Age 65 or greater — The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients.
Radiologic studies with contrast — Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop RIOMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m²; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart RIOMET if renal function is stable.
Surgery and other procedures — Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension, and renal impairment. RIOMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake.
Hypoxic states — Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia. When such an event occurs, discontinue RIOMET.
Excessive alcohol intake — Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving RIOMET.
Hepatic impairment — Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of RIOMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease.

### Should restrictions Be relaxed for metformin use in chronic kidney disease? Yes, they should be relaxed! what's the fuss? [^116AZ61X]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin is and has been considered as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause a lactic acidosis that is exceptionally rare but fatal. The likelihood of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with kidney impairment and also among those with seemingly normal kidney function who are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding metformin. However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for many years, many of them with serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² who have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, there clearly remains controversy in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove the renal restrictions of metformin. To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we provide a Point-Counterpoint. In the preceding point narrative, Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and Kovesdy provide their argument that although there is little evidence of the potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, just considering the sheer numbers of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m² or in those who are at high risk of AKI irrespective of underlying eGFR. In the counterpoint narrative below, Drs. Bakris and Molitch argue that the data from a very large analysis demonstrate clearly that serum creatinine should be supplanted with eGFR as the criteria for metformin use and that the incidence of lactic acidosis is only elevated in those with a reduced eGFR who become dehydrated for various reasons or in those exposed to some toxin resulting in AKI. Otherwise the data clearly support the use of metformin under normal circumstances down to eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²-William T. CefaluEditor in Chief, Diabetes Care.

### Metabolic acidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1117qBur]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a primary reduction in serum bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) concentration, a secondary decrease in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂) of approximately 1 mmHg for every 1 mmol/l fall in serum HCO₃⁻ concentration, and a reduction in blood pH. Acute forms (lasting minutes to several days) and chronic forms (lasting weeks to years) of the disorder can occur, for which the underlying cause/s and resulting adverse effects may differ. Acute forms of metabolic acidosis most frequently result from the overproduction of organic acids such as ketoacids or lactic acid; by contrast, chronic metabolic acidosis often reflects bicarbonate wasting and/or impaired renal acidification. The calculation of the serum anion gap, calculated as [Na⁺] − ([HCO₃⁻] + [Cl⁻]), aids diagnosis by classifying the disorders into categories of normal (hyperchloremic) anion gap or elevated anion gap. These categories can overlap, however. Adverse effects of acute metabolic acidosis primarily include decreased cardiac output, arterial dilatation with hypotension, altered oxygen delivery, decreased ATP production, predisposition to arrhythmias, and impairment of the immune response. The main adverse effects of chronic metabolic acidosis are increased muscle degradation and abnormal bone metabolism. Using base to treat acute metabolic acidosis is controversial because of a lack of definitive benefit and because of potential complications. By contrast, the administration of base for the treatment of chronic metabolic acidosis is associated with improved cellular function and few complications.

### Demystifying lactate in the emergency department [^115G8oLL]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of lactic acid and its conjugate base, lactate, has evolved during the past decade in the care of patients in the emergency department (ED). A recent national sepsis quality measure has led to increased use of serum lactate in the ED, but many causes for hyperlactatemia exist outside of sepsis. We provide a review of the biology of lactate production and metabolism, the many causes of hyperlactatemia, and evidence on its use as a marker in prognosis and resuscitation. Additionally, we review the evolving role of lactate in sepsis care. We provide recommendations to aid lactate interpretation in the ED and highlight areas for future research.

### Metformin hydrochloride extended release (metformin HCl ER) [^116HAboC]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Warnings Section

Lactic Acidosis:

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^111pRzMw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, severe systemic acidemia with a low blood pH in patients with CS likely reflects the inability of the respiratory system and endogenous buffering mechanisms to compensate for acid‐base derangements including lactic and nonlactic acidosis. Respiratory acidosis (hypercarbic respiratory failure) appeared to be a major contributor to low blood pH in our cohort, particularly for patients without elevated lactate levels. Potential contributors to hypercarbic respiratory failure in patients with CS may include increased physiologic dead space from chronic lung disease, acute lung injury, and pulmonary vascular disease in addition to compromised lung perfusion from CS itself. These noncardiovascular disease processes may confer an adverse prognosis in patients with CS, explaining in part the association between acidemia and mortality and highlighting the importance of inadequate compensation for metabolic acidosis attributable to respiratory failure as a determinant of poor prognosis in CS. Although lactate appeared to be a better overall predictor of mortality, patients with CS with a lower blood pH were more likely to die independent of their shock severity; this was less apparent in SCAI shock stage B, presumably caused by the presence of nonlactic metabolic and respiratory acidosis, which may be less harmful. The patients with the worst outcomes were those who simultaneously manifested both marked lactic acidosis and severe systemic acidemia, particularly in SCAI shock stage E. This suggests that the severity of lactic acidosis coupled with an impaired homeostatic response leading to severe systemic acidemia is particularly detrimental. Notably, the observed survival for patients in SCAI shock stage E appeared worse for those with low blood pH than those with high lactate levels. As we attempt to develop an evidence‐based definition of hemometabolic CS using laboratory variables, these data suggest that both high lactate levels and low blood pH should be incorporated into the definition to reflect both severe hypoperfusion and failing homeostatic mechanisms.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^117KjtkU]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In cases of suspected albuterol-induced lactic acidosis, the primary management involves reducing the frequency of beta-adrenergic agonist administration. In most cases, lactate levels normalise within 24 to 72 hours after adjusting the albuterol dose or frequency. Supportive care, including intravenous fluids and monitoring of metabolic parameters, is typically sufficient to manage these patients. Discontinuation of beta-adrenergic agonists is rarely necessary, as reducing the frequency of administration is usually effective in resolving acidosis.

We considered metformin-associated lactic acidosis as a differential diagnosis in our case. However, since our patient was not on metformin or any biguanide medications, this aetiology was effectively ruled out. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is an extremely rare event, with an estimated incidence of 0.03 to 0.06 per 1000 patient-years. Evidence suggests that metformin alone rarely causes lactic acidosis and, when it does, it is typically in the presence of underlying risk factors such as renal impairment, sepsis or tissue hypoxia. A systematic review from the Cochrane Library, analysing 347 comparative trials and cohort studies, found no cases of fatal or non-fatal lactic acidosis and no significant difference in plasma lactate levels between metformin-treated and non-metformin-treated groups.

The case presented here illustrates the importance of recognising albuterol as a potential cause of lactic acidosis. The patient, who was treated with frequent albuterol nebulisations for a COPD exacerbation, developed significant lactic acidosis in the absence of tissue hypoxia. After ruling out sepsis and other causes of lactic acidosis, we reduced the frequency of albuterol treatments, leading to the normalisation of the patient's lactate levels. Clinicians should be aware of this potential side effect of beta-adrenergic agonists, particularly in patients who develop hyperlactataemia without signs of tissue hypoxia or infection.

In clinical practice, elevated lactate levels often trigger concerns for sepsis, prompting extensive investigations. This case emphasises the need for clinicians to consider albuterol-induced lactic acidosis as a differential diagnosis in patients receiving high doses of beta-adrenergic agonists, especially when other causes of lactic acidosis have been ruled out. Recognising this condition can prevent unnecessary investigations for sepsis and treatments, such as empirical antibiotics or aggressive fluid resuscitation, which may not be warranted.

### Sodium bicarbonate in treating lactic and non-lactic metabolic acidosis at different chloride levels: a retrospective study [^116Nsddx]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Although lactate levels are strongly correlated with mortality, it is also an important biofuel utilized in various cellular processes and tissues throughout the body. It can be appropriately produced under stress conditions and rapidly eliminated through cellular metabolism. The increase in lactate accumulation serves more as an indicator of the body's response to stress feedback. The emphasis on lactic acid itself contributing to the harm of acidosis may have been unnecessarily emphasized. Furthermore, the idea that anaerobic transport, tissue hypoxia, and resulting anaerobic glycolysis are key driving factors for lactic acidosis in sepsis has also been questioned. In this case, it can be reasonably explained to some extent why lactate levels do not affect the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate treatment.

In addition to using alkaline agents to correct pH values, continuous renal replacement has been advocated to remove lactate. Unfortunately, in the presence of shock, lactate generation excesses its clearance by continuous renal replacement. While no other types of alkalis have been proven to be effective and available, sodium bicarbonate remains the preferred alkalis for clinicians. Administration of sodium bicarbonate can have several side effects, including hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂), it may even lead to increased lactate production. Therefore, some scholars do not advocate the use of sodium bicarbonate in patients with non-toxic causes of metabolic acidosis. Some studies have observed that the staged use of sodium bicarbonate in the treatment of hypoperfusion lactic acidosis caused by septic shock can reduce the incidence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, mechanical ventilation time, ICU and hospitalization time, and mortality rate. Other studies have also found that sodium bicarbonate is not an appropriate treatment for acute pancreatitis patients with hyperparathyroidism (lactate > 2.0 mmol/L), and does not improve hemodynamics in critically III patients who have lactic acidosis. The findings of this study do not contradict conclusions of these studies but refine them. Neither of these studies disclosed nor paid attention to the baseline chloride levels of patients.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^116Hhk4f]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Patient's perspective

When I first started experiencing shortness of breath, I assumed it was just my COPD acting up. I had been using my albuterol inhaler more frequently, thinking it would help, but things only got worse. I ended up in the emergency room, and that's when they noticed my elevated lactate levels. At first, I was really scared, I didn't know what was causing it, and I feared the worst, like sepsis. The doctors ran so many tests, and I'm grateful they finally figured out that it was the albuterol causing the problem. Once they adjusted my treatment, I started feeling better almost immediately. Looking back, I wish I had known that using my inhaler too much could cause something like this. It's been a relief to recover, and now I'm much more careful with my medication. I'm thankful for the care I received and the thoroughness of the doctors in figuring this out.

Learning points

Recognise albuterol as a potential cause of lactic acidosis, especially in patients with elevated lactate levels without signs of tissue hypoxia or infection; it should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Adjusting the frequency of albuterol administration may effectively resolve the acidosis, preventing unnecessary diagnostic investigations and avoiding the need to discontinue bronchodilator therapy.
Early identification of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis can streamline patient care by avoiding extensive workups and treatments aimed at sepsis or other causes, ensuring more efficient and targeted management.

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: a systematic review of case reports and case series [^114VyjV8]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review suggests that the cumulative mortality of MALA with kidney failure in case reports or case series published between 1977 and 2014 with biochemical data available at individual level is 17.2%, which is much lower than previously documented high mortality rates to about 50% based on single center experience. We also found serum lactate level is a significant predictor for MALA-related mortality with a positive linear relationship particularly at greater than 20 mmol/L. From a treatment planning perspective, renal replacement therapy (RRT) may play a critical role in reversing disturbances of lactic homeostasis but no single RRT modality shows superior performance than the other. Although our study contributes novel observations regarding MALA with kidney failure, the results need to be interpreted with caution due to publication bias, heterogeneity between studies, and moderate sample size.

The observed positive association between inappropriate dosing defined by conventional FDA serum creatinine criteria and mortality among MALA patients requiring RRT suggested the iatrogenic and preventable nature of MALA. More interestingly, this association was inverted if the inappropriateness was defined by a recently proposed dosing recommendation (eGFR-dosing algorithm). Thus, the increasing sensitivity of alarming inappropriateness gained by applying the eGFR-dosing algorithm was of questionable clinical significance in the context of risk prevention. Furthermore, most cases with classification disagreement between the two different definitions were patients with CKD stage 3. This finding indirectly supports that a cautious expansion of metformin use in patients with CKD stage 3 or 4 may be appropriate and the optimal dosing requires more evidence to justify its long term efficacy and safety profile among CKD population. The drastic decline of kidney function among patients with appropriate metformin dose with concomitantly higher metformin and lactate concentration implied the primary etiologies of AKI played an important role in the development of MALA.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis in patients with renal impairment solely due to drug accumulation? [^1124NBJk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

We suspect that the life-threatening complication of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, solely due to drug accumulation following renal impairment, occurs more frequently than that previously reported and is not necessarily associated with other predisposing factors for lactic acidosis.

Methods

During a period of 13 months, at a tertiary referral centre, the incidence of lactic acidosis of any aetiology was 12.8% [67 of 524 total intensive care unit (ICU) admissions]. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis solely as the result of drug accumulation was diagnosed in 6% of all the patients suffering from lactic acidosis (4 of 67 patients).

Results

These patients presented with severe circulatory shock due to lactic acidosis. We could not identify any predisposing factor for lactic acidosis other than renal impairment. Intercurrent deterioration of diabetic nephropathy was suspected to be responsible for the accumulation of metformin followed by lactic acidosis, finally resulting in multiorgan failure. The diagnosis was supported by extensively elevated serum levels of metformin. Two patients died during ICU treatment.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that the incidence of metformin-associated lactic acidosis solely due to metformin accumulation is possible and underestimated. Symptoms of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are unspecific and physicians should be aware that metformin, if prescribed in patients with renal impairment, can cause fatal lactic acidosis due to drug accumulation.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113hUixk]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acid–base abnormalities are common in the intensive care unit (ICU). Differences in outcome exist between respiratory and metabolic acidosis in similar pH ranges. Some forms of metabolic acidosis (for example, lactate) seem to have worse outcomes than others (for example, chloride). The relative incidence of each type of disorder is unknown. We therefore designed this study to determine the nature and clinical significance of metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients.

Methods

An observational, cohort study of critically ill patients was performed in a tertiary care hospital. Critically ill patients were selected on the clinical suspicion of the presence of lactic acidosis. The inpatient mortality of the entire group was 14%, with a length of stay in hospital of 12 days and a length of stay in the ICU of 5.8 days.

Results

We reviewed records of 9,799 patients admitted to the ICUs at our institution between 1 January 2001 and 30 June 2002. We selected a cohort in which clinicians caring for patients ordered a measurement of arterial lactate level. We excluded patients in which any necessary variable required to characterize an acid–base disorder was absent. A total of 851 patients (9% of ICU admissions) met our criteria. Of these, 548 patients (64%) had a metabolic acidosis (standard base excess < −2 mEq/L) and these patients had a 45% mortality, compared with 25% for those with no metabolic acidosis (p < 0.001). We then subclassified metabolic acidosis cases on the basis of the predominant anion present (lactate, chloride, or all other anions). The mortality rate was highest for lactic acidosis (56%); for strong ion gap (SIG) acidosis it was 39% and for hyperchloremic acidosis 29% (p < 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression model identified serum lactate, SIG, phosphate, and age as independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusion

In critically ill patients in which a measurement of lactate level was ordered, lactate and SIG were strong independent predictors of mortality when they were the major source of metabolic acidosis. Overall, patients with metabolic acidosis were nearly twice as likely to die as patients without metabolic acidosis.

### Utility of lactate levels in the diagnosis and prognosis of septic shock [^115pA8pd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Early recognition of septic shock and its treatment are key factors for limiting progression to multiple organ dysfunction and death. Lactate, a byproduct of metabolic pathways, is usually elevated in tissue hypoperfusion and shock and is associated with poor prognosis in sepsis. As a biomarker, it may help the clinician in risk stratification, and the identification and treatment of sepsis. In this article, we provide an update on lactate's pathophysiology and role in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis in children with sepsis and septic shock.

### Serum lactate level and mortality in metformin-associated lactic acidosis requiring renal replacement therapy: a systematic review of case reports and case series [^112uUVbV]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Definition of key variables

All information in this review including baseline demographics was directly extracted from the primary literature at individual level. The diagnostic criteria for MALA described in this review refers to an arterial pH less than 7.35 and a serum lactate level above 5 mmol/L in association with metformin exposure, or based on the author's clinical diagnosis where papers not providing measurements of either pH or lactate level. The baseline renal function was defined as the lowest serum creatinine concentration that could be traced back prior to the index event. Peak serum creatinine and lactate levels were defined as the highest serum creatinine and lactate concentrations, respectively, after the index event and before RRT initiation (Additional file 1: Figure S2). Other clinical parameters related to MALA including pH, serum bicarbonate, and glucose were also abstracted using the reported values closest in time prior to the peak lactate level or the same time. Values greater than the highest bound and less than the lowest bound of the individual's laboratory reportable range were assigned the highest laboratory reportable value and a half of the detection limit, respectively. Cases with post-MALA ESRD were defined as being long-term RRT dependent after the index event. Cases with acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined either by the authors of the source paper or by an absolute decline from baseline renal function. Inappropriateness of metformin dosing was defined by (1) the contraindicated use of metformin if serum creatinine higher than 1.4 and 1.5 mg/dL in women and men, respectively, based on the US-FDA black-box warning and (2) the prescribed dose higher than the maximal dosage recommended in a recently proposed dosing algorithm based on the CKD stage.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^114C26LV]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and outcome of severe lactic acidosis

Lactic acidosis is one of the most common biological concerns for intensivists. Nevertheless, clinical studies assessing the incidence and outcome of lactic acidosis are sparse and are mostly retrospective or prospective in nature with small sample sizes.

For this review, the most convincing prospective multi-center study, conducted in 2011 by Jung and colleagues, noted severe lactic acidosis in 6% of the studied population (200/2,550 patients); that is, with pH 7.09 ± 0.11 with high lactatemia values. Eighty-three percent of these patients were treated with vasopressors with a mortality rate of 57%. In this study, lactatemia and the swiftness of lactic acidosis correction were linked with survival. Interestingly, only 18% exhibited a slight coexistent respiratory acidosis at admission.

Clearly, a causal relationship between lactic acidosis and mortality has yet to be established. For example, in metformin-associated lactic acidosis, even with pH values most often around 7.0, the observed mortality rate was 25%. However, for the same pH values during shock, regardless of origin, no survival was reported. Consequently, severe lactic acidosis is much more of a precipitator than a direct causal factor of mortality. Lactic acidosis probably contributes to the decompensation of underlying comorbidities and, hence, to the mortality rate.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^113tm814]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies evaluating the association of metabolic acidosis and outcome in the critically ill have focused on either a specific etiology (for example lactate) or a certain degree of acidosis (for example base excess). Most of these studies had small sample sizes and were, of course, observational in nature. Studies such as these have led to controversy as to whether acidosis is merely a marker for illness severity or whether it is itself in causal pathway of critical illness. Experimental evidence suggests that acidosis itself can influence hemodynamics and innate immunity. Studies also suggest that different acids are associated with different responses. Although no observational study can establish causation, we sought to determine whether different types of metabolic acidosis were associated with different hospital mortality rates. If pH or the degree of metabolic acidosis, as characterized by SBE, are themselves significant determinants of outcome, we would expect to see either a similar mortality across different subtypes of metabolic acidosis or independent associations as determined by multivariable regression. We saw neither. Indeed, the two major findings of our study are that different etiologies of metabolic acidosis are associated with different mortality rates, and that the severity of acidosis, measured by pH or SBE, was not independently associated with hospital mortality after controlling for the causative anion (lactate, chloride, or all others). The finding that pH and SBE were not in the final predictive model may be due to their strong correlation with all forms of metabolic acidoses.

### Salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis in status asthmaticus survivor [^112mt7Kp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis is a rare presentation that could manifest in specific clinical context as acute asthmatic attack treatment. An increase of glycolysis pathway leading to pyruvate escalation is the mechanism of hyperlactatemia in β2-adrenergic agonist drug.

Case Presentation

A 40-year-old man who had poor-controlled asthma, presented with progressive dyspnea with coryza symptom for 6 days. He was intubated and admitted into medical intensive care unit due to deteriorated respiratory symptom. Severe asthmatic attack was diagnosed and approximate 1.5 canisters of salbutamol inhaler was administrated within 24 h of admission. Initial severe acidosis consisted of acute respiratory acidosis from ventilation-perfusion mismatch and acute metabolic acidosis resulting from bronchospasm and hypoxia-related lactic acidosis, respectively. The lactate level was normalized in 6 h after hypoxemia and ventilation correction. Given the lactate level re-elevated into a peak of 4.6 mmol/L without signs of tissue hypoxia nor other possible etiologies, the salbutamol toxicity was suspected and the inhaler was discontinued that contributed to rapid lactate clearance. The patient was safely discharged on the 6th day of admission.

Conclusion

The re-elevation of serum lactate in status asthmaticus patient who had been administrated with the vast amount of β2-adrenergic agonist should be considered for salbutamol-induced lactic acidosis and promptly discontinued especially when there were no common potentials.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^1165QRKY]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acid-base abnormalities are common in the intensive care unit (ICU). Differences in outcome exist between respiratory and metabolic acidosis in similar pH ranges. Some forms of metabolic acidosis (for example, lactate) seem to have worse outcomes than others (for example, chloride). The relative incidence of each type of disorder is unknown. We therefore designed this study to determine the nature and clinical significance of metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients.

Methods

An observational, cohort study of critically ill patients was performed in a tertiary care hospital. Critically ill patients were selected on the clinical suspicion of the presence of lactic acidosis. The inpatient mortality of the entire group was 14%, with a length of stay in hospital of 12 days and a length of stay in the ICU of 5.8 days.

Results

We reviewed records of 9,799 patients admitted to the ICUs at our institution between 1 January 2001 and 30 June 2002. We selected a cohort in which clinicians caring for patients ordered a measurement of arterial lactate level. We excluded patients in which any necessary variable required to characterize an acid-base disorder was absent. A total of 851 patients (9% of ICU admissions) met our criteria. Of these, 548 patients (64%) had a metabolic acidosis (standard base excess < -2 mEq/l) and these patients had a 45% mortality, compared with 25% for those with no metabolic acidosis (p < 0.001). We then subclassified metabolic acidosis cases on the basis of the predominant anion present (lactate, chloride, or all other anions). The mortality rate was highest for lactic acidosis (56%); for strong ion gap (SIG) acidosis it was 39% and for hyperchloremic acidosis 29% (p < 0.001). A stepwise logistic regression model identified serum lactate, SIG, phosphate, and age as independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusion

In critically ill patients in which a measurement of lactate level was ordered, lactate and SIG were strong independent predictors of mortality when they were the major source of metabolic acidosis. Overall, patients with metabolic acidosis were nearly twice as likely to die as patients without metabolic acidosis.

### Lactic acidosis and severe septic shock in metformin users: a cohort study [^111Gj7we]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The current study has several limitations. For one, lack of measurement of circulating metformin levels precludes verifying an association between severe lactic acidosis and metformin accumulation. An additional limitation relates to the higher risk for lactic acidosis in metformin users than in nonusers. While this could be expected to result in selection bias, as metformin users may be more likely to have lactate measurements, the higher mean APACHE score in the metformin group does not support such possibility.

Lastly, to achieve a "clear-cut" very high-risk population, only patients with extremely elevated blood lactate (> 10 mmol/L) were included in the study. The upshot is that conclusions for the effect of metformin in mild lactic acidosis cannot be drawn.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^112tXwNA]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Lactate generation in shock states

As indicated above, lactic acidosis is a common phenomenon in shock patients and a high predictor of mortality. The pathophysiology of shock-associated lactic acidosis is still taught to medical students as a direct marker of oxygen debt or hypoperfusion in tissues (type A lactic acidosis). Lactate is produced from pyruvate and through the glycolysis cascade. Thus, when pyruvate production exceeds mitochondrial capacity, lactate generation increases.

Far from being the only hypothesis explaining hypoxia-induced hyperlactatemia, numerous other mechanisms are involved, including under aerobic conditions (type B lactic acidosis). Indeed, lactate is first and foremost an energetic, non-toxic substratum. Under resting conditions, half of the total lactate produced (1,500 mmol·day⁻¹) is directed toward gluconeogenesis in the liver (Cori cycle) while the remaining 50% is consumed via oxidation. Moreover, the kidney is also involved, acting as a neoglucogenesis-directed metabolizer in the cortex and as a producer of lactate in the medulla. At the cellular level, in response to adrenergic stress in shock patients, accelerated glycolysis enhances lactate production. An elevated lactate/pyruvate ratio is an indicator of a cytoplasmic accumulation of NADH that can be used to regenerate ATP:

Thus, the increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio appears to be much more of an adaptive response to shock-induced energetic debt than an actual side effect.

In shock patients, acute liver or renal dysfunctions are most often associated with decreased lactate clearance and a pronounced increase in blood lactate level compared with patients without liver or renal dysfunction. However, liver and renal dysfunctions are inextricably linked with the shock state and their impact on the decreased lactate clearance in this situation remains unclear.

### Risk of lactic acidosis or elevated lactate concentrations in metformin users with renal impairment: a population-based cohort study [^114Qnnii]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine whether treatment with metformin in patients with renal impairment is associated with a higher risk of lactic acidosis or elevated lactate concentrations compared with users of a noninsulin antidiabetic drug (NIAD) who had never used metformin.

Research Design and Methods

A cohort of 223,968 metformin users and 34,571 diabetic patients who had never used metformin were identified from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The primary outcome was defined as either a CPRD READ code lactic acidosis or a record of a plasma lactate concentration > 5 mmol/L. The associations between renal impairment, dose of metformin, and the risk of lactic acidosis or elevated lactate concentrations were determined with time-dependent Cox models and expressed as hazard ratios (HRs).

Results

The crude incidence of lactic acidosis or elevated lactate concentrations in current metformin users was 7.4 per 100,000 person-years (vs. 2.2 per 100,000 person-years in nonusers). Compared with nonusers, risk of lactic acidosis or elevated lactate concentrations in current metformin users was significantly associated with a renal function < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² (adjusted HR 6.37 [95% CI 1.48–27.5]). The increased risk among patients with impaired renal function was further increased in users of ≥ 730 g of metformin in the preceding year (adjusted HR 11.8 [95% CI 2.27–61.5]) and in users of a recent high daily dose (> 2 g) of metformin (adjusted HR 13.0 [95% CI 2.36–72.0]).

Conclusions

Our study is consistent with current recommendations that the renal function of metformin users should be adequately monitored and that the dose of metformin should be adjusted, if necessary, if renal function falls below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: metformin toxicities [^115Dy7UF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin toxicity is a rare but serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of metformin toxicity, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

Metformin is a common medication used for treatment of diabetes mellitus. Metformin toxicity is a spectrum of conditions that may be differentiated into three subgroups: metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA), metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA), and metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis (MULA). MILA is a condition found predominantly in patients chronically taking metformin or those with large acute overdoses. Conversely, MULA occurs in patients on metformin but with a critical illness stemming from a separate cause. MALA is rare but the most severe form, with mortality rates that reach 50%. Differentiating these entities is difficult in the ED setting without obtaining metformin levels. Patients with metformin toxicity present with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and vital sign abnormalities. Laboratory analysis will reveal a high lactate with anion gap metabolic acidosis. Patients presenting with elevated lactate levels in the setting of metformin use should be considered at risk for the most severe form, MALA. Patients with MALA require aggressive treatment with intravenous fluids, treatment of any concomitant condition, and early consideration of hemodialysis, along with specialist consultation such as nephrology and toxicology.

Conclusions

An understanding of metformin toxicity can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets (metformin hydrochloride) [^116kJPEn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Post-marketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and precautions (5.1)].

If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended-release tablets and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions(5.1)].

### Glyburide and metformin [^112JrXzC]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Lactic Acidosis

Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with glyburide and metformin; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels > 5 mcg/mL are generally found.

The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. Glyburide and metformin treatment should not be initiated in patients ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, glyburide and metformin should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, glyburide and metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking glyburide and metformin, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, glyburide and metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS).

### Lactic acidosis not hyperlactatemia as a predictor of in hospital mortality in septic emergency patients [^114kkXMw]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the prognostic abilities of lactic acidosis and hyperlactatemia and determine the influence of metabolic acidosis when attempting to predict the outcome of septic patients using serum lactate levels.

Method

126 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were prospectively included in this study at an emergency department. Haemodynamic variables, simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II, arterial blood gas studies and serum lactate levels were obtained at the time of presentation (0 h) and 4 h after presentation. The probability of mortality was calculated using SAPS II scores and compared with actual inhospital mortality at different serum lactate levels and arterial pH. Survival curves for lactic acidosis and severe hyperlactatemia were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

The calculated probability of mortality decreased from 35.7% (95% CI 30.2 to 41.2) at presentation to 29.3% (95% CI 24.2 to 34.4) at 4 h post-presentation. 27.0% of patients (34) died in hospital. Arterial pH and SAPS II scores were independent factors for predicting mortality of septic patients, at 0 h and 4 h. Serum lactate levels were closely related to severity of illness and metabolic acidosis in septic patients. Patients with lactic acidosis had significantly higher inhospital mortality than patients with normal pH and normal lactate levels by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis as determined based on measurements made at 0 h and 4 h (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 by the log-rank test, respectively). No significant difference in survival was found between patients with hyperlactatemia and those with normal pH and serum lactate levels.

Conclusion

Lactic acidosis not hyperlactatemia was found to predict inhospital mortality more exactly in severe sepsis and septic shock patients. The acid-base state should be considered when attempting to predict the outcome of septic patients using serum lactate levels.

### Lactic acidosis: relationship between metformin levels, lactate concentration and mortality [^111S8j3H]. Diabetic Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Aim

The role of metformin in lactic acidosis is regularly questioned. Arguments against a causal role for metformin in lactic acidosis occurrence are the lack of correlation between plasma metformin and lactate levels, as well as between metformin plasma levels and mortality. We aim to analyse these correlations in a large series of lactic acidosis cases recorded in the French nationwide pharmacovigilance database.

Methods

All cases of lactic acidosis spontaneously reported between 1985 and October 2013 associated with metformin exposure were extracted from the pharmacovigilance database. We assessed the statistical correlations between prescribed daily doses of metformin, plasma concentrations of metformin and lactate, pH and plasma creatinine, as well as the relationship between mortality and these variables.

Results

Seven hundred and twenty-seven cases of lactic acidosis were reported during the period. Metformin plasma concentration was documented for 260 patients, lactate plasma concentration for 556 patients, pH for 502 patients, creatinine for 397 patients and the vital outcome for 713 patients. Metformin plasma concentration, lactate concentration, pH and plasma creatinine were all correlated (P < 0.001). There were significant differences between surviving and deceased patients in terms of metformin plasma levels (25.2 vs. 37.4 mg/l, P = 0.002) and lactate concentrations (10.8 vs. 16.3 mmol/l, P < 0.001). Thirty per cent of patients died when metformin concentration was > 5 mg/l compared with 11% for patients with concentration < 5 mg/l (P = 0.003).

Conclusions

Our data suggest that metformin accumulation contributes to the pathogenesis and prognosis of lactic acidosis.

### Should restrictions Be relaxed for metformin use in chronic kidney disease? No, we should never again compromise safety! [^111efm94]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Metformin is and has been considered as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes for over a quarter of a century. Like other biguanides, metformin can cause a lactic acidosis that is exceptionally rare but fatal. The likelihood of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is substantially higher in patients with kidney impairment and also among those with seemingly normal kidney function who are at risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Hence, regulatory agencies in many industrialized nations have maintained strict renal restrictions surrounding metformin. However, there have been millions of people exposed to metformin for many years, many of them with serum creatinine values at or close to 1.5 mg/dL with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) much below 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) who have not developed lactic acidosis. Thus, there clearly remains controversy in this area, and there has been heightened pressure to remove the renal restrictions of metformin. To provide a discussion on the pros and cons of relaxing the renal restrictions for metformin use, we provide a Point-Counterpoint. In the point narrative below, Drs. Kalantar-Zadeh and Kovesdy provide their argument that although there is little evidence of the potential benefits of metformin in kidney disease, just considering the sheer numbers of metformin users and the high fatality rate of its associated lactic acidosis, the most appropriate practice is to avoid metformin use in people with eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or in those who are at high risk of AKI irrespective of underlying eGFR. In the following counterpoint narrative, Drs. Bakris and Molitch argue that the data from a very large analysis demonstrate clearly that serum creatinine should be supplanted with eGFR as the criteria for metformin use and that the incidence of lactic acidosis is only elevated in those with a reduced eGFR who become dehydrated for various reasons or in those exposed to some toxin resulting in AKI. Otherwise the data clearly support the use of metformin under normal circumstances down to eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m²-William T. CefaluEditor in Chief, Diabetes Care.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^113ToUzS]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

Lactic acidosis is a serious condition often associated with tissue hypoxia or sepsis, but it can also be caused by beta-adrenergic agonists such as albuterol. This report describes a case of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis in a male patient in his 70s with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea and increased albuterol use. During the initial evaluation, an elevated lactate level was observed, which further increased after albuterol treatment in the emergency room. A thorough sepsis workup was performed, yielding negative results, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis. After reducing the frequency of albuterol treatments, the patient's lactate levels normalised. This case underscores the importance of considering medication-induced causes of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with respiratory conditions who are frequently administered beta-adrenergic agonists. Recognising this under-reported phenomenon can help clinicians avoid unnecessary sepsis workups and ensure more accurate treatment plans.

### Lactate versus non-lactate metabolic acidosis: a retrospective outcome evaluation of critically ill patients [^1151jCXe]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective study, our database is limited to the variables that were collected for clinical management, and some patients with metabolic acidosis may have been excluded because of missing data. However, these were the data available to clinicians and our study demonstrates that a significant number of patients suspected of having lactic acidosis clinically do in fact have other forms of metabolic acidosis. Second, we could not control for severity of illness between groups. Severity of illness scores (for example Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)) were recorded only on admission to ICU and only in a subset of patients. Several patients had their highest lactate levels several days into their stay in ICU. However, the use of severity of illness scores are potentially misleading because metabolic acidosis itself might lead to worsening disease severity. Indeed, most severity scoring systems take into account acid–base variables and/or lactate. Thus, for our model we included age as covariate. We also report the admission diagnostic category in Table 2. The nature of our database (laboratory values) also limited our logistic regression model. Ideally we would have included treatment variables (saline and other resuscitation fluid) as well as other clinical variables (hemodynamics). Another limitation involved our initial selection process. The 'suspicion of lactic acidosis' excluded several patients in whom a metabolic acidosis may have been present for other reasons but was not suspected. The categories of metabolic acidosis were used to describe the predominating anion. Rather than using an arbitrary definition of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis that relies on an absolute value of chloride, we first eliminated all other causes of what has been traditionally classified as an anion gap metabolic acidosis (SIG or lactate). Our classification scheme leaves open the possibility that a combined lactic/SIG acidosis would have been misclassified as hyperchloremic. Conversely, some hyperchloremic cases could have been misclassified as either SIG or lactic acidosis if pre-existing or concomitant metabolic alkalosis was also present, decreasing the apparent impact of chloride. However, these limitations exist with any acid–base classification scheme and given that hyperchloremic acidosis is defined on the basis of 'acidosis without an AG', rather than on the basis of chloride levels, some imprecision is always going to be present.

### An exercise in clinical reasoning: use of social context in diagnosing an elevated lactate [^1175cXTT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this case, an older man was admitted with severe type B lactic acidosis, which was eventually diagnosed as the Warburg effect secondary to stage IV NK/T-cell lymphoma. This case showcases the differential diagnosis for type B lactic acidosis and also highlights the need to be thoughtful when considering the patient's racial identity and geographic exposures in clinical reasoning.

The magnitude of the presenting lactic acidosis made it the focal point of the initial PR. The discordance between its severity and the patient's clinical stability rapidly confirmed type B lactic acidosis, and the discussant was able to systematically narrow the differential diagnosis. While the potential causes of lactic acidosis are broad, typically only cancer or thiamine deficiency can cause such dramatic type B elevations. Contextualization of the laboratory result facilitated rapid recognition of the Warburg effect.

### Acute kidney injury, plasma lactate concentrations and lactic acidosis in metformin users: a goDarts study [^113gssKa]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

There is on‐going debate about the use of metformin in patients with CKD. 6 Recently, two retrospective UK studies utilising the CPRD database have been performed. In one, an assessment of 223 968 metformin users and 34 571 patients with Type 2 diabetes naive to metformin reported a HR of 6.37 for lactic acidosis or elevated lactate concentration (> 5 mmol/L) in metformin users with an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². 8 However, in the other, a retrospective analysis of 77 601 metformin‐using patients identified a total of 35 non‐fatal lactic acidosis events with no difference in incidence of lactic acidosis between groups stratified by renal function. 9 In our study, we do show a threefold increase in the risk of lactic acidosis in those with CKD stage 4/5. However, there was limited use of metformin in this CKD group who had lactates measured, which reflects the common prescribing practices of metformin in those with chronic renal impairment. The association observed between CKD4/5 and high lactate concentrations and acidosis is likely driven by the non‐metformin users, and reflects an effect of chronic renal impairment per se rather than an interaction between metformin use and CKD.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^117DAB7u]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults notes that an elevated serum lactate is associated with sepsis and part of the definition of septic shock, but that "a serum lactate level alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough for diagnosing sepsis and should be interpreted based on the clinical context and with consideration for other causes of an elevated lactate level"; for these reasons, "a weak recommendation is made for measurement of serum lactate levels in adults suspected of having sepsis".

### Inhaled β-agonist therapy and respiratory muscle fatigue as under-recognised causes of lactic acidosis [^117Nhg3n]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 49-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented with significant tachypnoea, fevers, productive cough and increased work of breathing for the previous 4 days. Laboratory data showed elevated lactate of 3.2 mEq/L. Continuous inhaled ipratropium and albuterol nebuliser treatments were administered. Lactate levels increased to 5.5 and 3.9 mEq/L, at 6 and 12 h, respectively. No infectious source was found and the lactic acidosis cleared as the patient improved. The lactic acidosis was determined to be secondary to respiratory muscle fatigue and inhaled β-agonist therapy, two under-recognised causes of lactic acidosis in patients presenting with respiratory distress. Lactic acidosis is commonly used as a clinical marker for sepsis and shock, but in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion and severe hypoxia, alternative aetiologies for elevated levels should be sought to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful medical interventions.

### Lactic acidosis and severe septic shock in metformin users: a cohort study [^116Ypqn5]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In a cohort of patients admitted to the ER with severe lactic acidosis and sepsis, the rate of inhospital mortality was lower for those who were actively treated with metformin than for those who were not, 56.8% vs. 88.1%, p < 0.0001. The unexpected relatively high survival rate of metformin users distinguishes them as patients who may benefit from intensive treatment.

Lactate was first suggested as a clinical prognostic tool by Broder and Weil in 1964 when they observed that a level of > 4 mmol/L was associated with poor outcomes in patients with undifferentiated shock. Since then, much has been published on the etiology and treatment of elevated lactate levels in a variety of patient populations. The role of blood lactate as a marker of tissue hypoperfusion has demonstrated prognostic value. Moreover, hyperlactatemia has been suggested as an obligatory diagnostic criterion for septic shock. The current study examined patients with septic shock and extremely severe lactic acidosis, represented by blood lactate higher than 10 mmol/L at hospital admission. The very high mortality rate observed further supports the prognostic value of high lactate levels in risk assessment of septic patients. However, the prognostic value of lactic acidosis in metformin users was different, as reflected by better survival. Their lower mortality rate is particularly remarkable in light of the higher risk profile of the metformin users: older mean age, higher incidence rates of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and AKI.

WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain.

### Treatment of lactic acidosis: appropriate confusion [^112hz3TN]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Lactic acidosis (LA) is common in hospitalized patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. There have been major recent advances in our understanding of lactate generation and physiology. However, treatment of LA is an area of controversy and uncertainty, and the use of agents to raise pH is not clearly beneficial.

Aim and Methods

We reviewed animal and human studies on the pathogenesis, impact, and treatment of LA, published in the English language and available through the PubMed/MEDLINE database. Our aim was to clarify the physiology of the generation of LA, its impact on outcomes, and the different treatment modalities available. We also examined relevant data regarding LA induced by medications commonly prescribed by hospitalists: biguanides, nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), linezolid, and lorazepam.

Results/Conclusions

Lactic acid is a marker of tissue ischemia but it also may accumulate without tissue hypoperfusion. In the latter circumstance, lactic acid accumulation may be an adaptive mechanism-a novel possibility quite in contrast to the traditional view of lactic acid as only a marker of tissue ischemia. Studies on the treatment of LA with sodium bicarbonate or other buffers fail to show consistent clinical benefit. Severe acidemia in the setting of LA is a particularly poorly studied area. In the settings of medication-induced LA, optimal treatment, apart from prompt cessation of the offending agent, is still unclear.

### Macrovascular hemodynamics and peripheral perfusion in cardiogenic shock: exploring current targets and future directions [^116Wodat]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Biochemical indices of peripheral perfusion

Lactate

Multiple laboratory markers offer insight into the state of systemic perfusion in CS, of which lactate has been the most well-studied. Lactic acidosis is a signature feature of CS, with up to 74% of patients presenting with an elevated lactate on admission and 40% experiencing an admission lactate elevation ≥ 5 mmol/L. Lactate elevation in CS occurs via multiple distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms, including true hypoperfusion (type A) and mechanisms unrelated to global hypoperfusion (type B). Type A lactic acidosis in CS typically results from reduced CO and global hypoperfusion. However, lactate elevation in CS can also be the result of adrenergic stimulation of lactate production (either through catecholamines produced during shock or exogenous administration as vasopressor agents) or mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly with concomitant sepsis. Thus, while lactate elevation is often assumed to reflect inadequate perfusion in CS, it is critical to consider other potential contributing mechanisms, particularly in the presence of conflicting clinical markers of perfusion.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^112kxSmH]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a serious condition often associated with tissue hypoxia or sepsis, but it can also be caused by beta-adrenergic agonists such as albuterol. This report describes a case of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis in a male patient in his 70s with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea and increased albuterol use. During the initial evaluation, an elevated lactate level was observed, which further increased after albuterol treatment in the emergency room. A thorough sepsis workup was performed, yielding negative results, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis. After reducing the frequency of albuterol treatments, the patient's lactate levels normalised. This case underscores the importance of considering medication-induced causes of lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with respiratory conditions who are frequently administered beta-adrenergic agonists. Recognising this under-reported phenomenon can help clinicians avoid unnecessary sepsis workups and ensure more accurate treatment plans.

### Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA): moving towards a new paradigm [^1152sZf6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Although metformin has been used for over 60years, the balance between the drug's beneficial and adverse effects is still subject to debate. Following an analysis of how cases of so-called "metformin-associated lactic acidosis" (MALA) are reported in the literature, the present article reviews the pitfalls to be avoided when assessing the purported association between metformin and lactic acidosis. By starting from pathophysiological considerations, we propose a new paradigm for lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Metformin therapy does not necessarily induce metformin accumulation, just as metformin accumulation does not necessarily induce hyperlactatemia, and hyperlactatemia does not necessarily induce lactic acidosis. In contrast to the conventional view, MALA probably accounts for a smaller proportion of cases than either metformin-unrelated lactic acidosis or metformin-induced lactic acidosis. Lastly, this review highlights the need for substantial improvements in the reporting of cases of lactic acidosis in metformin-treated patients. Accordingly, we propose a check-list as a guide to clinical practice.

### Approach to the evaluation of a patient with an increased serum osmolal gap and high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis [^111QBddX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

An increase in serum osmolality and serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis is an important clue to exposure to one of the toxic alcohols, which include methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or isopropanol. However, the increase in serum osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis can occur either together or alone depending on several factors, including baseline serum osmolal gap, molecular weight of the alcohol, and stage of metabolism of the alcohol. In addition, other disorders, including diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and lactic acidosis, can cause high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis associated with an increased serum osmolal gap and therefore should be explored in the differential diagnosis. It is essential for clinicians to understand the value and limitations of osmolal gap to assist in reaching the correct diagnosis and initiating appropriate treatment. In this teaching case, we present a systematic approach to diagnosing high serum osmolality and increased serum osmolal gap with or without high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.

### A claims database analysis of dose-dependency of metformin and incidence of lactic acidosis in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes [^111D2RFw]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For a long time, metformin has been used at a lower dose in Japan than in European countries and the United States despite evidence on its dose-dependent hypoglycemic effect. The validity and safety of high-dose metformin have been demonstrated in large-scale clinical studies, including the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). In the clinical guidelines of Western countries, metformin is a first-line hypoglycemic drug used for managing type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, owing to multiple reports of deaths overseas in the 1970s due to lactic acidosis associated with the use of phenformin, regulatory authorities in Japan placed restrictions on the maximum dosage of metformin which, like phenformin, belongs to the biguanide class of drugs. In 2010, the recommended dosage levels of metformin were revised in Japan, with the normal maintenance dose increased to 750–1500 mg/day and the maximum prescription dose increased to 2250 mg/day. However, the average daily prescription dose has continued to at < 1000 mg/day in many patients in clinical settings.

Lactic acidosis is considered to be the most serious side effect of metformin, and the package inserts of metformin describe the possibility of serious lactic acidosis in patients with risk factors, such as renal or hepatic dysfunction and older age. Lactic acidosis is a disease with poor prognosis and is a form of metabolic acidosis caused by the build-up of lactic acid in the blood as a result of the overproduction of lactate or its decreased metabolism. However, to our knowledge, there have been no reports to date of an association of metformin administration with lactic acidosis and an elevated risk in patients having comorbidities, such as renal impairments. For example, some meta-analyses studies have reported that there is no evidence associating metformin administration with an increase in lactic acid level and incidence of lactic acidosis. It has also been reported that the incidence rate of lactic acidosis in patients using metformin ranges from 3.3 to 9.7 per 100,000 person-years, which is comparable to that of patients who do not use metformin, which ranges from 4.8 to 9.9 per 100,000 person-years. The majority of the cases in which the incidence of lactic acidosis has been associated with the use of a biguanide are those noted as an administration contraindication or careful administration. In 1972, the Lancet published an article that indicated an association between metformin administration and incidence of lactic acidosis; the same article also highlighted a possible contraindication of metformin in diabetic patients with chronic kidney disease, but not in those without such comorbidities.

### The role of lactate clearance in the resuscitation bundle [^1169W9Y1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The sepsis resuscitation bundle is the result of an effort on behalf of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to translate individual guideline recommendations into standardized, achievable goals for physicians caring for the critically ill patient. Implementation of this bundle is associated with decreased mortality. Many of the bundle items reflect components of therapy shown to improve mortality in the seminal early goal-directed therapy trial for severe sepsis and septic shock, including an initial lactate measurement. Elevations in serum lactate are associated with increased mortality, and may result from either increased lactate production or impaired lactate clearance. Lactate clearance may be an important addition to the monitoring and management bundles of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, However, specific mechanisms of lactate clearance, the relation of lactate clearance to traditional hemodynamic parameters, and the importance of lactate clearance as a therapeutic target or monitoring tool remain unclear.

### Glyburide and metformin hydrochloride (Glucovance) [^115uNUf8]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis:

Lactic
acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due
to metformin accumulation during treatment with GLUCOVANCE (Glyburide and
Metformin HCl) Tablets; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of
cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic
conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant
tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated
blood lactate levels (> 5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances
with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When
metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma
levels > 5 µg/mL are generally found.

The
reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride
is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately
0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure
to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis.
Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant
renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion,
often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and
multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring
pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable or acute congestive
heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased
risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree
of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may,
therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function
in patients taking metformin and by use of the minimum effective dose of metformin.
In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring
of renal function. GLUCOVANCE treatment should not be initiated in patients
 ≥ 80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that
renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing
lactic acidosis. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be promptly withheld in the
presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis.
Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear
lactate, GLUCOVANCE should generally be avoided in patients with clinical
or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against
excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking GLUCOVANCE,
since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate
metabolism. In addition, GLUCOVANCE should be temporarily discontinued prior
to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see
also PRECAUTIONS).

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^112Va9M8]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Several studies have described the association between beta-adrenergic agonists and lactic acidosis. Gluck et al first described the relationship between beta-adrenergic agonists and hyperlactatemia in 1989, reporting that patients receiving albuterol for bronchospasm developed elevated lactate levels without metabolic acidosis. In a later study, Bellinger et al demonstrated that beta-adrenergic stimulation leads to a significant increase in lactate production, particularly in resting humans. Clinical observations support this mechanism. Marik and Bankov reported a case where lactic acidosis developed following the administration of beta-agonists in sepsis-associated acute lung injury, suggesting a direct relationship between beta-adrenergic stimulation and increased lactate production. Other studies have also shown that patients' lactate levels normalise after reducing or discontinuing beta-agonist therapy.

A review of the literature reveals several cases of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis, most commonly in the context of asthma or COPD exacerbations. Haupt et al described a case where a patient receiving high doses of albuterol developed lactic acidosis, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. Similarly, Theodosiou et al documented a case of albuterol-induced lactic acidosis in a young woman, with resolution following a reduction in beta-agonist therapy. Sharif et al reported a case of a young woman with an asthma exacerbation who developed severe lactic acidosis following high-dose salbutamol therapy, highlighting the role of beta-adrenergic stimulation in lactate production. Their findings further support that beta-agonist-induced lactic acidosis can occur independently of tissue hypoxia or sepsis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained hyperlactatemia. Similarly, our case of a COPD patient who developed significant lactic acidosis following frequent albuterol nebulisation expands the clinical context of this phenomenon, emphasising the need for clinicians to recognise this potential adverse effect in both asthma and COPD patients. In most cases, the patients developed lactic acidosis after receiving frequent or high doses of albuterol, either through nebulised treatments or inhalers. The elevated lactate levels typically returned to normal within 24 to 72 hours after adjusting the dose or frequency of albuterol administration.

### Hemodynamic consequences of severe lactic acidosis in shock states: from bench to bedside [^115gPdzD]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Shock was recently redefined as a clinical state of acute circulatory failure with inadequate oxygen utilization and/or delivery by the cells resulting in cellular dysoxia/hypoxia. In this setting, shock-associated lactic acidosis is the principal but not exclusive cause of metabolic acidosis in the shock state. Current clinical practice considers a pH ≤ 7.35 and lactatemia > 2.0 mmol·L⁻¹ with a PaCO₂ ≤ 42 mmHg as defining lactic acidosis. In contrast, the definition of severe lactic acidosis is unclear. Critical care physicians usually consider that metabolic acidosis with a pH < 7.2 has deleterious hemodynamic effects and requires symptomatic treatment. Nevertheless, despite optimal management with adequate supportive and etiological therapy, shock and severe lactic acidosis (that is, with pH < 7.2) remain associated with an observed high mortality rate of about 50%, while no survival has been reported for severe lactic acidosis with shock under pH 7.0.

Numerous studies have assessed the cardiovascular consequences of severe metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis. These experimental studies demonstrated that severe metabolic acidosis worsens cardiovascular function by exacerbating myocardial dysfunction and hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors. Nevertheless, such findings have yet to be formally observed in human studies.

Etiological treatment is essential while symptomatic lactic acidosis correction remains a contentious issue. It is unknown whether alkalinization is beneficial in severe lactic acidosis. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends against symptomatic treatment in lactic acidotic patients with a pH > 7.15 for the purpose of improving hemodynamic status. Alternatively, the effect of alkalinization on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements at pH ≤ 7.15 is currently unknown. Nevertheless, despite the lack of relevant results on its efficacy, alkalinization is still largely prescribed in instances of severe acidosis with pH ≤ 7.15.

### Consideration of alternative causes of lactic acidosis: thiamine deficiency in malignancy [^112nzUo8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Lactic acidosis is a common metabolic acidosis characterized by increased serum lactate and is usually associated with a decreased blood pH. Lactic acidosis has many different causes but has been differentiated into type A, hypoxic causes, and type B, non-hypoxic causes. Tissue hypoxia, type A, is the most common cause, usually secondary to processes such as sepsis and multi-organ failure. Type A must be differentiated from type B in the correct clinical setting as treatments are vastly different. Type B causes may include drug side-effects, toxins, enzymatic defects, inherited or acquired, any of which may lead to overproduction or underutilization of lactate. However, as most clinicians are more familiar, and likely more initially concerned with hypoxic etiologies, evaluation is directed toward finding the source of hypoperfusion or hypoxia, and thus generally leading to a delay in discovering a type B cause (or mixed type A and type B). Here we describe a case of lactic acidosis in the setting of thiamine deficiency thought to be secondary to advanced lung cancer. The purpose of this paper is to bring awareness to the clinician to consider other causes of lactic acidosis when evaluating a patient.

### Lactic acidosis… [^112ojxts]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

ALTHOUGH endogenous lactic acid has been recognized as a source of metabolic acidosis for many years in a variety of situations, 1–5 it was not until the publication by Huckabee of his clinical observations of the significance of lactic acid acidosis 6, 7 that great interest was stimulated in this condition. The demonstration that severe metabolic acidosis, frequently of fatal outcome, was a significant clinical problem has led to the increasing recognition of this situation in clinical practice. 5, 8–17. The definition of lactic acidosis remains arbitrary. Since the production of lactate is always accompanied by an equivalent appearance of hydrogen ion, significant elevation in blood lactate must be interpreted as lactic acidosis regardless of resultant arterial pH or bicarbonate levels.

Qualifying factors include the degree of compensation for the metabolic acidosis, represented by arterial pH, eventual outcome, the presence or absence of clinical symptoms of metabolic acidosis. TRANQUADA RE, GRANT WJ, PETERSON CR. Lactic Acidosis. Arch Intern Med. 1966; 117: 192–202.

### Lactic acidosis and associated hypoglycemia… [^1153xwdh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Lactic acidosis has elicited considerable clinical interest since1961 when Huckabee1, 2 drew attention to it as a clinical entity. Waters et al3 listed the etiologies of excess lactic acid production as follows: no known cause, diabetes mellitus, phenformin hydrochloride, shock, acute anoxia, exercise, extracorporeal circulation, liver glycogen storage disease, and epinephrine injection. Only in the cases of glycogen storage disease4–8 has the association of hyperlactacidemia with hypoglycemia been noted and the necessity of glucose administration been stressed. Among the reported cases of well documented lactic acidosis not associated with glycogen storage disease, four patients had concomitant hypoglycemia9–12 but the authors failed to mention the role of hypoglycemia in those patients. Johnson and Waterhouse11 did, however, point out the need of glucose and insulin in their report of lactic acidosis in a diabetic patient receiving phenfromin.

To the Editor An article in the Diagnostic Test Interpretation series discussed elevated lactate levels in a non–critically ill patient. 1 We wish to underscore the importance of considering infection as a cause of lactic acidosis early in the clinical course of similar patients. Infection is one of the leading causes of death in non-Hodgkin lymphoma2; patients with lymphoma can become immunocompromised as a consequence of the underlying cancer or secondary to myeloablative therapies. Although this patient was not currently neutropenic, his absolute lymphocyte count of 200/μL was very low. A history of advanced, refractory lymphoma and signs of immune suppression should increase clinical suspicion for infection. Swenson KE, Wira CR. Cause of an Elevated Lactate Level. JAMA. 2015;

### Controversies in lactic acidosis… [^1163B99F]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Lactic acidosis is common in critically ill patients and is usually caused by tissue perfusion that is inadequate to meet metabolic demand. However, it has also been noted in conditions in which tissue perfusion is apparently adequate. Hyperlactatemia can occur in the absence of acidosis, usually in the setting of hypermetabolic disease. Numerous areas of controversy exist regarding the pathogenesis of lactic acidosis, as well as certain of its diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic features. Knowledge of these areas of controversy should facilitate the clinician's approach to diagnosis and management. Mizock BA. Controversies in Lactic Acidosis: Implications in Critically III Patients.

### Lactic acidosis, metformin use, and dose-response association… [^1115rWWr]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor Lazarus and collegues, 1 both in the title and in the introduction of their article published in a recent issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, used the term lactic acidosis, which endorses the concept that lactic acidosis is a state of acidosis determined by an elevated plasma lactate concentration. This term, based on the old lactate paradigm, 2 does not consider that, since the 1980s, this paradigm has radically shifted, and lactate is not considered responsible for acidosis. The same lactic acidosis is deemed a misnomer and should be replaced by the term lactate anion acidosis. 3 Indeed, the intermediate acids — another misleading definition4 — of glycolysis have a low pKa; therefore, at body pH levels, they all exist in their base form, and in their production process, no molecules are ever in an acid form and do not function as sources of protons.

The acidosis associated with hypoxia is induced by the increased H⁺ production from the cytosolic adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. As a matter of fact, the production of lactate also consumes 2 protons and, by definition, retards acidosis. Although blood lactate accumulation is a good proxy of increased proton release, and the potential for decreased cellular and blood pH, such relationships should not be interpreted as cause and effect, but rather "guilt by association". 5 More explicitly, high levels of lactate are only a marker for the acidosis. As physiologist Robert A. Robergs put it, "The lactic acidosis explanation of metabolic acidosis is not supported by fundamental biochemistry, has no research base of support, and remains a negative trait of all clinical, basic, and applied science fields and professions that still accept this construct.
