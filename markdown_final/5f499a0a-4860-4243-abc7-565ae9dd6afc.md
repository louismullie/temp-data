## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evaluation and management of hepatic cysts, preserving the thinking process and self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the cyst and confirm whether it is simple versus complex. Then, I should verify the initial imaging modality and what features on ultrasound mandate cross-sectional imaging. Next, I will consider symptom status and how that drives management. After that, I need to check for red flags suggesting parasitic or neoplastic disease and outline the differential. Finally, I will align treatment options with guideline-backed pathways and close with surveillance and special-population considerations, ensuring each step is supported by current ACG and EASL guidance [^112rSYjJ] [^1115GKKV].

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because everything downstream depends on it. Simple hepatic cysts are thin-walled, fluid-filled lesions lined by biliary epithelium without biliary communication, whereas complex cysts show septations, mural thickening or nodularity, calcifications, heterogeneity, daughter cysts, or solid components; this distinction is foundational and directly alters management decisions, so I need to ensure I anchor on this before proceeding [^111BEJPZ] [^112rSYjJ].

> Next, I should review the first-line imaging and what I expect to see. Ultrasound is the recommended initial modality for hepatic cysts, with sensitivity and specificity around 90% for simple cysts; I should confirm an anechoic lesion with a thin, imperceptible wall and posterior acoustic enhancement, and I must actively look for atypical features that would push me to CT or MRI for further characterization [^113XLYSd] [^111BEJPZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if ultrasound shows septations, mural thickening or nodularity, calcifications, heterogeneity, or daughter cysts, I should escalate to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI to exclude neoplastic or parasitic disease; I need to ensure I do not label a complex lesion as "simple" on ultrasound alone, as that risks missing entities like mucinous cystic neoplasm or hydatid disease [^115b6Het] [^115sKe7R].

> I will now examine symptom status, because management hinges on whether the cyst is asymptomatic or symptomatic. For asymptomatic simple cysts, regardless of size, expectant management without routine surveillance is recommended; I should double-check that I am not over-treating based on size alone, as guidelines explicitly advise against intervention solely for large dimensions in the absence of symptoms [^112rSYjJ] [^112bLhrR].

> For symptomatic simple cysts, I need to confirm that symptoms are attributable to the cyst — typically pain, fullness, early satiety, or compressive effects — and then consider definitive therapy. Options include laparoscopic fenestration (deroofing/unroofing) or percutaneous aspiration with sclerotherapy; I should weigh patient comorbidity, cyst location, and local expertise, recognizing that both approaches are acceptable though laparoscopic fenestration may offer durable symptom relief in selected patients [^111nS37B] [^116Qmcpb].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative data for aspiration sclerotherapy. Systematic reviews suggest high rates of volume reduction and symptom improvement after sclerotherapy, but heterogeneity and risk of bias are substantial; ethanol-related intoxication can occur, so I need to counsel patients and monitor carefully if I choose this route, especially with larger fluid volumes or prolonged dwell times [^115UXd5S].

> But what if the cyst is complex or the clinical context raises concern for parasitic or neoplastic disease? I should confirm the differential: hydatid cyst, mucinous cystic neoplasm, biliary cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma, and intraductal papillary neoplasm of bile ducts are key considerations; imaging features such as a pericyst, daughter cysts, or detached membranes favor hydatid, while enhancing septations and mural nodularity raise concern for MCN-L, which requires complete surgical resection rather than fenestration or sclerotherapy [^112bZLqo] [^116ybvZF].

> I need to ensure I do not inadvertently biopsy a suspected hydatid cyst, as aspiration can precipitate anaphylaxis or dissemination; if hydatid disease is on the table, I should obtain serology and, if intervention is planned, initiate benzimidazole therapy beforehand to sterilize the cyst and reduce complications, reserving PAIR for selected cases and avoiding procedures in the setting of biliary communication or multiseptated disease [^112anPn6] [^116Mms5g].

> For mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver, I should confirm that aspiration or partial resection is inadequate; complete surgical resection with negative margins is the gold standard because of recurrence risk and malignant potential, and if the patient is not a surgical candidate, surveillance imaging is reasonable though no specific interval is established, so I should individualize and involve a multidisciplinary tumor board [^116ybvZF].

> Let me consider polycystic liver disease separately, because the approach differs from solitary simple cysts. In PCLD, treatment is symptom-driven, with options including aspiration-sclerotherapy for dominant cysts, laparoscopic fenestration or resection when feasible, and somatostatin analogs for diffuse small-to-medium cysts not amenable to local therapy; I should also remember to stop exogenous estrogens when present, as they can accelerate cyst growth, and consider liver transplantation in refractory cases with severe symptom burden [^114KQMzW] [^112hzPN4] [^113yMxiX].

> I should double-check surveillance recommendations so I do not over-image. For asymptomatic simple cysts, no routine follow-up is needed; for symptomatic cysts treated with fenestration or sclerotherapy, EASL advises against routine post-procedure imaging, relying on clinical follow-up unless symptoms recur; for asymptomatic complex cysts, discussion at a multidisciplinary tumor board with consideration of interval imaging in 6–12 months is prudent; and for hydatid cysts managed conservatively with watch-and-wait, periodic ultrasound can be used to confirm stability, especially for inactive stages [^112oftaR] [^116qhUFx] [^1174eamr] [^116nHXWs].

> Hold on, I should verify special contexts that modify management. In patients with cirrhosis or at risk for HCC, I need to ensure I am not missing a cystic-appearing malignancy and should follow HCC surveillance pathways if imaging is nondiagnostic; in endemic settings or patients with travel history, I must actively exclude hydatid disease before any invasive procedure; and in pediatrics, liver cysts are uncommon and large symptomatic cysts are managed similarly with symptom-guided intervention, though I should tailor choices to size, location, and developmental considerations [^113btcar] [^1173kFxg] [^112iQpQi].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency: classify on ultrasound, escalate to CT/MRI if complex features are present, stratify by symptom status, avoid intervention for asymptomatic simple cysts, treat symptomatic simple cysts with fenestration or sclerotherapy, and manage complex or parasitic/neoplastic lesions along disease-specific pathways with multidisciplinary input; this sequence aligns with ACG and EASL guidance and minimizes both under- and over-treatment [^112rSYjJ] [^1115GKKV].

Liver cysts are **benign, fluid-filled lesions** [^114pw1v8] most often found incidentally on imaging [^111LKqLW]. They are **managed conservatively** unless symptomatic or complicated [^112rSYjJ]. Simple cysts require no routine follow-up [^112oftaR]; complex cysts may need CT/MRI [^115b6Het] and, if symptomatic, sclerotherapy or laparoscopic fenestration [^111nS37B] [^1115GKKV]. Hydatid cysts need serology and, if confirmed, **medical therapy before intervention** [^115mY1D1] [^112xLiuG]. Polycystic liver disease is managed based on symptoms and cyst burden [^115ffaKo], with somatostatin analogs for diffuse disease [^112hzPN4] and surgery or transplant for severe cases [^113yMxiX]. Prognosis is excellent for simple cysts [^1141fV5e]; complications are rare but include hemorrhage, infection, and rupture [^115JJqN4].

---

## Classification and etiology

Liver cysts are **classified by etiology** as follows:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Simple cysts | - Non-parasitic <br/> - Congenital <br/> - Fluid-filled [^111BEJPZ] |
| Parasitic cysts | - Echinococcal (hydatid) [^1173kFxg] |
| Polycystic liver disease (PLD) | - Multiple cysts <br/> - Genetic (ADPKD, PCLD) [^113dM1Uh] |
| Neoplastic cysts | - Mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) <br/> - Intraductal papillary neoplasm (IPNB) [^1162m1pZ] |
| Inflammatory cysts | - Peribiliary cysts [^115miiV8] |

---

Simple cysts are the **most common**, typically congenital and lined by biliary epithelium [^111BEJPZ]; hydatid cysts result from Echinococcus infection [^1173kFxg]; PLD is a genetic disorder with numerous cysts [^113dM1Uh]; and neoplastic cysts are rare but have malignant potential [^116ybvZF].

---

## Clinical presentation

Most liver cysts are **asymptomatic and discovered incidentally** [^111LKqLW]. When symptomatic, features reflect mass effect or complications:

- **Abdominal pain or discomfort**: From cyst enlargement or pressure [^115JJqN4].
- **Early satiety, nausea, vomiting**: Due to gastric compression [^114pw1v8].
- **Jaundice**: From biliary obstruction [^115JJqN4].
- **Rupture or infection**: Acute pain, fever, or anaphylaxis (hydatid) [^1173kFxg].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Imaging modalities

Ultrasound is **first-line** for initial characterization [^113XLYSd]; CT defines complex features, calcifications, and biliary/vascular relationships [^115mY1D1]; and MRI characterizes complex or indeterminate cysts and detects biliary communication [^115mY1D1].

---

### Laboratory tests

Routine labs are usually normal; hydatid serology (indirect hemagglutination, ELISA) confirms echinococcal disease [^notfound]; and tumor markers (CEA, CA 19–9) may be elevated in neoplastic cysts [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on cyst type, size, symptoms, and complications [^notfound]. Simple cysts are **managed expectantly** without routine surveillance [^112bLhrR]; symptomatic or complicated cysts may require intervention [^116Qmcpb] [^115JJqN4].

---

### Simple hepatic cysts

- **Asymptomatic**: Expectant management; no routine follow-up [^112rSYjJ] [^112oftaR].
- **Symptomatic**: Aspiration with sclerotherapy (ethanol, tetracycline) or laparoscopic fenestration [^111nS37B] [^111BEJPZ].
- **Large cysts (> 5 cm)**: Consider intervention if symptomatic or growing [^114pw1v8].

---

### Hydatid cysts

- **Medical therapy**: Albendazole or mebendazole before intervention [^112anPn6] [^112xLiuG].
- **PAIR**: For accessible cysts 5–10 cm without biliary communication [^112anPn6] [^112bZLqo].
- **Surgery**: For complicated cysts (rupture, infection, biliary fistula) [^114mbeij] [^116Mms5g].

---

### Polycystic liver disease

Management is **symptom-driven**, with somatostatin analogs (octreotide, lanreotide) for diffuse disease [^112hzPN4] and cyst fenestration, resection, or liver transplantation for severe symptomatic cases [^113yMxiX].

---

### Neoplastic cysts

Complete surgical resection is the **gold standard** for mucinous cystic neoplasms and intraductal papillary neoplasms [^116ybvZF]; surveillance imaging is reserved for inoperable cases [^113btcar].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent for simple cysts**, with low recurrence after treatment [^114ommye]; hydatid cysts have good outcomes with appropriate therapy, though recurrence can occur [^113eYsjV]; PLD prognosis depends on cyst burden and liver function [^notfound]. Complications include intracystic hemorrhage, infection, rupture with peritonitis or anaphylaxis (hydatid), biliary obstruction, and portal hypertension (PLD) [^115JJqN4] [^1173kFxg].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Asymptomatic simple cysts require **no routine follow-up** [^112oftaR]; symptomatic or treated cysts are followed clinically, with imaging if symptoms recur [^116qhUFx]; hydatid cysts are monitored with ultrasound for 2–5 years after treatment; and PLD is followed with periodic imaging and liver function tests.

---

Liver cysts are common, usually benign, and often incidental; management is **conservative unless symptomatic or complicated** [^112rSYjJ]. Simple cysts need no routine follow-up [^112oftaR]; complex or symptomatic lesions may require CT/MRI and intervention [^115b6Het] [^1115GKKV]. Hydatid cysts need serology and medical therapy before intervention [^112anPn6]; PLD is managed by symptoms and cyst burden, with somatostatin analogs or surgery/transplant for severe disease [^112hzPN4] [^113yMxiX]. Prognosis is excellent for simple cysts, with complications uncommon but including hemorrhage, infection, and rupture [^111BEJPZ] [^115JJqN4].

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^1113c2mo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Currently affecting approximately 2.5–18% of the world population, cystic liver lesions are broadly classified into simple and complex cystic lesions. Hepatic simple cysts (HSCs), making up the majority of these lesions, are benign, rarely symptomatic, tend to remain stable in size, and seldom require treatment. Complex liver cysts, on the other hand, include congenital, premalignant, neoplastic, infectious, and post-traumatic lesions. Ultrasonography (US) as the first imaging modality, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), combined with clinical and laboratory data, provide useful information regarding the diagnosis and characterization of complex cystic liver lesions. Since the majority of complex cysts require surgical management, difficulties in reaching an accurate diagnosis pose problems in their effective management, potentially increasing morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review is to offer up-to-date insight into the diagnosis, classification, and effective management of the most common complex cystic liver lesions.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^112fTMu9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cystic liver disease has been increasingly reported in the literature, with a prevalence as high as 15–18%. Hepatic cysts are usually discovered incidentally, while their characterization and classification rely on improved imaging modalities. Complex cystic liver lesions comprise a wide variety of novel, re-introduced, and re-classified clinical entities. This spectrum of disorders ranges from non-neoplastic conditions to benign and malignant tumors. Their clinicopathological features, prognostic factors, and oncogenic pathways are incompletely understood. Despite representing a heterogeneous group of disorders, they can have similar clinical and imaging characteristics. As a result, the diagnosis and management of complex liver cysts can become quite challenging. Furthermore, inappropriate diagnosis and management can lead to high morbidity and mortality. In this review, we aim to offer up-to-date insight into the diagnosis, classification, and management of the most common complex cystic liver lesions.

### Risk for laparoscopic fenestration of liver cysts [^115Yjo8W]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic fenestration is considered the best treatment for symptomatic simple liver cysts. Conversely, the laparoscopic approach for the management of hydatid simple liver cysts is not widely accepted because of the risk for severe complications. Despite improvement in imaging techniques, the probability of preoperatively mistaking a hydatid liver cyst for a simple liver cyst remains about 5%. Therefore, laparoscopic fenestration, planned for a liver cyst could be performed unintentionally for an undiagnosed hydatid liver cyst.

Methods

From January 2000 to January 2001, 15 patients with a diagnosis of liver cyst underwent laparoscopy for fenestration. In all cases preoperative serologic and imaging assessment had excluded hydatid liver cyst. To further exclude hydatid liver cyst, preliminary aspiration of the cyst with assessment of cystic fluid characteristics was performed.

Results

In two patients with presumedly simple liver cyst, hydatid liver cyst was diagnosed instead at laparoscopy by aspiration of cystic fluid. The procedure was converted to laparotomy with subtotal pericystectomy.

Conclusions

The risk of misdiagnosing a hydatid liver cyst for a simple liver cyst, especially in the presence of a solitary cyst, should be considered before laparoscopic fenestration is performed. Intraoperative aspiration of cyst fluid before fenestration can minimize this risk, thus avoiding severe intraoperative and late complications.

### KDIGO 2025 ADPKD guideline: a commentary on diagnosis and management of hepatopancreatic manifestations by the ERA working group genes&kidney [^114UTKYk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2025 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation, Management, and Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a long-awaited development and the first KDIGO guideline addressing a genetic kidney disease. The approval of tolvaptan as targeted therapy for ADPKD in 2015, marked a pivotal advancement, and galvanized towards a structured approach in research and clinical care. Considering the systemic nature of ADPKD guidance for the management of extrarenal manifestations is of special importance for nephrologists and requires interdisciplinary collaboration. In this regard, cysts in other organs, particularly the liver, are the most common extrarenal finding. While most liver cysts are incidental findings on routine imaging, both cyst infections and severe polycystic liver disease accompanying ADPKD come with a high disease burden and challenges in management. In contrast, pancreatic cysts in ADPKD are usually completely asymptomatic, but raise questions about the need for follow-up. This commentary provides an overview of the most important recommendations and practice points on hepatopancreatic cysts provided by the KDIGO guideline with the aim to contribute to implementation and to highlight remaining gaps in guidance, clinical care and research.

### A rare large symptomatic simple hepatic cyst [^112iQpQi]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A fit and well 4-year-old girl presented with a 1-year history of abdominal distension, pain and vomiting with signs of non-shifting dullness on the right side of the abdomen. An abdominal CT revealed a 19 cm epigastric cyst that did not appear to connect to any solid organ and was therefore thought to represent a mesenteric cyst. However, laparotomy revealed that the cyst was arising from the liver. The cyst was resected and subsequent histology revealed a simple hepatic cyst. The patient has been well post-operation. The case represents the largest described simple hepatic cyst in the 0–16 years paediatric age group in Europe to date. We outline the epidemiology, embryology, key investigations and management options for these lesions.

### Biologic and clinical features of benign solid and cystic lesions of the liver [^116VFRNR]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The widespread use of imaging analyses, either routinely or to evaluate symptomatic patients, has increased the detection of liver lesions (tumors and cysts) in otherwise healthy individuals. Although some of these incidentally discovered masses are malignant, most are benign and must be included in the differential diagnosis. The management of benign hepatic tumors ranges from conservative to aggressive, depending on the nature of the lesions. New imaging modalities, increased experience of radiologists, improved definition of radiologic characteristics, and a better understanding of the clinical features of these lesions have increased the accuracy of diagnoses and reduced the need for invasive diagnostic tests. These advances have led to constant adjustments in management approaches to benign hepatic lesions. We review the biologic and clinical features of some common hepatic lesions, to guide diagnosis and management strategies.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^113btcar]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Focal cystic liver lesion on ultrasound or nondiagnostic imaging — initial steps include to "Evaluate history, physical, laboratory workup", and "If cirrhosis present, refer to AASLD guidance on hepatocellular carcinoma". For symptomatic simple cyst, the box directs "Surgical treatment; alternative: aspiration with sclerotherapy". For polycystic liver disease, actions include "Stop exogenous estrogen use", and when "symptoms present such as early satiety, wt loss, portal hypertension", to "Consider surgical resection, cyst fenestration or liver transplant" and "Consider lanreotide". For mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver, the directive is "Complete resection; if not surgical candidate then surveillance imaging". For biliary hamartoma, the figure states "No surveillance needed". For echinococcal cyst, management specifies "Anthelmintic drugs prior to surgery or cyst puncture or PAIR" with "Surveillance if not resectable".

### Hepatic cysts and liver abscess [^113psftr]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Benign pathologies of the liver often include several cystic diseases, such as simple cysts, autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease, and Caroli's disease. The differential of hepatic cysts also includes infectious pathologies, such as pyogenic liver abscess, hydatid cysts, and parasitic infections if the appropriate clinic setting. Understanding of the various causes, clinical presentation, and treatment options is required to ensure the appropriate surgical management of these patients.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^114Zn6VM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Choledochal cysts — management and surveillance are type-specific: Patients with type I cysts should undergo complete cyst excision with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy; type II cysts can undergo simple cyst excision; type III cysts can be managed endoscopically (via sphincterotomy) or by transduodenal excision for larger cysts. Type V cysts are managed based on the extent of intrahepatic disease with options including extrahepatic cyst excision with or without partial hepatectomy and hepaticojejunostomy, and liver transplantation may be required when resection is not feasible. We suggest that patients with type I and IV cysts should continue to undergo surveillance even after cyst resection because of the ongoing risk of malignancy. Key concepts emphasize that management is based on cyst type and malignancy risk; type I or IV choledochal cysts are most commonly associated with malignancy and should undergo surveillance imaging, although a specific interval cannot be recommended; and in both type IV and V choledochal cysts, when resection is not feasible, liver transplantation should be considered.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on the management of cystic liver diseases [^1174dYxS]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The advent of enhanced radiological imaging techniques has facilitated the diagnosis of cystic liver lesions. Concomitantly, the evidence base supporting the management of these diseases has matured over the last decades. As a result, comprehensive clinical guidance on the subject matter is warranted. These Clinical Practice Guidelines cover the diagnosis and management of hepatic cysts, mucinous cystic neoplasms of the liver, biliary hamartomas, polycystic liver disease, Caroli disease, Caroli syndrome, biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts. On the basis of in-depth review of the relevant literature we provide recommendations to navigate clinical dilemmas followed by supporting text. The recommendations are graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine system and categorised as 'weak' or 'strong'. We aim to provide the best available evidence to aid the clinical decision-making process in the management of patients with cystic liver disease.

### Clinical management of liver cyst infections: an international, modified Delphi-based clinical decision framework [^116WArYN]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Liver cyst infections often necessitate long-term hospital admission and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. We conducted a modified Delphi study to reach expert consensus for a clinical decision framework. The expert panel consisted of 24 medical specialists, including 12 hepatologists, from nine countries across Europe, North America, and Asia. The Delphi had three rounds. The first round (response rate 21/24 [88%]) was an online survey with questions constructed from literature review and expert opinion, in which experts were asked about their management preferences and rated possible management strategies for seven clinical scenarios. Experts also rated 14 clinical decision-making items for relevancy and defined treatment outcomes. During the second round (response rate 13/24 [54%]), items that did not reach consensus and newly suggested themes were discussed in an online panel meeting. In the third round (response rate 16/24 [67%]), experts voted on definitions and management strategies using an online survey based on previous answers. Consensus was predefined as a vote threshold of at least 75%. We identified five subclassifications of liver cyst infection according to cyst phenotypes and patient immune status and consensus on episode definitions (new, persistent, and recurrent) and criteria for treatment success or failure was reached. The experts agreed that fever and elevated C-reactive protein are pivotal decision-making items for initiating and evaluating the management of liver cyst infections. Consensus was reached on 26 management statements for patients with liver cyst infections across multiple clinical scenarios, including two treatment algorithms, which were merged into one after comments. We provide a clinical decision framework for physicians managing patients with liver cyst infections. This framework will facilitate uniformity in the management of liver cyst infections and can constitute the basis for the development of future guidelines.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^112anPn6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hydatid cysts medical, percutaneous, and surgical therapy indicates that medical therapy consists of chemotherapy with anthelmintic drugs, albendazole or mebendazole, with studies indicating the former as the superior agent, and is indicated before surgery or cyst puncture to prevent risk of recurrence, secondary seeding, or to decrease cyst pressure or in inoperable cases, with the risk of anaphylaxis with percutaneous drainage mitigated by initiating medical therapy first; an important change in medical therapy is that cyclical regimens are no longer recommended, and because albendazole can cause hepatic dysfunction and granulocytopenia patients should be monitored regularly with white cell counts and liver function tests; percutaneous or surgical approaches are recommended for large cysts (> 5 cm), for cysts likely to rupture, for cysts not responding to medical therapy, or for patients with contraindications to medical therapy, with puncture, aspiration, injection of scolicidal agent, and reaspiration with adjunct anthelmintic therapy an effective alternative to surgery, although this is contraindicated in biliary fistulas or cysts communicating with the biliary tree, complex multiseptated cysts, or percutaneously inaccessible cysts; surgical approaches aim for cyst removal and cavity obliteration and may range from simple cyst resection to radical cystectomy, and hepatic resection may be warranted in some instances to remove all the hydatid disease.

ACG Clinical Guideline — hydatid cysts key concepts and management recommendations state that medical therapy of hydatid cysts with anthelmintic drugs is indicated before surgery or cyst puncture in patients with symptomatic or active hydatid cysts to prevent risk of recurrence, secondary seeding, or to decrease cyst pressure or in inoperable cases, and that medical therapy alone is not recommended because of ineffective treatment unless percutaneous aspiration or surgery is contraindicated; we suggest surgical management in patients with complicated hydatid cysts provided there is no contraindication to surgery (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence), and in patients with uncomplicated hydatid cysts in whom surgery is not an option, we suggest percutaneous treatment with puncture, aspiration, injection of scolicidal agent, and reaspiration with adjunct anthelmintic therapy (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence).

### The surgical management of congenital liver cysts [^114ommye]. Surgical Endoscopy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Most series that report the results of surgical treatment for congenital liver cysts focus more on the technical aspects of the operation than on the late outcome of these patients. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of appropriate patient selection and adequate surgical technique for successful long-term outcome.

Methods

Twenty-four consecutive patients with congenital liver cysts were selected for surgical treatment. According to our own classification, 13 patients had simple liver cysts, nine had multicystic liver disease, and two had type I polycystic liver disease. All of these patients were treated by the fenestration technique. An open approach was used for five patients (group 1) treated between 1984 and 1990. In 19 patients (group 2) treated since 1991, a laparoscopic approach was used. The incidence of complicated liver cysts was 40% in group 1 and 68% in group 2.

Results

There were no treatment-related deaths in this series. The mean postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter for patients who underwent successful laparoscopic fenestration (p < 0.05). In the open group (group 1), there were no postoperative complications, and all patients were alive and free of symptoms during a mean follow-up of 130 months, without any sign of cyst recurrence. In the laparoscopic group (group 2), four patients were converted to open surgery. One of these patients had an inaccessible posterior cyst; another had bile within the cystic cavity. A further two cases had complicated liver cysts with an uncertain diagnosis between congenital and neoplastic cysts. Four patients (21%) developed peri- or postoperative complications. During a mean follow-up time of 38.5 months, none of the patients with simple liver cysts incurred late symptoms or signs of cyst recurrence. In the six patients with multicystic liver disease, one developed disease-related cyst progression (17%) and required reoperation. One of the two patients with type I polycystic liver disease (50%) developed asymptomatic disease-related cyst progression.

Conclusions

When patients are carefully selected and a proper surgical technique is employed, excellent long-term results with a low morbidity rate can be achieved in patients with congenital liver cysts. Patients with multicystic liver disease or type I polycystic liver disease are more prone to late cyst recurrence. A tailored approach is thus indicated for patients with congenital liver cystic disease. However, the laparoscopic approach appears to be the gold standard for the treatment of highly symptomatic or complicated simple liver cysts.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^116ybvZF]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Mucinous cystic neoplasm of the liver (MCN-L) — imaging features and management — Mural calcifications have a 90% specificity for MCN-L and can be seen in up to 69% of cysts, and on MRI the presence and enhancement of septations and mural nodularity are a highly sensitive feature, nearly 100%. Complete surgical resection is the gold standard for all MCNs, whereas cyst aspiration, sclerotherapy, partial resection, or cyst fenestration are not recommended. Fluid aspiration or biopsy of MCN-L is not recommended to distinguish it from a simple hepatic cyst because of low sensitivity, and MCN-L with thick septations, fenestrations, nodularity, calcifications, or mixed solid and cystic components require prompt evaluation for complete surgical resection. For patients who are not surgical candidates, surveillance imaging should be implemented, although a specific interval cannot be recommended, and changes suggestive of malignant degeneration should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board for consideration for nonsurgical options. In the postoperative period, surveillance imaging is recommended, although there are no established guidelines regarding specific intervals.

### Clinical response after laparoscopic fenestration of symptomatic hepatic cysts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114pw1v8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Simple hepatic cysts are fluid-filled cavities that arise from malformations of the ductal plate during embryonic development. Simple hepatic cysts are a relatively common finding as it is estimated to be present in 2.5–18% of the general population. The presence of multiple cysts, arbitrarily > 10, is defined as polycystic liver disease (PLD) and is usually part of the phenotype of two inherited disorders: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) or autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (ADPLD). Regardless of underlying pathology, these patients are at risk to develop large cysts, arbitrarily defined as > 5 cm in diameter. Large cysts may cause symptoms such as pain, loss of appetite, early satiety, nausea or dyspnea, sometimes causing a considerable decrease in quality of life. As such, treatment of large symptomatic cysts is indicated. Treatment options for large cysts comprise laparoscopic fenestration, also termed laparoscopic deroofing or unroofing, and percutaneous aspiration sclerotherapy.

Laparoscopic fenestration combines cyst fluid aspiration, followed by excision of extra-hepatic cyst wall in a single laparoscopic procedure. The surgical approach of large hepatic cysts has gained popularity since the 1990s, especially after the introduction of laparoscopy. As usual in surgical practice, operative treatment has been gradually adopted in routine clinical care without valid comparison. Multiple cohort studies, however, suggest that laparoscopic fenestration is effective and safe in selected populations. Some surgeons routinely apply omentopexy (also termed omentoplasty, omental transposition or greater omentum flap), a procedure that applies omental tissue in the residual cyst cavity to prevent symptomatic recurrence. The merits and risks of omentopexy over and beyond mere laparoscopic fenestration are unexplored.

Percutaneous aspiration sclerotherapy is an alternative approach that percutaneously places a pigtail catheter in the cyst cavity to evacuate hepatic cyst fluid. After complete drainage, a sclerosing agent (e.g. ethanol, tetracycline, polidocanol) is injected in the cyst which destroys the inner epithelial lining resulting in regression of the cyst. A recent clinical guideline suggests that symptomatic simple hepatic cysts may better be managed with laparoscopic fenestration rather than percutaneous aspiration sclerotherapy with the restriction of low quality of evidence. It is imperative to quantify the benefits and risks of laparoscopic fenestration and to grade the evidence on this topic.

Inflammatory (peribiliary) cysts

Peribiliary cysts are multiple, bilateral cystic lesions (0.2–2.5 cm) that develop secondary to disturbed periportal blood flow and resultant periportal inflammation in cirrhotic livers, or as a result of genetic changes accompanying hereditary fibrocystic diseases. These lesions are located predominantly around the hepatic confluence, with no communication with the biliary tree. They do not require any treatment. Nevertheless, correct diagnosis is essential, since misdiagnosis of peribiliary cysts as malignant lesions can cause unnecessary denials or delays in patients with end-stage liver disease listed for liver transplantation.

Benign liver lesions are increasingly diagnosed in daily clinical practice due to the growing use of imaging techniques for the study of the abdomen in patients who have non-specific symptoms and do not have an increased risk of hepatic malignancy. They include simple or parasitic cysts and solid benign tumors which differ widely in terms of prevalence, clinical relevance, symptoms and natural history and often lead to significant clinical problems relating to diagnosis and clinical management. Following the need to have updated guidelines on the management of benign focal liver lesions, the Scientific Societies mainly involved in their management have promoted the drafting of a new dedicated document. This document was drawn up according to the present Italian rules and methodologies necessary to produce clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic guidelines based on evidence. Here we present the first part of the guideline, concerning the characterization of focal hepatic lesions detected by ultrasound, and the diagnosis and clinical management of simple and parasitic hepatic cysts, and of polycystic liver disease.

### Laparoscopic resection of benign hepatic cysts: a new standard [^114B3NwT]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

We sought to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of laparoscopic resection of symptomatic hepatic cysts.

Study Design

Fifty-one patients underwent laparoscopic resections for symptomatic hepatic cysts. Resection was accomplished laparoscopically with an Endo-GIA vascular stapler. Data were collected in a prospective database.

Results

Median patient age was 60 years, with a median lesion diameter of 13 cm. Indication for surgical treatment was pain in 92% of patients. Laparoscopic resection was successful in 100% of patients. A pure laparoscopic approach was used in 58% of patients, the remaining used a hand port. Median operating time was 178 minutes. Preoperative diagnosis was polycystic liver in 88% and simple cyst in 12% diagnosed by preoperative imaging. Histologic examination showed 90% to be simple cysts and 10% cystadenomas. There were nine minor perioperative complications. Median hospital stay was 2 days. Relief of symptoms was achieved in all patients operated on for pain, with a median followup of 13 months. Two patients required reoperation for recurrence of the same cyst. CT or MRI was used for yearly followup.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic resection of symptomatic liver cysts is a feasible and effective method to relieve symptoms with minimal surgical trauma. This series represents the largest report of laparoscopic management for benign hepatic cysts and provides evidence for a routine laparoscopic approach to benign symptomatic cysts. Traditional surgical methods should be reserved for when a malignancy is expected, laparoscopy is contraindicated, or for recurrence after an initial laparoscopic approach.

Surgical interventions can be open or laparoscopic, conservative or radical. Conservative techniques include drainage, and unroofing, with or without omentoplasty. In fenestration, the cyst is opened and its content is aspirated following injection of hypertonic saline.

Radical procedures include total pericystectomy and minor or major hepatectomy. A benzimidazole agent is always administered prior to any type of surgery to sterilize the cyst and reduce the risk of anaphylactic reaction. PAIR involves puncture, aspiration of the cyst, injection of hypertonic saline and/or absolute alcohol, and re-aspiration. It is indicated for ECs 5–10 cm in diameter, in poor surgical candidates or in patients who have failed previous surgical interventions. It is best performed under continuous US or CT guidance with benzimidazole coverage. A study by Chen et al, showed a 98.7% cure rate in patients undergoing laparoscopic intervention, and 97.5% in patients receiving PAIR plus chemotherapy. Follow up is recommended initially every 6 months for the first 2 years, and then once a year, depending on the clinical setting.

### Contemporary management of benign liver tumors [^116b3EUq]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Benign lesions of the liver represent diagnostic dilemmas, clinically and radiographically; however, certain clues can help the extensive differential diagnosis of both benign and malignant processes. Hemangiomas and simple cysts have very distinct and very specific radiographic characteristics, and if diagnosed, no further work-up is necessary. The remaining benign lesions have significant overlap, even though there are some more common characteristics to each of the entities. Still, differentiation of any particular lesion outside simple cysts or hemangioma may be difficult. It is reasonable and relatively simple, with minimal invasiveness, to perform US- or CT-guided, percutaneous core-needle biopsies. It is recommended that core biopsies be performed, because many of the benign entities have some overlapping histologic features, and if fine-needle aspirations are performed, a definitive diagnosis may be difficult to obtain. A definitive pathological diagnosis still cannot be made in some cases, even after needle biopsy. Therefore, a surgical resection or wedge resection may be necessary if a benign process cannot be definitively ruled out.

Uncommon and congenital liver cysts

Ductal plate malformations, also known as fibropolycystic liver diseases, represent a unique spectrum of pathological abnormalities that are caused by an insult to the embryonic ductal plate development. As a result, congenital cystic lesions tend to develop in intra- or extra-hepatic bile ducts, predisposing for pancreatitis, cholangitis, lithiasis and malignancy. Depending on the timing of ductal plate insult, different congenital cystic lesions develop, including biliary hamartomas; autosomal dominant polycystic liver disease (in the presence of > 20 hepatic cysts), Caroli disease (type V lesions based on Todani classification), and choledochal cysts. These lesions need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of complex cystic liver lesions when they are complicated with hemorrhage, bacterial superinfection, or intracystic development of neoplastic lesions, and should be treated as previously discussed. Polycystic liver disease with compression on the bile ducts, the hepatic veins, the inferior vena cava, the portal vein (causing portal hypertension) or adjacent viscera may dictate the need for open or laparoscopic fenestration of multiple liver cysts, or hepatectomy in appropriate surgical candidates. Orthotopic liver transplantation should be reserved for severe hepatic decompensation, ascites, malnutrition, vascular occlusion, or when resection fails or is deemed inappropriate.

Concluding remarks

Complex cystic liver lesions are increasingly being recognized in asymptomatic individuals or during workup for non-specific abdominal symptoms, leading patients to seek surgical attention. They encompass a spectrum of disorders ranging from non-neoplastic conditions to benign and malignant tumors. These complex cystic liver lesions pose multiple diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas to hepatobiliary specialists (radiologists, gastroenterologists, pathologists, hepatologists and surgeons). Liver cyst characteristics that can assist with their classification, include presence of septa, enhancing thickened wall, mural consistency/nodularity, calcifications, and quality of cystic fluid with or without debris. When a high index of suspicion for underlying malignancy is present, cases should be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board meeting. If malignancy or high-grade dysplasia is anticipated, surgical options include radical resection and enucleation, according to cyst location and the patient's performance status. When imaging characteristics are atypical or inconclusive, regular short-interval monitoring with high resolution imaging should be entertained (Fig. 5). Extensive research into the pathogenesis and progression of complex cystic liver lesions is currently underway. Ongoing studies will hopefully bring forward a set of clinically relevant molecular markers to help improve the diagnosis and classification of these lesions.

### Pulmonary cystic echinococcosis [^117Mke8s]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT

Clinicians should seek advice from an expert centre for the workup, including differential diagnoses, treatment and a long-term management plan.

There are three standard treatment modalities in lung CE

(1) Surgery
(2) Antiparasitic drug treatment with benzimidazoles
(3) Watch and wait

With the exception of the watch and wait approach for selected inactive cysts (CE4, CE5) the WHO cystic echinococcosis cyst classification-based treatment cannot be applied to pulmonary cystic echinococcosis cysts.

Surgery

Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for pulmonary cystic echinococcosis (Table 1). Frequently, patients with cystic echinococcosis have lung and liver cysts. In these instances, a sequential surgical approach starting with surgery of lung cysts because of the higher probability of cyst rupture, cystobronchial fistula and associated complications is appropriate. For pulmonary cystic echinococcosis surgery, double lumen intubation is obligatory in order to prevent spillage of cyst content to the healthy lung during surgery.

Table 1
Surgery for uncomplicated lung cysts

Independent of cyst size or the presence of cyst complications, lung parenchyma sparing surgical techniques with partial cystectomy (formerly 'endocystectomy') should be applied whenever possible. The main requirement in order to prevent pleural dissemination of disease is to avoid spillage of cyst content by surgical field protection (Table 1). There is a variety of methods published for residual cavity (adventitia, formerly 'pericyst') management, which range from simple closure of bronchial fistulas to capitonnage and obliteration of the cavity. The published evidence is not sufficient to give recommendations in one or the other direction.

In complicated cystic echinococcosis cysts with transdiaphragmatic growth, bacterial infection or bronchial fistula partial cystectomy is in most cases the best option. Complex clinical presentations and cyst architecture ideally needs an interdisciplinary work up of a treatment plan. Only very rarely, lobectomy is necessary.

Antiparasitic drug treatment

Starting presurgical antiparasitic treatment with benzimidazoles, mainly albendazole (ABZ), in uncomplicated lung cystic echinococcosis, is not urgent. There is enough time for a thorough work up and a treatment plan. Premature start of ABZ treatment may cause iatrogenic harm to the patient through treatment-induced parasitic cyst membrane detachment and opening of cystobronchial fistulas.

### Clinical response after laparoscopic fenestration of symptomatic hepatic cysts: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116sVhpk]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We conducted a systematic review of studies that evaluated the efficacy of laparoscopic fenestration for symptomatic simple hepatic cysts. This study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) checklist (Supplementary File 1). The study protocol was registered in the Prospero database of systematic reviews (CRD42017071305) on 10 July 2017.

Eligibility criteria

We included cohort studies and clinical trials of adult patients with one or more simple (non-parasitic, non-neoplastic) and symptomatic hepatic cysts (excluding choledochal cysts or hepatic foregut cysts), either solitary or in context of PLD, that underwent laparoscopic surgery with minimal resection of healthy liver parenchyma (e.g. fenestration, deroofing, unroofing). We included studies that assessed symptomatic relief and/or symptomatic recurrence. We excluded case reports, overlapping datasets, reviews, unpublished data and conference abstracts. We excluded studies with a mean or median follow-up < 6 months. For practical reasons, only articles in the following languages were included: Dutch, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Literature search strategy

We systematically searched the electronic databases of PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from inception to 18 July 2017, without any restrictions. The search strategy combined terms related to hepatic cysts and laparoscopic interventions. The search terms were composed in collaboration with an experienced medical librarian. Exact search terms are presented in Supplementary File 2. If no full-text article was available, the original authors were emailed in order to gain access. References of included studies were checked for additional studies missed in the primary search. All identified records were exported to citation management program EndNote X8 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) for deduplication, which was performed according to a published protocol. After deduplication, all records were exported to the browser-based systematic review management program Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia. Available at). First, two investigators (LB and SE) independently screened title and abstract to determine the eligibility of each study. Second, the full-text of all included abstracts was independently assessed by the same investigators. Disagreements in both screening phases were resolved through discussion between the two investigators. Any remaining disagreement between reviewers was resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (CR, JD).

### Surgical strategy for cystic diseases of the liver in a Western hepatobiliary center [^112tRpDK]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to define the indications and evaluate the results of various management options in patients with cystic liver disease. Between 1992 and 1999 we managed 60 consecutive patients with cystic liver disease. Diagnoses included a simple cyst (solitary 12, multiple 10), adult polycystic liver disease (APLD 17), Caroli's disease (8), hydatid cysts (4), and neoplastic cysts (9). Half of the patients with simple cysts had mild or no symptoms and required no treatment. Percutaneous drainage in eight patients (simple cyst 4, APLD 4) was followed by symptomatic recurrence in three. Laparoscopic deroofing in three patients (multiple simple cysts 2, APLD 1) was followed by symptomatic enlargement of the remaining cysts that required further intervention (laparoscopic deroofing 2, transplantation 1). Laparoscopic hepatectomy was successful in three patients with solitary simple cysts. Of 18 patients who underwent open hepatic resection (neoplastic 8, Caroli's 4, simple cysts 3, hydatid cysts 2, APLD 1), 2 patients with Caroli's disease required liver transplantation for disease progression. Nine patients (Caroli's 5, APLD 4) underwent liver transplantation, and three had a concomitant renal transplant. Seven patients developed complications, and three died (5%). Cholangiocarcinoma developed in three patients with bilateral Caroli's disease, and all died. Radiologic treatment has a limited role in the management of patients with simple cysts or APLD. Laparoscopic deroofing of simple cysts may have to be repeated, whereas resection minimizes cyst recurrence. Unilobar Caroli's disease may be resected, whereas bilateral disease requires early liver transplantation owing to the high risk of malignancy. Transplantation is a reserved option in patients with extensive APLD.

### Scoping review of clinical practice guidelines on the management of benign liver tumours [^114hyprL]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Content of the guidelines

The ACG guideline included literature up to June 2013 on both benign and malignant liver tumours. Discussed benign entities are: hepatic haemangioma, FNH, HCA, focal regenerative hyperplasia, simple hepatic cysts, biliary cystadenomas, polycystic liver disease, and hydatid cysts. The SBH guideline did not mention a literature study timeframe; the most recent included publication dates September 2014. It includes hepatic haemangioma, FNH, HCA, simple hepatic cysts, hydatid cysts, cystadenomas, and polycystic liver disease. The EASL guideline did not mention the time frame of the literature study either but included studies published up to July 2015. It focused on hepatic haemangioma, FNH, and HCA. Nodular (or focal) regenerative hyperplasia is mentioned but referred to alternate reviews for recommendations on diagnostic features and management. It was the only guideline recommending use of a BLT multidisciplinary team consisting of a hepatologist, hepatobiliary surgeon, diagnostic and interventional radiologists, and pathologist.

Hepatic haemangioma

The ACG and SBH guidelines discouraged percutaneous needle biopsy due to bleeding risk, in contrast to the EASL guideline (table 2). Indications for surgical intervention differed slightly, as ACG guidelines included consideration of haemangiomas ≥ 10 cm, while the other guidelines only included surgery for symptomatic tumours. Follow-up recommendations were similar in ACG and EASL guidelines. The SBH guideline recommended follow-up through ultrasound (US) in large haemangiomas and in pregnant patients. The SBH guideline was the only guideline to suggest liver transplantation as option for surgical treatment.

### Novel technique for treating simple hepatic cysts: endoscopic transgastric hepatic cyst deroofing [^1134KuLd]. Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Simple hepatic cysts are common benign liver lesions which are usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. However, larger lesions may need surgical treatment if patients present with abdominal pain, epigastric fullness, or early satiety. American Society of Gastroenterology clinical practice guidelines recommend that symptomatic simple hepatic cysts may be managed with laparoscopic deroofing rather than aspiration and sclerotherapy. Natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has been developed as a step towards less invasive procedures. With the development of digestive endoscopy, some researchers have used endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration or NOTES technology for cystic fluid aspiration. Herein, we report a novel approach to smoothly achieving unroofing of simple hepatic cysts, called endoscopic transgastric hepatic cyst deroofing (ETGHCD).

A 73-year-old man complained about abdominal pain and epigastric fullness, which was significantly impacting on his daily life. Abdominal computed tomography and ultrasonography revealed an 8-cm simple cyst located in the right liver as the underlying disease. To address the issue we performed ETGHCD on the patient. During the procedure the anterior wall of the gastric antrum was perforated with a sterile colonoscope. The cyst was found at the lower edge of segment IV of the liver. After endoscopic ultrasonography reconfirmed the cyst, transparent liquid was extracted with a 23-G puncture needle (Boston Scientific) and sent for examination. After all fluid was extracted from the cyst, we opened the cyst wall and removed it piecemeal with a snare at the interface with the hepatic parenchyma, sealed the vessels of the cyst wall, flushed the abdominal cavity, and closed the gastric wall. The ETGHCD technique, which was applied to the large hepatic cyst located on the surface of the liver, was performed and deroofing of the cyst was achieved, thus avoiding surgery (Fig. 1, Video 1). The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged 2 days after endoscopic surgery. His symptoms resolved completely during the following 6 months.

### Cystic liver lesions: a pictorial review [^115sfRr3]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Hepatic cysts (HC) are sac-like structures mainly filled with liquid and showing a distinct membrane. They are usually found incidentally through imaging. A wide spectrum of imaging patterns may be observed for common and uncommon, neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. While simple hepatic cysts occur frequently and do not require any treatment or follow-up, non-typical cysts should be carefully analysed to avoid misdiagnosing a lesion that would require appropriate management. Therefore, adequate knowledge of all the relevant imaging patterns is critical to secure an accurate diagnosis. The aim of this review is to describe the imaging features of the different types of hepatic cysts.

Simple hepatic cysts — Hepatic cysts are thin-walled structures lined by cuboidal bile duct epithelium and filled with isotonic fluid and are the result of ductal plate malformation without communication with the biliary tree. Simple hepatic cysts can be diagnosed on conventional grayscale ultrasound with a sensitivity and specificity of 90%, and they are usually asymptomatic and incidentally found unless very large; there is a female predominance although there is no established correlation with OCP use or pregnancy and cyst prevalence increases with age. For symptomatic cysts, treatment options include surgical cyst fenestration, also known as deroofing/marsupialization, or aspiration with sclerotherapy; aspiration sclerotherapy can be achieved with substances including 100% ethanol, tetracycline, or other sclerosants.

Focal liver lesions (FLL) have been a common reason for consultation faced by gastroenterologists and hepatologists. The increasing and widespread use of imaging studies has led to an increase in detection of incidental FLL.

In this ACG practice guideline, the authors provide an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis and management of FLL.

### Open or laparoscopic treatment for hydatid disease of the liver? A 10-year single-institution experience [^116EHHei]. Surgical Endoscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although the possibilities for the treatment of hepatic echinococcosis have increased considerably in recent years (including medical treatment, PAIR, or a combination of these two), surgery remains the mainstay for healing of hydatid disease. Due to the development in technology and especially the increasing number of more experienced surgeons, laparoscopic surgery has been introduced for the surgical treatment of liver hydatid disease liver as well as for the surgical treatment of many other organs.

Initially, however, laparoscopy was not quickly accepted or widely used in the treatment of hydatid disease due to the concern that the recurrence rate and the risk of intraperitoneal dissemination might be higher with laparoscopy than with the conventional approach. Different authors have attempted to reduce the risks with laparoscopy by pre- and postoperative albendazole therapy, proper isolation of the cyst from the remainder of the peritoneal cavity (using various devices), and the use of wide-angle laparoscopes. In fact, the real risk of spillage is lower than might be expected, and the short-term recurrence rate varies between 0 and 9% after laparoscopy, whereas in open cases, it is higher (0–30%).

Laparoscopic treatment of liver hydatidosis should not be regarded as a new surgical technique but rather as a new and minimally invasive access (with all its benefits) for performing a popularly established surgical intervention. Like any other surgical intervention, laparoscopic treatment of liver hydatidosis complies with the basic surgical principles of treating liver hydatid cysts by an open approach including prevention of hydatid spillage, sterilization and evacuation of the parasite, and management of the residual cavity.

Most of the reports on laparoscopic treatment of liver hydatidosis consist of case reports or small patient series. They could give the misleading impression that they are oriented to publish successful results with this technique, but the difference detected in favor of the minimally invasive approach could be due to the limited number of patients and the rigorous selection criteria (central location of the cyst, cyst size exceeding 10 cm, cysts with thickened and calcified walls).

### Watch and wait approach for inactive echinococcal cyst of the liver: an update [^116nHXWs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a chronic, complex and neglected infection causing severe disease in humans. Hepatic CE cysts are detected and classified mainly by using ultrasound. Expert opinion and published data suggest that uncomplicated inactive liver cysts do not require treatment and only need to be monitored over time ("Watch and Wait"). Here we update our findings as published in 2014 on the "Watch and Wait" approach applied to inactive, asymptomatic cysts of the liver to keep the medical community informed. Clinical data of patients who accessed the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for CE at the University of Pavia-San Matteo Hospital Foundation from January 1991 to October 2017 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were presence of one or more inactive uncomplicated cysts in the liver (CE4 or CE5), without any history of previous treatment, and an ultrasound-based follow-up of at least 24 months. Fifty-three patients with 66 inactive cysts fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 patients are newly described here; 37 were part of our previously described cohort and the follow-up for 17 of them was further extended; and five were excluded from the previously published analysis as their follow-up was too short, but could be included now. Without the need for treatment and without development of complications, 98.5% of cysts remained inactive over time. In only one patient (1.9% of patients), a reactivation of one cyst (1.5% of cysts) was observed.

### Diagnosis and management of polycystic liver disease [^113dM1Uh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is arbitrarily defined as a liver that contains > 20 cysts. The condition is associated with two genetically distinct diseases: as a primary phenotype in isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD) and as an extrarenal manifestation in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Processes involved in hepatic cystogenesis include ductal plate malformation with concomitant abnormal fluid secretion, altered cell-matrix interaction and cholangiocyte hyperproliferation. PLD is usually a benign disease, but can cause debilitating abdominal symptoms in some patients. The main risk factors for growth of liver cysts are female sex, exogenous oestrogen use and multiple pregnancies. Ultrasonography is very useful for achieving a correct diagnosis of a polycystic liver and to differentiate between ADPKD and PCLD. Current radiological and surgical therapies for symptomatic patients include aspiration-sclerotherapy, fenestration, segmental hepatic resection and liver transplantation. Medical therapies that interact with regulatory mechanisms controlling expansion and growth of liver cysts are under investigation. Somatostatin analogues are promising; several clinical trials have shown that these drugs can reduce the volume of polycystic livers. The purpose of this Review is to provide an update on the diagnosis and management of PLD with a focus on literature published in the past 4 years.

### Cystic hepatic lesions: a review and an algorithmic approach [^116ZE5mo]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the different cystic hepatic lesions, with an emphasis on the imaging features that help to differentiate them, and to propose a practical algorithm for approaching the diagnosis of these lesions.

Conclusion

The number and morphology of the lesions and determination of whether there is a solid component are key imaging features that are helpful for approaching the diagnosis of cystic hepatic lesions. Familiarity with these features and knowledge of the clinical associations will help the radiologist to establish a definitive diagnosis or provide a reasonable differential diagnosis.

### Treatment of uncomplicated hepatic cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease) [^113eYsjV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The treatment of uncomplicated hepatic active/transitional cystic echinococcosis depends on the cyst characteristics, including the cyst stage, size and location within the liver, and overall patient health conditions (Brunetti 2010).

Treatment options include:

antiparasitic treatment with benzimidazoles;
invasive intervention such as: percutaneous techniques including: p uncture, a spiration, i njection with protoscolecidal agents and r e‐aspiration (PAIR); standard catheterization (the cyst is punctured by a needle, the fluid content aspirated, saline injection undertaken and a catheter inserted to allow cyst cavity irrigation with absolute alcohol followed by fluid drainage until minimal fluid remains); or modified catheterization techniques (MoCat) (similar to standard catheterization except that a guidewire may also be passed into the cyst through the catheter to mechanically break down cyst contents, or cyst contents may be broken down by multiple sessions of intensive irrigation with isotonic saline); surgery (open or laparoscopic), which involves removal of the cyst, both in conjunction with pre‐ and postoperative administration of benzimidazoles.

Cysts with any complications usually require surgical intervention, often with specialized procedures including endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, a therapeutic method often used to relieve biliary obstruction after a cyst rupture. There is uncertainty regarding the safety and efficacy of these different treatment options for clinically equivalent cysts. The conservative clinical management approach of only observing a cyst with no active intervention, also termed 'watch and wait', is applied for uncomplicated hepatic cysts in CE4 and CE5 stages (solid, inactive cysts).

Mortality and fatality rates are difficult to estimate and vary greatly depending on cyst location and characteristics; complications; and expertise, treatment modalities available, and health facilities where the patient is managed. Expertise can vary between and within different settings, depending on the experience of the health professional in the treatment modality utilized. On average, the reported figures for mortality range between 0.5% and 5%. Rates of recurrence after surgery and reactivation after medical treatment depend on a combination of factors (e.g. treatment method/schedule of antiparasitic drug applied, stage of the cyst); in the literature, reported figures range from 2% to 40% for recurrence after surgery and 9% to 60% for reactivation after medical treatment (McManus 2003).

Benign liver lesions are increasingly diagnosed in daily clinical practice due to the growing use of imaging techniques for the study of the abdomen in patients who have non-specific symptoms and do not have an increased risk of hepatic malignancy. They include simple or parasitic hepatic cysts and solid benign tumors which differ widely in terms of prevalence, clinical relevance, symptoms and natural history and often lead to significant clinical problems relating to diagnosis and clinical management. Following the need to have updated guidelines on the management of benign focal liver lesions, the Scientific Societies mainly involved in their management have promoted the drafting of a new dedicated document. This document was drawn up according to the present Italian rules and methodologies necessary to produce clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic guidelines based on evidence. Here we present the second part of the guideline, concerning the diagnosis and clinical management of hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatocellular adenoma.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^115mY1D1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

CT represents the examination of choice for the detection of biliary and/or vascular involvement, cyst wall rupture and superinfection. Changes in EC architecture, biliary dilation, presence of air, air-fluid level, or fat-fluid level within the cyst are nonspecific signs of intrabiliary rupture. T2-weighted MRI sequences and MRCP are similarly useful in diagnosing intrabiliary EC rupture. A poorly defined cystic lesion, a hyperenhancing rim, patchy heterogeneously enhancing areas in the vicinity of the lesion, and internal gas or air-fluid levels within the cyst combined with the appropriate clinical scenario are CT findings highly suggestive of EC superinfection.

Type I ECs, and biliary MCNs share many common radiologic characteristics with HSCs. When managing patients with unilocular cystic liver lesions, one should bear in mind that rapidly growing symptomatic cysts need to be differentiated both from MCNs and ECs, thus anti-echinococcal antibodies should always be sent along with the remaining work up, especially in endemic areas or when immigrants from these areas are involved.

The optimal therapeutic approach for the management of hepatic ECs depends on the extent of organ involvement, the number and size of cysts, the presence of communication with the biliary tree, simultaneous bacterial contamination and/or intracystic hemorrhage. One can choose between 3 different treatment modalities: a) systemic chemotherapy with mebendazole/albendazole; b) surgical approaches, ranging from deroofing to major hepatectomy; and c) percutaneous US guided "puncture, aspiration, injection and re-aspiration" (PAIR). Small ECs (< 5 cm) can be managed with antihelminthics and clinical observation. In a study evaluating this "watch and wait" strategy, 97.4% of ECs remained inactive over a 2-year period, although a longer follow-up period needs to be fully evaluated.

### Management of nonparasitic hepatic cysts [^1171WNXc]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal management of nonparasitic hepatic cysts (NPHC) is a topic of debate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our 17-year experience with NPHC.

Study Design

From January 1990 to August 2007, 131 consecutive patients with NPHC were evaluated and treated at our institution. Seventy-eight patients (60%) had simple hepatic cysts (SHC). The remaining 53 (40%) had polycystic liver disease (PLD). Morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rates for each of the two groups were evaluated.

Results

Thirty-seven patients underwent open deroofing (SHC, 24; PLD,13), 66 had laparoscopic deroofing (SHC, 46; PLD, 20), 19 had percutaneous drainage (SHC, 4; PLD, 15), 3 had major hepatic resections (PLD, 3), 4 had cystojejunostomy (SHC, 4), and 2 had combined hepatorenal transplantation (PLD, 2). Corresponding morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rates were, respectively: conventional deroofing: SHC, 29%, 0%, 8%; PLD, 8%, 0%, 0%; laparoscopic deroofing: SHC, 2%, 0%, 2%; PLD, 25%, 0%, 5%; percutaneous drainage: SHC, 0%, 0%, 75%; PLD, 0%, 0%, 20%; cystojejunostomy: SHC, 75%, 0%, 25%; major hepatic resections: PLD, 66%, 0%, 0%; and hepatorenal transplantation: PLD, 50%, 50%, 0%.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic deroofing provided complete relief of symptoms for both SHC and PLD. Percutaneous drainage was our procedure of choice for infected liver cysts and potentially for patients who cannot tolerate general anesthesia. Liver and liver-kidney transplantations were reserved for patients with end-stage PLD alone and in association with end-stage renal disease, respectively.

### Watch-and-wait approach for inactive echinococcal cysts: scoping review update since the issue of the WHO-IWGE expert consensus and current perspectives [^116YKUV7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The WHO-IWGE (Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis) Expert Consensus published in 2010 recommended that patients with cystic echinococcosis (CE) harbouring uncomplicated, asymptomatic, inactive (CE4-CE5 stages of the WHO-IWGE classification) CE cysts, especially localized in the liver, be monitored with ultrasound imaging, in the absence of treatment, with 'strength of recommendation: B (Moderate); Quality of Evidence: III (from experience or case reports)'. This was defined as 'watch-and-wait' approach. The attitude of leaving CE cysts with solid content untreated originated from previous observations that some CE cysts become solid (i.e. inactive) spontaneously and remain stable over time (reviewed in). We provide an update knowledge on the evolution of untreated inactive CE cysts gathered after the publication of the WHO-IWGE Expert Consensus document by means of a scoping review of the literature.

### Pulmonary cystic echinococcosis [^116SNGrQ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of our review is to summarize specific clinical, diagnostic and treatment aspects of pulmonary cystic echinococcosis. The lung is the organ second most affected by cystic echinococcosis with approximately a quarter of cystic echinococcosis cysts. Most cysts are in the liver. Apart from the watch and wait approach for selected inactive cysts [cystic echinococcosis CE4, CE5], the well established WHO cystic echinococcosis cyst classification-based treatment of hepatic cystic echinococcosis cannot be applied to pulmonary cystic echinococcosis cysts. Some standard interventions can even be harmful when applied to pulmonary cystic echinococcosis cysts.

Recent Findings

Cystic echinococcosis is one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Development of new diagnostics and treatment modalities is hampered by low investment into research and is accordingly slow.

Summary

Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for pulmonary cystic echinococcosis cysts. Parenchyma-sparing surgical techniques should be used whenever possible. Albendazole induces decay of the parasitic cyst membrane, opening of cystobronchial fistulas and cyst complications, which can be life threatening. It is strongly recommended to seek advice from expert centres, including differential diagnoses, treatment and a long-term management plan.

Although rarely studied in the literature, pribiliary cysts were frequent in studies designed to evaluate their prevalence, and were mostly asymptomatic. Inaccurate diagnosis, therapeutic misadventures, cysts progression and cysts-related complications are frequent.

Hydatid/echinococcal cysts — epidemiology, transmission, features, and imaging are summarized as follows: Cystic echinococcosis or hydatid cysts are caused by Echinococcus granulosus infection and are most commonly seen in rural sheep grazing areas with a wide geographical distribution. Humans serve as accidental intermediate hosts after ingestion of contaminated foods, water, or soil with Echinococcus eggs or organ meat from infected animals, after which eggs hatch in the small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall, and migrate via the venous system to organs including the liver and lungs. Cysts are often asymptomatic early, but larger cysts can cause abdominal discomfort and pain, compress the bile ducts leading to obstructive jaundice or cholangitis, and rupture or leak causing severe allergic reactions or anaphylaxis, peritonitis, ascites, and septic shock. Imaging appearances vary, and the WHO-Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis classification details ultrasound-based staging characteristics that help guide treatment options; management varies by cyst characteristics, clinical presentation, and center expertise.

### Laparoscopic treatment of simple hepatic cysts and polycystic liver disease [^115hW2Gs]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The authors present their experience in the laparoscopic management of hepatic cysts and polycystic liver disease (PLD).

Methods

Between January 1996 and January 2002, 16 patients underwent laparoscopic liver surgery. Indications were solitary giant cysts (n = 10) and PLD (n = 6). Data were collected retrospectively.

Results

Laparoscopic fenestration was completed in 15 patients. Median operative time was 80 min. There was no deaths. Complications occurred in four patients: one patient with a solitary liver cyst experienced diarrhea, while a pleural effusion, a bleeding from the trocar-insertion site, and ascites occurred in three patients with PLD. Median follow-up was 34 months. There was one asymptomatic recurrence (11%) in one patient with a solitary cyst. Two patients with PLD had a symptomatic recurrence of a liver cyst.

Conclusion

Laparoscopic fenestration could be the preferred treatment of solitary liver cysts and PLD. Adequate selection of patients and type of cystic liver together with a meticulous surgical technique are recommended.

### Complicated hepatic hydatid cyst with simultaneous biliary tree and intraperitoneal rupture: can we treat it in a minimally invasive way? [^116yskp3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

We report a case of complicated liver hydatid cyst with biliary tree communication, cholangitis, and simultaneous free intraperitoneal rupture. This very rare case was successfully treated in a minimally invasive way, initially with ERCP (large sphincterotomy and bile duct debridement), followed by percutaneous radiologic subdiaphragmatic drainage and prolonged administration of albendazole. Minimally invasive approaches like PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, and Re-aspiration) are accepted, although as yet not fully, only for the treatment of uncomplicated hydatid cysts. The best approach for complicated liver peripheral cysts ruptured into the biliary tract, is ERCP combined with complete surgical cyst removal including pericystic tissue and fistulous tract. Surgery is not easy to perform in the context of acute cholangitis, especially in the presence of a free peritoneal cyst rupture. In fact, the principal difficulty concerns the management of the large biliocystic fistula (> 5 mm), suture, internal transfistulary drainage or fistulization. After a liver hydatid cyst intraperitoneal rupture, the mortality rate increases up to 6% and morbidity rates range between 20% and 35%. These rates are even higher for older patients with poor performance status and comorbidities.

In conclusion, this very rare case which has not previously been reported to our knowledge, evaluates a clinically efficient alternative minimally invasive strategy for the treatment of complicated liver hydatid cyst. On this subject, the level of evidence is low and there are still many questions but few answers, clearly demanding further study and evaluation.

### Extrarenal manifestations: polycystic liver disease and its complications [^114cEEEw]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

The liver is the commonest site of involvement outside of the kidney in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Most individuals with polycystic liver disease are asymptomatic and require no therapeutic interventions, but a small number of affected individuals who experience symptomatic polycystic liver disease develop medical complications as a result of massive enlargement of cyst number and size and hepatic parenchyma and its subsequent associated complications. This can lead to deterioration in overall health and quality of life, increasing morbidity and mortality. In this review, we will touch upon disease pathogenesis, prevalence, and complications and discuss recent advances in surgical and medical management.

### Biliary mucinous cystic neoplasm mimicking a hydatid cyst: a case report and literature review [^117GR73y]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Management

Management of biliary mucinous cystic neoplasms is dictated by two key concerns. First, if misdiagnosed as a simple cyst or a hydatid cyst, incomplete excision (such as deroofing, marsupialization or partial resection) may be undertaken. Incomplete excision of BMCN is associated with a high recurrence rate, with some authors reporting recurrence rates over 90%. Thus, complete excision is indicated, and recurrence of a hepatic cyst following partial resection should raise suspicion for a BMCN. In the case of hepatic hydatid disease, surgical management is recommended to avoid complications such as exophytic growth leading to pressure or mass effects on nearby structures (such as bile ducts, portal or hepatic veins), cyst rupture leading to peritonitis, bacterial infection which can result in liver abscesses, transdiaphragmatic thoracic involvement as well as hematogenous dissemination. A pre-operative course of anthelmintics (e.g. albendazole) is recommended to achieve sterilization and to reduce the risk of recurrence post-operatively.

Second, because differentiating BMCN from cystadenocarcinoma pre-operatively is exceedingly difficult, complete surgical resection remains the gold standard. The risk of malignant transformation to cystadenocarcinoma supports the role of surgical resection. Lewis et al. published a series of 15 BMCNs for which formal resection was undertaken, and reported few complications and no recurrences. Table 1 summarizes the major characteristics of the largest contemporary case series on BMCNs. It emphasizes that complete resection is a safe and efficacious method to treat cystadenoma with good outcomes and low risk of recurrence. When the diagnosis is unclear pre-operatively between hydatid cyst and BMCN, we would recommend complete resection, as it would treat both diseases, and minimize the risk of recurrence.

Enucleation is a viable alternative in cases in which formal resection would be technically difficult or associated with excessive morbidity. Although only small case series are available, some have shown comparable results compared to formal hepatectomy, with few recurrences. However, given the large size of these lesions and the resulting distorted anatomy, enucleation remains technically challenging and must be approached with caution.

Finally, given the high rate of recurrence and the potential risk for malignant transformation, surveillance imaging with ultrasound or CT scan at regular intervals is recommended post-operatively.

Polycystic liver disease (PCLD) — epidemiology and management: Isolated PCLD is far less common than ADPKD with a prevalence of 1–10 per million, and because the 6 genes identified in PCLD only account for 30%–45% of the population, genetic testing is generally not recommended, though in young patients with PCLD and few renal cysts who do not meet diagnostic criteria, genetic testing might be helpful to exclude ADPKD. PCLD has a largely female predominance (> 80%), and in premenopausal women estrogen-containing OCPs led to a 5.5% higher height adjusted total liver volume over 10 years; exogenous estrogen use should be discontinued in patients with PCLD. Imaging surveillance of the cysts is not recommended in asymptomatic patients because there is no malignant potential.

### Approach of the patient with a liver mass [^1141fV5e]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The widespread use of imaging techniques has led to an increased diagnosis of incidental liver tumours. The differential diagnosis is extremely broad since it may range from benign asymptomatic lesions to malignant neoplasms. The correct characterisation of a liver mass has become a diagnostic challenge for most clinicians. They can be divided in two major categories; cystic lesions, usually benign with excellent long-term outcome, and solid lesions, in which malignancy should be excluded. A particular population is those patients with cirrhosis, who have high risk for hepatocellular carcinoma development. Dynamic imaging techniques have a pivotal role in the diagnostic work-up of liver tumours, allowing a confident diagnosis in most cases. If imaging is not conclusive, a biopsy should be requested to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^111fc4w9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Incidental focal liver lesions (FLLs) — initial evaluation and management: Incidental liver lesions can be defined as suspected findings within the liver, which are often identified on outpatient or emergency department imaging performed to investigate an unrelated clinical symptom such as pain, weight loss, or trauma, and imaging studies performed under these circumstances are usually either an abdominal ultrasound or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, and while they may identify a FLL, they cannot adequately characterize the lesion itself. Given the extensive categories of benign and malignant pathologies of FLLs, as well as differences in management, liver-directed imaging is often needed for adequate clarification; however, there are a few instances where further workup of incidental FLLs is not necessary, specifically if the imaging appearance on abdominal ultrasound or single-phase CT is characteristic for a hemangioma or benign uncomplicated cyst. In most instances, characterization of liver lesions requires careful investigation of the medical history, clinical symptomatology, physical examination, laboratory workup, and imaging, with attention to histories that suggest increased risk such as previous cancer, constitutional symptoms, foreign travel, medications including oral contraceptive pills, hormone supplementation, or steroids, and risk factors for chronic liver disease. Detection is common, with some studies showing that up to 52% of patients without cancer have a benign liver lesion at autopsy and the American College of Radiology reporting that up to 15% of patients have an incidental liver lesion detected on routine noninvasive imaging; common modalities detecting incidental lesions include ultrasonography (US) with or without contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

### Diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated hydatid cyst of the liver [^112k5Hrg]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Hydatid disease of the liver is still endemic in certain parts of the world. The diagnosis of noncomplicated hydatid cyst of the liver depends on clinical suspicion. Ultrasonography and computed tomography, the most important diagnostic tools, are helpful for determining the complications and planning treatment. The modern treatment of hydatid cyst of the liver varies from surgical intervention to percutaneous drainage or medical therapy. Surgery is still the treatment of choice and can be performed by the conventional or laparoscopic approach. Percutaneous drainage and treatment of the cyst with hypertonic saline or alcohol seems to be a good alternative to surgery in selected cases. Currently, we treat types I and II by ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage and types IV and V (excluding totally calcified cysts) surgically. Type III cysts can be managed either way depending on the presence of drainable content. We believe that the laparoscopic approach should be limited to noncomplicated cysts.

### Efficacy and safety of aspiration sclerotherapy of simple hepatic cysts: a systematic review [^115UXd5S]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Aspiration sclerotherapy is a percutaneous procedure indicated for treatment of symptomatic simple hepatic cysts. The efficacy and safety of this procedure have been sources of debate and disagreement for years. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of aspiration sclerotherapy in a systematic review of the literature.

Materials and Methods

A systematic search was conducted of the electronic databases PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library (until August 2015). Studies of proportional volume or diameter reduction after aspiration sclerotherapy of simple hepatic cysts were included for full-text evaluation. Case reports and case series were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed by use of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Results

From 9357 citations, 100 were selected for full-text assessment. We included 16 studies, which included 526 patients with a total of 588 treated cysts. Overall, risk of bias was high, with 12 of 16 studies having a score of poor. Proportional cyst volume reduction ranged between 76% and 100% after a median follow-up period of 1–54 months. Change in symptoms was evaluated in 10 studies: 72–100% of patients reported symptom reduction, and 56–100% reported disappearance. Postprocedural pain occurred most frequently, at a rate of 5–90% among studies. Ethanol intoxication occurred in up to 93% of cases and was reported more frequently in studies with either high ethanol volumes (133.7–138.3 mL) or long sclerotherapy duration (120–180 minutes).

Conclusion

We found excellent results with respect to long-term efficacy and safety after aspiration sclerotherapy of hepatic cysts. Nevertheless, because of the high risk of bias in the included studies, definite conclusions regarding efficacy cannot be drawn.

### ACG clinical guideline: focal liver lesions [^116oixH9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Table 3 (continued) — management of biliary hamartomas, peribiliary cysts, intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts, choledochal cysts, and hydatid cysts: Biliary hamartomas and peribiliary cysts are benign malformations and do not require surveillance imaging. Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts are premalignant biliary lesions with a high risk of malignant transformation, and thus, continued surveillance imaging is recommended even after surgical resection. Management and treatment of choledochal cysts is based on type of cyst and risk of malignant transformation; Type I or IV choledochal cysts are most commonly associated with malignancy and should undergo surveillance imaging, although a specific interval cannot be recommended. In both type IV and V choledochal cysts, when resection is not feasible, liver transplantation should be considered. For hydatid cysts, medical therapy with anthelmintic drugs is indicated before surgery or cyst puncture in symptomatic or active cysts to prevent recurrence, secondary seeding, or to decrease cyst pressure or in inoperable cases, and medical therapy alone is not recommended unless percutaneous aspiration or surgery is contraindicated.

Liver biopsy — echinococcal cyst management — The presence of an echinococcal cyst (hydatid disease) represents an absolute contraindication to biopsy because piercing a cyst may be associated with fatal anaphylaxis; however, available data suggest that careful aspiration with 19-gauge to 22-gauge needles is relatively safe, and if suspected, some consideration and preparation for possible anaphylaxis is warranted.

Polycystic liver disease (PCLD) — therapy and hormone guidance are specified as follows: We suggest discontinuation of exogenous estrogen use in women with PCLD (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). For patients with PCLD with numerous small- to medium-sized cysts throughout the liver not amenable to surgical resection, cyst fenestration or aspiration sclerotherapy, or for patients with symptomatic ADPKD with concurrent PCLD, we recommend medical management using somatostatin analogs (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence).

Introduction and Hypothesis

We present a simple approach to the marsupialization of a Skene's gland cyst.

Methods

Our technique facilitates suture placement to exteriorize the cyst wall to efficiently treat a distal Skene's gland cyst and reduce the risk of recurrence.

Conclusion

Marsupialization is an accepted option for the surgical management of Skene's gland cyst. This technique is an effective and streamlined approach to Skene's gland marsupialization.

### Symptomatic and complicated nonhereditary developmental liver cysts: cross-sectional imaging findings [^115JJqN4]. Emergency Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Commonly encountered in the general population, in the vast majority of cases nonhereditary developmental liver cysts are asymptomatic, not associated with altered hepatic function and confidently diagnosed on imaging studies, and do not require further workup, follow-up, or treatment. However, particularly in women, simple hepatic cysts may reach large sizes and cause symptoms and signs resulting from mass effect, vascular compression, and biliary obstruction. Furthermore, although rarely compared to the incidence observed in patients with adult polycystic kidney and liver disease, sporadic hepatic cysts sometimes undergo life-threatening complications such as intracystic hemorrhage, infection, or rupture, which require prompt imaging triage and appropriate interventional, laparoscopic, or open surgical treatment. This pictorial essay reviews with examples the cross-sectional imaging findings of symptomatic and complicated nonhereditary liver cysts, aiming to provide radiologists with an increased familiarity with these uncommon, challenging occurrences. Emphasis is placed on the role of MRI as a useful problem-solving modality to elucidate the complex imaging appearances resulting from intracystic bleeding and superinfection, and to differentiate complicated cysts from other hemorrhagic liver lesions and biliary cystic tumors.

IPNBs display microscopic fibrovascular cores or tubulopapillary formations within the bile ducts. The epithelium may be of pancreatobiliary, intestinal, gastric or oncocytic type, with various degrees of atypia. According to their histopathologic subtype, IPNBs may express specific mucin core proteins, such as MUC5AC and MUC6 in the pancreatobiliary and gastric type, MUC-1 in the pancreatobiliary subtype, and MUC2 in intestinal type cells. The neoplastic stroma is fibrous and lacks the ovarian-like morphology of MCNs. The majority of the carcinomas arising from IPNBs are pancreatobiliary type cholangiocarcinomas, while mucinous carcinomas are usually associated with intestinal type tumors. IPNBs with invasive characteristics follow the staging of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, with a better prognosis, determined by the depth of invasion as well as the proportion (%) of the invasive component.

Management options (HSCs vs. mucinous-secreting cystic neoplasms of the liver and biliary tract)

Treatment may be indicated for symptomatic or questionable HSCs. Open or laparoscopic fenestration ("unroofing") is the first-line treatment to drain an HSC in the peritoneal cavity, resulting in symptom reduction in 92% of cases. Laparoscopic fenestration combined with marsupialization appeared to be safe and effective in patients with HSCs measuring > 15 cm in diameter, with a single recurrence recorded during 41 months of follow up. Endoscopic transgastric cyst drainage is an attractive treatment option, eliminating the need for incisions. However, it is limited to superficially located left-sided liver cysts, unless the procedure is assisted laparoscopically.

Sclerotherapy is a simple, safe and efficacious treatment indicated in patients with poor performance status. During this procedure, a sclerosing agent (dehydrated alcohol or tetracycline) is injected into HSCs after complete aspiration of their content. In a multicenter study comprising HSCs > 5 cm in diameter, complete clinical response was 55% at 6 months, while lesser responses have been observed with complex cysts containing hemorrhagic or large amounts of intracystic debris. If malignancy is suspected, liver resection with clear margins is required.

### Cystic liver lesions: a pictorial review [^111LKqLW]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic cysts are frequent (2.5% to 18% in the general population), mostly incidental and asymptomatic lesions. They are well-defined fluid-filled lesions, with or without epithelial lining. Depending on the lesion, the cystic component may be composed of different types of fluid, including bilious, serous, mucinous, necrotic, haemorrhagic, proteinaceous or mixed fluid. Some of them may be diagnosed non-invasively on the basis of specific imaging features. Radiologists should both know and recognise non-typical benign features — i.e. wall thickness, presence of septa, tissular component, enhancement, and signal intensity on MRI — and systematically take the clinical context into consideration.

The aim of this article is to describe and illustrate some of the most frequent cystic hepatic lesions, with a special emphasis on typical radiological features, which allow a non-invasive diagnosis. Even though the extra-hepatic bile ducts abnormalities, rare tumours sometimes cystic (hepatocellular carcinoma, mucinous cholangiocarcinoma, etc.) and post-traumatic lesions will not be addressed in this review, they are listed in Table 1.

Due to the inherent limitations of preoperative diagnostic tools, all suspected biliary MCNs should ideally be surgically removed with negative margins. Especially in MCNs with associated invasive carcinoma, the gold standard of treatment is radical resection with a wide (> 2 cm) surgical margin. Pathological staging of invasive MCNs follows the staging of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. However, they present a notably favorable prognosis compared to other hepatic malignancies, since they exhibit less aggressive clinical behavior, with slow growth and rare metastases. In a retrospective study by Jwa et al, no tumor recurrences were observed in patients with MCNs undergoing complete surgical removal. Postoperative 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates in patients bearing invasive MCNs were 100%, 100%, and 75.0%, respectively. Optimal prognosis is expected only if complete (R0) resection is contemplated. Klompenhouwer et al reported a 5% recurrence rate for MCNs following resection or enucleation, and up to 100% post-fenestration. In a literature review analyzing 25 studies that included 103 patients with MCNs, the main indication to choose enucleation over liver resection was a large cyst located in a central liver portion. Data review demonstrated a 0% recurrence rate, no postoperative deaths, and no late occurring malignancies. The authors concluded that MCN enucleation is a safe and effective option for patients who cannot tolerate major hepatectomy.

Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for IPNBs. The extent of surgical resection depends on the tumor location, the degree of biliary tract involvement and patient suitability. Most patients are sufficiently treated with radical surgical resection, which includes hepatectomy with or without bile duct resection. In extreme cases with more aggressive IPNBs and positive resection margins, major hepatectomy or orthotopic liver transplantation, with or without pancreaticoduodenectomy, may be performed. IPNBs undergoing curative surgical resection present a significantly better prognosis compared to cholangiocarcinomas, with 5-year disease-free survival as high as 81%. Positive resection margins, positive lymph nodes, tumor invasion ≥ 5 mm and invasive component ≥ 10% are all associated with a poorer prognosis. Taking into account the incidence of invasiveness and metastases in patients with IPNBs, and hence the high possibility of disease recurrence, regular postoperative follow up with short-interval imaging is recommended.

Infectious cysts

Bacterial, fungal and amoebic liver abscesses and hepatic hydatid cysts are among the differential considerations for complex liver cysts.

Haematuria and cyst haemorrhage

Macroscopic haematuria is reported in 5–15% of children with ADPKD. However, studies may overestimate the incidence, as imaging for haematuria may have prompted the diagnosis. Macroscopic haematuria is associated with enlarged TKV in adultsbut was not more common in children with severe versus moderate versus no cysts, nor in children with very-early-onset disease versus those with later onset. Gross haematuria before the age of 30–35 years is associated with worse renal survival in adults with ADPKD. Observations in adults with severe cyst haemorrhage seem to suggest a benefit of treatment with tranexamic acid, but the efficacy of this therapy has not been investigated in children.

Nephrolithiasis

Nephrolithiasis is an exceedingly rare complication in children with ADPKD, and ultrasonography should be used as the first-line imaging modality to rule out stones or other urinary tract obstructions. If kidney stones are found, additional risk factors for stone disease should be investigated, and a high fluid intake and symptomatic treatment are recommended.

Liver cysts

As the size and number of ADPKD-related liver cysts are known to increase in pregnancy, avoidance of exogenous oestrogens and hormone replacement therapy is generally recommended for women with ADPKD. However, the prevalence of hepatic cysts in children with ADPKD is < 5%, with no reports of severe cases. The risk of future aggravated liver disease in young women with ADPKD considering hormonal contraceptive therapy should be balanced against the risk of unplanned pregnancy. Assessment of the burden of liver cysts and family history might assist in clinical decision-making.
