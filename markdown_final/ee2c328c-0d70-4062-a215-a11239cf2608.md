## Question

How is gout diagnosed, and what are the common symptoms?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how gout is diagnosed and what the common symptoms are. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing when to suspect gout clinically. Then, I should verify the gold standard diagnostic test and its feasibility. Next, I'll review what to do when crystal analysis isn't possible, including validated classification criteria and imaging. After that, I need to check how serum urate and other labs fit into diagnosis. Then, I should examine comorbidities and risk factors. I will also consider atypical presentations that can mislead. Finally, I'll synthesize a diagnostic approach and summarize the characteristic symptoms and common pitfalls, ensuring each assertion is anchored to appropriate guidelines or evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical triggers for suspicion. Gout should be high on the differential in adults with acute monoarthritis, especially first metatarsophalangeal involvement, with abrupt onset of severe pain peaking within 12–24 hours and prominent inflammatory signs including swelling, erythema, warmth, and marked tenderness, with an episodic pattern early in the disease course; EULAR advises explicitly to include gout in the differential for any adult with acute arthritis, which aligns with classic podagra presentations described in core reviews and guidelines, so this frame is sound and consistent with best practice [^113jCzmB] [^111wMtrC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without anchoring the diagnostic standard. The definitive diagnosis is the identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid or tophus aspirate by polarized light microscopy, recognizing negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals, which remains the gold standard per ACR/EULAR methodology papers and ACP guidance recommending synovial fluid analysis when diagnostic testing is indicated; feasibility can be limited by joint accessibility and microscopy expertise, but when positive it is highly specific and should be pursued during an acute flare when possible [^1111X7CV] [^111NWXYW].

> Wait, let me verify what to do when arthrocentesis cannot be done. In that scenario, the 2015 ACR/EULAR classification criteria provide a validated, data-driven scoring system that integrates clinical features, serum urate, and imaging, with good sensitivity and specificity in validation work; AAFP guidance also endorses using validated clinical decision rules alongside clinical and imaging data when aspiration is not performed, though I should emphasize these are classification tools, not a substitute for crystal confirmation when attainable [^112h2Xav] [^117YR5Kt] [^114m1nrX] [^116TDyzM] [^1152rKQM].

> Next, I should review imaging, and I need to be precise. Initial radiography is appropriate to look for characteristic erosions or tophi and as a first-line modality in suspected inflammatory arthritis per American College of Radiology, while ultrasound at the point of care can support the diagnosis by identifying the double contour sign, which systematic reviews suggest has reasonably high specificity; DECT can visualize urate deposition with reported sensitivities around 85–100% and specificities 83–92% in comparative studies, and ultrasound or CT can complement radiographs to detect erosions and tophi, with MRI used as a problem-solving or procedure-guidance tool in difficult cases [^115bdqHM] [^1113BU1q] [^116FjpPZ] [^111FGfKM] [^117VnH6i] [^117Y4Fea].

> I need to ensure labs are interpreted in context. Hyperuricemia alone does not diagnose gout, and EULAR explicitly recommends against diagnosing gout based solely on an elevated serum urate; however, serum urate contributes to the ACR/EULAR criteria, and once gout is established, a treat-to-target strategy aiming for serum urate below 6 mg/dL is standard and FDA-recognized as an appropriate therapeutic goal, sometimes lower in severe disease, but that is a management target rather than a diagnostic criterion [^116bpXqK] [^112h2Xav] [^113tyTHd].

> Let me consider comorbidities and risk modifiers because they affect both suspicion and evaluation. Renal function should be assessed at diagnosis and monitored longitudinally given the bidirectional links between CKD and urate handling per treat-to-target recommendations, and gout commonly coexists with cardiometabolic disease; there is emerging evidence of temporal cardiovascular risk around gout diagnosis and flares, and broader reviews underscore the high burden of cardiovascular and renal comorbidity that complicates both diagnosis and treatment choices, so I should incorporate medication review, especially diuretics, and measure blood pressure, metabolic parameters, and kidney function during the diagnostic work-up [^113eWh1B] [^113Wqygy] [^1174ieho].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical. Atypical patterns such as early-onset disease from genetic predisposition, axial involvement, extra-articular tophi in unusual locations, pseudoseptic systemic features, or polyarticular flares in advanced disease can confound diagnosis, in which case a combination of imaging modalities like ultrasound or DECT and careful application of classification criteria becomes more critical to triangulate toward gout in the absence of crystals and to avoid mislabeling septic arthritis or other crystal arthropathies [^117L13yS] [^117Y4Fea] [^112h2Xav].

> I will now examine how to synthesize these elements into a diagnostic pathway. The most robust confirmation is crystal-proven gout via synovial fluid or tophus analysis when feasible; if arthrocentesis is not possible, a high-probability synthesis combines typical clinical features with specific imaging evidence such as the ultrasound double contour sign or DECT-demonstrated urate deposition, supported by elevated serum urate and pattern recognition, while meeting or exceeding the ACR/EULAR classification threshold can standardize case identification when crystals are unavailable, recognizing the classification, not diagnostic, intent of the criteria [^1111X7CV] [^116FjpPZ] [^111FGfKM] [^112h2Xav] [^1152rKQM].

> Let me think about symptoms across the disease course and ensure I capture the spectrum accurately. Acute flares feature excruciating joint pain with rapid crescendo to peak in less than 24 hours, pronounced swelling, warmth, erythema, marked tenderness often to light touch, sometimes low-grade fever and malaise, with podagra common at presentation and an overall high one-year recurrence rate after a first flare; over time, intercritical periods may shorten, and chronic tophaceous gout produces firm subcutaneous deposits, chronic arthropathy with stiffness and erosive changes, and may involve nephrolithiasis and other urate-related renal manifestations, as described in authoritative reviews and clinical summaries [^111wMtrC] [^116sHinV].

> Hold on, I should verify nuances in pain mechanisms since this can influence interpretation of persistent symptoms. While gout pain is predominantly inflammatory and nociceptive, some studies in inflammatory arthritides, including gout, suggest a minority of patients exhibit generalized pain hypersensitivity consistent with central sensitization, which may not respond fully to anti-inflammatory therapy and can complicate symptom assessment between flares; the evidence base is limited and lower credibility, so I will note it cautiously as a potential contributor rather than a core diagnostic feature [^111xFVne].

> Finally, I should double-check common diagnostic pitfalls to avoid anchoring errors. Do not diagnose gout based on hyperuricemia alone, because many hyperuricemic individuals never develop gout and serum urate can be normal during an acute flare; when the presentation is atypical or there is concern for septic arthritis, prioritize synovial fluid analysis to exclude infection and confirm crystals per ACP guidance, and remember that early radiographs can be normal, so a normal film does not exclude gout in the acute setting, with ultrasound or DECT offering added specificity when needed [^116bpXqK] [^111NWXYW] [^117Y4Fea] [^111FGfKM].

Gout is diagnosed by identifying monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in synovial fluid or tophi [^1111X7CV], which is the **gold standard** [^111NWXYW]. If aspiration is not feasible, use validated clinical criteria (e.g. ACR/EULAR) [^1152rKQM] and imaging (ultrasound double contour sign [^11563DPg] or DECT [^111FGfKM]) to support diagnosis. Common symptoms include **sudden severe joint pain** [^111wMtrC], swelling, erythema, warmth, and tenderness, most often in the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra), with flares peaking within 24 hours [^113Wqygy] and resolving in days to weeks; chronic disease may show tophi, joint deformity, and polyarticular involvement [^116sHinV].

## Clinical presentation and common symptoms

---

### Acute gout flare

- **Sudden onset**: Rapid onset [^116XCZDk] of severe joint pain [^111wMtrC], swelling, erythema, warmth, and tenderness, often peaking within 24 hours [^113CTcv8].

- **Monoarticular involvement**: Most commonly affects a single joint [^113jCzmB], particularly the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint (podagra) [^111wMtrC].

- **Severe pain**: Intense pain, often described as excruciating [^113CTcv8], with significant functional impairment [^111wMtrC].

- **Resolution**: Flares typically resolve spontaneously [^111wMtrC] within days to weeks, even without treatment [^114goZD1].

---

### Chronic gout

- **Tophi**: Firm, subcutaneous nodules composed of urate crystals [^111wMtrC], commonly found on ears, elbows, fingers, and Achilles tendon.

- **Chronic arthritis**: Persistent joint inflammation [^111wMtrC], leading to joint deformity, erosion, and functional impairment [^1113BU1q].

- **Polyarticular involvement**: Multiple joints may be affected over time [^116XCZDk], particularly in advanced disease [^111wMtrC].

---

## Diagnostic methods

The diagnosis of gout involves a **combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and imaging studies** [^116bpXqK]:

---

### Clinical evaluation

During clinical evaluation, **history and physical examination** [^1136Wi1C] should document articular symptoms, prior flares, and risk factors (e.g. hyperuricemia, alcohol use, diuretics). If joint aspiration is not performed, **validated clinical criteria** (e.g. ACR/EULAR) [^1152rKQM] are used to estimate the likelihood of gout [^112h2Xav].

---

### Laboratory tests

For laboratory testing, **synovial fluid analysis** — identifying monosodium urate (MSU) crystals under polarized light microscopy [^111NWXYW] — is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis [^1111X7CV]. **Serum uric acid levels** greater than 6.8 mg/dL support the diagnosis [^111wMtrC] but are not diagnostic on their own [^116bpXqK], as levels may be normal during acute flares [^1152rKQM].

---

### Imaging studies

- **Ultrasound**: Detection of the "double contour sign" [^11563DPg] (urate crystal deposition on cartilage surfaces) and tophi not evident on clinical examination.

- **Dual-energy CT (DECT)**: Highly sensitive and specific for detecting urate crystal deposits in joints and soft tissues [^111FGfKM] [^1152rKQM].

- **Plain radiography**: Useful for detecting characteristic bone erosions [^1113BU1q] and tophi in chronic gout.

---

## Differential diagnosis

Gout must be differentiated from **other causes of acute arthritis** [^111NWXYW]. These include septic arthritis — an infection of the joint requiring urgent treatment [^1152rKQM]; pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease), which presents similarly but has different crystal morphology [^113jCzmB]; and rheumatoid arthritis, a chronic inflammatory arthritis with distinct clinical and laboratory features [^116bpXqK].

## Summary of diagnostic approach

| **Diagnostic method** | **Key features** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical evaluation | - History <br/> - Physical exam <br/> - Validated criteria | Subjective; may miss atypical cases |
| Synovial fluid analysis | MSU crystals (gold standard) | Invasive; not always feasible |
| Serum uric acid | Supports diagnosis | Not specific; may be normal during flares |
| Ultrasound | Double contour sign; tophi | Operator-dependent |
| DECT | Highly sensitive and specific | Limited availability; cost |
| Plain radiography | Bone erosions; tophi | Less sensitive in early disease |

### Generalized pain hypersensitivity and associated factors in gout [^113CTcv8]. Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, especially in men, characterized by an intense inflammatory reaction triggered by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around the joints. Acute gout flares are usually extremely painful and self-limiting, resolving within several days. The pain is most often directly related to the inflammation and typically also resolves completely. However, gouty arthritis may also result in chronic pain between gout flares due to gouty bone erosions and deformities.

Although gout pain is generally assumed to be either inflammatory or nociceptive in nature, it remains unclear whether other pain mechanisms, including central sensitization, may also play a role in gout. Several studies have indicated that different types of inflammatory arthritis are associated with an altered state of central pain processing, referred to as central sensitization. Central sensitization typically manifests as general hypersensitivity of the pain system, including allodynia, (secondary) hyperalgesia, and aftersensations. Previous studies have suggested that up to 40–45% of patients with inflammatory arthritides display signs of central sensitization, which is generally not associated with objective parameters of inflammation or disease activity.

As pain due to central sensitization does not respond well to traditional anti-inflammatory medications such as those typically used in gout treatment and may have a serious negative impact on functionality and quality of life, it is important to examine if and to what extent central sensitization contributes to the pain experienced by individuals with gout.

### Gout [^111wMtrC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gout:

- **Definition**: Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues.

- **Pathophysiology**: Gout is due to persistently elevated blood levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia), which is often multifactorial. This includes increased intake of purine-rich foods, defects in purine metabolism, older age, male sex, obesity, renal failure, and diuretics.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of gout is estimated at 3,900 persons per 100,000 population. The incidence of gout is estimated at 400 per 100,000 person-years in men, and 140 per 100,000 person-years in women.

- **Disease course**: In patients with acute gout, deposition of urate monohydrate crystals inside joint cavities initiates an inflammatory response that results in the clinical manifestations of arthritis. Chronic synovitis, bony erosions, cartilage damage, and tophi formation may occur in patients with chronic gout.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year recurrence rate for an acute gout attack in patients who have experienced an attack in the past year is estimated at 69%.

### Diagnosis of gout: A systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111FGfKM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Alternative strategies exist for diagnosing gout that do not rely solely on the documentation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals.

- **Purpose**: To summarize evidence regarding the accuracy of clinical tests and classification algorithms compared with that of a reference standard of MSU crystals in joint aspirate for diagnosing gout.

- **Data sources**: Several electronic databases from inception to 29 February 2016.

- **Study selection**: Twenty-one prospective cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies including participants with joint inflammation and no previous definitive gout diagnosis who had MSU analysis of joint aspirate.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment by two reviewers independently; overall strength of evidence (SOE) judgment by group.

- **Data synthesis**: Recently developed algorithms, including clinical, laboratory, and imaging criteria, demonstrated good sensitivity (up to 88%) and fair to good specificity (up to 96%) for diagnosing gout (moderate SOE). Three studies of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) showed sensitivities of 85% to 100% and specificities of 83% to 92% for diagnosing gout (low SOE). Six studies of ultrasonography showed sensitivities of 37% to 100% and specificities of 68% to 97%, depending on the ultrasonography signs assessed. The pooled sensitivity and specificity for the double contour sign were 74% (95% CI, 52% to 88%) and 88% (CI, 68% to 96%), respectively (low SOE).

- **Limitation**: Important study heterogeneity and selection bias; scant evidence in primary and urgent care settings and in patients with conditions that may b

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^1111X7CV]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The new ACR/EULAR gout classification criteria represent an international collaborative effort that incorporates the latest published evidence on imaging modalities. This effort employs a data-driven approach with MSU identification as a gold standard to reference key features, and a decision analytic approach to inform the weighting of the scoring system. The classification criteria set will enable a standardized approach to identifying a relatively homogeneous group of individuals who have the clinical entity of gout for enrollment into studies. The criteria permit characterization of an individual as having gout regardless of whether he or she is currently experiencing an acute symptomatic episode and regardless of any comorbidities. The new classification criteria have superior performance characteristics, with high sensitivity and improved specificity compared with previously published criteria. Arguably, specificity — leading to high positive predictive value — is of critical importance in most clinical studies, since investigators need to have confidence that individuals enrolled in a study truly have the condition of interest.

Gout is unlike other rheumatic diseases in that a gold standard assessment is available, namely MSU crystal positivity. While this gold standard has high specificity, its feasibility and sensitivity may be inadequate due to difficulty with aspiration of joints, particularly small ones, and/or examination of the sample under polarizing microscopy. Thus, although MSU crystal results are extremely helpful when positive, they are not always feasible.

### Casebook challenges: Managing gout, hyperuricemia, and comorbidities — dialogue with the experts [^115ZpRbx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia is on the rise in the United States, correlating with an increase in risk factors for these conditions such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and the use of diuretics. As a progressive disorder, untreated gout can be debilitating and result in tophi, chronic arthropathy, and renal complications like kidney stones. Although joint aspiration is needed for a definitive diagnosis, most patients are diagnosed presumptively based on medical history and presentation with characteristic signs and symptoms.

Patients with gout often have multiple comorbidities, and there is an increasing body of evidence showing that hyperuricemia is associated with the incidence of hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Clinical strategies for managing gout and hyperuricemia must consider these and other common cardiometabolic and renal conditions. In addition to acute flare therapy and prophylaxis, the treatment of gout involves lowering serum uric acid (SUA) levels with urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) such as allopurinol or febuxostat. Once initiated, treatment with ULT is lifelong; however, inadequate dosing and patient nonadherence or intolerance to therapy often lead to treatment failure.

Recent guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology emphasize tailoring therapy and targeting SUA levels — traditionally < 6 mg/dL, though lower levels may be needed for certain patients — based on gout severity and the presence of comorbid conditions. Painful acute gout flares may result in trips to the emergency department, and they highlight the importance of precise management strategies.

Uloric is a xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitor indicated for the chronic management of hyperuricemia in adult patients with gout who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable.

- **Limitations of use**: Uloric is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^1139UKZq]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). High credibility.

In the management of gout, particularly during acute flares, the EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend initiating colchicine within 12 hours of flare onset. The suggested dosage is a loading dose of 1 mg followed one hour later by 0.5 mg on day 1. Alternatively, an NSAID (with PPIs if appropriate), oral corticosteroids (30–35 mg/day of equivalent prednisolone for 3–5 days), or articular aspiration followed by intra-articular corticosteroids, can be used as first-line options for the management of acute flares.

### 2015 Gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^117YR5Kt]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). High credibility.

In Phase 2, an international panel of expert rheumatologists and primary care physicians used a multicriterion decision analytic consensus methodology, informed by data generated in Phase 1, to determine the factors that best discriminated gout from other rheumatic diseases that could conceivably be considered in the differential diagnosis. Such an approach would lead to expert-derived, data-informed weighting of discriminating factors. The specific methods are described below.

Rheumatologists and general internists with an interest in gout submitted paper patient cases of patients for whom gout was in the differential diagnosis, using standardized data collection forms. A subset of 30 paper patient cases was selected to represent a broad spectrum of the probability of gout. Prior to the in-person expert panel meeting, panel members were given the data from Phase 1 to review, and they were asked to rank-order the 30 paper patient cases from lowest to highest probability of having gout.

At the in-person expert panel meeting, held over two days (June 9–10, 2014, in Paris, France, in advance of the EULAR Congress), three concepts were agreed upon a priori. First, the task was to develop criteria that would enable standardized assembly of a well-defined, relatively homogeneous group of subjects representative of persons with gout, for entry into observational studies or clinical trials. Such criteria are not intended to capture all possible patients but rather to capture the great majority of patients with shared key features of gout.

### Verinurad combined with febuxostat in Japanese adults with gout or asymptomatic hyperuricaemia: a phase 2a, open-label study [^114FCU2F]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints, tendons, and other connective tissues, secondary to long-standing hyperuricaemia. Hyperuricaemia itself is typically undetected until the symptoms of gout or its commonly associated comorbidities — such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic syndrome — are diagnosed. Successful management of gout requires a sustained reduction in the concentration of serum urate (sUA) below a target of < 6.0 mg/dL, or < 5.0 mg/dL in patients with severe gout symptoms, which leads over time to the dissolution of crystals, the alleviation of gout symptoms, and improved outcomes from cardiovascular, renal, and other comorbidities.

To achieve a sustained reduction in sUA, most patients require long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT). Currently available ULTs include the xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs) allopurinol and febuxostat, which reduce the production of urate, and the uricosurics probenecid, benzbromarone, sulfinpyrazone, and lesinurad, which increase the excretion of sUA by inhibiting its reabsorption. Many patients fail to achieve their target sUA using an XOI as monotherapy. For these patients, management guidelines recommend combining ULTs with complementary mechanisms of action, such as an XOI with a uricosuric. Japanese guidelines, in addition to providing guidance on the treatment of gout, offer recommendations on managing asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, on the basis that reducing sUA in these subjects can prevent the onset of gout.

### Short-term risk of cardiovascular events in people newly diagnosed with gout [^114fXNk5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

A self-controlled case series (SCCS) study evaluated the temporal association between the first diagnosis of gout — typically a flare consultation at which gout could be diagnosed in primary care or secondary care — and cardiovascular events. In the SCCS study, eligible patients — those with an exposure and an outcome — act as their own controls. Comparisons are made within individuals and not between them, accounting for fixed, time-invariant confounding. A cohort study provided estimates of the incidence of cardiovascular events following the first consultation in which gout was diagnosed. The study period spanned from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2020.

- **Data source**: Linked primary care, hospitalization, and mortality data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)-GOLD, Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), and Office for National Statistics (ONS) databases, respectively. CPRD-GOLD contains anonymized patient data on sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, prescriptions, diagnoses, and test results originating during routine care from more than 18 million individuals in England.

- **Source population**: Patients were newly diagnosed with gout at 18 years or older who contributed research-quality data to CPRD-GOLD, with their primary care records linked to HES and ONS datasets. To minimize the risk of including prevalent gout cases as incident, we included patients with a new diagnosis of gout at least two years after their registration at the Practice, without prior prescription.

Gout is a common form of arthritis, where many risk factors, pathogenetic mechanisms, and clinical features have been recognized for years. Nevertheless, new information has become available regarding the normal physiologic role of uric acid as an antioxidant, and greater insight has been obtained regarding the inflammatory process in acute gout. Recent studies have improved our understanding of the role of genetic and environmental factors responsible for hyperuricemia, and we know more about the significance of the association of hyperuricemia with other diseases.

Clinically, rare complications and disease manifestations in new populations continue to be discussed, and diagnostic methods continue to be refined.

### Investigating gout flares: Beyond a definition [^117QkxRi]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Gout flares are a paramount component of the disease burden inflicted by gout on the patient. Furthermore, they are included in the core domain set for long-term gout studies recognized by Outcome Measures in Rheumatology. Along with a validated classification criterion for gout, researchers have focused their efforts on defining and characterizing the gout flare. This brief review summarizes the work done to define and characterize a gout flare in clinical studies.

Recent findings include a validated definition of a gout flare that has been utilized in novel clinical studies, the use of technology to monitor gout flares and their effects on patients' lives, and qualitative analyses into the disease burden that patients endure.

Although guidelines for core outcome domains have been well established, there are questions about methods of measuring and reporting gout flares in long-term trials. Furthermore, there is doubt regarding the effectiveness of the instruments' ability to fully capture the disease burden experienced by patients with gout. A combination of outcome measurements, including binary data (gout flare present or absent) along with a comprehensive measurement of disease burden over time, would theoretically provide a more accurate description of the disease and serve as a basis for intervention development.

Regarding medical management for gout, and more specifically with respect to the management of acute flares, EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend treating acute flares of gout as early as possible. Patients should be fully educated to self-medicate at the first warning symptoms. The choice of drug should depend on the presence of contraindications, the patient's previous experience with treatments, the time of initiation after flare onset, and the number and type of joints involved.

### Krystexxa [^1171CpnV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A 52-week, randomized, double-blind trial was conducted in adult patients with chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy to evaluate the administration of Krystexxa 8 mg every two weeks co-administered with weekly methotrexate 15 mg, compared to Krystexxa alone. Patients in Trial 1 (NCT03994731) were naïve to Krystexxa therapy. Patients who tolerated two weeks of oral methotrexate 15 mg were then randomized to receive four additional weeks on either methotrexate 15 mg or a matching placebo before initiating Krystexxa therapy in a 2:1 ratio. Each Krystexxa infusion was preceded by a standardized infusion reaction prophylaxis regimen consisting of oral fexofenadine, acetaminophen, and intravenous methylprednisolone.

Methotrexate or placebo was administered weekly throughout the Krystexxa treatment period, accompanied by daily oral folic acid, to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of methotrexate in attenuating the development of anti-drug antibodies.

Entry criteria for this trial were: baseline serum uric acid ≥ 7 mg/dL, inability to maintain serum uric acid < 6 mg/dL on other urate-lowering therapy, intolerable side effects associated with urate-lowering therapy, and/or the presence of clinically evident tophaceous deposits.

### Common intestinal parasites [^111AXPMa]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Parasites are a source of significant illness worldwide. In the United States, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis, and trichinellosis are nationally notifiable conditions. Pinworm, the most common intestinal parasite in children, is not a locally notifiable infection. Intestinal parasites have a wide range of acute and chronic symptoms but should be suspected in those who present with diarrhea lasting more than seven days. Infections most often occur through a fecal-oral route. Symptoms tend to be worse for children, older adults, or immunocompromised individuals.

To diagnose Giardia infection, stool microscopy with direct fluorescent antibody testing is recommended. Metronidazole, nitazoxanide, or tinidazole is used for treatment. Microscopy with immunofluorescence is sensitive and specific for diagnosing Cryptosporidium infection. This infection is often self-resolving, but treatment with nitazoxanide is effective for symptoms lasting more than two weeks. Microscopy or polymerase chain reaction assays are recommended to diagnose Cyclospora infections, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim may be used to treat patients with persistent diarrhea. Trichinella infection is diagnosed by serum antibody testing, and severe symptoms are treated with albendazole in patients older than one year. Pinworm infections are diagnosed visually or by a tape test or paddle test; albendazole and pyrantel pamoate are both effective treatments.

### Uloric [^113tyTHd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout.

- **Management of hyperuricemia in gout**: The efficacy of Uloric was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level of ≥ 8 mg/dL.

	- **Study 1 (NCT00430248)**: Patients were randomized to receive either Uloric 40 mg daily, Uloric 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Clcr) ≥ 60 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Clcr ≥ 30 mL/min and ≤ 59 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months.

	- **Study 2 (NCT00174915)**: Patients were randomized to receive placebo, Uloric 80 mg daily, Uloric 120 mg daily, Uloric 240 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and ≤ 2 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months.

	- **Study 3 (NCT00102440)**: This year-long study randomized patients to receive Uloric 80 mg daily, Uloric 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study, where they received treatment with Uloric for over three years.

In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1, the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3, the duration…

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^113jcmxe]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of data on the natural history of gout, which has several stages of development. The Gout, Hyperuricemia and Crystal-Associated Disease Network (G-CAN) has previously endorsed a definition of the disease state 'gout' that requires prior clinically evident symptoms or signs resulting from MSU crystal deposition. Gout is generally considered a chronic disease, characterized by episodic highly symptomatic flares. Poorly controlled gout can substantially impact an affected individual and their family. Inadequately treated gout leads to recurrent flares, the formation of tophi (which contain aggregated masses of MSU crystals in joints and certain soft tissues), chronic gouty arthritis, and joint erosion. Ulceration and infection associated with tophi occur frequently, and surgical interventions for these sequelae have a high complication rate.

Substantial time off work, poor health-related quality of life, and disability are common in those with poorly controlled gout. Gout is associated with frequent hospital admissions, particularly in patients with hyperuricemia and inadequate allopurinol use and/or dose. However, not all individuals with gout develop severe disease, and there are questions regarding whether everyone diagnosed with gout requires long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT).

### We can make gout management more successful now [^112N9Jrm]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Numerous publications document deficits in the management and clinical outcomes of gout despite a detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy, a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers, incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management, suboptimal patient adherence even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations, comorbidities, and drug interferences that complicate the treatment of gout, patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout, and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### Lunsumio [^1135Aa3k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Infections**: Lunsumio can cause serious or fatal infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Among patients who received Lunsumio at the recommended dose in the clinical trial, serious infections, including opportunistic infections, occurred in 17%, with Grade 3 or 4 infections in 14%, and fatal infections in 0.9% of patients. The most common Grade 3 or greater infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and upper respiratory tract infection.

	- Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection prior to and during treatment with Lunsumio and treat appropriately. Lunsumio should not be administered in the presence of active infection. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of Lunsumio in patients with a history of recurring or chronic infections (e.g. chronic, active Epstein-Barr Virus), with underlying conditions that may predispose to infections, or who have had significant prior immunosuppressive treatment. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to guidelines.

	- Withhold Lunsumio or consider permanent discontinuation of Lunsumio based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: Lunsumio can cause fatal or serious hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). HLH is a potentially life-threatening, hyperinflammatory syndrome that is independent of CRS. Common manifestations include fever, elevated ferritin, hemophagocytosis, cytopenias, coagulopathy, hepatitis, and splenomegaly.

	- Across a broader clinical trial population, HLH occurred in 0.5% (7/1536) of patients. Most cases (5/7) were identified within the fir.

### A re-look at an old disease: A multimodality review on gout [^117Y4Fea]. Clinical Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Gout, the most common form of microcrystalline arthropathy, has always interested radiologists. The diagnosis of gout is primarily based on clinical and laboratory findings; however, it has well-known and characteristic radiographic manifestations. Radiographs remain the examination of choice in the diagnosis of joint involvement. Plain radiographs are less sensitive to early changes in gout than other imaging techniques. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and computed tomography (CT) have demonstrated an increasing role in the early diagnosis of gouty arthritis, in assessing the extent of soft-tissue involvement, and as problem-solving tools for diagnostically difficult cases. Cross-sectional imaging can also be used for guiding needle aspirations in patients with an acute attack of gout, which may simulate an infective process clinically.

This pictorial review illustrates the main imaging features of gout on radiographs, MRI, CT, and ultrasound with the aim of helping the radiologist make a confident diagnosis in radiographically typical cases and to serve as a problem-solving tool in cases that present a diagnostic dilemma.

### New classification criteria for gout: A framework for progress [^114vWb5j]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

The definitive classification or diagnosis of gout normally relies upon the identification of MSU crystals in synovial fluid (SF) or from tophi. Where microscopic examination of SF is not available or is impractical, the best approach may differ depending upon the context. For many types of research, clinical classification criteria are necessary. The increasing prevalence of gout, advances in therapeutics, and the development of international research collaborations to understand the impact, mechanisms, and optimal treatment of this condition emphasize the need for accurate and uniform classification criteria for gout.

Five clinical classification criteria for gout currently exist. However, none of the currently available criteria have been adequately validated. An international project is currently underway to develop new validated gout classification criteria. These criteria will be an essential step forward to advance the research agenda in the modern era of gout management.

### Uloric [^1118SZpC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage**:
	- The recommended ULORIC dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The starting dosage is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) level of less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, an increase to 80 mg once daily is recommended. ULORIC can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Prophylactic treatment**:
	- Prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Dosage recommendations for renal and hepatic impairment**:
	- For patients with severe renal impairment, the recommended dosage of ULORIC is limited to 40 mg once daily. No dose modification is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dosage modification is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Serum uric acid level monitoring**:
	- Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating ULORIC therapy.

- **Recommended prophylaxis for gout flares**:
	- Gout flares may occur after initiation of ULORIC due to changing serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a NSAID or colchicine is recommended upon initiation.

### Presenting symptoms of cancer and stage at diagnosis: Evidence from a cross-sectional, population-based study [^116pCoby]. The Lancet Oncology (2020). High credibility.

The findings from this study characterize associations between common presenting symptoms and stage at diagnosis in a population-based cohort of patients with different cancers. For 13 of the 20 studied symptoms, more than 50% of patients were diagnosed with cancer at stages other than stage IV. Moreover, for 19 symptoms, excluding neck lump, more than a third were diagnosed at a stage other than stage IV.

Common presenting symptoms have variable associations with advanced stage at diagnosis, although for all symptoms analyzed in this cross-sectional study, we found that large proportions of patients are diagnosed at stages other than stage IV. Early diagnosis initiatives, such as public health campaigns aimed at raising awareness of possible symptoms of cancer and clinical guidelines for the assessment and investigation of patients with symptoms, have the potential to help detect cancer at a non-advanced stage.

### New insights into gout epidemiology [^116BE27u]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

The systematic study of gout dates to antiquity, beginning with Hippocrates' initial descriptions of disease risk factors, including advancing age, female menopause, and male sex. Although urate crystal diagnosis remains the gold standard for diagnosis, it is impractical at a population level. Beyond crystal diagnosis, progress in gout epidemiology has been hampered by the lack of a standardized approach in defining case status.

Substantial progress has been made in understanding gout over the last few decades. Epidemiologic investigations suggest that the frequency of gout is on the rise worldwide. Our understanding of gout risk factors continues to expand with the recent availability of well-designed prospective cohort studies from both the United States and abroad. Moreover, recent investigations have provided important insights into the complex relationships of hyperuricemia, gout, and comorbid conditions, particularly the association of serum urate levels with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Despite our growing understanding of many facets of this age-old condition, evidence continues to underscore the frequency with which gout is characterized by suboptimal care. Below, we review our knowledge of gout epidemiology, emphasizing the association of hyperuricemia with cardiovascular comorbidity and evidence of the determinants of continued suboptimal care in gout.

### Empirical assessment of functional somatic disorder (FSD): Frequency, applicability, and diagnostic refinement in a population-based sample [^113X668W]. BMC Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Persistent and troublesome physical symptoms are observed across all healthcare specialties, commonly overlapping between them and receiving inconsistent diagnoses. In a recent online survey across four European countries, healthcare professionals from different medical specialties suggest that mixed terminology and varied diagnostic approaches are common barriers to treatment access for persistent physical symptoms. These symptoms can persist and become troublesome, leading to impairment or disability and can be caused by a range of biopsychosocial factors reflecting brain-body interactions.

Classification systems separate symptom-based diagnoses into somatic or mental sections; for example, somatic symptom disorder (SSD) according to the DSM-5, and bodily distress disorder according to ICD-11, are mental disorder diagnoses used to classify persistent somatic symptoms that are associated with significant psychological distress. Meanwhile, functional somatic syndromes such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are used within biomedical specialties (i.e. rheumatology or gastroenterology) when troublesome symptoms are associated with disability and their pathophysiological or structural basis is unknown.

Diagnostic criteria for these diagnoses greatly overlap, which has led to suggestions that a dimensional classification across medical specialties may be more helpful than those split by specialties. There has been an increasing focus within research to address diagnostic confusion and adopt a symptom-based classification that does not presuppose division by specialty.

### Diagnosis and treatment of gout [^114KMSzy]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is an ancient disease that has caused pain and suffering over many centuries. The tragedy is that today we have excellent medication for the prevention of chronic gout, yet many people continue to be plagued by gout attacks and develop chronic arthritis. The incidence of gout is increasing worldwide, which is related to aging and lifestyle changes. Gout is more prevalent in individuals with metabolic syndrome, obesity, the use of diuretics, and the intake of beer and sugared drinks.

This video and associated PowerPoint presentations aim to assist anyone managing patients with gout in understanding how to elicit a good history, examine patients, and generate a differential diagnosis; the focus is on understanding the causes of gout and taking a proactive role (see online supplementary video and file). The good news is that gout can improve with lifestyle changes, and medication is relatively inexpensive.

### Diagnosis of acute gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111NWXYW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases, from database inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes (results of laboratory and radiographic tests, such as serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision-making (additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management); short-term clinical (patient-centered) outcomes, such as pain and joint swelling and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

- **Recommendation**: ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Are the classical symptoms of hypertension in children still sensitive enough [^114N7Lje]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The available literature is scarce on the initial symptoms of arterial hypertension in children. Our study aimed to analyze the initial clinical profile of patients referred to the hospital with suspected hypertension and those diagnosed with hypertension for the first time during a hospitalization for other reasons. This study was a retrospective analysis of medical records in 471 patients. More than half of the patients showed no symptoms. The most common symptom reported was a headache — 28% (132) of patients. The diagnosis of elevated blood pressure or hypertension was more frequent in asymptomatic patients (P = 0.001). Headaches were seen more often in healthy patients than in patients with hypertension. Newly diagnosed hypertension is mainly identified in asymptomatic children. Moreover, the symptoms previously described in the literature as the most common did not prove to be predictive of hypertension in our study.

### Gout: an update [^117YHQA5]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout, also known as gouty arthritis, accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and its prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues, leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biological precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels, known as hyperuricemia. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout.

Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling in one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine serves as a second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors such as high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, and diuretic therapy should be addressed.

- **Urate-lowering therapy**: This is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies for patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L).

- **Prophylactic therapy**: Low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^116TDyzM]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

As with most diseases, there is a gradient of probability of truly having the disease based on signs and symptoms. The threshold chosen for this classification criteria set yielded the best combination of sensitivity and specificity. While for certain purposes a higher sensitivity (lower score) may be preferable, such as in a general population survey to determine the public health burden of gout for resource planning, a higher specificity (higher score) may be desirable for others, like genetic association studies in which accurate phenotyping is critical. Furthermore, classification criteria are not intended to characterize the severity of the disease, but only its presence. Additionally, classification criteria should be applied only to the intended population — those who meet the entry criteria. Performance characteristics of any classification criteria set will necessarily be altered if the criteria are applied to those other than the intended population.

A limitation of our effort is that there is still a relative paucity of data and of clinical experience to fully test advanced imaging data empirically. As more studies are published, there may be additional imaging signs and/or modalities found to have sufficient specificity for gout that could be incorporated into future criteria. We also realized that some investigators may not have access to imaging and therefore aimed to develop criteria that would still perform well in the absence of imaging data. In the discrete-choice experiments, the lack of imaging data was weighted the same as for studies performed with negative results.

### Prevalence and distribution of musculoskeletal symptoms in cystic fibrosis and impacts on daily life [^114rrubT]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

The following diagnoses were recorded in participant case notes: CF‐associated arthritis in 48 patients (10%); gout in 33 patients (7%); tendinitis in 9 patients (2%); osteoarthritis in 3 patients (0.6%); and rheumatoid arthritis in 1 patient (0.2%). Additionally, 29 patients (6%) had other diagnoses recorded for their joint symptoms. No patients were diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis. A total of 277 patients (56%) reported seeking help from at least one source, most commonly from a physiotherapist (124 patients, 26%), while 85 patients (17%) reported seeking help from a CF physician. Within the last year, 49% of participants experienced impacts on activities of daily living due to joint or back pain.

A total of 133 participants offered comments in the free‐form space. A proportion of comments related symptoms to specific injuries or events, while others highlighted the difficulties experienced when their joints were in poor condition. The data collected was analyzed thematically following guidelines created by Braun and Clarke. The themes identified were: inflammatory symptoms, non-inflammatory symptoms, impact of symptoms, help-seeking, and associations with chest disease. Some comments regarding the impact of symptoms are illustrated in Figure 3.

### Gout: Will the "king of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured [^115Ldos4]? BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults in the Western world. Characterized by hyperuricemia and the effects of acute and chronic inflammation in joints and bursa, gout leads to agonizing, chronically painful arthritis. Arthritis can also be accompanied by urate nephropathy and subcutaneous urate deposits (tophi).

Exciting new developments in the last decade have refocused attention on this interesting, crystal-induced chronic inflammatory condition. New insights include:

- **NALP3 inflammasome-induced inflammation**: Understanding of its role in acute gout.
- **Diagnostic advancements**: Characterization of signs on ultrasound and dual-energy computed tomography imaging modalities.
- **Treatment targets**: Recognition of target serum urate levels less than 6 mg/dL as the goal for urate-lowering therapies.
- **Guideline developments**: Establishment of evidence-based treatment guidelines.

A better understanding of disease mechanisms has enabled drug discovery. Three new urate-lowering drugs have been approved in the last decade, with several more in development. We now recognize the important role that environment and genetics play in the causation of gout. A focus on the cardiac, renal, and metabolic comorbidities of gout will help translational research and discovery over the next decade.

### Pegasys [^115Ufjd7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Infections**: While fever may be associated with the flu-like syndrome commonly reported during interferon therapy, other causes of high or persistent fever must be ruled out, particularly in patients with neutropenia. Serious and severe infections (bacterial, viral, or fungal), some fatal, have been reported during treatment with alpha interferons, including Pegasys. Appropriate anti-infective therapy should be started immediately and discontinuation of therapy should be considered [see Boxed Warning].

- **Colitis**: Ulcerative and hemorrhagic/ischemic colitis, sometimes fatal, have been observed within 12 weeks of starting alpha interferon treatment. Abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and fever are the typical manifestations of colitis. Pegasys should be discontinued immediately if these symptoms develop. The colitis usually resolves within 1 to 3 weeks of discontinuation of alpha interferon.

- **Pancreatitis**: Pancreatitis, sometimes fatal, has occurred during alpha interferon and ribavirin treatment. Pegasys/ribavirin should be suspended if symptoms or signs suggestive of pancreatitis are observed. Pegasys/ribavirin should be discontinued in patients diagnosed with pancreatitis.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Severe acute hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. urticaria, angioedema, bronchoconstriction, and anaphylaxis) have been observed during alpha interferon and ribavirin therapy. If such a reaction occurs, therapy with Pegasys/ribavirin should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy immediately instituted.

### Gout [^114goZD1]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which form when urate concentrations are elevated. While environmental factors contribute to hyperuricaemia, the excretion of urate through the kidneys and gut plays a central role in regulating serum urate levels, with genetic factors also being significant. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the release of interleukin 1β are crucial in triggering acute gout flares.

A "treat to target serum urate" approach is essential for effective management of gout; long-term reduction of serum urate to below 360 μmol/L leads to crystal dissolution and eventually suppresses flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy is often effective in achieving treatment goals, and several new urate-lowering drugs have become available. Globally, the rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy are very low, resulting in infrequent achievement of serum urate targets. Strategies to improve the quality of gout care are necessary.

### Somatic symptoms and associations with common psychological diagnoses: A retrospective cohort study from Norwegian urban general practice [^117H7Xz6]. Family Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with mental health problems often present with somatic symptoms when visiting their general practitioner (GP). Somatic presentations may challenge the correct diagnosing of mental health disorders in general practice, where most of these disorders are treated.

- **Objective**: Explore the associations between common psychological diagnoses and somatic symptom diagnoses in Norwegian urban general practice.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study including electronic medical data from 15,750 patients aged 16–65 years from 35 GPs in six GP offices in Oslo, Norway, during 12 months in 2014–2015. We explored prevalences and associations between anxiety, depression, and stress-related diagnoses, and somatic symptom diagnoses.

- **Results**: Patients with anxiety, depression, and stress-related diagnoses had a mean number of 2.9 ± 3.6 somatic symptom diagnoses during the 12 months, compared to 1.9 ± 2.5 for patients without any psychological diagnoses (P < 0.001). The mean number of somatic symptoms was significantly higher for the different psychological diagnoses viewed separately, for both sexes and different age groups. There was an increase in probability for anxiety, depression, or stress-related diagnoses with an increasing number of somatic symptom diagnoses during the 12 months. We found a significant increase in somatic symptom diagnoses from ICPC-2 chapters: General and unspecified, digestive, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, urological, female genital disorders, and social problems. Associated symptom patterns were different for each of the included psychological diagnoses.

### Outcome measures for acute and chronic gout [^113hVmsY]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Gout presents unique challenges in its classification and the measurement of outcomes. Our aim was to evaluate criteria for classification and to develop and validate optimal instruments for measuring outcomes in both acute and chronic gout. A planning committee and interested attendees convened to propose classification criteria and domains for outcomes.

Seven of the American Rheumatism Association's preliminary criteria were suggested as the best criteria for classifying acute gouty arthritis, pending further studies. The presence of gout is best confirmed by crystal identification, though this technique has its limitations. We identified five domains for acute gout outcomes and nine for chronic gout, along with proposed instruments for testing and validation. The unique issues associated with evaluating gout can and will be addressed.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^1119KM5h]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Gout, characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) in synovial fluid and other tissues, is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, with a prevalence of 3.9% in the US, 0.9% in France, 1.4%–2.5% in the UK, 1.4% in Germany, and 3.2% (European ancestry)–6.1% (Maori ancestry) in New Zealand. Over the last decade, several new therapies for gout have been approved by regulatory agencies or are being tested. The conduct of trials that lead to drug approval, and of observational studies that provide insights into risk factors, genetic associations, and general epidemiology of gout, is critically dependent on appropriate identification of individuals with gout for inclusion in such studies. Classification criteria serve the purpose of enabling standardized assembly of a relatively homogeneous group of individuals with the disease of interest for enrollment into such studies.

There are several existing sets of classification criteria or diagnostic rules for gout, with the most widely used being the 1977 American Rheumatism Association (now the American College of Rheumatology [ACR]) preliminary criteria for the classification of the acute arthritis of primary gout. These preliminary criteria were intended for identifying the acute arthritis of gout and not necessarily for intercritical gout. The spectrum of comparator diseases was limited, and physician diagnosis was the gold standard. In a recent study in which the gold standard was MSU crystal status in synovial fluid or nodule aspiration, the criteria were assessed.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gout, specifically in the context of diagnosis, EULAR 2020 guidelines recommend establishing a clinical diagnosis of gout if synovial fluid analysis is not feasible. This can be done by identifying the following highly suggestive (though not specific) features:

- **Male gender**: The prevalence of gout is higher among males.
- **Monoarticular involvement of a foot**: Especially the first metatarsophalangeal or ankle joint.
- **Previous similar acute arthritis episodes**: Recurrent episodes can be indicative.
- **Rapid onset of severe pain and swelling**: Symptoms reach their worst within less than 24 hours.
- **Erythema**: Redness is a common sign.
- **Hyperuricemia**: Elevated levels of uric acid in the blood.
- **Associated cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)**: Gout may be linked with the presence of CVDs.

### Ilaris [^117JQpF7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of ILARIS was demonstrated in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies in patients with gout flares for whom NSAIDs and/or colchicine were contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective and who had experienced at least three gout flares in the previous year (Studies 1 and 2). The studies continued in:

1. **Two 12-week, double-blind, active-controlled extensions**: Followed by open-label extensions, continuing in a third open-label extension (combined for both studies) for up to a maximum of 36 months where all patients were treated with ILARIS upon a new flare.

In Study 1 (NCT01029652), patients were randomized to receive ILARIS 150 mg subcutaneous (N = 115) or triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg intramuscular (N = 115) at baseline and were thereafter treated upon a new flare. Two patients randomized to canakinumab were not included in the analysis as they did not receive any study medication. In Study 2 (NCT01080131), patients were randomized to receive ILARIS 150 mg subcutaneous (N = 112) or triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg intramuscular (N = 114) at baseline and were thereafter treated upon a new flare.

### Gout [^116sHinV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Gout is associated with a variety of conditions and symptoms, including podagra, arthritis, subcutaneous nodules, and joint line tenderness. Patients often exhibit joint swelling, increased serum uric acid levels, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Additional symptoms may include knee pain, polyarticular synovitis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of urine uric acid crystals, obesity, joint pain, ankle pain, and tophus on the pinna are also common markers. Gout can be influenced by genetic predispositions and is often accompanied by warm joints and increased alcohol consumption. Diagnosis may be confirmed by observing increased urine uric acid and synovial fluid monosodium urate crystals.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^115xVoQq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

- **Recent findings**: Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade, including those from the British Rheumatism Society, the European League Against Rheumatism, the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative, the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism, and the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers, with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. Despite the existing guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations and uptake have been slow. The initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate are infrequent. Greater education in proper management and increased awareness of new treatment strategies appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management as well as areas for further research.

- **Summary**: Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers struggle with the appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### A cross-sectional questionnaire survey involving physicians for the clarification of the diagnosis and current status of therapeutic intervention of psoriatic arthritis in Japan [^115YU7MF]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

In the previous survey, half of the respondents stated that they noticed joint symptoms and diagnosed PsA while treating patients for skin psoriasis. Furthermore, 70% of those physicians said that patients had these symptoms before diagnosis, indicating that there are cases where PsA symptoms were overlooked by physicians. In the present survey, the most common reasons for performing PsA screening were "when patients have symptom complaints" and "when physicians discover symptoms". Physicians may overlook the possibility that the patient has PsA because patients with psoriasis vulgaris are unaware of PsA and might not report any complaints. Many patients with PsA who visit an orthopedic practitioner do so voluntarily rather than through a referral from another hospital. Patients may be complaining about their pain to orthopedists without being aware of the link between psoriasis and joint symptoms. Patients with psoriasis, especially those with severe skin psoriasis or nail psoriasis, should be informed of PsA and instructed to contact their attending physician if they experience pain.

Several screening questionnaires are being developed as an examination support tool for GP dermatologists, and they can be simple and useful tools for PsA diagnosis. Regardless of their importance, screening questionnaires are not widely known. The most prominent PASE questionnaire is only known by 47.2%, 59.6%, 62.5%, and 54.0% of GP dermatologists, HP dermatologists, rheumatologists, and orthopedists, respectively. Moreover, such questionnaires for screening patients were used by only 11.0%.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^1174ieho]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Renal and cardiovascular comorbidities are frequent in patients with gout and play an important role in the premature mortality observed in the disease. Patients with gout should therefore be systematically screened for renovascular diseases and risk factors, which should be addressed as an important part of gout management. Comorbidities, especially renal disease, and drugs prescribed for their management should be considered during the choice of drugs to be used in the treatment of gouty inflammation and for urate lowering.

Finally, whereas an impressive number of epidemiological data have shown the association of renal and cardiovascular diseases with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, causality remains uncertain, and large RCTs are still needed to assess the cardiovascular and renal benefits of asymptomatic hyperuricaemia treatment.

### Buphenyl [^112kUyht]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Medications affecting drug breakdown**: Probenecid, a medication used to treat gout, may affect the way the kidneys excrete Buphenyl. Consult the doctor for details.

- **Common side effects**: The most common side effect reported in premenopausal women taking Buphenyl was absent or irregular menstrual periods. Decreased appetite was reported in 4% of all people treated. Body odor and bad taste were each reported in 3% of all patients treated. A breakdown product of Buphenyl has been associated mainly with sleepiness and light-headedness. Because these symptoms may also be due to the urea cycle going out of control, a doctor should be consulted immediately if these symptoms occur, so the cause can be determined. Blood tests should be performed periodically for adverse effects and for levels of the medication and its breakdown products.

- **Storage instructions**: Buphenyl should be stored in a tightly closed bottle at room temperature.

This leaflet provides a brief summary of the information available on Buphenyl. The information here is incomplete and is not designed to take the place of your doctor's instructions. For more complete information, consult your physician, or contact Horizon at 1–866–479–6742.

### 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for management of gout. Part 1: Systematic nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapeutic approaches to hyperuricemia [^1149vEW6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gout, specifically concerning indications for specialist referral, the ACR 2012 guidelines recommend referring patients for specialist consultation in the following situations:

- **Unclear etiology of hyperuricemia**: When the cause of hyperuricemia is not clear, a specialist's insight is necessary.

- **Refractory signs or symptoms of gout**: If the symptoms of gout persist despite treatment, specialist referral is advised.

- **Difficulty in reaching the target serum urate level**: Particularly in cases of renal impairment and following a trial of xanthine oxidase inhibitor treatment, specialist intervention may be required.

- **Multiple and/or serious adverse events from pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy**: If adverse events occur, consulting a specialist is recommended.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for gout, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, EULAR 2020 guidelines recommend considering ultrasound to establish a diagnosis in patients with suspected gout flare or chronic gouty arthritis. This can be achieved through the detection of tophi not evident on clinical examination, or a double contour sign at cartilage surfaces — a highly specific sign for urate deposits in joints.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^113bRmD5]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to "cure" the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practices, and barriers to effective care, as well as how these barriers might be overcome.

To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and to ensure adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Krystexxa [^111h3dbL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Anaphylaxis and infusion reactions**: Anaphylaxis and infusion reactions can occur at any infusion while on therapy. Counsel patients on the importance of adhering to any prescribed medications to help prevent or lessen the severity of these reactions. Educate patients on the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, including wheezing, peri-oral or lingual edema, hemodynamic instability, and rash or urticaria, nausea, or vomiting. Also, educate patients on the most common signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction, including urticaria (skin rash), erythema (redness of the skin), dyspnea (difficulty breathing), flushing, chest discomfort, chest pain, and rash. Advise patients to seek medical care immediately if they experience any symptoms of an allergic reaction during or at any time after the infusion of Krystexxa [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Advise patients to discontinue any oral urate-lowering agents before starting on Krystexxa and not to take any oral urate-lowering agents while on Krystexxa.

- **Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency**: Inform patients not to take Krystexxa if they have a condition known as G6PD deficiency. Explain to patients that G6PD deficiency is more frequently found in individuals of African, Mediterranean, or Southern Asian ancestry and that they may be tested to determine if they have G6PD deficiency, unless already known [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Contraindications (4)].

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: An update on prevalence and treatment options [^115Tmj1f]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Gout is a prevalent disorder whose frequency is increasing worldwide. In addition to causing excruciating arthritic pain, gout is associated with premature death, classically explained by a high frequency of comorbidities, especially renal and cardiovascular diseases. Comorbidities must be considered in gout because they could contribute to the vital prognosis of gouty patients and they complicate gout management. These comorbidities are also frequently associated with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, an even more prevalent condition than gout, with their causal relationship with hyperuricaemia raising important therapeutic issues.

### Unusual clinical presentations of gout [^117L13yS]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The dogmatic description of gout is defined as an inflammatory crystal-induced arthropathy that affects peripheral joints. This manuscript describes many recent cases and unusual clinical presentations of gout, emphasizing its potential to cause diagnostic dilemmas that can impact patient treatment and care.

- **Recent findings**: Various genetic mutations can predispose patients to developing early onset gout. Environmental exposures, medications, and certain patient populations can affect the pathophysiology of uric acid, predisposing patients to both typical and atypical manifestations of gout. Numerous reports have described gout deposition in unusual parts of the body, which can mimic unrelated disease processes.

Although classic gout is still most commonly seen, the disease can manifest with a wide array of presentations. It is likely that such atypical presentations result from a complexity of reasons. When faced with a diagnostic challenge in a patient with gout, clinicians should be aware of unusual manifestations of gout and consider it in the differential.

### How do patients with interstitial cystitis present [^1162cZK1]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

We determined how interstitial cystitis progresses from initial symptoms to diagnosis. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 45 patients to determine the dates of symptom onset and diagnosis, and the sequence of urgency/frequency, nocturia, and pain. We also documented alternate and previous diagnoses, as well as previous surgical treatments.

Of the patients, 89% presented with only one symptom. The median time from the initial symptom to all symptoms was 2 years (mean 5.5). The most common previous diagnoses were urinary infection in 19 cases, a gynecologic diagnosis in 14, and urethral diagnoses in 6. A previous urinary infection was documented in only 1 of the 19 patients, while 11 had undergone hysterectomy and 5 diagnosed with endometriosis had no pathological documentation available.

Early interstitial cystitis presents variably and usually with only a single symptom of urgency/frequency, nocturia, or pain. Clinicians may fail to appreciate the symptoms of early interstitial cystitis, which leads to delayed diagnosis until the patient is more symptomatic. Over time, multiple symptoms manifest. Bacterial cystitis, prostatitis, endometriosis, and chronic pelvic pain are common initial misdiagnoses. Interstitial cystitis should be considered when laboratory documentation of alternate diagnoses is lacking or when patients fail to respond to therapy for alternate diagnoses.

### 2015 gout classification criteria: An American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative [^114m1nrX]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The expert panel (n = 20) comprised 19 physicians with a clinical and/or research interest in gout (17 clinical rheumatologists and 2 primary care physicians) and an epidemiologist/biostatistician. Among these, 9 members were from the US, 8 from Europe, 2 from New Zealand, and 1 from Mexico. A total of 133 paper cases were submitted by the expert panel and 79 clinical rheumatologists and general internists.

Based on a review of the Phase 1 data and the ranking exercise with 30 cases representing a low to high probability of gout, the initial key factors identified as important for classifying gout were the presence of MSU crystals, pattern of joint involvement, intensity of symptomatic episodes, time to maximal pain and to resolution, episodic nature of symptoms, presence of clinical tophus, level of serum urate, imaging features, response to treatment, family history, and risk factors or associated comorbidities. The last three factors were not considered further as they are not features of gout itself despite their association with it. Including risk factors or comorbidities in the definition of gout would preclude future studies evaluating their association with the condition.

The entry criteria were intended to identify the relevant patient population to whom the classification criteria would be applied. Sufficient criteria were meant to define…

### Short-term risk of cardiovascular events in people newly diagnosed with gout [^113Wqygy]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

We must acknowledge some limitations. The first is the uncertainty regarding the onset of gout symptoms. We used the date of the contact with the health care system on which a gout diagnosis was made as the exposure date. We believe that it is a reasonable proxy, especially in the context of gout flares in which symptoms usually peak within 12 to 24 hours of onset. We could not be sure about the fact that the first gout diagnosis is the consultation for the first-ever gout flare experienced by the patient. However, gout flare has typical characteristics, and it is likely that most patients in this study were consulting for gout flare for the first time.

Although we performed sensitivity, stratified, and negative control analyses, another limitation is that the risk of residual unmeasured time-varying confounding could not be completely ruled out. However, results of the analyses stratified on the major cardiovascular risk factors for gout flares (i.e. chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, heart failure, and prescription of diuretics) were consistent with the main analysis.

Third, we did not conduct an adjudication of cardiovascular outcomes. However, these outcomes have been widely adopted in previous research. Fourth, these results might apply only to gout flares that are of sufficient severity to require contact with the health care system. Fifth, the available sample size limited our ability to draw any definite conclusions on the comparative impact of different anti-inflammatory medications prescribed to treat gout flares.
