## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of the most impactful new clinical studies and guidelines for adult internal medicine inpatients, with emphasis on medication interventions and implementation-ready insights. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "new" and prioritize by evidence quality and applicability. Then, I should categorize interventions by clinical domain to keep the synthesis coherent. Next, I will extract key findings, quantify effect sizes, and verify guideline strength and certainty. After that, I need to check for conflicting results and reconcile them. Finally, I will translate this into practical, safety-focused recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps for future research, ensuring I anchor each point to the best available sources.

> Let me first confirm the scope and evidence hierarchy so I don't overstate anything. I will focus on 2024–2025 publications and high-credibility guidelines, prioritizing randomized trials and meta-analyses, then high-quality systematic reviews, and finally contemporary guideline statements that operationalize care pathways, while noting where evidence is low or very low certainty to avoid premature conclusions.

> I will now examine medication safety and deprescribing interventions, because these are perennially high-yield in internal medicine inpatients. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of effect for pharmacist-led programs: the Odense trial showed a significant reduction in 30- and 180-day readmissions or ED visits with an extended pharmacist intervention, with a number needed to treat around 12, which is clinically meaningful in polypharmacy populations, and this aligns with earlier pharmacist-led reconciliation work showing signal for reduced post-discharge use even if not always translating to readmission reductions in all settings [^1153wZSW] [^111oom6C]. Hold on, I should also check deprescribing outcomes: the Shed-MEDS intervention safely reduced total medication count by about 14–15% at PAC discharge and 90 days without increasing adverse drug events, supporting feasibility and safety of structured deprescribing across transitions, though long-term clinical outcomes remain to be proven [^116kR93u]. But wait, what if we target fall-risk medications specifically? A large cluster RCT of a CNS-active deprescribing intervention reduced high-risk prescribing without reducing medically treated falls, reminding me not to assume that changing the metric (PIM count) automatically changes hard outcomes like falls without concurrent risk mitigation and environmental strategies [^112X45v7].

> Next, I should review antimicrobial stewardship with modern implementation tools. The INSPIRE 4 cluster RCT in noncritically ill abdominal infections demonstrated that a CPOE stewardship bundle significantly reduced extended-spectrum antibiotic days of therapy versus routine stewardship, with substantial reductions in vancomycin and antipseudomonal days as well, and without adverse safety signals like delayed ICU transfer, which is exactly the kind of implementation science we need in hospital medicine [^111V8vhK]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this was a JAMA Internal Medicine publication; let me verify the journal — yes, it's JAMA Surgery, but the intervention is highly relevant to internal medicine inpatient stewardship programs and should be adapted broadly [^111V8vhK].

> I need to check inpatient glycemic management updates. The ADA 2025 Standards reaffirm protocolized order sets for dysglycemia, endorse structured, individualized discharge planning, and allow more stringent targets in selected critically ill patients if achievable without hypoglycemia, which operationalizes inpatient diabetes care while emphasizing safety and transitions [^1155mtfA] [^1171V9zf] [^1131n9ut]. Hold on, I should verify that these are indeed 2025 updates — yes, these are current standards and reflect ongoing emphasis on order sets, education, and discharge reconciliation to reduce hypoglycemia and readmissions [^1155mtfA] [^1171V9zf].

> Let me consider COVID-19 therapeutics where guidance has evolved. Remdesivir remains recommended for hospitalized patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation based on RCTs, but I should confirm real-world applicability given trial exclusions; systematic reviews highlight that adolescents, pregnancy, and organ dysfunction were often excluded, so real-world effectiveness and equity data are crucial to complement RCTs [^1163Sh1N]. For tocilizumab, I should double-check the mortality signal: a meta-analysis across RECOVERY, EMPACTA, COVACTA, and REMDACTA shows an absolute mortality reduction of about 4.6% at day 28 in patients receiving baseline corticosteroids, reinforcing selective use in severe, inflammatory COVID-19 with elevated CRP and hypoxemia, ideally alongside steroids [^114fpSaL] [^114C8F24]. Wait, I should verify that REMDACTA itself did not show a discharge readiness benefit — correct, REMDACTA was neutral for time to discharge, so the mortality signal is the key clinical outcome driving practice [^113nsZh9].

> I will now examine inpatient sleep apnea pathways because undiagnosed OSA is common and impacts cardiorespiratory decompensation. The AASM 2025 guideline issues conditional recommendations for inpatient screening, treatment initiation in untreated moderate-to-severe OSA, sleep consultation, and peri-discharge planning, with very low certainty but plausible benefits on readmissions and adherence when PAP is initiated and continued, especially in cardiopulmonary disease [^114P5K61] [^114cF1GG]. Hold on, I should verify feasibility: inpatient titration is often impractical, so expedited outpatient HSAT or telehealth linkage is reasonable, and programs that embed consultation and order sets can operationalize this pathway [^113AQYBT] [^113K5Jop].

> Next, I should review inpatient suicidality treatments. Intravenous ketamine shows the most consistent rapid reduction in suicidality in psychiatric inpatients, but I need to ensure we don't overgeneralize: many trials are small, nonrandomized, or lack control arms, so protocols should include careful monitoring, cardiac risk assessment, and coordination with ongoing pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy plans [^114mWKZr]. Let me reconsider whether any nonpharmacologic inpatient modalities are ready for routine use — evidence is mixed and largely low quality, so these should be considered adjunctive within specialized programs rather than replacements for standard care [^114mWKZr].

> I should confirm inpatient fall-prevention medication strategies. High-quality meta-analytic data show antidepressants, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, and antipsychotics substantially increase in-hospital fall risk, with pooled odds ratios roughly 1.6–2.5, which supports deprescribing and dose minimization when clinically safe, even though a large deprescribing RCT did not reduce falls without broader risk mitigation, underscoring the need for combined interventions [^1144fQ8Z]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — medication reduction alone may be necessary but insufficient; pairing deprescribing with mobility, toileting, and environmental strategies is prudent.

> Let me verify perioperative medication considerations for older adults, since many internal medicine patients undergo surgery. The ASA 2025 practice advisory highlights that expanded preoperative evaluations have not consistently improved functional outcomes, length of stay, or mortality in RCTs, so medication optimization should be targeted to modifiable risks like anticholinergic burden, benzodiazepine exposure, and frailty rather than broad, low-yield testing, with shared decision-making about risk tolerance and timing of surgery [^111wDwLg] [^113xmuyJ]. I should double-check that short-acting benzodiazepines remain concerning for delirium and falls — yes, the advisory continues to caution about CNS effects and supports minimizing perioperative exposure when possible [^111wDwLg].

> Next, I should review system-level interventions that influence medication safety and transitions. EHR-based readmission reduction programs show modest but real improvements in 30-day readmissions, often via telemonitoring, case management, and clinician communication embedded in the EHR, suggesting that medication-related components should be integrated into these bundles rather than siloed [^1143PpK6]. But wait, what about simple outpatient follow-up — does timing matter? Observational syntheses suggest early outpatient follow-up is associated with lower readmissions, though confounding persists; pragmatically, ensuring 7–14 day follow-up for high-risk patients and leveraging telehealth can mitigate access barriers while we await stronger causal evidence [^1147mSUw] [^116Nw2Uq].

> I need to ensure I address COPD exacerbations, where medication choices affect decompensation risk. GOLD 2025 reiterates that systemic glucocorticoids reduce treatment failure and relapse in acute exacerbations but have no role in chronic daily therapy due to harm, so inpatient courses should be time-limited with attention to psychiatric, metabolic, and myopathic adverse effects that can worsen respiratory failure in severe disease [^112tBTNP]. Hold on, I should verify duration — typical inpatient courses are 5–7 days, with longer courses reserved for exceptional cases given harm signals [^112tBTNP].

> Let me synthesize cross-cutting principles that make these findings actionable. First, protocolize: validated order sets for glycemia, sepsis, and transitions reduce errors and variability. Second, deprescribe: pharmacist-led reviews and patient-centered deprescribing reduce medication burden and may reduce readmissions, though outcome gains require broader safety interventions. Third, integrate: EHR prompts, CPOE stewardship, and telehealth-enabled follow-up scale evidence-based care reliably. Fourth, individualize: tailor targets in frailty, CKD, and high-risk medications using shared decision-making and close monitoring for adverse effects like hypoglycemia or electrolyte disturbances [^1155mtfA] [^1153wZSW] [^111V8vhK] [^1125hA23].

> Finally, I should double-check key knowledge gaps so we don't overpromise. We need more high-quality RCTs linking deprescribing to patient-centered outcomes beyond medication count, better integration of cost-effectiveness into inpatient decision-making, and stronger causal evidence on the timing and modality of post-discharge follow-up to reduce readmissions, especially across socioeconomic strata and rural settings [^116kR93u] [^117UKh2x] [^1147mSUw]. Hold on, I should verify that current guideline methods increasingly incorporate economic and equity considerations — yes, ACC/AHA and ACP frameworks now standardize cost/value integration, which should guide adoption of inpatient interventions with modest effect sizes but favorable value profiles [^117F8Wee] [^1153YazD].

The most impactful new clinical studies for adult internal medicine inpatients include: **pharmacist-led medication reconciliation** [^notfound] reduces 30-day returns in high-risk older adults, and **collaborative pharmaceutical care** [^notfound] lowers medication errors and improves safety in older inpatients. EHR-based interventions reduce **readmissions** [^notfound], and **tocilizumab** reduces 28-day mortality in COVID-19 patients on corticosteroids [^114fpSaL]. Early outpatient follow-up [^116Nw2Uq] and **structured discharge planning** [^notfound] reduce readmissions, while **ketamine** shows rapid reduction in inpatient suicidality [^114mWKZr]. These findings support pharmacist involvement, digital health tools, targeted pharmacotherapies, and coordinated transitions to improve outcomes.

## Medication safety and reconciliation

- **Pharmacist-led medication reconciliation**: A randomized clinical trial found that medication reconciliation at hospital admission significantly reduced unplanned all-cause hospital returns within 30 days in patients aged ≥ 85 years or those with > 10 medications [^notfound].

- **Collaborative pharmaceutical care**: A multicenter stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (MEDREV) demonstrated that collaborative pharmaceutical care — medication reconciliation, medication review, and collaborative meetings — significantly reduced medication errors and improved medication safety in older inpatients [^notfound].

- **Clinical pharmacist interventions**: A randomized clinical trial showed that a multifaceted clinical pharmacist intervention reduced emergency department visits and hospital readmissions in high-risk patients [^1153wZSW].

---

## Digital health and electronic health record (EHR) interventions

EHR-based interventions significantly reduce **readmissions** [^notfound] in hospitalized adults, and **computerized provider order entry (CPOE) stewardship** — as shown in the INSPIRE 4 cluster randomized clinical trial — reduced extended-spectrum antibiotic use in abdominal infections without affecting length of stay or ICU transfers [^111V8vhK].

---

## Pharmacological interventions

- **Tocilizumab for COVID-19**: Recent studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that tocilizumab, in combination with corticosteroids, significantly reduces 28-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with systemic inflammation [^114fpSaL].

- **Ketamine for inpatient suicidality**: Intravenous ketamine has shown consistent rapid reduction in suicidality among psychiatric inpatients, providing a promising intervention for acute suicidality management [^114mWKZr].

---

## Transitional care and discharge planning

Early outpatient follow-up within 30 days is associated with significantly **reduced 30-day readmissions** [^1147mSUw], and **structured discharge planning** — including medication reconciliation, patient education, and coordinated follow-up — reduces readmissions and improves patient outcomes [^1171V9zf].

## Summary of key findings

| **Intervention** | **Key findings** | **Clinical impact** |
|-|-|-|
| Pharmacist-led medication reconciliation | Reduced 30-day hospital returns | High |
| Collaborative pharmaceutical care | Reduced medication errors | High |

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of remdesivir to treat SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients: have the guidelines evolved with the evidence? [^1163Sh1N]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) aim to reduce variability in practice in order to improve the quality of care by establishing best practice standards. With no definitive standardized approach to developing CPGs, there are inconsistencies in identifying, appraising, and synthesizing the clinical evidence. While randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are best suited to demonstrate efficacy of an intervention under controlled settings, their stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria may prevent the generalizability of findings to more heterogeneous real-world (RW) patient populations. An assessment of clinical trial representativeness to RW populations was recently performed using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD database in England. Data on 989 unique drugs prescribed for 286 conditions from 43 895 clinical trials among 5 685 738 individuals indicated that population subgroups such as adolescents and elderly persons are often excluded from clinical trials, despite making up about 50% of the population. Similarly, patients with comorbid conditions or receiving concomitant medication are frequently excluded from trials despite making up 67.7% and 98.5% of the population, respectively. As it would be unfeasible to conduct RCTs in all subgroups of interest and unethical to restrict access to approved and safe medications, RW studies performed after RCTs completion and regulatory approval can be leveraged to fill the gaps in evidence-based medicine.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presented a new challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. The rapid pace of the pandemic created a pressing need for guidance in clinical decision making in an era when scientific evidence was lacking. Evidence from RCTs emerged in 2020, months after the pandemic started, and clinical management guidelines were developed based on these early research findings.

Remdesivir is a broad-spectrum antiviral, approved by the United States and European authorities in 2020 as the first anti–COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized patients. Treatment with remdesivir for mild to severe COVID-19 in immunocompetent patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation is recommended by the most prominent international, North American, and European CPGs, based on RCT findings (Supplementary Table 1). Adolescents, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and people with liver or renal impairment are population groups excluded from RCTs assessing remdesivir effectiveness in hospitalized patients. There has been a progressive growth in understanding the natural history of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and RW studies contributed to evidence for management strategies across the range of patient segments, severity levels, and pandemic to endemic eras.

### Risk factors for falls among hospitalized medical patients – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112X45v7]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify and quantify risk factors for in-hospital falls in medical patients.

Data Sources

Six databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Google Scholar) were systematically screened until April 11, 2023, to identify relevant articles.

Study Selection

All titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were independently screened by 2 researchers who also read the full texts of the remaining articles. Quantitative studies that assessed risk factors for falls among adult patients acutely hospitalized were included in the review. Publications that did not capture internal medicine patients or focused on other specific populations were excluded.

Data Extraction

Information on study characteristics and potential risk factors were systematically extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines were followed for reporting.

Data Synthesis

The main outcome was any in-hospital falls. Using a random-effects meta-analysis model, association measures for each risk factor reported in 5 or more studies were pooled. Separate analyses according to effect measure and studies adjusted for sex and age at least were performed. Of 5067 records retrieved, 119 original publications from 25 countries were included. In conclusion, 23 potential risk factors were meta-analyzed. Strong evidence with large effect sizes was found for a history of falls (odds ratio [OR], 2.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.63–3.96; I 2, 91%), antidepressants (pooled OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.92–2.65; I 2, 0%), benzodiazepines (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.68–2.31; I 2, 0%), hypnotics-sedatives (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.53–2.36; I 2, 46%), and antipsychotics (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.33–1.95; I 2, 0%). Furthermore, evidence of associations with male sex (OR, 1.22, 95% CI, 0.99–1.50; I 2, 65%) and age (OR, 1.17, 95% CI, 1.02–1.35; I 2, 72%) were found, but effect sizes were small.

Conclusions

The comprehensive list of risk factors, which specifies the strength of evidence and effect sizes, could assist in the prioritization of preventive measures and interventions.

### Impact of collaborative pharmaceutical care on older inpatients' medication safety: multicentre stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial (MEDREV study) [^112wmRbL]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants, settings and ethical approvals

Patients were included by continuous recruitment, sometimes including the weekend when the pharmaceutical team was available. Each patient has been included in the study only once. They were at least 65 years old (i.e. World Health Organisation's definition for elderly), admitted to an acute medical care unit (i.e. length-of-stay being less than 21 days). All of them provided written informed consent at inclusion, after sufficient time for reflection. Patients were recruited immediately after admission according to their order of arrival in the care unit. Clusters participating were six French university hospitals in Grenoble (geriatric acute medicine), Nice (geriatric internal medicine), Nîmes (medical emergency), Rouen (diabetes, endocrinology and metabolic diseases), Strasbourg (internal medicine) and Toulouse (cardiology). Patients with a hospital stay of more than 21 days were excluded to focus the study on acute care and avoid the intra-cluster contamination. The local ethics committee (the Third Southern Mediterranean Protection to Persons Committee) approved the study for all centres (approval number 2015.04.03 bis).

Intervention

The detailed study protocol was previously published. The patients included in the control period received standard care without a clinical pharmacist in the ward. In the intervention period, patients received CPC combining medication reconciliation at hospital admission, pharmaceutical analysis of medication order, medication review and collaborative meeting. A centralised and standardised training was performed over three days, the week before the study started, to harmonise the intervention across centres. Three training modules created by the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy were followed by the clinical pharmacists in a face-to-face group training course and covered medication reconciliation, pharmaceutical analysis and medication review presented by three senior hospital pharmacists specialised in these activities. All materials were provided to participants in digital format during the training.

During the intervention period, the clinical pharmacist based in the care unit performed the above-mentioned interventions and notified the prescriber if any MEs occurred. Notifications were performed orally and on electronic AMO and/or computerised patient record. The medication review of the AMO was conducted using STOPP and START tools, the French list of potentially inappropriate medications in geriatric patients and the PAPA guide for medication prescription adapted to elders.

### Inpatient treatment of suicidality: a systematic review of clinical trials [^114mWKZr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective: Psychiatric inpatients represent an acutely vulnerable population with high rates of suicidality (ie, suicidal ideation, attempts, and completed suicide). This systematic review aimed to evaluate treatments for suicidality delivered within inpatient settings.

Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library were systematically searched using 3 concepts: suicidality, inpatient population/setting, and treatment/ interventions. Searches were limited to years 2001–2024, with no language restrictions.

Study Selection: Of 19,921 articles identified, 11,519 were screened, and 179 underwent full-text review. We included clinical trials on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions for suicidality in psychiatric inpatients aged 18–65 with moderate to high levels of suicidality that measured changes in suicidality.

Data Extraction and Synthesis: Studies were organized into tables by study design, treatments, participants, suicide measure, outcomes, and key findings. Due to heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not conducted; instead, a narrative synthesis was used for qualitative analysis.

Results: Forty-nine studies were included. Of 14 pharmacologic trials, intravenous ketamine showed most consistent rapid reduction in suicidality. Thirty-five nonpharmacologic trials, covering a broad spectrum of treatments including chronotherapy, neurostimulations, and psychotherapies, were reviewed. The results were mixed, with some interventions showing potential in reducing suicidality, particularly in the mood, personality, and trauma-related disorders. Many studies had methodological concerns including nonrandomized designs, lack of control arms, and retrospective assessments.

Conclusion: A range of interventions for treating suicidality in inpatient settings have been evaluated, with mixed results. The current review underscores the need for larger, well-designed trials to assess the effectiveness of these treatments in inpatient settings.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine 2024 guidelines on adult ICU design [^112LNhGe]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine 2024 Guidelines on adult ICU design — methods and panel: A guidelines panel of 27 members with experience in ICU design met virtually from the panel's inception in 2019 to 2024, and Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Central, and Proquest were searched from database inception to September 2023. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to determine certainty in the evidence and to formulate recommendations, suggestions, and practice statements for each Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes (PICO) question based on quality of evidence and panel consensus, and recommendations were provided when evidence was actionable; suggestions, when evidence was equivocal; and practice statements when the benefits of the intervention appeared to outweigh the risks, but direct evidence to support the intervention did not exist.

### 2025 American society of anesthesiologists practice advisory for perioperative care of older adults scheduled for inpatient surgery [^111wDwLg]. Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Methods and evidence grading — risk of bias for individual studies was evaluated using design-specific tools, results were summarized by outcome, and when relevant, decision-informative, and practicable, pairwise and network meta-analyses were performed with analyses conducted in R. Methodologists rated strength of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system from high to very low; randomized clinical trials start at high strength and nonrandomized studies start at low. For each key question, benefits and harms were summarized, randomized clinical trials were prioritized for analysis when developing recommendations, and nonrandomized designs (before–after/time series, cohort, and case–control) were only analyzed when randomized clinical trials were insufficient to evaluate harms and for supportive confirmatory evidence; recommendations were then developed and the strength rated consistent with the body of evidence.

### Evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults hospitalized for medical care: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114cF1GG]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Inpatient OSA treatment in those with established diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) not currently on treatment — In adult patients with a known pre-admission diagnosis of OSA who are not already on treatment, we recommend initiation of PAP therapy, interventions to address any non-adherence prior to hospitalization, and a discussion of strategies to optimize post-discharge adherence as well as alternatives to PAP. That said, more immediate OSA treatment may be beneficial to optimize clinical outcomes directly related to the medical reason for admission and reduce short-term recurrent risk of clinical progression or decompensation, particularly in those with cardiopulmonary and neurologic disease.

### Enhancing patient-dedicated time in clinical encounters: a systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention strategies [^114hUwzE]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospitals' institutional programs designed to protect or increase the time dedicated to interactions between patients and healthcare professionals, while growing in popularity, often lack formal evaluation. This study aims to quantify the effectiveness of programs designed to protect or enhance the quality or quantity of clinical encounter time between hospitalized patients and healthcare professionals.

Methods

A systematic literature review and random-effects meta-analysis were performed on Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Studies had to include ≥ 80% adult inpatients in acute care, compare groups, and assess at least one of the following outcomes: patient satisfaction, length of stay, home discharge, or 30-day readmission. Screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were performed independently and in duplicate. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized trials, and the Cochrane 2.0 instrument for randomized trials.

Results

A total of 117 unique studies comprising 298,517 patients were included. Compared to their controls, interventions increased the proportion of satisfied patients (+8% [95% CI,+4.7 to+11.4%]; 26 studies, 20,456 patients), the proportion of patients discharged home (+2.6% [95% CI,+0.3 to+5.0%]; 21 studies, 61,539 patients), and reduced length of stay (-1.07 days [95% CI,-1.62 to-0.52]; 58 studies, 160,080 patients) without significant difference in readmission rates (-0.8% [95% CI-1.8 to+0.2%]; 49 studies, 177,677 patients). Most studies were at high risk of bias, even among randomized trials. Programs varied widely in interventions, contexts, and findings.

Discussion

Programs enhancing or protecting clinical encounter time in acute care may improve patient experience, care quality, and discharge processes. Higher quality randomized controlled trials evaluating such interventions are warranted. Future programs may benefit from studies that draw on multi-disciplinary knowledge and implementation sciences to identify contextual factors impacting their success.

### Indications for the evaluation and supplementation of hypophosphatemia: an umbrella systematic review of reviews and guidelines [^112nGVZr]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review in accordance with the PRISMA statement.

Information sources and search strategy

We conducted a search of MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar until September 2024, using any combination of the keywords "phosphate", "phosphorus", "screen", "test", "supplement", "substitu", "hospital", "inpatients", "patient care", "internal medicine", "primary care", and "ambul". The search strategy was designed via a text analysis of key papers. An animal study exclusion search filter was applied and adapted. For the detailed search strategy, see Additional file 1. Additionally, we searched reference lists and performed internet searches for potentially relevant guidelines not referenced, including the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website.

Eligibility criteria

Reviews, guidelines, and consensus statements concerning when to test for hypophosphatemia and/or when to supplement phosphate in adults aged 18 years and older in any health care setting except intensive care units (ICUs) were included. ICU settings were excluded due to their highly specific clinical context, which differs substantially from general inpatient and outpatient care and often involves distinct protocols for phosphate management. Conference abstracts, books, study protocols, and publications in languages other than English were excluded. We excluded non-English publications to ensure consistent interpretation and quality assessment across sources, as translation may introduce bias or misinterpretation. Only the most recent publication was included, with the following exceptions: if an older publication had more or other information, then both publications were included to avoid losing relevant information. If a more recent publication had less information than an older publication and no new aspects, the older publication was retained.

We had initially planned to consider any type of study that assessed phosphate testing or supplementation and its appropriateness in adults. After the first 500 abstracts were reviewed, the inclusion rate was 26.3%. In a team discussion, we decided on the aforementioned selection criteria changes to include only reviews, guidelines, and consensus statements. The study protocol and amendments were preregistered in PROSPERO. Abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers (SN and LB or AEB), as were the full texts (SN and LB). Any disagreements were resolved by consensus or through discussion with the senior author (CEA).

### Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines on family-centered care for adult ICUs: 2024 [^117L7PhP]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intensive care unit (ICU) diaries — among reviewed studies, 12 were RCTs and a prominent recent French RCT did not demonstrate an impact on patient PTSD symptoms, while overall meta-analyses found significant beneficial associations between ICU diary protocols and patient PTSD, albeit with low certainty. There were no differences for other patient outcomes, including delirium, anxiety, depression, quality of life, mortality, and length of stay, and for family outcomes there was no impact on anxiety, depression, or PTSD. The panel judged the evidence likely in favor of the intervention due to a reduction of PTSD among patients in the meta-analyses and no clear undesirable effects.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guideline — sleep medicine consultation for medically hospitalized adults at increased risk for or with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): Recommendation 3 states, "the AASM suggests that sleep medicine consultation be available as part of an evaluation and management pathway, rather than no sleep medicine consultation. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". Oversight "by a board-certified sleep medicine clinician and/or an AASM-accredited sleep center is preferable", and "creative consultation models of care such as teleconsult/telehealth, E-consult and/or nursing or respiratory therapist care can be considered". "Availability of inpatient diagnostic and treatment as part of the consultation should be taken into consideration" for feasibility, and "the diagnostic and management components of the pathway could occur while in the inpatient or outpatient setting". Evidence included "1 observational study" showing "an improvement in the number of follow-ups of patients with PSG, and an increase in the number of OSA diagnoses", with "very low" certainty due to selection bias; costs "were judged to vary", and "the intervention was deemed feasible to implement".

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: executive summary [^114auexv]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This updated executive summary includes 3 recommendations, which were developed as part of ASH's living guidelines effort regarding the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (Table 3). These recommendations have been previously published separately as stand-alone recommendations or updates. The living phase (ie, continuous review and updating) is concluded. Going forward, ASH will maintain these guidelines through regular review and scheduled revision. For all recommendations, we followed the same methods as reported in publications to date, and important methodological aspects and updates are highlighted below.

The initial and updated recommendations were created and updated as shown in Table 3.

Table 3.
Initial and updated recommendations

This executive summary includes final versions of all recommendations as approved by the ASH Guideline Oversight Subcommittee and the ASH Committee on Quality in April 2024. For the executive summary we have applied the following important aspects:

- **Guideline funding and management of conflicts of interest**: supplemental File 1 provides updated "Participant Information Forms" for all panel members, detailing financial and nonfinancial interests, as well as the ASH conflict of interest policies agreed to by each individual. supplemental File 2 provides the updated complete participant information forms of researchers on the systematic review team who contributed to these guidelines.
- **Evidence review and development of recommendation**: new EtD frameworks were created for all recommendations including new evidence and considerations. The systematic review to identify comparative anticoagulation studies for the entire guideline was updated until June 2023. During the project, the initial guideline's literature search strategy (supplemental File 3) was modified to add search terms for antiplatelet agents for the guideline question on postdischarge anticoagulation, and the protocol (supplemental File 4) was modified to focus on inclusion of only randomized controlled trials. The systematic review to identify baseline risk studies for important outcomes for all guideline questions was updated until June 2023 and the methods remained the same throughout the project (search strategy and protocol previously published).
- **Criteria to update living systematic reviews and recommendations**: due to the rapid emergence of a wealth of research studies related to this topic, the systematic reviews were periodically updated and recommendations were reconsidered if new evidence could potentially lead to important changes in baseline risk estimates, intervention effect estimates, certainty in the evidence, or to ensure face validity especially to include important trials.
- **Decision thresholds**: to support judgments about whether the magnitude of an effect estimate was trivial, small, moderate, or large, as well as for determining imprecision of effect estimates, we used decision thresholds for all outcomes considered in the final reported recommendations in the executive summary. Thresholds were calculated using the outcome-specific utility value and results from a decision threshold survey that included the members of the panel. The decision threshold values that were used for each recommendation are reported in the footnotes of the online evidence profiles.
- **Document review**: draft recommendations were reviewed by all members of the panel, and made available online from 1 December 2023 to 22 December 2023 for external review by stakeholders including allied organizations, other medical professionals, patients, and the public. One individual submitted a response that did not require changes to the recommendations. In April 2024, the ASH Guideline Oversight Subcommittee and the ASH Committee on Quality approved that the defined guideline development process was followed, and in May 2024, the officers of the ASH executive committee approved submission of the executive summary manuscript for publication under the imprimatur of ASH.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guideline — peri-discharge management for medically hospitalized adults at increased risk for or with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): Recommendation 4 states, "the AASM suggests a discharge management plan to ensure timely diagnosis and effective management of OSA, rather than no plan. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". Remarks include, "Timeliness: Consider an expedited evaluation and management plan to optimize post-discharge outcomes", and "Linkage to care: Consider ordering post-discharge testing or sleep medicine evaluation prior to discharge. Inpatient sleep testing prior to discharge and/or telehealth medicine may be an option to reduce barriers to care". "Population management: Consider care coordination to ensure appropriate follow-up and post-discharge care". The task force evidence base included "1 RCT and 6 observational studies" with pooled estimates showing "clinically meaningful improvements in mortality, incidence of OSA-related comorbidities (recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiovascular events), readmission, and PAP adherence".

### Identifying core clinical topics and recommending core performance measures for internal medicine physicians: a position paper from the American College of Physicians [^114C3T98]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Internal medicine physicians are specialists who promote health, emphasize disease prevention, manage complex acute and chronic conditions in adults, and receive extensive training in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases affecting all systems of the human body. As a result, internal medicine performance measures (PMs) target several topics. Many PMs are not based on high-certainty evidence of at least moderate net benefit and are burdensome, with low or no value to patient care. The American College of Physicians (ACP) wants to provide a national focus to improve the quality of health care in the United States. The ACP is a leader in the evidence-based world, being the only physician organization designated as a GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) Center, an Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) Center, and a member of the Cochrane U.S. Network. Using a structured, stepwise, evidence-based approach, ACP identified the most important clinical topics evaluated and treated by internal medicine physicians. The ACP is also actively working toward recommending essential PMs for each core clinical topic that can be used to evaluate and improve patient care. This position paper describes ACP's method and results of identifying core clinical topics. It also offers a blueprint for defining core PMs and illustrating the principals through application to 2 core clinical topics. The ACP plans to apply this method on PMs for other core clinical topics.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine 2024 guidelines on adult ICU design [^111p7C7Z]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Society of Critical Care Medicine 2024 adult ICU design — limitations and evidence base — GRADE-based methodology was used, and the systematic review identified, at best, literature of low certainty, most commonly very low certainty, with occasional topics deemed important by the panel but with no relevant literature to evaluate. A paucity of high-quality research on ICU design impacts clinical or patient-important outcomes affected the strength of evidence assessment, resulting in only two Strong Recommendations. Future ICU design guidelines efforts will likely continue to require incorporating expert opinion. Unlike other guidelines, public nonclinical input was not sought as the major focus was ICU design not ICU use. These guidelines may not reflect design priorities in some specialty ICUs; specific adaptations for resource-limited or austere environments are not addressed, mobile critical care spaces are not covered herein, and only English language manuscripts were included.

### Interventions to reduce readmissions after pneumonia hospitalization: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112iTR52]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines (Table S1).

Search strategy

A search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and the Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) to identify peer‐reviewed English‐language articles published through May 29, 2024. The databases were queried using the terms "pneumonia", "readmission", and "reduction" or "prevention" (Table S2 for complete search strategy). This electronic search was complemented by reviewing reference lists of included articles.

Study eligibility criteria

We included studies published in English‐language peer‐reviewed medical journals, discussed an intervention to reduce readmissions of adult patients after a pneumonia‐associated hospitalization, and provided data on the effect of the intervention on readmission rate or risk. Interventions were broadly defined as hospital‐initiated actions or institution characteristics assessed for their ability to reduce readmissions. We excluded non‐English language articles or articles published as perspectives, reviews, conference abstracts, or published in other non‐peer‐reviewed literature.

Study selection and data extraction

Two investigators independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full‐text articles using prespecified eligibility criteria. For each study, one investigator extracted information on study populations, interventions, outcomes, settings, and study designs, with a second investigator reviewing the information for completeness and accuracy. Visual display of individual study results and syntheses were completed by two investigators and are available in Table 1 and Figure 2. Any disagreements between investigators were resolved by a third reviewer.

### The core competencies in hospital medicine: procedures 2025 update [^116wDqq1]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This article presents an updated framework from the Society of Hospital Medicine for individual learning objectives related to key procedures in hospital medicine. Building upon the 2017 framework, these objectives have been revised to reflect evolving clinical evidence, advancements, and shifts in hospital medicine practice patterns. The methodology included a comprehensive literature review, expert consensus panels, and feedback from practicing hospitalists across diverse clinical settings. The updated learning objectives address procedural competencies for the most common interventions in hospital medicine, including arthrocentesis, emergency procedures, interpretation of chest radiographs and electrocardiograms, lumbar puncture, paracentesis, thoracentesis, and vascular access. These revised learning objectives provide a framework to guide curricular development, continuing medical education, and hospital medicine practitioners in developing and maintaining procedural competence essential for high-quality inpatient care.

### Electronic health record interventions to reduce risk of hospital readmissions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114uKtkL]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guideline. The review protocol was registered in.

Data Sources and Searches

In collaboration with a research librarian, we designed and performed a comprehensive search of multiple databases on June 17, 2023, including Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov, from inception using text words with analogous terms within concept areas of "randomized controlled trial", "hospitalized adults", and "readmissions". Relevant articles were also hand-searched and included. This search was updated on July 5, 2024. Database-specific search strategies are provided in eTable 1 in Supplement 1.

Eligibility Criteria and Study Selection

Eligible studies were RCTs conducted in hospitalized adult populations with the aim of reducing hospital readmissions. The interventions had to be delivered entirely or in part using EHR technology, which was defined as a real-time health data record accessible in immediate and secured fashion to authorized users. Control arms had no intervention with an EHR-embedded component. As this level of detail was often not included in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles, we did not require this criterion to be met during the first screening stage; this criterion was applied at the full-text phase. The review excluded studies involving pediatric, obstetric, or psychiatric populations as well as studies that did not report readmission outcomes. There were no language restrictions, and studies in non-English languages were translated using an online translation tool previously validated in systematic reviews. Conference abstracts meeting eligibility criteria were included in this study but were excluded from the risk-of-bias assessment.

Using Covidence (Cochrane Technology), 3 reviewers (B.S.B.P. A. A. and K.W.) independently screened titles and abstracts in duplicate. A calibration exercise was performed whereby the first 100 decisions were reviewed to ensure each reviewer was appropriately applying the eligibility criteria. Studies deemed eligible by 1 or more reviewers were propagated to the full-text phase of the review. At this stage, 4 reviewers (B.S.B.P. A. A. T.H. and K.T.M.) independently reviewed full-text articles in duplicate for inclusion. Disagreements between the reviewers were resolved by a fifth reviewer (T.G.H.).

RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) Collaborative Group Study in Hospitalized Adults Diagnosed with COVID-19

RECOVERY was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter platform study conducted in the United Kingdom to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients for the ACTEMRA portion of the study had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical contraindications to any of the treatments and had clinical evidence of progressive COVID-19 (defined as oxygen saturation < 92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy, and CRP ≥ 75 mg/L). Patients were then randomized to receive either standard of care (SoC) or intravenous ACTEMRA at a weight-tiered dosing comparable to the recommended dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] in addition to SoC.

Efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprising 4116 adult patients who were randomized to the ACTEMRA + SoC arm (n = 2022) or to the SoC arm (n = 2094). The mean age of participants was 64 years (range: 20 to 101), and patients were 67% male, 76% White, 11% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% mixed race. At baseline, 0.2% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 45% of patients required low flow oxygen, 41% of patients required non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, and 14% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation; 82% of patients were reported to be receiving systemic corticosteroids.

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to death through Day 28. The results for the overall population and the subgroups of patients who were or were not receiving systemic corticosteroids at time of randomization are summarized in Table 12.

The inclusion criteria were noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics for abdominal infection. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the interventions were: n = 50620 CPOE stewardship bundle (computerized patient order entry prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics coupled with clinician education and feedback) n = 54384 routine stewardship (educational materials and quarterly coaching calls to maintain stewardship activities per national guidelines). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in extended-spectrum days of therapy (169.3 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 19.8 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.66). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in vancomycin days of therapy (29.7 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 11.8 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37) Significant increase in reduction in antipseudomonal days of therapy (131.8 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 5.6 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.78). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in length of stay, days to ICU transfers. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the conclusion was: in noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection, CPOE stewardship bundle was superior to routine stewardship with respect to reduction in extended-spectrum days of therapy.

### Tocilizumab (Tofidence) [^116XqfAo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) Collaborative Group Study in Hospitalized Adults Diagnosed with COVID-19

RECOVERY was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter platform study conducted in the United Kingdom to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients for the tocilizumab portion of the study had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical contraindications to any of the treatments and had clinical evidence of progressive COVID-19 (defined as oxygen saturation < 92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy, and CRP ≥ 75 mg/L). Patients were then randomized to receive either standard of care (SoC) or intravenous tocilizumab at a weight-tiered dosing comparable to the recommended dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] in addition to SoC.

Efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprising 4116 adult patients who were randomized to the tocilizumab + SoC arm (n = 2022) or to the SoC arm (n = 2094). The mean age of participants was 64 years (range: 20 to 101), and patients were 67% male, 76% White, 11% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% mixed race. At baseline, 0.2% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 45% of patients required low flow oxygen, 41% of patients required non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, and 14% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation; 82% of patients were reported to be receiving systemic corticosteroids.

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to death through Day 28. The results for the overall population and the subgroups of patients who were or were not receiving systemic corticosteroids at time of randomization are summarized in Table 9.

Study and Participant Characteristics

Characteristics of the included studies and participants are described in Table 1. Studies were published between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2024, with 48 studies (41%) published between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2020, and 56 (48%) conducted in the US, and had a mean (SD) follow-up time of 0.5 (0.6) years. In total, 207 652 participants were included across all studies, who had a weighted mean (SD) age of 68 (9) years. The weighted mean (SD) percentage of females was 44% (16%), of males was 56% (16%), and of participants with hypertension was 59% (20%). The most common admission diagnosis was heart failure (38 studies [33%]), with cardiology being the most common attending service (48 studies [41%]). Furthermore, most intervention components included telemonitoring (76 [66%]), and communication with a health care professional (86 [74%]). Nearly half of interventions had a duration greater than 30 days (44 [38%]), and were partially supported by a health care professional, including the patient and/or caregiver as part of the intervention. Ninety-one studies (78%) included at least 2 components, in which telemonitoring (59 studies [65%]), case management (45 studies [49%]), and telephone follow-up (35 studies [38%]), were the most common (eTable 3 in Supplement 1).

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112cpwoB]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Adults with restless legs syndrome (RLS) — gabapentin enacarbil recommendation: In adults with RLS, the AASM recommends the use of gabapentin enacarbil over no gabapentin enacarbil (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). The TF identified 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 3 observational studies in which the pooled estimates demonstrated clinically significant improvements in disease severity, sleep quality, and QOL with a moderate effect size; all 8 RCTs reported on the presence of adverse events leading to study withdrawal and the pooled estimate for the adverse events did not meet clinical significance, with adverse effects including somnolence and dizziness and the undesirable effect size deemed small. The overall certainty of evidence was moderate due to imprecision; since the cost of the medication is considered high, treatment would probably reduce health equity, but direct evidence is lacking; the intervention was feasible to implement; and patients who are at a high risk of side effects with this class of medications may choose other treatment options.

### Outpatient follow-up and 30-day readmissions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147mSUw]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guideline. The study is registered with.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

We included studies of any design examining inpatient hospital admissions among adults discharged home or to the community. The intervention was outpatient follow-up within 30 days (alone or with other postdischarge follow-up components [telephone or home visits]) in any care setting. Studies with outpatient follow-up combined with any predischarge intervention were included only if they reported the numbers who received and did not receive follow-up. The comparator was no known outpatient follow-up within 30 days. The primary outcome was all-cause 30-day readmission. A sensitivity analysis included composite outcomes, combining readmission with ED discharge and/or mortality. Secondary outcomes included all-cause 30-day ED discharge and mortality. We excluded studies not in English, that included psychiatric or obstetric-related admissions or patients younger than 18 years, that evaluated only scheduled follow-up or outcomes beyond or prior to 30 days, and that reported only secondary outcomes.

Search Strategy and Study Selection

We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, and CINAHL for studies published between January 1, 2000, and August 4, 2025, using terms related to outpatient follow-up and readmissions (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Two reviewers (I.B. E.B. A.) independently screened titles and abstracts using a web and mobile app. Full texts were retrieved for abstracts included by either reviewer. Both reviewers evaluated full-text articles, resolving conflicts through discussion with the third author (C.M.).

Data Extraction

We extracted author, publication year, country, population characteristics (number of hospitals or sites, age, disease, sample size [number of admissions], discharge destination, whether patients had multiple admissions, time period, and exclusions), intervention details (time to follow-up, practitioner type [eg, primary care practitioner]), additional intervention components, data source for outpatient follow-up (eg, medical records), comparator description, and outcome description (eg, readmission, mortality, or composite outcome). For the meta-analysis, we extracted the number of patients with and without follow-up, number of readmissions, and effect sizes (odds ratios [ORs] or hazard ratios [HRs] and associated 95% CIs for each outcome) and analysis details (statistical methods, adjustments for bias, and handling of missing data).

### Bupropion hydrochloride [^112fTJ3M]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of major depressive disorder was established in two 4-week, placebo-controlled trials in adult inpatients with MDD (Trials 1 and 2 in Table 4) and in one 6-week, placebo-controlled trial in adult outpatients with MDD (Trial 3 in Table 4). In the first trial, the dose range of bupropion hydrochloride tablets was 300 mg to 600 mg/day administered in 3 divided doses; 78% of subjects were treated with doses of 300 mg to 450 mg/day. The trial demonstrated the efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride tablets as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score, the HDRS depressed mood item (Item 1), and the Clinical Global Impressions-severity score (CGI-S). The second trial included 2 doses of bupropion hydrochloride tablets (300 and 450 mg/day) and placebo. This trial demonstrated the effectiveness of bupropion hydrochloride tablets for only the 450-mg/day dose. The efficacy results were statistically significant for the HDRS total score and the CGI-S score, but not for HDRS Item 1. In the third trial, outpatients were treated with 300 mg/day of bupropion hydrochloride tablets. This trial demonstrated the efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride tablets as measured by the HDRS total score, the HDRS Item 1, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the CGI-S score, and the CGI-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) score. Effectiveness of bupropion hydrochloride tablets in long-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials.

### Tocilizumab (Actemra) [^114fpSaL]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

REMDACTA

REMDACTA was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate intravenous ACTEMRA 8 mg/kg in combination with intravenous remdesivir (RDV) 200 mg on Day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily for a total of 10 days in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The study randomized 649 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result, pneumonia confirmed by radiography, and who required supplemental oxygen > 6 L/min to maintain SpO2 > 93%. At baseline, 7% of patients were on low flow oxygen, 80% were on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, 14% were on invasive mechanical ventilation, and 84% were on corticosteroids.

The primary efficacy endpoint was time from randomization to hospital discharge or 'ready for discharge' up to Day 28. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms with respect to time to hospital discharge or "ready for discharge" through Day 28.

Mortality at Day 28 was 18.1% in the ACTEMRA+ RDV arm versus 19.5% in the placebo +RDV arm (weighted difference (ACTEMRA arm - placebo arm): -1.3% [95% CI, -7.8% to 5.2%]).

Mortality Across Studies in Patients Receiving Baseline Corticosteroids

A study-level meta-analysis was conducted on EMPACTA, COVACTA, REMDACTA and RECOVERY studies. For each of the four studies, the risk difference through Day 28 was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method in the subgroup of patients receiving baseline corticosteroids, summarized in Figure 3. Patients from the RECOVERY trial represent 78.8% of the total sample size in this meta-analysis. The combined risk difference showed that ACTEMRA treatment (n = 2261) resulted in a 4.61% absolute reduction in the risk of death at Day 28 (risk difference = -4.6%; 95% CI: -7.3% to -1.9%) compared to SoC (n = 2034).

### Nefazodone hydrochloride [^113q24jX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies in "Inpatients"

Two studies were conducted to evaluate nefazodone's effectiveness in hospitalized depressed patients. These were 6 week, dose-titration trials comparing nefazodone (up to 600 mg/day) and placebo, on a BID schedule. In one study, nefazodone was superior to placebo. In this study, the mean modal dose of nefazodone was 503 mg/day, and 85% of these inpatients were melancholic; at baseline, patients were distributed at the higher end of the 7 point CGI Severity scale, as follows: 4 = moderately ill (17%); 5 = markedly ill (48%); 6 = severely ill (32%). In the other study, the differentiation in response rates between nefazodone and placebo was not statistically significant. This result may be explained by the "high" rate of spontaneous improvement among the patients randomized to placebo.

Studies of "Relapse Prevention in Patients Recently Recovered (Clinically) From Depression"

Two studies were conducted to assess nefazodone's capacity to maintain a clinical remission in acutely depressed patients who were judged to have responded adequately (HDRS total score ≤ 10) after a 16 week period of open treatment with nefazodone (titration up to 600 mg/day). In one study, nefazodone was superior to placebo. In this study, patients (n = 131) were randomized to continuation on nefazodone or placebo for an additional 36 weeks (1 year total). This study demonstrated a significantly lower relapse rate (HDRS total score ≥ 18) for patients taking nefazodone compared to those on placebo. The second study was of appropriate design and power, but the sample of patients admitted for evaluation did not suffer relapses at a high enough incidence to provide a meaningful test of nefazodone's efficacy for this use.

Comparisons of Clinical Trial Results

Highly variable results have been seen in the clinical development of all antidepressant drugs. Furthermore, in those circumstances when the drugs have not been studied in the same controlled clinical trial(s), comparisons among the findings of studies evaluating the effectiveness of different antidepressant drug products are inherently unreliable. Because conditions of testing (e.g., patient samples, investigators, doses of the treatments administered and compared, outcome measures, etc.) vary among trials, it is virtually impossible to distinguish a difference in drug effect from a difference due to one or more of the confounding factors just enumerated.

### Methodology for ACOEM's occupational medicine practice guidelines-2025 revision [^115CjwHs]. ACOEM (2025). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline–systematic review intersection — CPG developers should use systematic reviews that meet standards set by the Institute of Medicine's Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Comparative Effectiveness Research. When systematic reviews are conducted specifically to inform particular guidelines, the GDG and systematic review team should interact regarding the scope, approach, and output of both processes. The ACOEM Guidelines relies on systematic reviews conducted in accordance with the highest standards to provide current guidance on the relevant clinical questions. ACOEM also utilizes Cochrane systematic reviews, in addition to other scientific systematic reviews that meet or exceed the IOM's Committee on Standards for Systematic Reviews of Comparative Effectiveness Research. The Research Team staff conduct exhaustive systematic literature reviews for each guideline topic/question. In order to identify all high- and moderate-quality original research studies, the literature search is broad and comprehensive. Medical Terms (MeSH Terms) are used to identify studies relevant to answer the questions regarding the treatments and diagnostic procedures. A combination of MeSH terms and other terms are typically used in order to determine the method that will yield the most relevant studies in the search process. ACOEM searches PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, and Scopus for primary sources of original research. ACOEM conducts extensive supplementary searches using review articles, systematic reviews, and reference lists of the included and excluded studies.

### Rufinamide [^117TQV1e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving, it is advisable to contact a Certified Poison Control Center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug.

One overdose of 7,200 mg per day rufinamide was reported in an adult during the clinical trials. The overdose was associated with no major signs or symptoms, no medical intervention was required, and the patient continued in the study at the target dose.

Treatment or Management of Overdose: There is no specific antidote for overdose with rufinamide. If clinically indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be attempted by induction of emesis or gastric lavage. Usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. General supportive care of the patient is indicated including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient.

Hemodialysis: Standard hemodialysis procedures may result in limited clearance of rufinamide. Although there is no experience to date in treating overdose with hemodialysis, the procedure may be considered when indicated by the patient's clinical state.

Study Design, Setting, and Participants

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of general medicine patients at 28 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, between April 2015 and December 2021 that are part of the General Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI), a hospital-based research network. Our study was approved by the research ethics boards for all included hospitals; the requirement for written informed consent was waived by the research ethics board given the use of deidentified patient data. Ontario is the largest single-payer health system in North America with a population of 14.2 million people. Hospital services are insured for all residents of Ontario at no charge to patients. This study was reported in accordance with Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

All patients admitted to or discharged from general medicine during the study period who were older than 18 years were included. We included both emergency department admissions and direct admissions. No exclusion criteria were applied. Patients were followed from the date of hospital admission to the latest of either in-hospital death, hospital discharge, or readmission within 30 days to a hospital within the GEMINI database. The GEMINI database includes administrative data (at both the patient and clinician level) and clinical data for all patients admitted to, or discharged from, the medical units at the affiliated sites. Hospitals in the GEMINI network encompass more than 60% of medical hospitalizations in Ontario and include academic hospitals affiliated with 5 of the province's 6 independent medical schools.

1.3 Special Considerations in Treating Pediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder

Pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders; however, diagnosis can be challenging. For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, pediatric patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder should be part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions.

1.4 ZYPREXA IntraMuscular: Agitation Associated with Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Mania

ZYPREXA IntraMuscular is indicated for the treatment of acute agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania.

Efficacy was demonstrated in 3 short-term (24 hours of IM treatment) placebo-controlled trials in agitated adult inpatients with: schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed episodes) [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

"Psychomotor agitation" is defined in DSM-IV as "excessive motor activity associated with a feeling of inner tension". Patients experiencing agitation often manifest behaviors that interfere with their diagnosis and care, e.g., threatening behaviors, escalating or urgently distressing behavior, or self-exhausting behavior, leading clinicians to the use of intramuscular antipsychotic medications to achieve immediate control of the agitation.

### Olanzapine and fluoxetine [^114rZQNg]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice.

The data in the tables represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

Adults — The information below is derived from a clinical study database for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules consisting of 2547 patients with treatment resistant depression, depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder with psychosis, or sexual dysfunction with approximately 1085 patient-years of exposure. The conditions and duration of treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules varied greatly and included (in overlapping categories) open-label and double-blind phases of studies, inpatients and outpatients, fixed-dose and dose-titration studies, and short-term or long-term exposure.

Adverse Reactions Associated with Discontinuation of Treatment in Short-Term, Controlled Studies Including Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder and Treatment Resistant Depression — Overall, 11.3% of the 771 patients in the olanzapine and fluoxetine capsule group discontinued due to adverse reactions compared with 4.4% of the 477 patients for placebo. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation associated with the use of olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules (incidence of at least 1% for olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules and greater than that for placebo) using MedDRA Dictionary coding were weight increased (2%) and sedation (1%) versus placebo patients which had 0% incidence of weight increased and sedation.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^117F8Wee]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Health care costs — Health care costs refer to the resources consumed in the production of health care that are then no longer available for other uses and include costs of drugs, devices, durable medical equipment, clinician and nonclinician time, inpatient hospitalization, emergency room visits, outpatient services, long-term care, and home-based services. There are 2 approaches to evaluating health care costs: micro-costing, which is a bottom-up approach that relies on direct enumeration and costing of all resources consumed or saved, and gross-costing, which is a top-down approach that assigns each episode of care an average aggregate cost based on known national reimbursement rates (eg, Medicare reimbursement for a Diagnosis-Related Group). The choice of approach used to estimate costs depends on the specific types of resources to be valued.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^112tBTNP]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Oral glucocorticoids — In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), oral glucocorticoids have numerous side effects, including steroid myopathy which can contribute to muscle weakness, decreased functionality, and respiratory failure in people with very severe COPD. Systemic glucocorticoids for treating acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients or during emergency department visits have been shown to reduce the rate of treatment failure, the rate of relapse and to improve lung function and breathlessness, whereas prospective studies on the long-term effects in stable COPD are limited. Therefore, while they play a role in the acute management of exacerbations, they have no role in the chronic daily treatment in COPD because of a lack of benefit balanced against a high rate of systemic complications.

### Incorporating economic evidence in clinical guidelines: a framework from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^1153YazD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In recognition of accelerating health care spending and alignment with the American College of Physicians (ACP) principles of promoting high-value care, the ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) developed a framework to standardize its approach to identifying, appraising, and considering economic evidence in the development of ACP clinical guidelines. This article presents the CGC's process for incorporating economic evidence, which encompasses cost-effectiveness analyses, economic outcomes in randomized controlled trials, and resource utilization (intervention cost) data. Economic evidence is one component of ACP recommendations. The CGC first and foremost assesses the certainty of evidence for clinical net benefit of interventions; it then considers patient values and preferences, and only then considers economic evidence to develop recommendations.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty amongst older hospital inpatients in low-and middle-income countries [^116vpX1r]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was prospectively registered (PROSPERO CRD42022340466) and is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Ethical approval was not required as it provided a secondary summary of existing published data.

Search strategy

Medline (OVID), Embase (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO) and PsychInfo (ProQuest) were searched from their inception to 11 October 2024. Titles and abstracts were searched for the terms 'frail', 'frailty' or 'frail elderly' as a keyword and/or subject heading, or the truncated keyword 'frail'. These were combined with every country listed as an LMIC by the World Bank as of 2022–23, also as a keyword and/or subject heading. No additional filters or limits were used. In addition to this primary database search, references of included studies were searched manually and considered for inclusion.

Eligibility criteria

To be considered eligible for inclusion, studies had to meet the following criteria: (i) cross-sectional or cohort design, (ii) report data from LMICs, (iii) report data from adults aged ≥ 60 years, (iv) report data from hospital inpatients, (v) report frailty prevalence using clearly defined and validated methods (note this criterion excludes studies which reported frailty as a continuous variable). Hospital inpatients were defined as those admitted to medical and surgical ward environments and expected to stay in hospital overnight. Studies which assessed frailty amongst a subpopulation based on an index disease (e.g. acute coronary syndrome or COVID-19) were excluded on the basis that the prevalence of frailty in these groups might not necessarily reflect the prevalence in the general hospital inpatient population. To minimise the risk of selection bias, included studies were required to at least attempt to assess all members (e.g. whole hospital, ward or department), or a random sample, of the target clinical population. Studies relating to community, primary care, outpatient, emergency department or short-stay settings were excluded. Given the international scope of this review, it was deemed important to include studies which were not available in the English language. Google Translate® was used to translate non-English-language studies and is increasingly recognised as a viable and accurate tool for use in systematic reviews.

### Clinical use of inpatient FDG-PET / CT in internal medicine [^117J1pEr]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

FDG-PET/CT is useful in internal medicine for evaluation of patients with various inflammatory presentations. However, data regarding its diagnostic role in inpatients is limited. This study aims to assess the contribution of FDG-PET/CT in hospitalized patients.

Methods

An observational cohort study was conducted at a tertiary medical center in Israel from 2015 to 2020. We analyzed FDG-PET/CT scans of 260 adult inpatients from Internal Medicine, Cardiology, Medical Intensive Care, and Intensive Cardiac Care units. Scans done solely for malignancy follow-up were excluded. The primary outcome was a change in diagnosis and/or management, assessed by at least two physicians.

Results

Among the 260 patients, indications included infection (42%), inflammation (35%), suspected malignancy (17%), cardiac disease (5%), and other (1%). 80% of studies were clinically helpful. In 40% treatment was changed, either in type (27%) or duration (13%). 9% of studies contributed to diagnosis alone, and 7% contributed to localization. 23% were negative studies, eliminating additional testing. 1% showed incidental findings requiring treatment. In 43% of studies, there were new findings that were not visible by prior morphologic imaging. A significantly higher percentage of clinically helpful studies was observed in patients with foreign devices compared with those without devices (89% vs 74%, p = 0.003), while immunocompromised patients had a lower percentage of clinically helpful studies (74% vs 84%, p = 0.06).

Conclusion

FDG-PET/CT is a useful, noninvasive diagnostic tool in patients hospitalized in Internal Medicine, Cardiology, and Intensive Care. This modality may aid in treatment and prevent unnecessary invasive procedures in selected patients.

### Outpatient follow-up and 30-day readmissions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Nw2Uq]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis offers compelling evidence on the association between outpatient follow-up and reduced readmissions. Rather than universal recommendations, risk factors such as patient age and disease should be considered in prioritizing postdischarge follow-up. We emphasize the need for high-quality studies and offer actionable recommendations to guide future research.

### International networks for pediatric inpatient research and excellence (INSPIRE): a global initiative in pediatric hospital medicine [^114xNYVD]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) has emerged as one of the fastest‐growing pediatric subspecialties. Internationally, PHM is most established in the United States, with fellowship training and accreditation as a board‐certified specialty, while in other countries (e.g. Australia), core pediatric training includes competencies focused on hospital medicine. Training, accreditation, inpatient staffing models, and the use of the terms "hospital medicine" and "hospitalist" differ across countries, but there is universal recognition of the expertise required to provide care in this setting. While the clinical expertise is well established, including its growing importance with the rise in complexity of children managed in hospital, PHM is underdeveloped as an academic field. Less than one‐third (30.9%) of PHM clinicians have protected time for research, compared to 52.6% for other pediatric subspecialties, and less than 4% spend > 25% time on research.

Researchers in other pediatric subspecialties have developed national networks to build academic capacity with the aim of improving quality of care and reducing unwarranted variation. Pediatric networks in emergency medicine, oncology, and critical carehave focused on conducting multicenter studies, in particular, high‐quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on important clinical questions. Learning from the success and impact of other pediatric research networks, the past decade has seen the emergence of several PHM national and regional research networks focused on generating evidence to improve quality of care and outcomes for hospitalized children and youth. The objective of this perspective article is to describe the development of an international network of networks focused on PHM research called INSPIRE — the International Networks for Pediatric Inpatient Research and Excellence.

### Aripiprazole (Opipza) [^111Gz6kd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of OPIPZA for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia in patients 13 years and older, adjunctive treatment of adults with MDD, treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder in pediatric patients 6 years and older, and treatment of Tourette's disorder in pediatric patients 6 years and older is based on adequate and well-controlled studies of another oral aripiprazole product. Below is a display of adverse reactions of oral aripiprazole (referred to as "aripiprazole" in this section) from those adequate and well-controlled studies.

Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 13,543 adult patients who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and other indications, and who had approximately 7,619 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole. A total of 3,390 patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 1,933 patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least one year of exposure.

Aripiprazole has been evaluated for safety in 1,686 pediatric patients (6 to 18 years) who participated in multiple-dose, clinical trials in schizophrenia, autistic disorder, Tourette's disorder or other indications who had approximately 1,342 patient-years of exposure to oral aripiprazole. A total of 959 pediatric patients were treated with oral aripiprazole for at least 180 days and 556 pediatric patients treated with oral aripiprazole had at least one year of exposure.

The conditions and duration of treatment with aripiprazole (monotherapy and adjunctive therapy with antidepressants or mood stabilizers) included (in overlapping categories) double-blind, comparative and noncomparative open-label studies, inpatient and outpatient studies, fixed- and flexible-dose studies, and short- and longer-term exposure.

The most common adverse reactions of aripiprazole in adult patients in clinical trials (≥ 10%) were nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, akathisia, anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness.

The most common adverse reactions of aripiprazole in the pediatric clinical trials (≥ 10%) were somnolence, headache, vomiting, extrapyramidal disorder, fatigue, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and weight increased.

### International networks for pediatric inpatient research and excellence (INSPIRE): a global initiative in pediatric hospital medicine [^1135MDbr]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

EARLY INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS IN PHM

Launched in 2001, the US Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings (PRIS) Network is the earliest PHM research network. Following a rapid growth and development of the field of PHM in the United States, PRIS was redesigned in 2009 and led by a group of hospitalist investigators focused on multicentre research. PRIS also envisioned strong international collaborations, leading to United States–Canadian partnership on multicenter prospective observational studies (e.g. the I‐PASS handoff program), using administrative databases, and inclusion of Canadian sites in surveys (e.g. pulse oximetry in bronchiolitis), and more recently collaborations with Australian researchers in hybrid‐effectiveness trials. This foundational work from PRIS inspired the launch of PHM networks in other regions in the past decade. Networks now include the General and Adolescent Paediatric Research in the United Kingdom and Ireland (GAPRUKI) in 2016; the Children's Inpatient Research Collaboration of Australia and New Zealand (CIRCAN) in 2018, and the Canadian Paediatric Inpatient Research Network (PIRN) in 2019.

Table 1 outlines the characteristics of the four currently established pediatric research networks focused on inpatient hospital care. The practice context across the four networks vary with respect to medical training, hospital medicine accreditation as a specialty, inpatient staffing models, and healthcare insurance coverage. Beginning in 2019, there were out‐reach efforts made across the networks to arrange quarterly calls to share updates, discuss challenges, and identify opportunities for international collaborations. Building on the foundational work in PRIS, each of the three newly established networks focused early work on prioritization studies, including those of parents and families, clinicians, researchers, and health system impact. These meetings also created opportunities to collaborate on workshop submissions to Pediatric Academic Society (PAS) meetings, invitations to speak at respective network meetings (e.g. monthly webinars, annual keynote lectures), cross‐network PHM prioritization studies, methodological articles, and specific studies.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

ACC/AHA cost/value methodology — scope and updates state that "The ACC/AHA published its first cost/value methodology statement in 2014", which "has served as a methodological guidepost for economic evaluations in cardiology and has led to the routine incorporation of 'Value Statements' in ACC/AHA guidelines". The preface notes that "The past 10 years have seen a proliferation of publications focused on cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)" with advances "including guidance from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, the introduction of novel alternatives to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and an increasing emphasis on patient-centered and patient-reported outcomes", while challenges include "lack of clarity on nationally representative costs for new drugs and devices, interpretation of heterogeneity of cost effectiveness across subpopulations, and incorporation of methods to address health inequities". It states that the methodology statement "provides updated guidance for investigators, academic journals, and clinical guideline committees regarding the rigorous evaluation of CEAs", that "This update incorporates novel CEA methods and highlights areas where further methodological research is needed", and that "It updates the cost-effectiveness thresholds to reflect currently available empiric evidence regarding willingness-to-pay thresholds in the United States", with "the 2025 update" including "a focus on health equity in CEA". The writing committee "included experienced clinicians and specialists in cardiology, health economics, and research methodology", and the ACC and AHA "have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are developed without bias".

### Aripiprazole (Opipza) [^113rHdg7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in five short-term (4 week and 6 week), placebo-controlled trials of acutely relapsed inpatients who predominantly met DSM-III/IV criteria for schizophrenia. Four of the five trials were able to distinguish aripiprazole from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (one trial) or haloperidol (two trials), but they were not designed to allow for a comparison of aripiprazole and the active comparators.

In the four positive trials for aripiprazole, four primary measures were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms. Efficacy was evaluated using the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30 item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient.

In a 4 week trial (n = 414) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (15 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 1 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and CGI-severity score. In addition, the 15 mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale.
In a 4 week trial (n = 404) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (20 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 2 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, and CGI- severity score.
In a 6 week trial (n = 420) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (10, 15, or 20 mg/day) to placebo, all three doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 3 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale.
In a 6 week trial (n = 367) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (2, 5, or 10 mg/day) to placebo, the 10 mg dose of aripiprazole was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 4 in Table 26), the primary outcome measure of the study. The 2 and 5 mg doses did not demonstrate superiority to placebo on the primary outcome measure.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113SePcz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) patient information — symptom course, watchful waiting, and antibiotics: Most patients with ABRS feel better within 7 days and by 15 days about 90% are cured or improved. Watchful waiting means delaying antibiotic treatment of ABRS for up to 5 days after diagnosis, with a prescription to be filled only if not better after 5 days or if worse at any time. Both watchful waiting and antibiotic therapy are proven ways to treat ABRS, and antibiotics only slightly increase symptom relief with about 10–15 people must use antibiotics to get 1 more person better after 7–15 days; antibiotics have side effects including rash, upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, and causing resistant germs. If antibiotics are used, they are usually given for 10 days; ask your doctor about a 5–7 day course of antibiotics since side effects are less common. For symptomatic relief, nasal steroid sprays can reduce symptoms after 15 days of use but the benefit is small (about 14 people must use them to get 1 person better), decongestant nasal sprays should be used for no more than 3 days in a row, and antihistamines and oral steroid medicines should not be used routinely.

### Optimizing order sets with a large language model-powered multiagent system [^116b9vJQ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The knowledge retrieval agent retrieved content from various sources, including Journal Watch from the New England Journal of Medicine, which summarizes newly published guidelines and articles from over 250 journals; we extracted all summaries from January 2022 to July 2024. Other sources included the Pocket Medicine (7th edition), a reliable reference for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in internal medicine, compiled by physicians at Massachusetts General Hospital. We also included StatPearls, a clinical support tool containing articles on diseases, drugs, and procedures, extracted from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Bookshelf. Another source was Vanderbilt Internal Medicine Residency Handbook (VIMBook), a yearly updated, peer-reviewed guide offering systems-based practice guidance at VUMC. The last source was PubMed articles and clinical guidelines previously saved by the dynamic search agent. This agent used the Chroma vector database to retrieve the 5 most relevant documents based on semantic similarity. This process enables the agent to generate targeted evidence-based suggestions, ensuring that order sets are based on comprehensive current clinical knowledge.

The medication verification agent used the RxNav application program interface (API) to extract medication class information and the Bing Search API to confirm current market availability. Finally, the suggestion summarizer agent synthesized the inputs from all agents to produce a final list of recommendations with confidence and importance scores.

### Practice of data sharing plans in clinical trial registrations and concordance between registered and published data sharing plans: a cross-sectional study [^113QMuXB]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We reported this study according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline. This study was registered on the Open Science Framework.

Search strategy and eligibility criteria

We first identified the top 10 medical general journals that frequently published clinical trials and were ranked by journal impact factor in the category of "Medicine, General & Internal" based on Journal Citation Reports (as of June 2023). After excluding those journals that primarily focused on basic science or published less than 10 clinical trials annually, a total of 6 journals were chosen, including The Lancet, The New England Journal of Medicine (New Engl J Med), Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), British Medical Journal (BMJ), JAMA Internal Medicine, and Annals of Internal Medicine (Ann Intern Med). Subsequently, we searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) to systematically retrieve clinical trials published in these journals (Additional file 1: Table S1 shows the search strategy used). Given that ICMJE required a data sharing plan in trial registration from Jan 2019 onwards, we only included trials that started participant enrollment on or after Jan 1, 2019, and trial publications published between Jan 1, 2021, and Dec 31, 2023, to allow sufficient time and samples of trials for evaluation. We included clinical trial publications with primary results; methods papers, publications of secondary results, relevant reviews, commentaries, perspectives, or editorials were excluded. The detailed selection process is presented in Additional file 1: Fig. S1.

If the same trial was registered on different platforms, we only extracted and analyzed information from ClinicalTrials.gov. Some publications may pool different trials for analysis, thereby having ≥ two registration identifiers (IDs). We treated such publications as different trials by their corresponding registration IDs for data extraction and analysis; i.e. each registration ID represented an individual trial. Some publications with updated data may share the same registration ID with prior publications; in this case, the most recent publication was kept for analysis to avoid double counting.

### Quetiapine [^1113DcK5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Quetiapine tablet is an atypical antipsychotic indicated for the treatment of:

Schizophrenia (1.1)
Bipolar I disorder manic episodes (1.2)
Bipolar disorder, depressive episodes (1.2)

1.1 Schizophrenia

Quetiapine tablet is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. The efficacy of quetiapine tablets in schizophrenia was established in three 6-week trials in adults and one 6-week trial in adolescents (13 to 17 years). The effectiveness of quetiapine tablets for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

1.2 Bipolar Disorder

Quetiapine tablet is indicated for the acute treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, both as monotherapy and as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was established in two 12-week monotherapy trials in adults, in one 3-week adjunctive trial in adults, and in one 3-week monotherapy trial in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Quetiapine tablet is indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Efficacy was established in two 8-week monotherapy trials in adult patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorder [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Quetiapine tablet is indicated for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, as an adjunct to lithium or divalproex. Efficacy was established in two maintenance trials in adults. The effectiveness of quetiapine tablets as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder has not been systematically evaluated in controlled clinical trials [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

1.3 Special Considerations in Treating Pediatric Schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder

Pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder are serious mental disorders, however, diagnosis can be challenging. For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is indicated as part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions.

### 2025 American society of anesthesiologists practice advisory for perioperative care of older adults scheduled for inpatient surgery [^112pFU14]. Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Background — perioperative care of older adults — In the next 30 years, the population of U.S. adults aged 65 yr and older will double (from 46 to 98 million), and the U.S. population 85 yr and older will triple (from 6 to 20 million). Even though adults older than 65 yr comprise only 15% of the U.S. population, they undergo more than 30% of all inpatient and outpatient surgeries. Unfortunately, loss of independence is common in older adults after surgery, with the incidence increasing with age; Nineteen percent of patients aged 80 to 89 yr and 26% of patients 90 yr or older exhibited functional decline that persisted for 30 days after a surgical procedure. Thirty-five percent of older adults with a new disability after surgery have no recovery 6 months later.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^115PYuqH]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Internal fistulas in Crohn's disease — rectovaginal, enterovesical, and enteroenteric — are outlined with limited trial data and a medical-first approach for rectovaginal disease: Internal fistulas originate between the bowel and a visceral organ and may occur in the form of rectovaginal fistulas, enterovesical fistulas, or enteroenteric fistulas. Limited clinical trial data exist for internal fistulizing CD, and most of the data stem from the early infliximab studies including the ACCENT II trial which included patients with rectovaginal fistula; therefore, infliximab with or without an immunomodulator tends to be recommended for these patients as an initial treatment approach before surgery. For patients with enterovesicular or colovesicular fistulas, recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infection is an indication for surgery especially if associated with pyelonephritis, and surgery usually involves resection of involved inflamed bowel and closure of the bladder defect. Enteroenteric fistulas are generally asymptomatic because they tend to form as sequelae of luminal inflammatory activity and typically do not require surgical management, whereas larger symptomatic internal fistulas can be associated with diarrhea, malnutrition, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and may require more intensive management with nutritional support and medical and surgical interventions. The presence of high-output fistulas typically mandates surgical intervention (proximal bowel diversion, bowel segment resection, or surgical fistula closure) and historically they do not close spontaneously or with medical therapy.

### Lubiprostone (Amitiza) [^115r22JH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Study 1, patients receiving non-diphenylheptane (e.g., non-methadone) opioids (n = 431) were randomized to receive placebo (n = 217) or Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily (n = 214) for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy analysis was a comparison of the proportion of "overall responders" in each treatment arm. A patient was considered an "overall responder" if ≥ 1 SBM improvement over baseline were reported for all treatment weeks for which data were available and ≥ 3 SBMs/week were reported for at least 9 of 12 treatment weeks. The proportion of patients in Study 1 qualifying as an "overall responder" was 27.1% in the group receiving Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily compared to 18.9% of patients receiving placebo twice daily (treatment difference = 8.2%; p-value = 0.03). Examination of gender and race subgroups did not identify differences in response to Amitiza among these subgroups. There were too few elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) to adequately assess differences in effects in that population.

In Study 2, patients receiving opioids (N = 418) were randomized to receive placebo (n = 208) or Amitiza 24 mcg twice daily (n = 210) for 12 weeks. Study 2 did not exclude patients receiving diphenylheptane opioids (e.g., methadone). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in SBM frequency at Week 8; 3.3 vs. 2.4 for Amitiza and placebo-treated patients, respectively; treatment difference = 0.9; p-value = 0.004. The proportion of patients in Study 2 qualifying as an "overall responder", as prespecified in Study 1, was 24% in the group receiving Amitiza compared to 15% of patients receiving placebo. In the subgroup of patients in Study 2 taking diphenylheptane opioids (baseline mean [median] MEDDs of 691 [403] mg and 672 [450] mg for placebo and Amitiza patients, respectively), the proportion of patients qualifying as an "overall responder" was 20.5% (8/39) in the group receiving Amitiza compared to 6.3% (2/32) of patients receiving placebo. Examination of gender and race subgroups did not identify differences in response to Amitiza among these subgroups. There were too few elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) to adequately assess differences in effects in that population.

### Deprescribing medications among older adults through postacute care… [^116kR93u]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

The intervention group received the Shed-MEDS intervention, which consisted of a pharmacist- or nurse practitioner–led comprehensive medication review, patient or surrogate-approved deprescribing recommendations, and deprescribing actions that were initiated in the hospital and continued throughout the PAC facility stay. The control group received usual care at the hospital and PAC facility. Overall, there was a statistically significant treatment effect, with patients in the intervention group taking a mean of 14% fewer medications at PAC facility discharge and 15% fewer medications at the 90-day follow-up compared with the control group. The intervention additionally reduced patient exposure to potentially inappropriate medications and Drug Burden Index. Adverse drug event rates were similar between the intervention and control groups. Conclusions and Relevance Results of this trial showed that the Shed-MEDS patient-centered deprescribing intervention was safe and effective in reducing the total medication burden at PAC facility discharge and 90 days after discharge. Future studies are needed to examine the effect of this intervention on patient-reported and long-term clinical outcomes. The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a patient-centered deprescribing intervention among hospitalized older adults transitioning or being discharged to a PAC facility. The primary objective of the intervention was to reduce overall medication count at hospital discharge and PAC facility discharge and to assess the maintenance of intervention effects 90 days after PAC facility discharge.

The secondary objective was to identify the intervention effects on the number of potentially inappropriate medications 14–16 and the anticholinergic and sedative drug burden.
17. At the time of trial initiation, we expected to enroll approximately 576 participants across 4 years of enrollment with
27. 5% attrition, or 420 total participants. The pilot intervention was associated with an approximately 50% reduction in the count of total medications from enrollment to hospital discharge, whereas an approximately 25% reduction was observed in the control group under usual hospital care. 19 Using the mixed-effects Poisson regression method, we implemented a simulation-based power analysis assuming that these effects would be attenuated by 20% at PAC facility discharge and again by 20% at the 90-day follow-up.

Adjusting for the total medication count at enrollment, the mean total medication count was similar between intervention and control groups at hospital discharge, but patients in the intervention group had a mean of 14% fewer medications at PAC facility discharge when the intervention ended and a mean of 15% fewer medications 90 days after PAC facility discharge. The magnitude of the overall treatment effect was high across the entire period of observation, with the intervention group having significantly fewer medications compared with the control group.

### Effect of in-hospital multifaceted clinical pharmacist intervention on readmission… [^1153wZSW]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

Trial Protocol Patients invited to participate in the Odense Pharmacist Trial Investigating Medication Interventions at Sector Transfer underwent randomization to usual care vs intervention; those randomized to intervention underwent a second randomization to the basic intervention vs the extended intervention. The primary composite end point included readmission or an emergency department visit within 180 days of study inclusion. The usual care and intervention groups are described in the Pharmacist Intervention subsection of the Methods section. Question Can a multifaceted pharmacist intervention prevent hospital readmissions and emergency department visits.

Findings In a randomized clinical trial of 1467 Danish participants receiving at least 5 medications, a statistically significant reduced rate of readmissions within 30 and 180 days after inclusion was observed in patients randomized to receive an extended pharmacist intervention compared with those who received usual care or a basic pharmacist intervention. Of 1873 patients invited to participate, 1499 accepted. The medication review and patient interview were conducted in the hospital and followed up in collaboration with primary care. Analysis was based on intention to treat. Interventions The patients were randomized into 3 groups receiving usual care, a basic intervention, and an extended intervention.

Main Outcomes and Measures The prespecified primary outcomes were readmission within 30 or 180 days and ED visits within 180 days. The primary composite end point was readmission or an ED visit within 180 days. Secondary outcomes were drug-related readmissions within 30 and 180 days after inclusion, and all-cause mortality and drug-related mortality. The extended intervention had a significant effect on the numbers of patients who were readmitted within 30 days or within 180 days after inclusion and on the number of patients who experienced the primary composite end point. The study showed a nonsignificant reduction in drug-related readmissions within 30 days and within 180 days after inclusion and in deaths.

The number needed to treat to achieve the primary composite outcome for the extended intervention was 12. Conclusions and Relevance A multifaceted clinical pharmacist intervention may reduce the number of ED visits and hospital readmissions. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT03079375. Only 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis, and most of those were small or had short follow-up. The investigators concluded that high-quality trials with long-term follow-up are warranted to provide definitive evidence for the effect of medication reviews. 21 The aim of our large randomized clinical trial was to determine whether an in-hospital multifaceted pharmacist intervention based on medication review, motivational interview, and follow-up with the patient and the ongoing primary care physician can reduce the rate of readmissions. Was the treatment in agreement with current national guidelines regarding dose, choice of drug, and time of treatment.

### Reducing CNS-active medications to prevent falls and injuries among older adults… [^1144fQ8Z]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Does a health system–embedded deprescribing intervention delivered to community-dwelling older adults and their primary care clinicians reduce use of central nervous system –active medications and medically treated falls. Findings In this cluster randomized, parallel-group clinical trial that included 2367 older adults and their primary care clinicians, medically treated falls were not reduced among those who received the intervention compared with usual care. Objective To test the effect of a health system–embedded deprescribing intervention targeting older adults and their primary care clinicians for reducing the use of central nervous system–active drugs and preventing medically treated falls. Design, Setting, and Participants. Intervention Patient education and clinician decision support. Control arm participants received usual care. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was medically treated falls.

Secondary outcomes included medication discontinuation, sustained medication discontinuation, and dose reduction of any and each target medication. Serious adverse drug withdrawal events involving opioids or sedative-hypnotics were the main safety outcome. Analyses were conducted using intent-to-treat analysis. Results Among 2367 patient participants, the adjusted cumulative incidence rate of a first medically treated fall at 18 months was 0. 33 in the intervention group and
0. 30 in the usual care group. There were significant differences favoring the intervention group in discontinuation, sustained discontinuation, and dose reduction of tricyclic antidepressants at 6 months and secondary time points. Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial of a health system–embedded deprescribing intervention targeting community-dwelling older adults prescribed central nervous system–active medications and their primary care clinicians, the intervention was no more effective than usual care in reducing medically treated falls. For health systems that attend to deprescribing as part of routine clinical practice, additional interventions may confer modest benefits on prescribing without a measurable effect on clinical outcomes.

Secondary outcomes assessed changes to target medications at 6, 9, 12, and 15 months of follow-up, including discontinuation, sustained discontinuation, and dose reduction. 22 We considered each target medication separately and summarized across all target medication classes. calculation based on the marginal hazard ratio.

### Effect of medication reconciliation at hospital admission on 30-day returns… [^111oom6C]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Question Is medication reconciliation effective in improving health care outcomes when targeted to patients at increased risk of medication discrepancies and medication-related harms because of older age, polypharmacy, or both conditions. Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 1702 Swiss patients aged 85 years or older, with more than 10 medications at hospital admission, or meeting both conditions, the proportion of patients with unplanned all-cause hospital returns within 30 days after initial discharge did not differ among those who received medication reconciliation at hospital admission vs those who did not. Design, Setting, and Participants This parallel group, open-label randomized controlled trial used centralized randomization to the intervention group or control group. Outcome assessors and data analysts were blinded to group allocation.

Participants included 1702 patients aged 85 years or older, with more than 10 medications at hospital admission, or meeting both conditions at 2 regional secondary teaching hospitals in southern Switzerland. Results Among 1702 patients, 866 patients were allocated to the intervention group and 836 patients to the control group. The primary outcome occurred among 340 participants in the intervention group and 330 participants in the control group. In time-to-event analyses at study closeout, unplanned all-cause hospital visits to the emergency department and unplanned all-cause hospital readmissions occurred similarly in the intervention and control groups.

To date, 1 randomized clinical trial, not yet included in recent systematic reviews or meta-analyses, found that an extended intervention composed of medication review at admission and medication reconciliation at discharge significantly reduced the number of emergency department visits and readmissions within 6 months from discharge compared with usual care at 4 acute admission wards in Denmark. 13 Although the study was adequately powered, with a large sample size, the assessment of the primary composite outcome at 6 months could have been biased by factors unrelated to the targeted intervention on medication use. Considering polypharmacy, older patient age, or both conditions as inclusion criteria, this parallel group RCT aimed to assess the impact of medication reconciliation at hospital admission on a composite postdischarge health care use variable.

This was quantified as the proportion of patients with unplanned all-cause hospital visits within 30 days after initial discharge, a time when patients may still be using the medications they were using at discharge and a reasonable latency period between intervention and assessed outcomes. Eligible patients randomized to the intervention group received medication reconciliation according to 3 steps: At first, the pharmacy assistant compiled an ex novo comprehensive list of the patient's current medications at hospital admission and obtained the BPMH.

### Medication safety after hospitalization in persons prescribed high-risk medications… [^116zF4vh]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Trial protocol Categories of outcome events Data sharing statement Question What is the effect of a clinical pharmacist intervention on medication safety in patients who were recently discharged from the hospital and prescribed high-risk medications. Findings In this randomized clinical trial including 361 participants, more than a quarter of patients experienced adverse drug-related incidents and nearly 1 in 5 experienced clinically important medication errors in the 45-day period following hospital discharge. A reduction in these events that was related to the intervention was not observed. Objective To determine whether a multifaceted clinical pharmacist intervention improves medication safety for patients who are discharged from the hospital and prescribed medications within 1 or more of these high-risk drug classes.

Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized clinical trial was conducted at a large multidisciplinary group practice in Massachusetts and included patients 50 years or older who were discharged from the hospital and prescribed at least 1 high-risk medication. Participants were enrolled into the trial from June 2016 through September 2018. The study assessed 2 outcomes over a 45-day posthospital discharge period: adverse drug-related incidents and a subset defined as clinically important medication errors, which included preventable or ameliorable ADEs and potential ADEs. Clinically important medication errors were the primary study outcome. The intervention did not significantly alter the per-patient rate of adverse drug-related incidents or clinically important medication errors. Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial, there was not an observed lower rate of adverse drug-related incidents or clinically important medication errors during the posthospitalization period that was associated with a clinical pharmacist intervention. However, there were study recruitment challenges and lower than expected numbers of events among the study population. Trial Registration. The National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event Prevention identified 3 high-priority drug classes as key targets for reducing the risk of drug-related injuries: anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and opioids. 5 These medication classes account for the most measurable drug-related harms to patients, and many of the ADEs that are associated with these medications are considered preventable.

6–9 Insulins, opioid-containing analgesics, and warfarin are among the most common medications implicated in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for ADEs, 6, 7 especially among older adults.
8. The primary outcomes of interest were adverse drug-related incidents and clinically important medication errors. To evaluate the effect of the multifaceted intervention, we estimated the mean incidence rates of these outcomes within each group. Time denominators for the incidence rates considered the number of days that participants were available for EHR review and the telephone interview during a maximum of 45 days postdischarge, excluding days after a participant was rehospitalized, died, or disenrolled as a patient cared for by the medical group. We had initially planned to recruit 500 participants.

### Emergency department programs to support medication safety in older adults… [^114hjTVi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 eligible studies with 44 640 participants found that multidisciplinary approaches, including clinical pharmacists and geriatricians, were associated with improved PIM deprescribing among older adults but not with hospital outcomes, while computerized clinical decision support systems, with or without ED clinician education, were associated with enhanced geriatric ordering and prescribing practices by reducing PIMs. However, medication reviews targeting fall risk–increasing drugs were not associated with reduced falls in older adults. Clinical pharmacist review was not associated with decreased hospital admission or length of stay, but 2 studies showed a 32% reduction in PIMs from deprescribing. One study also found that ED geriatrician teleconsultation was associated with enhanced deprescribing of PIMs.

Three clinician educational intervention studies showed a 19% reduction in PIM prescribing. Two computerized CDSS studies showed a 40% reduction in PIM ordering. FRID reviews were not associated with reduced time to first fall or fall recurrence at 12 months. Conclusions and Relevance In this systematic review and meta-analysis of ED-based geriatric medication safety programs, a multidisciplinary team, including clinical pharmacists and/or geriatricians, was associated with improved PIM deprescribing. Furthermore, computerized CDSS, alone or in combination with ED clinician education, was associated with enhanced geriatric ordering and prescribing practices. These findings will inform the Geriatric ED Guidelines version 2. 0 update. pharmacists.

24 Although several studies have evaluated the impact of geriatric medication program interventions to optimize safe medication practices for older adults being treated in the ED, it is unknown how EDs can best facilitate responsible medication management to reduce PIMs and associated ADEs in older adults. 25, 26 The Geriatric ED Guidelines 2. 0 is a multidisciplinary initiative to update the 2014 iteration. As part of this effort, we systematically reviewed the published literature to identify which ED-based geriatric medication programs were associated with reduced PIMs and ADEs. In Clementz et al, 42 pharmacist-led medication review was associated with significantly lower rates of unplanned rehospitalizations.

Two studies41, 44 found pharmacist-performed medication review and reconciliation were associated with significantly reduced PIM use at ED discharge. Atey et al44 found use of at least 1 PIM on ED departure was significantly lower for the intervention group than comparison groups. Similarly, Jovevski et al41 found that case rate of PIM deprescribing in a preintervention group was 11. 1% vs
57. 1% in a postintervention group. Matz et al45 evaluated geriatrician teleconsultation and pharmacological recommendations among 50 ED patients aged 70 years and older with an Identification of Seniors at Risk Score of 2 or greater. 45 There was a higher frequency of recommendations, including drug discontinuation, drug initiation, or dose adjustment, via geriatric telemedicine compared with standard ED treatment.
