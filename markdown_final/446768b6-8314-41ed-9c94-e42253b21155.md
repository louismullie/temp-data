## Question

idsa 2010 guideline on treating simple cystitis with empiric antibiotivs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the IDSA 2010 guideline on empiric antibiotics for acute uncomplicated cystitis, including agents, dosing, duration, the resistance threshold, what to avoid, special populations, stewardship, and how later guidance refined these recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the target population and diagnostic context. Then, I should verify the first-line empiric regimens and exact durations. Next, I will check the 20% resistance threshold and how it applies to TMP-SMX. After that, I need to examine agents to avoid and why. Then, I should consider special populations such as pregnancy, pediatrics, and those with recent antimicrobial exposure. Finally, I will review stewardship principles and reconcile the 2010 recommendations with subsequent updates and contemporary data on concordance and outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. The 2010 IDSA guideline addresses acute uncomplicated cystitis in premenopausal, nonpregnant women without known urologic abnormalities or significant comorbidities, where empiric therapy is appropriate based on typical symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency, with or without a urinalysis, and cultures are not routinely required for uncomplicated presentations unless symptoms persist or recur, which I should explicitly state to avoid overtesting and delays in therapy [^1132XuuX] [^116D2UjH].

> I will now examine the recommended first-line empiric regimens and their durations. Wait, let me verify the exact regimens and durations to avoid errors: nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg orally twice daily for 5 days, TMP-SMX 160/800 mg orally twice daily for 3 days when local resistance is 20% or less, fosfomycin trometamol 3 g orally as a single dose, and pivmecillinam 400 mg orally twice daily for 3–7 days where available; I initially thought fosfomycin might be 3 days, but hold on, I should correct that — the guideline specifies a single 3 g dose, acknowledging somewhat lower efficacy than standard short-course regimens [^117PqarS].

> Next, I should review the 20% resistance threshold and confirm how it applies. The guideline advises against empiric TMP-SMX if local resistance exceeds 20%, which operationalizes a key stewardship principle of avoiding agents with inadequate local activity; this threshold has been widely adopted and is reiterated in subsequent guidance, and I need to ensure prescribers check the local antibiogram before choosing TMP-SMX empirically [^117PqarS] [^111fdQLH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "any beta-lactam" being uniformly excluded. I need to check which agents specifically to avoid and why. The 2010 guideline discourages amoxicillin or ampicillin as empiric therapy due to poor efficacy and high resistance, and it also cautions against beta-lactams in general for initial therapy because of concerns about effectiveness and ecological harm; importantly, if beta-lactams are later found to be inactive and the patient is improving, IDSA AMR guidance allows that no change is necessary for uncomplicated cystitis, which is a practical stewardship nuance I should include to prevent unnecessary switches [^116tgw7z] [^116D2UjH] [^111Hu8AB].

> I should confirm where fluoroquinolones fit. They are not first-line for empiric uncomplicated cystitis in the 2010 guidance due to collateral damage and resistance selection, though they remain active options when first-line agents are unsuitable; this stance was reinforced in later U.S.-focused guidance emphasizing black box warnings and stewardship, even as contemporary emergency department data show high fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli, supporting the conservative approach to empiric fluoroquinolone use for simple cystitis [^111fdQLH] [^112weDQK].

> Let me consider special populations and risk modifiers. In pregnancy, I should avoid TMP-SMX in the first trimester and nitrofurantoin at term; in children older than 2 months with low likelihood of pyelonephritis, shorter courses can be reasonable; in those with recurrent UTI, recent TMP-SMX exposure, or genitourinary abnormalities, the risk of TMP-SMX resistance is higher, so I should preferentially avoid empiric TMP-SMX and consider culture-directed therapy when feasible; I need to ensure these nuances are tied back to resistance risk and patient-specific factors rather than reflex empiricism [^114xyRJP] [^114CVrxj] [^113AvkVo].

> Next, I should review stewardship principles embedded in the 2010 guidance and subsequent updates. The guideline elevates resistance prevalence and ecological "collateral damage" as core decision factors, supports the shortest effective duration, and emphasizes tailoring to local antibiograms; later IDSA AMR guidance further clarifies that if empiric therapy proves inactive but the patient is clinically improving in uncomplicated cystitis, switching or extending is generally unnecessary, which helps avoid overtreatment and unnecessary cultures [^117PqarS] [^111Hu8AB] [^1168JeGi].

> I will now examine how later guidance refined or expanded the 2010 framework. Subsequent IDSA AMR documents reaffirm nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX as preferred for ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis when active, with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, carbapenems, single-dose aminoglycosides, and oral fosfomycin for E. coli as alternatives; they also provide dosing details for single-dose aminoglycosides and clarify that if piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime were started empirically for cystitis and the patient improves, no change is needed despite ESBL status, aligning with the 2010 stewardship ethos while expanding options for resistant organisms [^111DJoMB] [^113gRDTJ] [^111pRb8B].

> But wait, what about real-world adherence and outcomes. I should double-check concordance data. Large U.S. studies show substantial improvement over time, with guideline concordance reaching approximately 91% in the Military Health System and improving from roughly 48% to 65% nationally between 2015 and 2019, though fluoroquinolones remain overused and overtreatment persists; contemporary machine learning analyses also support the robustness of first-line agents like nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX for uncomplicated cystitis in terms of effectiveness and adverse events, reinforcing the 2010 first-line choices when local resistance permits [^116kWawM] [^1153i1uC] [^111ptg8h].

> In summary, I need to ensure the practical takeaway is precise: for acute uncomplicated cystitis in premenopausal, nonpregnant women, use nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, TMP-SMX 160/800 mg twice daily for 3 days only if local resistance is 20% or less, fosfomycin 3 g once, or pivmecillinam 400 mg twice daily for 3–7 days where available; avoid empiric amoxicillin or ampicillin, and reserve fluoroquinolones for alternatives when first-line agents are unsuitable; apply the 20% resistance threshold for TMP-SMX, tailor to patient-specific risk factors, and align with stewardship principles that prioritize narrow agents, short courses, and local antibiograms, with later IDSA guidance offering additional options for resistant organisms while preserving the core 2010 approach [^117PqarS] [^111fdQLH] [^111DJoMB].

---

The IDSA 2010 guideline recommends **nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5 days** [^117PqarS] as the preferred empiric therapy for acute uncomplicated cystitis, with **TMP-SMX 160/800 mg PO BID for 3 days** [^117PqarS] if local resistance is ≤ 20% [^117Lu3fS]. Fosfomycin 3 g PO once [^117PqarS] is an alternative when first-line agents are unsuitable. Fluoroquinolones are **not first-line** due to resistance and collateral damage [^111fdQLH]; beta-lactams (except pivmecillinam) are **not recommended** because of lower efficacy and resistance [^112e6Ry3] [^116D2UjH]. Therapy should be guided by local resistance data and patient factors [^114xyRJP].

## Recommended empiric antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Regimen** | **Recommendation level** |
|-|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | 100 mg PO BID for 5 days | Preferred |
| TMP-SMX | 160/800 mg PO BID for 3 days | Preferred if local resistance ≤ 20% [^117PqarS] |
| Fosfomycin | 3 g PO once | Alternative |
| Pivmecillinam | 400 mg PO BID for 3–7 days | Alternative (where available) [^117PqarS] |

---

## Antibiotics not recommended for empiric therapy

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Not first-line due to resistance and collateral damage [^111fdQLH].
- **Beta-lactams (except pivmecillinam)**: Not recommended due to lower efficacy and resistance [^116D2UjH].
- **Amoxicillin/ampicillin**: Specifically discouraged due to high resistance [^116tgw7z].

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

- **Local resistance patterns**: Empiric TMP-SMX is avoided if local resistance > 20% [^111fdQLH].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Allergies, renal function, pregnancy, and comorbidities [^111xwYMR].
- **Previous antibiotic use**: Recent TMP-SMX use increases resistance risk [^114CVrxj].

---

## Clinical outcomes and resistance patterns

Nitrofurantoin remains highly effective with **low resistance** [^112weDQK], whereas **TMP-SMX** is effective where resistance is ≤ 20% [^117Lu3fS]. Fosfomycin is effective but has somewhat **higher recurrence** than standard regimens [^115mC5vf].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5 days [^117PqarS].
- **Alternative**: TMP-SMX 160/800 mg PO BID for 3 days if resistance ≤ 20% [^117PqarS].
- **Other options**: Fosfomycin 3 g PO once or pivmecillinam 400 mg PO BID for 3–7 days [^117PqarS].
- **Avoid**: Fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams (except pivmecillinam) [^111fdQLH] [^116D2UjH] [^117PqarS].

---

The IDSA 2010 guideline emphasizes **short-course, narrow-spectrum agents** [^1132XuuX] with low resistance and minimal collateral damage, tailored to local resistance and patient factors.

Key Points

Question

What are the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline concordance rates in the treatment of uncomplicated acute cystitis with antibiotics, and are there differences in IDSA guideline-concordance rates among various specialties?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 46 793 adult women in the US Military Health System, the IDSA guideline-concordance rate was 91%. The specialty fields of internal medicine, family medicine, primary care, surgery, and emergency medicine had higher IDSA concordance rates; urology as well as obstetrics and gynecology had lower IDSA concordance rates.

Meaning

In this study, IDSA concordance rates for uncomplicated cystitis were found to be higher than what has been previously reported with substantial variation among different specialties.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^115mC5vf]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis — aminoglycoside and fosfomycin considerations are as follows: Treatment with a single IV dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative treatment option for uncomplicated ESBL-E cystitis, and a single IV dose is generally effective for uncomplicated cystitis, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical trial data are lacking. Susceptibility of E. coli to fosfomycin is not routinely tested by most clinical microbiology laboratories but E. coli resistance to fosfomycin remains rare in the United States, and among gram-negative species, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints are only available for E. coli for fosfomycin. Fosfomycin is not suggested for the treatment of infections caused by K. pneumoniae and several other gram-negative organisms, which frequently carry fosA hydrolase genes that may lead to clinical failure. A randomized open-label trial indicated that a single dose of oral fosfomycin is associated with higher clinical failure than a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated cystitis, and although this trial was not limited to E. coli cystitis, in a subgroup analysis exclusively of E. coli infections, outcomes remained poor in the fosfomycin group.

IDSA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to patients with antimicrobial-resistant UTI, IDSA 2022 guidelines recommend to administer standard infusion meropenem as the preferred treatment option in patients with cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales resistant to ertapenem (ertapenem MICs ≥ 2 mcg/mL) but susceptible to meropenem (meropenem MICs ≤ 1 mcg/mL), when carbapenemase testing results are either not available or negative.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117RCSCu]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111fdQLH]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Acute cystitis first-line selection and safety — when antimicrobial therapies for UTI are compared by clinical and/or bacteriological cure there is relatively little to distinguish agents, so the IDSA Guideline emphasizes in vitro resistance prevalence and ecological adverse effects as key considerations; fluoroquinolones are not among the suggested first-line agents in the United States, the three first-line agents available are nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX, and fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin shows exceptional durability against emergence of resistance, TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric use where local resistance rates exceed 20%, and with the exception of fosfomycin, single dose antibiotics should not be used in patients with UTI; fluoroquinolone agents have potential adverse side effects including QTc prolongation, tendon rupture, and increased risk of aortic rupture leading to FDA black box warnings.

Box 1
Audit and feedback script (example)

Table 2
List of activities at intervention and control sites

The audit and feedback component of the intervention (based on feedback intervention theory)was a highly personalised, interactive, one-on-one intervention with primary care providers to improve their capacity to distinguish between uncomplicated cystitis and other UTI syndromes and to encourage them to prescribe a guideline-concordant antibiotic regimen. We also included information about first-line antibiotics recommended by the IDSA guidelines and AAFP and determined whether the antibiotic regimen prescribed by the providers was in accordance with the guidelines (box 1).

In the intervention period, we distributed guidelines at both sites (intervention and control). Distributing the guidelines addressed awareness, but we did not expect guideline dissemination alone to be an effective method to achieve behaviour change. At the intervention site, we also conducted a training session to help providers engage with and internalise guidelines content. Our educational session provided a detailed overview of the IDSA treatment guidelines; definitions for various UTI syndromes, including uncomplicated versus complicated UTI, and actual clinical examples. During our training session, we also taught the providers how to use the decision aid (figure 2). The investigators selected actual cases of UTI seen in the clinics to design both teaching cases to address the specific clinical scenarios that were problematic for the interview participants.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Acute, uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. Quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts to optimize cystitis management rely on clinicians managing patients in a manner recommended by experts and guidelines. However, it is unclear if recent recommendations for cystitis from experts and guidelines from US medical societies that provide recommendations are well aligned.

Methods

We examined recommendations and guidelines for acute, symptomatic cystitis in women published in US medical societies' journals from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2016, within the fields of family medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, internal medicine, female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery, and infectious diseases.

Results

All recommendations endorsed the use of symptoms and urine dipstick to diagnose cystitis. Some societies did not recommend urine dipstick in patients with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), classic UTI symptoms, or a lack of underlying conditions or competing diagnoses. All endorsed nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line agents. Some guidelines classified fluoroquinolones as second- or third-line, while others considered them first-line treatment for UTI. Avoiding use of amoxicillin and ampicillin, antibiotic agents with high prevalence of resistance in the US, was recommended by some societies.

Conclusions

US recommendations differed in their approach to the treatment of acute, uncomplicated cystitis. Lack of uniformity likely contributes to clinical management variance for patients with UTI and hampers quality improvement and antibiotic stewardship efforts aimed at promoting optimal management. Our findings emphasize the need for more consistent recommendations for cystitis management.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-Negative infections [^112CsNzk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, carbapenem-resistant, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to administer nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as preferred options for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, although the likelihood of susceptibility to any of these agents is low. Administer a single dose of an aminoglycoside, oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only), colistin, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, or cefiderocol as alternative options.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^113wUHSC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most commonly diagnosed outpatient infection. In the US, more than 7 million people are referred to physicians for UTIs each year, and UTIs account for approximately 15% of all antibiotic prescriptions, with an annual cost to the US health care system of approximately $1.6 billion.

In 2011, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) updated their international clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in premenopausal women due to the increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance. For the optimal treatment of uncomplicated cystitis, the IDSA recommends nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin trometamol, and pivmecillinam as first-line therapy. Despite clear IDSA guidelines, practice patterns vary widely with numerous studies showing substantial discrepancies between clinical practice guidelines and antibiotic prescribing practices. A recent studyreported that the rate of IDSA antibiotic guideline concordance (hereinafter, guideline concordance) for UTIs ranged from 58.4% to 64.6%, and several studies, have shown that obstetricians and gynecologists are more likely to prescribe a first-line antibiotic compared with other clinicians in other specialties.

Antibiotic treatments for UTIs have been evaluated in a variety of different health care settings, but, to our knowledge, treatment patterns have not yet been studied in the Military Health System (MHS). The MHS provides health care to 9.6 million beneficiaries including active-duty personnel, retirees, and their dependents through the Department of Defense health insurance known as TRICARE. The MHS delivers care in 2 distinct settings: direct care through more than 350 military health facilities and via the US private sector care through civilian fee-for-service facilities. The ability to compare direct care and private sector care is a unique aspect of the MHS. Evaluating antibiotic prescribing patterns for uncomplicated UTIs in this universally insured population may help provide valuable insights on antibiotic treatment patterns in an optimal care environment. In addition, the Department of Defense formally chartered an antibiotic stewardship program in 2017, which has been implemented across the MHS; however, currently there is no specific requirement that hospitals have a specific outpatient or UTI protocol. Thus, the existence of any of these types of antibiotic stewardship programs varies across the MHS.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "Urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics (guidance for selection), IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider guiding the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected complicated UTI, including pyelonephritis, by the severity of illness, specifically whether the patient is in sepsis.
Use the Sepsis-3 definition, which defines sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Identify patients by an increase in the SOFA score of ≥ 2 points, indicating an in-hospital mortality risk > 10%, or presumptively identify using screening tools such as qSOFA or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognised threat to global health, with the United States alone accounting for 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections and 35 000 deaths each year. Increasing realisation of the need to minimise this public health threat can be seen in the efforts of regulatory bodies such as the Joint Commission, which recently established requirements for antimicrobial stewardship for ambulatory healthcare organisations, effective at the beginning of 2020. The new requirements mandate that such organisations provide resources to practitioners to promote appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices.

Although most studies of outpatients have focused on implementing antibiotic stewardship for upper respiratory infections, there is also a high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in primary care, including overuse of fluoroquinolones and longer duration of treatment than recommended by guidelines. A study in France found that only 20% of outpatient UTIs were treated with the guidelines-recommended drug, dose and duration. An Irish study found that only 55% of the antibiotic prescriptions for UTI in general practice were appropriate. Of 7738 outpatient encounters for UTI in Israel, 91% were treated with a longer duration of antibiotics than recommended by guidelines. A recent US study revealed that fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI, comprising up to 49% of prescriptions. Inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones is especially concerning because it promotes the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain sequence type 131. In addition, continued overprescribing of fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis in patients with other treatment options is occurring in the United Statesdespite two black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fluoroquinolones due to an association between their use and serious side effects. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with more central nervous system-related and gastrointestinal-related adverse events compared with other types of antimicrobials in a recent meta-analysis. Excessive treatment duration for uncomplicated cystitis is another common problem documented internationally. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelinesrecommend nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 3 days and a single dose of fosfomycin as the first-line regimens for uncomplicated cystitis. In our previous study in the same setting, most prescriptions for trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones had a treatment duration longer than recommended.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113JiPeu]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Unlike upper respiratory infections, which typically involve viral infections for which antibiotics are not indicated, a symptomatic UTI merits treatment with antibiotics, as recommended by the IDSA guidelines. Thus, the focus in implementing antibiotic stewardship for UTI needs to be optimisation of antibiotic choice and duration, which may present a different cognitive challenge for practitioners than deciding whether a patient needs antibiotics or not. One evidence-based strategy shown to be effective in implementing an antimicrobial stewardship for UTI in acute and long-term care settings is audit and feedback. Multiple strategies have been employed for implementing stewardship such as feedback to prescribers on antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial stewardship committee. Based on our prior successful experience with audit and feedback in acute and long-term care, we implemented a multifaceted antimicrobial stewardship intervention using audit and feedback to improve compliance with acute cystitis guidelines in a family medicine setting (general practice). The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted stewardship intervention on adherence to the evidence-based practice guidelines on treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in primary care. We hypothesised that our intervention would increase guideline adherence in terms of antibiotic choice and duration of treatment.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the IDSA guideline-concordance rate for adult women with uncomplicated UTIs in the MHS treated with antibiotics. Secondary objectives were to evaluate differences in IDSA guideline concordance rates between different clinician categories (physicians, physicians assistants and nurse practitioners, and other), specialties (general clinician, family medicine, internal medicine, primary care, emergency medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, urology, and other), and care settings (direct care and private sector care), and assess antibiotic overtreatment rates for uncomplicated UTIs.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113xzz7J]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this difference-in-differences study, we implemented a multifaceted stewardship intervention that targeted inappropriate antibiotic choice and duration of treatment. An increased proportion of guideline-adherent prescriptions was observed in the intervention period of both intervention and control sites. However, in the difference-in-differences analysis, the intervention site had a significantly larger increase in adherence than the control site.

The audit and feedback stewardship intervention was successful for UTI treatment in emergency departmentsand acuteand long-term care. In this study, we applied the audit and feedback intervention to primary care settings, where antibiotic stewardship is urgently needed. Our intervention was based on a treatment algorithm derived from the IDSA guidelines and AAFP recommendations on management of uncomplicated UTI. Our qualitative study showed that differentiating uncomplicated cystitis from other UTI syndromes is a challenge for providers; therefore, providing a set of diagnostic criteria for uncomplicated cystitis was important. This treatment algorithm describes steps that providers should take when encountered with a patient with UTI-relevant symptoms. We used this algorithm as a starting point to provide personalised, interactive, one-on-one feedback with providers to improve their capacity to distinguish between uncomplicated and complicated UTI and treat UTI appropriately. The content was individualised for each recipient, and specific information about the correct solution was included to maximise feedback effectiveness. Besides improvements in the clinical outcomes, we also observed that the intervention was received positively by feedback recipients.

### High prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant UTI among US emergency department patients diagnosed with urinary tract infection, 2018–2020 [^112weDQK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study of contemporary patients from 15 centers across the US found that the prevalence of FQ‐resistant E. coli exceeded 15% at 14 of the 15 sites and was > 20% at 7 of the 15 sites signifying that geographic variation exists in E. coli FQ‐resistance. Patients presenting with a complicated UTI had E. coli FQ resistance prevalences that exceeded 50% at many sites, whereas those with uncomplicated pyelonephritis and cystitis had resistance prevalences being 29.3% and 29.9% for pyelonephritis and cystitis, respectively. Previous studies have shown that prevalence of E. coli resistance to FQs has been increasing over the past two decades. In an analysis of over 12 million urine specimens, E. coli resistance to FQs was reported to be 3% in 2000 but increased to 17.1% in 2010. A study enrolling participants from 2013 to 2014 evaluated the prevalence of FQ‐resistant E. coli in patients presenting to the ED with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis and found that 19.9% of isolates were resistant. The combined E. coli FQ‐resistance rate at all sites in this study was 22.1% (range 10.5%–29.7% by site) demonstrating that resistance continues to increase across the US.

The most recent IDSA guidelines (published > 10 years ago) for the treatment of uncomplicated pyelonephritis recommend empiric FQ treatment unless the local prevalence of E coli resistance is greater than 10%, in which case, an initial parenteral antibiotic (e.g. ceftriaxone, consolidated 24‐hour dose of an aminoglycoside) dose is recommended to be administered before the patient is discharged home. All 15 sites in our study reported E. coli FQ‐resistance > 10%, suggesting that empiric antimicrobial regimens should be modified for patients with pyelonephritis. For uncomplicated cystitis, FQ‐resistant was reported in 29.9% of all of E. coli isolates. Fortunately, current guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin as first‐line treatment for uncomplicated cystitis as resistance rates have remained low. In the total cohort, we found E. coli resistance to nitrofurantoin was 2%, with it being slightly lower at 1.9% in patients with uncomplicated cystitis suggesting that nitrofurantoin remains a viable treatment option for uncomplicated cystitis.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^113zoJEq]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). In patients with rUTIs experiencing acute cystitis episodes associated with urine cultures resistant to oral antibiotics, clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion).

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^114AqSwd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This document seeks to establish guidance for the evaluation and management of women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTI) to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotic use, provide guidance on antibiotic and non-antibiotic strategies for prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and quality of life by reducing recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) events.

Materials and Methods

The systematic review utilized to inform this guideline was conducted by a methodology team at the Pacific Northwest Evidence-based Practice Center. A research librarian conducted searches in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to January Week 1 2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through December 2017) and Embase (through January 16, 2018). An update literature search was conducted on September 20, 2018.

Results

When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such evidence-based statements are provided as Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Conclusions

Our ability to diagnose, treat, and manage rUTI long-term has evolved due to additional insights into the pathophysiology of rUTI, a new appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobial therapy, rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and better reporting of the natural history and clinical outcomes of acute cystitis and rUTI. As new data continue to emerge in this space, this document will undergo review to ensure continued accuracy.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^1132Z6kn]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Our perceptions of recurrent UTI (rUTI) have evolved due to additional insights into rUTI pathophysiology, an appreciation for the adverse effects of repetitive antimicrobials ("collateral damage"), rising rates of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, and better reporting of the natural history of localized cystitis and rUTI. This document seeks to guide the evaluation and management of patients with rUTIs to prevent inappropriate antibiotic use, decrease the risk of antibiotic resistance, reduce adverse effects of antibiotics, provide guidance on strategies for rUTI prevention, and improve outcomes and quality of life for women with rUTIs.

Materials and Methods

In 2024, this Guideline was reviewed via the AUA Update Literature Review process, which identified 87 studies for full-text review published between June 1, 2021 and November 1, 2024. Of those 87 studies, 14 met inclusion criteria for review. The subsequent amendment is based on data released since the last review of this Guideline in 2021.

Results

The Panel developed evidence- and consensus-based statements based on an updated review to provide guidance on evaluation and management of rUTI in women. These updates are detailed herein.

Conclusions

This update provides several new insights, including expansion of non-antibiotic options for UTI prophylaxis, greater understanding of the value of a negative urinalysis in ruling out UTI, and a paradigm shift away from microbial detection to reliance on clinician judgement when weighing the individual risks and benefits of antibiosis. This Guideline will require further review as the diagnostic and treatment options in this space continue to evolve.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^115aTV7z]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

From April 2018 to February 2019, we performed an audit and feedback intervention, in which charts of women meeting study eligibility, as described in figure 1, were reviewed.

All cases of acute cystitis during the second phase of the study in the intervention clinic triggered a chart review. The patient's EMR was reviewed to determine the type of antibiotic prescribed and the duration of treatment. Appropriateness of the treatment was determined by the research team (LG, GG, MG and BT), using the IDSA guidelines. Our team included two infectious diseases doctors, an infectious diseases epidemiologist and a primary care research fellow. We randomly selected one case per provider per month to reduce the burden on providers, and the research team contacted each provider in person or by phone to provide follow-up as to whether the treatment decision was in compliance with IDSA guidelines. We built the script for our audit–feedback intervention using our previously published script used in acute and long-term care settings. The feedback was given to providers in person or by phone by the principal investigator (LG) within 5–7 days of the patient visit through postprescription antimicrobial review, using the algorithm. Feedback was given in both scenarios — when the prescribing was in accordance with the guidelines and when antibiotic choice and/or duration was not in accordance with the guidelines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) — agents with expected activity and alternatives — includes nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, which all achieve high concentrations in urine and are expected to be effective for uncomplicated CRE cystitis if the isolate is susceptible. A single dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative option; oral fosfomycin is an alternative for uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli, including if carbapenem resistant; and colistin is an alternative agent that converts to its active form in the urinary tract. Treatment suggestions for CRE infections listed below assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) uncomplicated cystitis — amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and doxycycline guidance is as follows: Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is not suggested for the treatment of ESBL-E cystitis, with a randomized trial comparing a 3-day amoxicillin-clavulanic regimen (500 mg/125 mg twice daily) to ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily) in 370 women showing clinical cure in 58% versus 77% and higher persistent vaginal bacterial colonization in 45% versus 10%; the proportion infected with ESBL-E strains was not available and both agents were administered at dosages lower than generally suggested. The panel suggests against the use of doxycycline for ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis, citing limited urinary excretion (35%–60%) and lack of convincing data for clinical effectiveness.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^114UPXv9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

IDSA treatment guidelines for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis recommend that, if the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate is > 10%, then in addition to a fluoroquinolone, an agent of another class (i.e. ceftriaxone or gentamicin) should be administered. Our findings indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates for E. coli are approaching or exceed this threshold for patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis in many parts of the United States. For uncomplicated cystitis, the guidelines recommend alternative agents if the resistance rate is > 20%, which is the current situation for fluoroquinolones in many settings for patients with complicated pyelonephritis. Unfortunately, we found that only one half to two thirds of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone or gentamicin. Rates of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli infections correlate to geographic location. Prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs or a healthcare setting, travel outside the United States, and a history of an antimicrobial drug–resistant infection substantially increases the chance that a person will have a current fluoroquinolone-resistant or ESBL-producing E. coli infection. Therefore, in settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance rates, in settings where ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections have emerged, or among persons with antimicrobial drug resistance risk factors (especially patients with or at risk for severe sepsis), healthcare providers should consider empirical treatment with a carbapenem or another agent found to be consistently active on the basis of the local antibiogram. In this study, ≈50% of patients with pyelonephritis were managed as outpatients. Currently, no oral antimicrobial drugs with consistent in vitro activity are available for empirical treatment of pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing E. coli uropathogens. Our findings, including the variability in the prevalence of resistance by site, show that increased local efforts to enhance surveillance for antimicrobial drug resistance are necessary to best inform treatment decisions. Furthermore, availability of new antimicrobial drugs must be expedited.

### Risk factors for empiric treatment failure in US female outpatients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection: an observational study [^114RdYkp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

More than half of females experience ≥ 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and uncomplicated UTIs (uUTI) are among the most frequently occurring infections in the United States (US). The annual incidence of uUTIs is upwards of 1,500 cases per 100,000 females aged ≥ 15 years.UTIs are often treated empirically, which may lead to suboptimal outcomes, including increased risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and treatment failure (TF), when inappropriate antibiotics are prescribed. – In the US, 0.3–17% of patients with uUTIs experience TF,– with varying incidence largely driven by TF definition heterogeneity. Incidence rates approaching 20% are notable as TF is associated with increased levels of UTI-related burden, including greater activity impairment and higher direct and indirect healthcare resource use. – Patients with uUTI who experience antibiotic TF cost $570 more on average in outpatient visit expenditures compared to those without TF.

To date, there is a dearth of research assessing risk factors for antibiotic TF in uUTI. In one randomized clinical trial (RCT), treatment with fosfomycin and age ≥ 52 years were associated with clinical failure, with the latter characteristic also associated with microbiological failure. An enhanced understanding of risk factors for TF could help optimize empiric antibiotic prescribing in uUTI and reduce the burden associated with TF. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for empiric treatment in uUTI recommend considering community-level thresholds of AMR when antibiogram data are available. However, these data are often unavailable as urine culture collection is not standardized across clinics or recommended by guidelines for most cases of uUTI. Therefore, identification of risk factors of TF that can be readily assessed in clinical practice is imperative to help inform empiric antibiotic prescribing.

To advance the understanding of TF in uUTI, this study assessed the incidence of TF to empirically prescribed oral antibiotics and identified risk factors for TF in female outpatients with uUTI in the US.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^111opq5j]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic stewardship and culture-directed management emphasizes that culture-directed, not empiric, therapies are associated with fewer UTI-related hospitalizations and lower rates of intravenous antibiotic use, and that obtaining cultures for each symptomatic episode is associated with reduced rates of overtreatment and more appropriate antibiotic selection. The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, risk of continued rUTIs as well as progression to later pyelonephritis is enhanced by unnecessary antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria without any demonstrable benefit, and collateral damage from antimicrobial therapy includes alterations of the normal gut microbiome and promotion of multidrug resistant organisms. Escherichia coli isolates continue to demonstrate high in vitro susceptibility to nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, and mecillinam, with these agents having minimal effects on the normal fecal microbiota, whereas TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones promote increased rates of antimicrobial resistance. Continued intermittent courses of antibiotics in rUTI patients are associated with significant adverse events, particularly in older adults, and thus substantial effort should be made to avoid unnecessary treatment unless there is a high suspicion of an acute cystitis episode. In asymptomatic women with a history of rUTIs, a placebo-controlled trial found those treated for ASB were more likely to have additional symptomatic cystitis episodes in a year of follow-up than those randomized to placebo, and over two years of follow up, treatment aimed at eradicating residual bacteriuria was associated with a higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance, a higher incidence of pyelonephritis, and a poorer quality of life compared to non-treatment.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^115PjHJn]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The overall IDSA guideline-concordance rate for uncomplicated UTIs among adult women between 18 to 50 years of age within the MHS is high at 91.0%, with higher rates observed in direct care compared with private sector care. Despite this high IDSA guideline-concordance rate, there is variability among specialties with lower IDSA guideline-concordance rates observed in urology and obstetrics and gynecology compared with other specialties. Of the 9% discordance rate, the antibiotic overtreatment rate was 5.9%, with higher rates of overtreatment in emergency medicine and family medicine.

The MHS IDSA guideline-concordance rate of 91% encompasses both direct care and private sector care and is substantially higher than what has been previously reported in the literature. Even the MHS IDSA guideline-concordance rate among private sector care was substantially higher than previous studies at 89.0%. A prior study reported IDSA guideline-concordance rates of up to 64%, but this study included women up to 75 years of age and was a retrospective observational secondary analysis of the National Disease and Therapeutic Index, which used a sample of 4800 office-based physicians to calculate national projections. Our study used health care data directly from the MDR, and we used strict exclusion criteria to best match the patient population described in the IDSA guidelines, which may have been a factor in the higher IDSA guideline-concordance rates. In addition, the IDSA clinical practice guidelines were published in 2011, a time frame that has given clinicians at least 7 years to learn and implement the IDSA guidelines. It is less clear why the IDSA guideline-concordance rate was substantially higher in direct care. One factor could be that the military health system uses 1 universal medical record system, whereas the electronic medical record may be more fragmented among various facilities in the private sector. Despite a universally insured patient population, the concordance rates were higher in direct care, suggesting that there may be underlying differences with prescribing choices between these 2 care settings. It raises the question as to whether universal health care may be associated with greater adherence to clinical practice guidelines.

### Case-based audit and feedback around a decision aid improved antibiotic choice and duration for uncomplicated cystitis in primary care clinics [^113CXAyP]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcome measure

The outcome of this study was in adherence to the IDSA guidelines for managing uncomplicated cystitis, both to medication choice and duration of therapy (figure 2). For example, prescribing a guideline-adherent antibiotic (nitrofurantoin) for excessive duration (7 days) would be counted as non-adherent. Likewise, prescribing ciprofloxacin (a non-first-line antibiotic choice) for the correct duration (3 days) would be counted as non-adherent. Prescribing a first-line agent (trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole) for the correct duration (3 days) would be counted as compliant. Likewise, prescribing nitrofurantoin for 5 days or a single dose of fosfomycin would be counted as compliant.

Intervention development

All activities in the intervention and control sites during the study period are described in table 2. In the first study period, we validated our electronic algorithmand obtained baseline data on the outcome. In the second study period, we interviewed providers to explore their prescribing decisions for UTI to help us understand why they were choosing certain drugs or durations of treatment. The findings from these interviews, published elsewhere, were used to develop educational materials (interactive case-based lecture) for the intervention. For example, we found that providers were misled by advanced patient age, diabetes and recurrent UTI to make inappropriate choices for acute cystitis. We therefore focused our teaching cases on these points, presenting actual cases of patients who had visited one of the clinics in the previous 2 months. Baseline period activities also included the development and validation of a search algorithm for identifying visits with UTI, as well as piloting of our decision aid (pocket card) (figure 2), and the audit and feedback intervention and script (box 1). We revised the existing audit and feedback script that we used in our previous successful intervention studyin acute and long-term care to be used in the primary care setting.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^11389yui]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

Uncomplicated cystitis caused by DTR P. aeruginosa — preferred and alternative treatments — lists ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, and cefiderocol as the preferred treatment options, while tobramycin or amikacin (as a single dose) and colistin are alternative options. Preferred agents are based on clinical trials showing non-inferiority, and data are insufficient to favor 1 of these agents over others for uncomplicated cystitis because available trials generally do not include patients infected by pathogens with DTR phenotypes. A single dose of tobramycin or amikacin is an alternative option, and a single IV dose of tobramycin or amikacin are likely effective for uncomplicated cystitis as aminoglycosides are nearly exclusively eliminated by the renal route in their active form, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical data are lacking.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — acute cystitis with cultures resistant to oral antibiotics: clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion). Many such infections will be caused by organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and generally are susceptible only to carbapenems; before considering that these infections require intravenous antimicrobials, clinicians should consider fosfomycin susceptibility testing because many multidrug-resistant uropathogens, including ESBL-producing bacteria, retain susceptibility to fosfomycin and/or nitrofurantoin, and consultation with an infectious diseases specialist may be appropriate.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^116BWWsy]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli, the predominant cause of community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) worldwide, is increasingly resistant to available antimicrobial drugs. In the United States, in vitro resistance of E. coli to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) became prevalent in the 1990s. Over the past decade, fluoroquinolone resistance rates have increased to > 10% in some surveys.

In many parts of the world, E. coli fluoroquinolone resistance rates are > 20% among patients with community-acquired uncomplicated UTI and > 50% among patients with complicated infections. In addition, infections resulting from extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae are becoming increasingly common in these same areas and are associated with sequence type (ST) 131, a globally disseminated, multidrug-resistant clone that frequently produces CTX-M-15 ESBL. These E. coli isolates are generally resistant to cephalosporins and often to other antimicrobial drug classes. In North America, ESBL-producing E. coli infections have occurred predominantly in patients with healthcare exposure and have not become prevalent as a cause of community-acquired infections.

The 2010 international treatment guidelines of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommend for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis a fluoroquinolone and an initial dose of an agent from another antimicrobial drug class (e.g. ceftriaxone or gentamicin) if the fluoroquinolone resistance rate is > 10%. For uncomplicated cystitis, the guidelines discourage use of an antimicrobial drug if its resistance rate is > 20%. The guidelines do not address a scenario in which ESBL-producing uropathogens have become prevalent among patients with community-acquired infections. Use of antimicrobial drugs for which the uropathogen shows in vitro resistance has been associated with substantially reduced response rates, which can lead to serious consequences, particularly for patients with pyelonephritis. Given rapid changes in global resistance patterns and a lack of recent active and prospective surveillance of community-acquired UTI in the United States, the extent to which the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance has increased and multidrug-resistant ESBL-producing strains have emerged in the community is unknown.

We sought to determine the prevalence of E. coli antimicrobial resistance among patients with acute pyelonephritis who sought care at a US emergency department (ED)–based sentinel research network. We focused on fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing isolates from these patients and examined risk factors for antimicrobial drug resistance.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections — piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### State-of-the-art review: recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1175RXfj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Over 50% of adult women experience at least 1 urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, and almost one-quarter of them will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI). Recurrent UTI is defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in a 6-month period or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months (at least 1 of these episodes should be culture-proven to confirm infectious etiology). In this narrative review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment considerations for recurrent uncomplicated cystitis in the adult female population. We provide a focused overview of the comprehensive management of these patients, with input from infectious disease physicians, urogynecologists, and urologists with expertise in rUTI, highlighting updated recommendations by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, American Urologic Association, Canadian Urologic Association, and American Urogynecologic Society. Finally, given the variety of prevention strategies, different treatment goals, and the need for "preference sensitive" decisions, we highlight the need for shared decision-making with patients.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^111wAxYy]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The rate of antibiotic overtreatment was 5.9% with higher rates in emergency medicine, family medicine, and other. Although obstetrics and gynecology and urology had lower overall rates of IDSA guideline concordance, they also had lower rates of antibiotic overtreatment in comparison with other specialties. In comparison with private sector care, rates of antibiotic overtreatment were higher in direct care facilities. It has previously been speculated that better insurance coverage may be associated with more expensive overtreatment for UTIs owing to fewer restrictions on prescribing choices. Another factor associated with antibiotic overtreatment seen in direct care may be that military clinicians may not encounter as many barriers regarding insurance coverage for antibiotic prescriptions as frequently as private sector clinicians, so they may be more prone to overtreatment. Although overtreatment rates were higher in direct care compared with private sector care, the overall IDSA guideline-concordance rate was substantially higher in direct care.

Antimicrobial stewardship and the consideration of collateral damage in recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) highlight rising resistance and drug-specific risks, noting, "In the past 20 years, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens has increased dramatically". The text states, "Fluoroquinolones have been linked to infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus and increasing fluoroquinolone resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), while broad spectrum cephalosporins have been linked to subsequent infections with vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, ESBL–producing K. pneumoniae, β-lactam resistant Acinetobacter species, and Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile)". Stewardship adherence "may significantly mitigate increasing fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance", yet "Non-adherence to Guidelines for the treatment of acute cystitis, however, is more common in patients who have rUTIs than patients with an isolated episode of acute cystitis". Practices such as "lengthening the antimicrobial course, broadening antibiotic treatment, or increasing antibiotic doses" lack evidence and "have not been demonstrated to be efficacious and have the potential for harm", and "Providers should combine knowledge of the local antibiogram with the selection of antimicrobial agents with the least impact on normal vaginal and fecal flora", with an antibiogram described as providing "a profile of the local results of antimicrobial sensitivity testing", and aggregate results "usually annually, providing the percentage of a given organism sensitive to a particular antimicrobial".

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112e6Ry3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Up to 50% of women will experience a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, making it the third most common indication for antibiotic treatment in the US after respiratory tract infection and skin and soft-tissue infections. Treatment guidelines published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2011 encouraged the use of nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fosfomycin as first-line treatments for uncomplicated UTI on the basis of their effectiveness and relatively limited adverse event profile. Fluoroquinolones are listed as an alternative option because of their predilection for selecting for multidrug-resistant organismsand their association with serious adverse events, including Clostridium difficile colitis. Despite this, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are still the most commonly used antibiotics in the treatment of UTI, which may reflect the real or perceived threat of antibiotic resistance to the first-line agents. The guidelines list β-lactams as an inferior alternative because they are associated with reduced treatment effectiveness.

The evidence supporting the IDSA treatment guidelines is based on a small number of randomized clinical trials and observational studies, many of which were completed several decades ago. Although those studies provided important information for policymaking, they were limited in terms of the diversity of patients they recruited and were performed at a time when standards of care and health care–seeking behavior differed greatly from current practice. Furthermore, the pathogen strains in circulation at the time of these studies have likely been replaced by new strains that may have a differential response to drug therapies, regardless of their susceptibility phenotype. Therefore, a re-evaluation of management strategies for uncomplicated UTI could provide useful information for treating clinicians and policymakers. In this study, we sought to estimate treatment effectiveness and adverse events for guideline-concordant and guideline-discordant treatments for UTI using causal inference supported by machine learning applied to a large contemporary claims dataset.

### Use of machine learning to assess the management of uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^111ptg8h]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study, using a large, contemporary clinical dataset, we demonstrate that IDSA guidelines for treatment of uncomplicated UTI remain robust in terms of both effectiveness and adverse events, despite major changes in the epidemiology of antibiotic resistance. Unless a patient has a history of drug resistance or intolerance or lives in a region where local rates of resistance are high, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole remain the treatments of choice. We replicated our domain expert–derived results with an automated feature building package applied to a common data model, thereby supporting the hypothesis that complex causal inference analyses combined with careful cohort selection can be semiautomatable. This will help promote reproducibility of our findings in other health systems and opens inquiry into other important clinical questions.

We observed a small increase in rates of revisits for patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy compared with those receiving first-line antibiotics. This result is surprising because fluoroquinolones are thought to be equivalent or superior to nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in terms of clinical effectiveness. The differences were limited to outpatients with a diagnosis of lower UTI and were much less pronounced for inpatients, suggesting that the benefit of first-line treatments is restricted to classic presentations of uncomplicated UTI. Follow-up visits soon after treatment may be the result of drug intolerance, toxic effects, or selection of a drug to which an organism is resistant. The latter may be a possible explanation for why people treated with nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had fewer revisits. Recent workhas suggested that rates of resistance to nitrofurantoin remain low, despite its widespread use, and may be due to a high barrier to resistance. Although resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is more common, clinicians are less likely to use this drug on the basis of IDSA guidancethat recommends avoiding it when rates of local resistance exceed 20%, which is a common scenario throughout the US. In contrast, resistance to fluoroquinolones is most often mediated by the accumulation of variants in a single gene, often in response to antibiotic exposure. Given the high rate of fluoroquinolone prescription in the community, this may increase the risk for prescribing an agent to which the organism is resistant. This is further complicated by the fact that uncomplicated UTI is often managed over telephone and without culture data. Finally, given that prescribers are prone to prescribe the same antibiotic, the impact of prior exposure may be more likely to lead to selection of resistance if that antibiotic is a fluoroquinolone and the patients are otherwise healthy outpatients with a low risk for colonization by drug-resistant organisms.

### New paradigms in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^111zyDyd]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a large burden on the healthcare system. Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise.

Summary

The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns and guideline concordance for uncomplicated urinary tract infections among adult women in the US military health system [^116kWawM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most commonly diagnosed infections, and prior studies have reported discordance in antibiotic treatment with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.

Objective

To assess IDSA guideline concordance rates for women with uncomplicated UTIs treated with antibiotics, and compare concordance rates between different specialty field.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective cross-sectional study of health care claims data from the US Military Health System Data Repository, which contains comprehensive health care encounter and claims data for all military beneficiaries. Participants were adult women between the ages of 18 to 50 years with uncomplicated UTIs from October 1, 2017, to September 30, 2019. Data extraction and analysis were performed in 2022. Patients with diagnosis of UTI in the preceding 6 months, current pregnancy, history of pyelonephritis, history of diabetes, history of organ transplant, history of human immunodeficiency virus, immunosuppression, renal insufficiency, urinary tract abnormalities, or history of urologic procedures were excluded.

Exposures

Antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated UTIs. Only antibiotics received within 1 day after the diagnosis were analyzed. The IDSA recommends the following antibiotics as first-line therapy: nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin, pivmecillinam.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The IDSA guideline concordance rates were calculated as the number of patients receiving first-line antibiotic therapy divided by the total number of cases for uncomplicated UTIs.

Results

A total of 46 793 adult women (67.3% [31 475 of 46 793] aged 18–34 years; 38.2% [31 475 of 46 793] of White race) were diagnosed with uncomplicated UTIs with 91.0% receiving guideline-concordant antibiotic treatment. In comparison with obstetrics and gynecology, IDSA guideline-concordant treatment was more likely in internal medicine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.87; 95% CI, 2.73–3.03), family medicine (aOR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.76–1.87), surgery (aOR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.36–1.67), and emergency medicine (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.32–1.39) and less likely in urology (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.38–0.43). Compared with direct military care, private sector care had lower concordance rates (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.62–0.64).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study of antibiotic treatments for uncomplicated UTIs in a universally insured population, the IDSA guideline-concordance rate was high at 91.0% with higher rates in direct military care compared with private sector care. There were higher rates in general medical specialties, surgery, and emergency medicine and lower rates in urology and obstetrics and gynecology. These results further enhance the literature on current antibiotic prescribing practices for uncomplicated UTIs in adult women.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — scope and exclusions specify that for the purposes of this Guideline the Panel considers only recurrent episodes in women of localized cystitis restricted to the lower urinary tract; infections with suspected upper urinary tract or systemic involvement should be managed differently, and in this Guideline the term urinary tract infection (UTI) will refer to acute bacterial cystitis. This Guideline does not specifically consider patients in whom complicating factors may put them at higher risk for decreased treatment efficacy or for progression of a localized UTI to systemic infection, including an anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract such as stone disease, diverticulum, or neurogenic bladder, an immunocompromised host, or urinary foreign bodies such as indwelling urethral catheters or ureteral stents.

Statistical Analysis

Study analyses included descriptive statistics of patient and clinician characteristics, IDSA guideline concordance rates by patient and clinician characteristics, and both unadjusted and adjusted logistic regressions with 95% CIs for the receipt of IDSA guideline-concordant treatment. Frequency comparisons of clinician specialties in direct vs private sector care were added as follow-up analyses. The IDSA guideline-concordance rates among women with uncomplicated UTIs were calculated as the number of cases receiving first-line guideline antibiotic therapy divided by the total number of cases for uncomplicated UTI. All patient and clinician characteristics were used as factors in all logistic regression modeling, and patients with missing values for variables were not included in regression analyses. A high rate of overprescribing was observed in women receiving nonconcordant treatment; therefore, additional regression modeling was performed on data from the subset of women receiving nonconcordant treatment. Because race was missing for nearly 34% of the study population and was a desired assessment as a factor in both guideline-concordant treatment and overprescribing, the reweighted estimating equations methodwith patient age, beneficiary status, and rank used as variables for the observed probabilities, was used in the adjusted regression models. Complete case analysis models with 95% CIs were used for sensitivity testing of the reweighted estimating equations regression results. All analyses were set at a priori probability of α < .05. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

The IDSA guidelines specifically apply to premenopausal women; therefore, women over the age of 50 years were excluded to minimize the number of postmenopausal women. Because the IDSA guidelines apply only to uncomplicated UTIs, patients with ICD-10 codes for the following conditions were excluded: current pregnancy, history of pyelonephritis, history of diabetes, history of any organ transplant, history of human immunodeficiency virus, immunosuppression, renal insufficiency, urinary tract abnormalities, and history of urologic procedures.

Characteristics of the treating clinician were extracted and included clinician type (physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, and other), specialty, and care setting (direct or private sector care). Patient characteristics including age, race (American Indian and Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, White, Other), beneficiary status (active duty, military dependent, retiree, other), and military rank of the patient or sponsor (junior enlisted, senior enlisted, junior officer, senior officer, warrant officer, and other) were also extracted. This study retained MDR-reported categories of race, with the exception of unknown and missing race categorized together by the authors and reported as missing race. The other race category was a self-selected value available to MHS beneficiaries when reporting their race. Race in the MDR does not include ethnicity; therefore reported categories are of race only.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Addressing antibiotic resistance [^112N6hvV]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) has traditionally been based on 2 important principles: the spectrum of organisms causing acute UTI is highly predictable (Escherichia coli accounts for 75% to 90% and Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounts for 5% to 15% of isolates), and the susceptibility patterns of these organisms have also been relatively predictable. As a result, empiric therapy with short-course trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been a standard management approach for uncomplicated cystitis. However, antibiotic resistance is now becoming a major factor not only in nosocomial complicated UTIs, but also in uncomplicated community-acquired UTIs. Resistance to TMP-SMX now approaches 18% to 22% in some regions of the United States, and nearly 1 in 3 bacterial strains causing cystitis or pyelonephritis demonstrate resistance to amoxicillin. Fortunately, resistance to other agents, such as nitrofurantoin and the fluoroquinolones, has remained low, at approximately 2%. Preliminary data suggest that the increase in TMP-SMX resistance is associated with poorer bacteriologic and clinical outcomes when TMP-SMX is used for therapy. As a result, these trends have necessitated a change in the management approach to community-acquired UTI. The use of TMP-SMX as a first-line agent for empiric therapy of uncomplicated cystitis is only appropriate in areas where TMP-SMX resistance prevalence is < 10% to 20%. In areas where resistance to TMP-SMX exceeds this rate, alternative agents need to be considered.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

### Development of predictive models to inform a novel risk categorization framework for antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli-caused uncomplicated urinary tract infection [^112NTTp8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common outpatient infections in the United States (US), with an estimated lifetime incidence of 50%‒60% in female adults. Approximately 80% of UTIs are classified as uncomplicated UTI (uUTI), which is one of the most common indications leading to antibiotic prescriptions in females. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin (NTF), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and fosfomycin as first-line treatments, while antibiotics such as β-lactams and fluoroquinolones are recommended as alternative options. Despite guideline recommendations, prescribing practices not aligned with IDSA guidelines are common, with 86.1% of patients prescribed alternative antibiotic agents as first-line therapy. These inappropriate prescribing practices contribute to increased healthcare costs and development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which leads to treatment failure, persistent uUTI symptoms, and adverse events.

Approximately 80% of uUTIs are caused by Escherichia coli (E. coli), and rising prevalence of AMR is a growing concern. A recent US study of urinary E. coli isolates from female outpatients ≥ 12 years of age found that 25.4%, 21.1%, and 3.8% were nonsusceptible to SXT, fluoroquinolones, and NTF, respectively, and 6.4% had extended-spectrum β-lactamase production. In clinical practice, challenges in identifying patients with uUTI at risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics can lead to inappropriate empiric prescribing. One novel method to help inform empiric prescribing by clinicians in uUTI is using a data-driven approach, such as predictive modeling, to identify patients at higher risk of having a nonsusceptible isolate to commonly prescribed antibiotics, thereby facilitating improved empiric prescribing practices in uUTI and mitigating development of AMR. Recently, predictive modeling has been used to identify important factors that contribute to risk of nonsusceptibility to antibiotic treatments for uUTI. To date, none have developed a corresponding risk categorization framework that contextualizes different AMR risk profiles.

To address this gap, this study developed and validated predictive models to estimate probabilities of E. coli nonsusceptibility to 4 commonly prescribed classes of antibiotic treatments for uUTI, identified key predictors of nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments, and constructed a novel risk categorization framework for nonsusceptibility to the 4 classes of antibiotic treatments.

The rationale notes uncertainty and diagnostic limits: "Clinical reports differ on how frequently resistance to ceftriaxone emerges", "there are no CLSI-endorsed approaches for AmpC detection in clinical isolates", and "these organisms may display ceftriaxone resistance for other reasons (eg, ESBL production)".

### Current prescribing practices and guideline concordance for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women [^1153i1uC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States. Clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and Fosfomycin as first-line antibiotic treatments and discourage the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents. US Food and Drug Administration released several black box warnings about fluoroquinolones over the past decade owing to antibiotic resistance and a high burden of adverse events. Historically, uncomplicated urinary tract infections have high rates of guideline-discordant treatment with past studies noting substantial use of fluoroquinolones, directly contradicting clinical practice guidelines.

Objective

This study aimed to assess the current concordance of physician prescribing practices with Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and identify patient and physician predictors of guideline concordance.

Study Design

A retrospective observational secondary analysis was conducted using a series of cross-sectional data extracted from the IQVIA (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania) National Disease and Therapeutic Index from 2015 to 2019. An estimated 44.9 million women with uncomplicated urinary tract infections at the age of 18 to 75 years were treated as outpatients. This population was selected to lack relevant comorbidities or urological abnormalities so that it matched the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The proportion of prescriptions for each antibiotic drug class were reported with 95% confidence intervals and compared with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Patient and physician characteristics were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of antibiotic selection and thereby guideline concordance.

Results

Of the visits that resulted in antibiotic treatment, the overall concordance rate was 58.4% (26.2 million visits of 44.9 million visits) and increased from 48.2% (3.9 million visits of 8.1 million visits) in 2015 to 64.6% (6.3 million visits of 9.8 million visits) in 2019. The most commonly prescribed antibiotic agents were fluoroquinolones (36.4%, 16.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), nitrofurantoin (31.8%, 14.3 million visits of 44.9 million visits), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (26.3%, 11.8 million visits of 44.9 million visits). From 2015 to 2019, fluoroquinolone use decreased whereas nitrofurantoin and beta-lactam use increased. Based on the logistic regression, patients aged 18 to 29 years (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–1.88; P < .001) and 30 to 44 years (odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.42; p = 0.020) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant treatment than patients aged 45 to 75 years (reference group). Obstetricians-gynecologists (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.37; P < .001) and urologists (odds ratio, 3.51; 95% confidence interval, 2.45–5.13; P < .001) had a statistically significantly higher likelihood of concordant treatment than all other specialties combined (reference group).

Conclusion

Guideline discordance continues in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections with the overuse of fluoroquinolones and the underuse of first-line antibiotic agents. Although improving, continued misuse of antibiotic agents may contribute to the growing rates of antibiotic resistance. Actions such as educating physicians about antibiotic resistance and clinical practice guidelines and providing feedback on prescription habits are needed to increase guideline concordance and therefore reduce the use of fluoroquinolones, especially for physicians in family and internal medicine.

### What's hot this year in infectious diseases clinical science [^112F4y7J]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

An older oral β-lactam antibiotic for uncomplicated UTI treatment, pivmecillinam, received FDA approval for use in the United States in spring 2024. Rates of resistance to pivmecillinam have remained very low despite several decades of widespread use internationally. Pivmecillinam was already included as recommended treatment for uncomplicated cystitis in the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America/European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases UTI guidelines, and with its FDA approval, it may well prove to be an important option for the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs in the United States.

The treatment of complicated UTIs, particularly those caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing organisms, continues to be a major problem that often requires intravenous antibiotics. This year saw the publication of the CERTAIN-1 trial, which looked at intravenous cefepime-taniborbactam for the treatment of complicated UTIs. In this study, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either cefepime-taniborbactam or meropenem every 8 hours for 7 days, with the possibility of extending to 14 days in cases of bacteremia. In the study's microbiologic intent-to-treat population, patients who had a positive urine culture with an Enterobacterales or Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate that was susceptible to both cefepime-taniborbactam and meropenem, cefepime-taniborbactam was superior to meropenem. The primary composite outcome of clinical success and microbiologic success at a 19–23-day test of cure was achieved in > 70% of the patients in the cefepime-taniborbactam arm versus only 58% in the meropenem arm, although clinical success rates were similar (85.7% vs 81.1%, respectively) between the 2 arms. While cefepime-taniborbactam is an exciting prospect for treating resistant gram-negative infections, it is not yet FDA approved as its application was rejected in early 2024 due to concerns about the manufacturing process. At this point, it is unclear when cefepime-taniborbactam may be available as an option for those difficult-to-treat infections.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^1137rWfo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

### Assessment and optimization of the empiric treatment of urinary tract infections in an academic emergency department observation unit [^1157MHaP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Poor adherence to evidence-based guidelines and overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics has been noted in the emergency department (ED). There is limited evidence on guideline-congruent empiric therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and uropathogen susceptibilities in the ED observation unit (EDOU).

Objective

The primary objective was to evaluate the prescribing patterns for the empiric treatment of UTI in the EDOU. Secondary objectives were to analyze uropathogen susceptibilities in the EDOU and implement an algorithm for the empiric treatment of UTI.

Methods

This study retrospectively reviewed adult patients who received empiric UTI treatment in the EDOU from January 1, 2018 to April 1, 2018. Eligible patients were categorized as having either uncomplicated or complicated cystitis, or pyelonephritis based on their clinical diagnosis. Antimicrobial therapy was evaluated in accordance with national practice guidelines, institutional guidelines, and local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.

Results

Patients with uncomplicated or complicated cystitis (n = 115) were provided guideline-congruent empiric treatment in 87% of cases. Patients with pyelonephritis (n = 35) were provided guideline-congruent empiric treatment in 57% of cases. Susceptibility patterns of uropathogens isolated from this patient sample differed slightly from the institutional antibiogram, notably depicting a lower Escherichia coli susceptibility rate. Fluoroquinolones were prescribed for a longer than recommended duration in 18 patients (60%).

Conclusions

The majority of patients in this study were provided guideline-congruent empiric therapy. Nevertheless, there are opportunities to optimize empiric UTI treatment and improve antibiotic stewardship in the EDOU.

### Risk factors for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole-resistant Escherichia coli in ED patients with urinary tract infections [^114CVrxj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is recommended as one of the first-line empiric therapies for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis, institutions that observe resistance rates exceeding 20% for Escherichia coli (E. coli) should utilize alternative empiric antibiotic therapy per the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Identifying risk factors associated with TMP-SMX resistance in E. coli may help guide empiric antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs).

Methods

This multicenter, retrospective study included adult patients who were discharged from 12 emergency departments (EDs) with a urine culture positive for E. coli between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019. Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between potential risk factors and TMP-SMX resistance. The overall institutional antimicrobial resistance rates for E. coli were compared to the rates seen in the study population of ED urinary isolates.

Results

Among 427 patients included from a randomized sample of 500 with a urine culture positive for E. coli, 107 (25.1%) were resistant to TMP-SMX. Three predictors of TMP-SMX resistance were identified: recurrent UTI (OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.27–3.99]), genitourinary abnormalities (OR 2.31 [95% CI 1.17–4.49]), and TMP-SMX use within 90 days (OR 8.77 [95% CI 3.19–28.12]). When the antibiotic susceptibilities for this ED cohort were compared to the institutional antibiogram, the TMP-SMX resistance rate was found to be higher in the ED population (25.1% vs 20%).

Conclusions

TMP-SMX should likely be avoided as first-line therapy for UTI in patients who have recurrent UTIs, genitourinary abnormalities, or have previously received TMP-SMX within the past 90 days. The use of an ED-specific antibiogram should be considered for assessing local resistance rates in this population.

New classifications of uUTI and cUTI define uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) as "Infection confined to the bladder in afebrile women or men", and classify complicated UTI as "infection beyond the bladder in women or men" including "Pyelonephritis", "Febrile or bacteremic UTI", "Catheter-associated (CAUTI)", and "Prostatitis* (*not covered by these guidelines)". The prior old classifications defined uncomplicated UTI as "Acute cystitis in afebrile nonpregnant premenopausal women with no diabetes and no urologic abnormalities", acute pyelonephritis as "Acute kidney infection in women otherwise meeting the definition of uncomplicated UTI above", and complicated UTI as "All other UTIs".

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117H4oaD]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### Improvement in adherence to antibiotic duration of therapy recommendations for uncomplicated cystitis: a quasi-experimental study [^111oQFmd]. Family Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common diagnoses for which antibiotic treatment is prescribed in the outpatient setting. Despite the availability of national guidelines, there remains a wide pattern in prescriber choices for therapy. Recent data portray a picture of consistently longer durations than recommended prescribed in outpatient settings.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the effect of a system-based intervention on adherence to guideline-recommended durations of therapy for uncomplicated cystitis in the outpatient setting.

Methods

This quasi-experimental study included women aged 18–64 years who were seen at five family medicine clinics at an academic medical centre and were prescribed targeted antibiotics for uncomplicated cystitis (nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg or ciprofloxacin 250 mg). The intervention involved revising or adding pre-filled, but modifiable, default prescribing instructions in the electronic health record (EHR) for the targeted antibiotics. We evaluated adherence to guideline-recommended duration of therapy as well as days of therapy (DOT) before and after the intervention.

Results

A total of 787 pre-intervention and 862 post-intervention cases were included. Adherence to recommended duration of therapy increased from 29.4% to 76.3% (P < 0.01). The average DOT decreased by 23% from 6.6 to 5.1 (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

A stewardship intervention consisting of revising/adding default prescribing instructions to targeted antimicrobials in an EHR was associated with increased adherence to recommended durations of therapy for uncomplicated cystitis and reduction of unnecessary antibiotic exposure. More studies are needed to confirm effectiveness across multiple medical record platforms.

### Empirical therapy for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: a decision and cost analysis [^112YEba3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines state that uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) should be treated empirically with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), unless the community resistance among uropathogens exceeds 10%-20%, in which case a fluoroquinolone (FQ) should be used. However, the data to support this threshold are limited. We performed a cost-minimization and sensitivity analysis to determine what level of TMP-SMZ resistance in a community should trigger FQ use. The mean cost of empirical treatment with TMP-SMZ was US$92 when the proportion of resistant Escherichia coli was 0%, $106 when it was 20%, and $120 when it was 40%. The mean cost of empirical FQ treatment was $107 at current levels of FQ resistance. When > 22% of E. coli in a community are TMP-SMZ-resistant, empirical FQ therapy becomes less costly than TMP-SMZ therapy. Treatment guidelines for empirical treatment of UTIs may need modification, and the threshold trigger for empirical FQ use should be raised to > 20% TMP-SMZ resistance.

### Costs and effects of screening and treating low risk women with a singleton pregnancy for asymptomatic bacteriuria, the ASB study [^116v65xz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Antibiotics choice and duration

There is no consensus in the literature on either the duration of therapy or the choice of antibiotic. As a result practice is guided by national or local practices and resistance patterns. A recent Cochrane review on the treatment duration for ASB underlines this lack of clear evidence on the best treatment.

The latest guidelines of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), published in 2005, recommend for the treatment of ASB a 3 to 7-day course for the treatment of ASB that includes sulphonamides, nitrofurantoin, nalidíxic acid, amoxicillin or trimethoprim.

E coli is the most common pathogen found in ASB and treatment should be targeted to the most common pathogens. Nitrofurantoin has proven to be safe in pregnancy with very low resistance levels in Netherlands. Nitrofurantoin is first choice in the treatment of cystitis in pregnancy in the Netherlands.

The Dutch guidelines of the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (NVOG) and the Dutch General Practitioners Society (NHG) do not currently recommend routine screening and treatment of ASB in pregnancy because convincing evidence is lacking. The Netherlands is one of the few countries which can still properly investigate this important question because a non treating policy of woman with ASB does not violate the guideline.

In view of the lack of good clinical evidence on the subject and the resulting practice variation, we think that an appropriately designed clinical trial evaluating the costs and effects of a screen and treat program is urgently needed. In a national cohort study women will be screened for ASB with the dipslide technique. Women with ASB will be randomised to either placebo or nitrofurantoin.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) present a significant problem for women and a challenge for the doctors who care for them. The diagnosis of uncomplicated UTI, which usually is not challenging, can be achieved best by a thorough assessment of patient symptoms with or without the addition of a urine dipstick test. Treatment should be based on the most recent Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines, taking into account resistance patterns in the local community. The patient who suffers from recurrent UTIs can be treated safely and effectively with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, postcoital therapy, or self-initiated treatment.

### Impact of an antimicrobial stewardship intervention on urinary tract infection treatment in the ED [^112zJDCE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The study objective is to assess changes in treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) after implementation of recommendations based on national guidelines and local resistance rates.

Methods

This preintervention and postintervention study included patients discharged home from the emergency department (ED) with an uncomplicated UTI at a 439-bed teaching hospital. Emergency department prescribers were educated on how local antimicrobial resistance rates impact UTI practice guidelines. Empiric treatment according to recommendations was assessed as the primary outcome. Agreement between chosen therapy and isolated pathogen susceptibility was compared before and after education. Reevaluation in the ED or hospital admission within 30 days for a UTI was also evaluated.

Results

A total of 350 patients were studied (174 before and 176 after education). Of those, 255 had cystitis, and 95 had pyelonephritis. After education, choice of therapy consistent with recommendations increased from 44.8% to 83% (difference, 38.2%; 95% confidence interval, 33%-43%; P < .001). The change was predominately driven by an increase in nitrofurantoin use for cystitis from 12% to 80% (difference, 68%; 95% CI, 62%-73%; P < .001). Agreement between empiric treatment and the isolated pathogen susceptibility improved for cystitis 74% to 89% (P = .05), and no change occurred in 30-day repeat ED visits for a UTI.

Conclusions

After implementation of treatment recommendations for uncomplicated UTIs based on local resistance, empiric antibiotic selection improved in the ED. To further meet goals of antimicrobial stewardship, additional interventions are needed.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^1164EvA5]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in adult women — antibiotic choice for acute cystitis should incorporate patient and pathogen factors, with specific options and caveats: Antibiotic choice should take into account specific patient factors (allergies, renal function), complicating factors, and uropathogen sensitivity. For acute cystitis in women with rUTI, nitrofurantoin is a key first-line agent; fosfomycin is effective; clinician may need to request sensitivity testing; TMP-SMX can also be used if resistance is less than 20% in the community; and fluoroquinolones are not first-line treatment of acute cystitis without complicating factors.

### Increasing antimicrobial resistance and the management of uncomplicated community-acquired urinary tract infections [^1161NYG2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in women. Therapy for these infections is usually begun before results of microbiological tests are known. Furthermore, in women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, empirical therapy without a pretherapy urine culture is often used. The rationale for this approach is based on the highly predictable spectrum of etiologic agents causing UTI and their antimicrobial resistance patterns. However, antimicrobial resistance among uropathogens causing community-acquired UTIs, both cystitis and pyelonephritis, is increasing. Most important has been the increasing resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the current drug of choice for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women. What implications do these trends have for treatment of community-acquired UTIs? Preliminary data suggest that clinical cure rates may be lower among women with uncomplicated cystitis treated with TMP-SMX when the infecting pathogen is resistant to TMP-SMX. Women with pyelonephritis also have less bacterial eradication and lower clinical cure rates when treated with TMP-SMX for an infection that is resistant to the drug. Therefore, in the outpatient setting, identifying risk factors for TMP-SMX resistance and knowing the prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance in the local community are important steps in choosing an appropriate therapeutic agent. When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians should consider such factors as in vitro susceptibility, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness, and selection of resistant strains. Using a management strategy that takes these variables into account is essential for maintaining the safety and efficacy of treatment for acute UTI.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^114xyRJP]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with UTIs. Empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients should contain antimicrobials that have historically demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs, achieve adequate urinary concentrations, and provide reliable activity against the most common pathogens based on local resistance rates. Presence of risk factors for antimicrobial resistance along with clinical severity also play an important role in the selection of empirical choices. 76, 77, 182 For patients with uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin is a reasonable drug of choice, based on robust evidence of efficacy and its ability to spare use of more systemically active agents for treating other infections.

78 For patients with pyelonephritis, TMP/SMX or a first-generation cephalosporin represent reasonable first-line agents but should be dependent upon local resistance rates. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Based on several randomized trials, shorter courses result in comparable outcomes to longer courses and are reasonable for the treatment of cystitis in children older than 2 months of age when the likelihood of pyelonephritis is deemed to be low. 100–102 Small study size, heterogeneity in trial design, end point definitions, and outcomes, preclude a clear recommendation for duration of treatment.

Based on the totality of the evidence available, we can provide clear recommendations on the optimal durations of treatment for cystitis for the antimicrobial classes listed below: Nitrofurantoin: 5 days108–110 TMP/SMX: 3 days109, 111, 112. Fluoroquinolones: 3 days109, 113–118 Oral fosfomycin: single dose78, 119–127 Pivmecillinam: 3 days109, 128–132 Gepotidacin: 5 days133 Data are insufficient to enable clear recommendations for duration of treatment for other potential treatment options, including β-lactams and parenteral aminoglycosides. Some pediatric data support a 5-day treatment duration when oral β-lactams are used to treat cystitis. 105.

### Updated guideline on diagnosis and treatment of intra-abdominal… [^112BHugS]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Therapy Antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as intra-abdominal infection is diagnosed or suspected. Antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible in patients with septic shock. Those who do not have septic shock should begin antimicrobial therapy in the emergency department. Adequate drug levels should be maintained during the source control procedure, which may necessitate additional administration of antimicrobials. MILD TO MODERATE COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED INFECTION IN ADULTS Antibiotics used for empiric treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infection should be active against enteric gram-negative aerobic and facultative bacilli and enteric gram-positive streptococci. Coverage for obligate anaerobic bacilli should be provided for distal small bowel, appendiceal, and colon-derived infection and for more proximal gastrointestinal perforations in the presence of obstruction or paralytic ileus. Table 1).

A combination of aztreonam and metronidazole is an alternative, but the addition of an agent effective against gram-positive cocci is recommended. The routine use of aminoglycosides is not recommended unless there is evidence that the patient harbors resistant organisms. The use of agents effective against methicillin-resistant. In newborns, empiric antifungal therapy should be initiated if Candida is suspected. An echinocandin should be the initial treatment in critically ill patients. Amphotericin B is not recommended as initial therapy because of its toxicity. Enterococcus species; in immunocompromised patients; and in those with valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular materials. Initial empiric anti-enterococcal therapy should be directed against Enterococcus faecalis. Antibiotics that can be used against this organism include ampicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin.

Empiric therapy for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium is not recommended unless the patient is at high risk of infection. Antimicrobial therapy with agents effective against facultative and aerobic gram-negative organisms and anaerobic organisms should be initiated in all patients diagnosed with appendicitis. In patients with suspected appendicitis who have equivocal imaging findings, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated in combination with pain medication and antipyretics, if indicated. Antimicrobial therapy should continue for at least three days in adults, until clinical symptoms and signs of infection resolve or a definitive diagnosis is made.

### Avoid presumptive antibiotic treatment of recurrent UTIs in… [^113AvkVo]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Although women with uncomplicated, infrequent UTIs can be treated empirically based on symptoms, women with recurrent UTIs should have a pretreatment urine specimen to document episodes and guide treatment. The use of vaginal, but not oral, estrogen in postmenopausal women is effective in reducing recurrent cystitis and should be used whenever possible. IDSA guidelines regarding cystitis should dictate treatment, accounting for antimicrobial resistance and potential ecological adverse effects.

### Abstract… [^114fs2uW]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections for which antibiotics are prescribed. The Infectious Diseases Society of America issued guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated acute bacterial cystitis and acute pyelonephritis in women. 1 The presence of bacteria in the urine of an asymptomatic patient is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria. The IDSA also has published guidelines on indications for the screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in various patient populations.
2. Diagnosis The presence of a significant quantity of bacteria in a urine specimen properly collected from a person without symptoms or signs of a UTI characterizes asymptomatic bacteriuria. 15 One study randomized women with bacteriuria to receive one week of nitrofurantoin or placebo; those receiving the antibiotic had a significantly lower prevalence of bacteriuria at six months, but not at one year.

16 The patients treated with antibiotics were just as likely as those in the placebo arm to have a symptomatic UTI in the year after therapy. 20 The IDSA recommends a course of three to seven days of antimicrobial therapy for pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria. 2 A Cochrane systematic review found insufficient evidence to determine whether a single dose regimen is as effective as treatments of longer duration. 21 Because leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests have low sensitivity for identifying bacteriuria in women who are pregnant, these patients should be screened with urine cultures. 25 or 14 years. 26 In a study of antibiotic therapy versus no therapy for women with diabetes and asymptomatic bacteriuria, antimicrobial therapy did not delay or decrease the frequency of symptomatic UTI or the rate of hospitalization for UTI or other causes at up to three years' follow-up.

27 These studies support the IDSA guidelines 2 that screening for or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in women with diabetes is not indicated. A prospective, randomized trial in patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria and intermittent catheterization showed similar rates of UTI at follow-up, whether or not prophylactic antimicrobials were administered. 36 Although there are few trials addressing the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with spinal cord injuries, review articles and consensus guidelines support the IDSA recommendations 2 that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be screened for or treated in patients with spinal cord injuries.
