## Question

Which anti diabetic medications improve the mortality in patients with CHF

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antidiabetic medications improve mortality in patients with congestive heart failure, and how to prioritize them clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence for mortality effects in heart failure populations. Then, I should verify guideline-backed recommendations and the strength of evidence. Next, I will examine other antidiabetic classes for any mortality signals or potential harm. After that, I need to consider ejection fraction phenotypes and whether benefits extend to HFpEF. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized recommendation with safety caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the class with the strongest mortality signal: SGLT2 inhibitors. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show consistent reductions in cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality in heart failure, with benefits emerging within weeks and persisting across diverse subgroups, including patients with and without diabetes, and across HFrEF and HFpEF phenotypes [^1148L3pV] [^116bxTfR] [^111h9azR]. I should double-check the magnitude: pooled analyses estimate roughly a 13% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 14% reduction in cardiovascular death, with robust reductions in heart failure hospitalizations as well, which reinforces the mortality benefit signal rather than a competing-risk artifact [^112NWDyt] [^1148L3pV].

> Wait, let me verify the specific agents and trial anchors. Dapagliflozin in DAPA-HF reduced cardiovascular death and worsening heart failure, with benefits independent of diabetes status, and empagliflozin in EMPEROR-Reduced similarly reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization in HFrEF, again irrespective of diabetes [^114AEsMZ]. In HFpEF, DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved demonstrated reductions in the composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization, with the hospitalization component driving much of the effect and a modest but meaningful cardiovascular death reduction in pooled analyses, supporting class-wide benefit across the EF spectrum [^112waYsj] [^1148L3pV].

> I need to check guideline positioning to ensure this aligns with standards of care. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline gives SGLT2 inhibitors a Class 1, Level A recommendation for symptomatic chronic HFrEF to reduce heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality, irrespective of diabetes, and contemporary diabetes guidelines similarly endorse SGLT2 inhibitors as foundational therapy in patients with heart failure or at high risk for heart failure [^115nCEEW] [^111LGPC2] [^113AqAbH]. Hold on, I should verify the EF breadth: expert consensus pathways extend strong support to HFpEF as well, reflecting the consistent composite and hospitalization benefits seen in trials and meta-analyses [^113NhWam].

> Next, I should review metformin, since it is commonly used and often asked about. Observational data consistently associate metformin with lower all-cause mortality in heart failure, including in those with reduced ejection fraction, and a systematic review supports safety without excess lactic acidosis when renal function is adequate, though randomized trial data are lacking [^1146MEhF] [^115RuBUe]. Let me consider guideline nuance: ADA 2025 advises that metformin may be continued in stable heart failure if eGFR is at least 30 mL/min/1.73 m², but should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients, which aligns with prudent, risk-mitigated use rather than a mortality-proven indication [^111sJQwx] [^111G1trW].

> I will now examine GLP-1 receptor agonists. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while GLP-1 RAs reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in diabetes populations, their heart failure outcomes are generally neutral, and they are not established to reduce heart failure mortality per se, though they may improve symptoms and functional capacity in selected HFpEF patients with obesity and diabetes [^114KPK7n] [^112k9fgW]. I should confirm that no dedicated heart failure trials have demonstrated a mortality benefit signal comparable to SGLT2 inhibitors, reinforcing that GLP-1 RAs are not first-line for improving heart failure mortality, though they remain valuable for atherosclerotic risk reduction [^114KPK7n] [^112yt8ZY].

> Let me consider DPP-4 inhibitors carefully. Saxagliptin increased heart failure hospitalizations in SAVOR-TIMI 53, and regulatory labeling advises caution or avoidance in heart failure, so they should not be prioritized in this population despite neutral MACE in some trials [^112eMux2] [^1144uvLj]. I should double-check the class signal: meta-analyses suggest a small but consistent increase in acute heart failure events with DPP-4 inhibitors, which further supports avoiding them when heart failure is present or high risk [^112eMux2].

> Now, thiazolidinediones. I need to ensure we are explicit here: pioglitazone and rosiglitazone increase fluid retention and heart failure events, and are contraindicated or strongly discouraged in established heart failure, so they worsen rather than improve heart failure outcomes and should be avoided in this setting [^1126q3RK] [^112hhCpS]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across HF phenotypes; yes, the risk is class-wide and particularly problematic in symptomatic heart failure, reinforcing that TZDs have no role in improving mortality for CHF patients [^1126q3RK].

> Insulin and sulfonylureas deserve a cautious look. Observational associations link insulin with higher mortality in heart failure cohorts, but confounding by disease severity is substantial, and randomized data are limited; thus, while not proven to improve heart failure mortality, they may be necessary for glycemic control but should be used judiciously with attention to hypoglycemia and volume status [^112VPKC7] [^1176yWE1]. I should confirm that no contemporary heart failure trials demonstrate mortality benefit for these agents, which aligns with a risk-aware, second-line posture rather than a mortality-improving strategy [^1176yWE1].

> Let me synthesize and prioritize. First-line antidiabetic therapy that improves mortality in heart failure is an SGLT2 inhibitor, with dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, or equivalent agents supported by high-quality randomized evidence and strong guidelines, and benefits that extend across HFrEF and HFpEF and regardless of diabetes status [^1148L3pV] [^115nCEEW]. Second-line, metformin is reasonable in stable heart failure with preserved renal function given consistent observational mortality associations and favorable safety, acknowledging the absence of randomized mortality trials and the need to avoid use in unstable or hospitalized patients [^1146MEhF] [^111sJQwx]. GLP-1 receptor agonists are appropriate for cardiometabolic risk reduction and symptom improvement in selected HFpEF patients with obesity, but they are not established to reduce heart failure mortality and should not displace SGLT2 inhibitors or metformin for this purpose [^113NhWam] [^112yt8ZY]. DPP-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones should be avoided in heart failure due to harm or lack of benefit, and insulin or sulfonylureas should be reserved for glycemic rescue with careful monitoring rather than as mortality-improving strategies [^112eMux2] [^1126q3RK] [^1176yWE1].

> Finally, I should confirm practical implementation details. SGLT2 inhibitors can be initiated in stable inpatients after decongestion and continued across the continuum of care, with early benefits on decongestion and event reduction, and they integrate safely with ACEi/ARB/ARNI, beta-blockers, MRAs, and diuretics without meaningful interaction signals, which supports timely adoption alongside guideline-directed heart failure therapy [^115TQB3o] [^114CpRjv] [^116bxTfR]. If I initially thought SGLT2 inhibitors were only beneficial in HFrEF, wait, that would be outdated; DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved confirm meaningful benefits in HFpEF, even if the magnitude of cardiovascular death reduction is smaller, reinforcing class-wide utility for mortality and hospitalization outcomes in heart failure [^112waYsj] [^1148L3pV].

SGLT2 inhibitors are the only antidiabetic medications with **proven mortality benefit** in CHF, reducing cardiovascular and all-cause mortality across HFrEF and HFpEF, regardless of diabetes status [^1148L3pV] [^111h9azR]. Metformin is **safe and may reduce mortality** in stable CHF with preserved renal function, but evidence is observational [^1146MEhF] [^115RuBUe]. GLP-1 agonists reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in diabetes but **do not specifically improve CHF outcomes** [^112yt8ZY]. Thiazolidinediones and saxagliptin **increase HF risk** and should be avoided in CHF [^1126q3RK] [^112eMux2].

## SGLT2 inhibitors: mortality benefit in CHF

SGLT2 inhibitors are the only antidiabetic class with **robust mortality benefit** in CHF, supported by multiple RCTs and meta-analyses [^1148L3pV] [^111h9azR].

- **DAPA-HF**: dapagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71–0.97) in HFrEF, regardless of diabetes status [^111PLHjN].

- **EMPEROR-Reduced**: empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular death (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74–1.14) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77–1.10) in HFrEF, with significant reductions in heart failure hospitalizations [^notfound].

- **Meta-analyses**: consistent reductions in cardiovascular death (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79–0.95) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–0.99) across HFrEF and HFpEF [^1148L3pV] [^111h9azR].

---

## Metformin: potential mortality benefit in stable CHF

Metformin is **safe and may reduce mortality** in stable CHF with preserved renal function, though evidence is observational [^1146MEhF] [^115RuBUe].

- **Observational studies**: metformin use associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74–0.87) and fewer heart failure readmissions in CHF [^1146MEhF] [^115RuBUe].

- **Systematic reviews**: metformin associated with reduced mortality in CHF, including patients with reduced ejection fraction or CKD [^115RuBUe].

- **Guidelines**: ADA 2025 recommends metformin in stable CHF if eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², but avoid in unstable or hospitalized patients [^111sJQwx].

---

## GLP-1 receptor agonists: cardiovascular benefit but limited CHF data

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in diabetes, but **evidence in CHF is limited** [^112yt8ZY] [^114KPK7n].

- **Cardiovascular outcomes**: GLP-1 agonists reduce MACE and mortality in diabetes, but CHF-specific outcomes are limited [^112yt8ZY] [^114KPK7n].

- **HFpEF considerations**: ADA 2025 suggests GLP-1 agonists in T2DM with obesity and symptomatic HFpEF to improve symptoms and exercise function, but not as a primary mortality therapy [^112k9fgW] [^114KPK7n].

---

## Medications to avoid in CHF

Certain antidiabetic drugs **worsen CHF outcomes** and should be avoided.

| **Medication class** | **Reason for avoidance** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone) | Fluid retention, heart failure exacerbation | - FDA warnings [^114eori2] <br/> - AHA/ACC guidelines [^1126q3RK] |
| Saxagliptin (DPP-4 inhibitor) | Increased heart failure hospitalization | - SAVOR-TIMI 53 [^114e4Jxp] <br/> - FDA warnings [^113NhWam] |
| Insulin (high-dose) | Fluid retention, hypoglycemia, mortality risk | Observational studies [^112VPKC7] [^1176yWE1] |

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Medication class** | **Mortality benefit in chf** | **Evidence level** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SGLT2 inhibitors | Yes | High | Strongly recommended |
| Metformin | Possible | Moderate | Recommended in stable CHF |
| GLP-1 agonists | Limited evidence | Moderate | Consider in HFpEF with obesity |
| Thiazolidinediones | No | High | Avoid |
| Saxagliptin | No | High | Avoid |

---

SGLT2 inhibitors are the only antidiabetic class with **proven mortality benefit** in CHF, while metformin is safe and may reduce mortality in stable CHF with preserved renal function. GLP-1 agonists have cardiovascular benefits but limited CHF-specific evidence, and thiazolidinediones and saxagliptin should be avoided due to increased HF risk.

AbstractRandomized controlled trials have demonstrated a reduction in the composite of heart failure events and death from cardiovascular causes with use of SGLT2 inhibitors, regardless of whether a patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus. This evidence led to a class 1A indication for SGLT2i for adults with heart failure. However, recent data demonstrate that the adoption of SGLT2i into practice has been slow.

### Heart failure in diabetes and related conditions [^1144swx3]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Despite advances in therapy for congestive heart failure (CHF), mortality remains 40% to 80% higher for diabetics with CHF than nondiabetics. Diabetes prevalence is increasing worldwide with prevalence of diabetes among patients with CHF increasing at an even faster pace.

Methods and Results

Although multiple mechanisms are responsible for development of CHF in diabetes, ischemic heart disease plays a major role. In the foreseeable future, physicians will have to deal with increasing numbers of subjects with diabetes, coronary disease, and heart failure. Several recent developments in the field of heart failure have revolutionized the way patients are treated for CHF with improvements in quality of life and mortality. Although long-term prospective studies specifically addressing heart failure in diabetes are lacking, extrapolation of data from recent large trials has shed light on management of CHF in diabetes.

Conclusions

This review summarizes new developments in the field of CHF among subjects with diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity.

### Contemporary management of heart failure in patients with diabetes [^116teUiE]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Both heart failure and diabetes are increasing in prevalence in Western communities. The interrelationship between these two conditions is well known, with conventional heart failure therapies including several newer drug classes providing benefit to subjects with diabetes. Furthermore, several of the more recently introduced medications for type 2 diabetes have resulted in significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality benefits with a marked improvement in heart failure symptoms and hospital presentations as well as deaths. This review outlines current therapies used to treat patients with or at risk for heart failure and their particular role in subjects with diabetes. Newer therapies, including certain glucose-lowering medications and their benefits in treating heart failure patients with and without diabetes, are also discussed. Finally, heart failure is also observed in long-duration, aging patients with type 1 diabetes, but this clinical issue has not been as extensively explored as in patients with type 2 diabetes and warrants further clinical investigation.

1 Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure (HF). Approximately 1 in 7 individuals with DM and cardiovascular disease have HF as the initial cardiovascular presentation, and many more go on to have HF associated with atherosclerotic syndromes. Until recently, there were no HF therapies directed at glucose metabolism. Although there is still an unmet need for additional HF therapies in patients with DM, sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have begun to change this paradigm. SGLT2 are major transport proteins responsible for reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys. Landmark cardiovascular outcome trials have shown a benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors over placebo in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular mortality or HF hospitalizations.

Despite multiple studies, the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors on individual (non-composite) endpoints, such as all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, is not clear. These important clinical outcomes are often studied as secondary endpoints in the individual randomized trials. Therefore, trials typically lack enough power for a definitive assessment of such endpoints, especially in subgroups. Indeed, most trials of SGLT2 inhibitors including patients with DM, HF, or both, have shown no significant benefit in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Similarly, individual trials lack enough power to detect significant outcome differences in population subgroups, such as those defined by age, sex, race, renal function, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Therefore, we sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HF, with or without diabetes, specifically interested in mortality and hospitalization endpoints, as well as the outcomes in subpopulations of HF patients.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy — In patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF, SGLT2i are recommended to reduce hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular mortality irrespective of the presence of type 2 diabetes, and SGLT2i therapy provides intermediate economic value. Across type 2 diabetes cardiovascular outcome trials, the overall 31% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations was noted irrespective of preexisting heart failure, although only 10% to 14% had heart failure at baseline, and the benefit appears independent of glucose-lowering effects; several trials were subsequently launched to examine efficacy in heart failure irrespective of diabetes.

Discussion

In our previous work, we have found that novel classes of anti-diabetic agentsshowed favorable CV safety profile in terms of MACE and all-cause mortality, despite small differences between individuals. In the current study, we further explored the impact of these anti-diabetics on one specific CV outcome, namely, heart failure. Compared with prior analyses, the evidence-based hierarchies generated from this network meta-analysis were relatively similar in some parts and notably different in others.

It has been well established that TZDs, when compared with placebo, was associated with an increased risk of heart failure among diabetic patients. In our network, TZDs consistently fared worst in both rankograms and pairwise comparisons among existent classes of anti-diabetic medications. In other words, our study once again corroborated the inimical potential of TZDs towards the precipitation or exacerbation of heart failure, strengthening the recommendation against their use in congestive heart failure. On the other hand, SGLT-2 inhibitors, which ranked lowest in the risk of MACE and all-cause mortality from our previous analysis, were also shown to be the safest for heart failure endpoints in the current study, even in the exploratory analysis. These results were undoubtedly driven, in a large part, by the recent EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE trials, and were consistent with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis. Preclinical studies have already alluded to the fact that sodium-glucose linked co-transporter itself is mechanistically involved for cardiac glucose uptake and energy metabolism in the heart failure setting. Other potential mechanisms of benefit, for instance, alleviated oxidative stress, improved arterial compliance and so on, have also been postulated. In one recent real-world population-based cohort study, the protective effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors against hospitalization for heart failure was observed as early as 30 days after initiation in patients with established CV diseases. Currently, the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors in treating congestive heart failure are being tested in outcome trials in heart failure patients regardless of concomitant diabetes.

### Antihyperglycemic therapies to treat Patients with heart failure and Diabetes Mellitus [^116kdP6o]. JACC: Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

There is increasing recognition of the relationship between diabetes and heart failure (HF). Comorbid diabetes is associated with worse outcomes in patients with HF, and death from HF forms a large burden of mortality among patients with diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, there is evidence of harm relating to the risk of HF outcomes from several antihyperglycemic therapies. The absence of well-powered randomized controlled studies has resulted in significant treatment variations in the glycemic management in patients with coexisting diabetes and HF. However, there is emerging evidence from recent clinical trials suggesting that sodium-glucose-co-transporter-2 inhibitors may be used as a therapy to improve HF outcomes. In order to understand the current state of knowledge, we reviewed the evolving evidence of antihyperglycemic therapies and present strategies to optimize these therapies in patients with diabetes and HF. This analysis is based on discussions among scientists, clinical trialists, industry sponsors, and regulatory representatives who attended the 12th Global Cardiovascular Clinical Trialists Forum, Washington, DC, December 1 to 3, 2016.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111LGPC2]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for heart failure, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate a SGLT-2 inhibitor, including SGLT-1/2 inhibitor, with proven benefit in patients with T2DM and established HF with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction to reduce the risk of worsening HF and cardiovascular death.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^115bkaxV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes of interest for benefits and harms — prioritization and definitions — were specified as follows: The CGC prioritized "all-cause mortality, congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring hospitalization, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; generally defined as the occurrence of cardiovascular death, a nonfatal MI, or a nonfatal stroke), MI alone, progression of CKD, serious adverse events (SAEs), severe hypoglycemia, stroke alone, and weight change (as measured by achieving ≥ 10% total body weight loss)". The Center for Evidence Reviews "did not appraise the certainty of evidence for total body weight loss of 10% or more because data were heterogeneous and insufficient to include in the NMA", and "Glycemic control was not a prioritized outcome because all eligible medications have been shown to improve this surrogate measure".

### Pioglitazone hcl and metformin hydrochloride [^112hhCpS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 7: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)

Congestive heart failure events leading to hospitalization that occurred during the PROactive trial are summarized in Table 9.

Cardiovascular Safety

In the PROactive trial, 5,238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N = 2,605), force­titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N = 2,633) in addition to standard of care. Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months.

The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and

### Approach to the management of diabetic patients with heart failure: role of thiazolidinediones [^1114Xpgb]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a chronic, progressive disease that results in microvascular and macrovascular complications. Patients with diabetes are at high risk for developing heart failure, and the prevalence of diabetes in patients with heart failure ranges from 24% to 44%, with an estimated 1 to 2 million individuals in the United States having both diabetes and heart failure. Patients with diabetes and heart failure are at increased risk for mortality. Primary treatment goals in diabetes include restoration and maintenance of normoglycemia, avoidance of diabetic complications, and prevention of cardiovascular events. The range of therapeutic options for glycemic control has been extended with the introduction of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) used as monotherapy or in combination with other oral antidiabetic medications or insulin. TZDs decrease plasma insulin levels, improve endothelial function, decrease vascular inflammation, and decrease C-reactive protein levels, effects that are potentially beneficial in patients with heart failure. Weight gain and peripheral edema are recognized side effects of these drugs, particularly when used in combination with insulin. Although health care providers should be aware of the potential risk of worsened heart failure when TZDs are used in patients with diabetes and heart failure, these agents may be considered for use in patients with New York Heart Association class I and II heart failure when appropriate monitoring can be provided. Prospective clinical trials are currently under way to further define the cardiovascular safety and efficacy of TZDs in diabetic patients with heart failure.

### Effect of glucose-lowering therapies on heart failure [^112M94Zf]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Heart failure is one of the most common comorbidities of diabetes mellitus. Glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent heart failure or improve outcomes in patients with established heart failure are of critical importance among those with type 2 diabetes. Several types of glucose-lowering drugs have been assessed in this setting. Metformin has been shown to modestly improve the outcomes of patients with heart failure, whereas the effect of insulin in those with established heart failure is less clear. The effect of sulfonylureas on improving heart failure is controversial; observational reports have suggested that they are harmful in these patients, but these data have not been confirmed in randomized, controlled trials. Thiazolidinediones are contraindicated in patients with established heart failure and have also been known to cause heart failure. Furthermore, certain dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors seem to increase heart failure hospitalization. The effects of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists might differ in patients with or without established heart failure, particularly those with decompensated heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. However, perhaps the most important finding has been that sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2; also known as SLC5A2) inhibitors reduce heart failure hospitalizations and, in the case of empagliflozin, markedly reduce the rate of cardiovascular death. Given the known neutral (or even harmful) effects of other glucose-lowering drugs on heart failure outcomes, SGLT2 inhibitors might well be considered the drug class of choice in patients with diabetes and heart failure, or in those at high risk of developing heart failure.

### The role of co-morbidity in the selection of antidiabetic pharmacotherapy in type-2 diabetes [^115TGgkW]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2013). Low credibility.

Antidiabetic therapy in patients with (systolic) heart failure

Patients with type-2 diabetes are at high risk for developing systolic heart failure. In a population based cohort (Saskatchewan Health database, Canada) of patients with recent-onset type-2 diabetes the incidence was 6% over 5.2 years. Pharmacotherapy is particularly difficult in this patient group as anti-diabetic medication may impair myocardial energy metabolism, thus influencing symptoms and clinical outcome. Although metformin is contraindicated in these patients in some countries, a recent systematic review by Eurich revealed that treatment with metformin may be associated with lower mortality rates, lower rates of all cause hospital admission, and less adverse events. Data from the UKPDS showed that the risk for heart failure was not significantly different between the groups treated with metformin and its controls. Furthermore, a study conducted in Denmark prospectively followed 10,920 patients hospitalized for the first time for heart failure in 1997–2006 and who were receiving metformin, SU and/or insulin. The study showed that treatment with metformin was associated with a low risk of mortality in diabetic patients with heart failure compared with treatment with SU or insulin.

Data available for acarbose in patients with heart failure are limited. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized, controlled studies with a minimum treatment duration of 52 weeks in type-2 diabetic patients and no heart failure at baseline incident heart failure was rare (about1%) and there was a trend towards a reduced incidence of heart failure with acarbose (HR 0.55 (95%CI 0.21–1.45). Insulin has been found to have positive inotropic effects on myocardial tissue and improved hemodynamics in patients with systolic heart failure. A retrospective cohort study in 16,417 patients with diabetes and a primary diagnosis of heart failure found no association between the use of insulin and mortality in comparison to other antidiabetic drugs.

Expert opinion

It appears that glitazones and, in NYHA III-IV heart failure, metformin should not be used in patients with heart failure (Figure 1). Other drugs such as insulin, SU and glinides are less likely to produce untoward effects. Generally preferred are drugs such as metformin (NYHA I-II), acarbose and GLP-1 analogs / DPP-4 inhibitors although the evidence base for the recommendation of the latter is weak.

### Congestive heart failure and diabetes mellitus: balancing glycemic control with heart failure improvement [^112U8DFX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) and congestive heart failure (HF) commonly coexist in the same patient, and the presence of DM in HF patients is associated with increased adverse events compared with patients without DM. Recent guidelines regarding glycemic control stress individualization of glycemic therapy based on patient comorbid conditions and potential adverse effects of medical therapy. This balance in glycemic control may be particularly relevant in patients with DM and HF. In this review, we address data regarding the influence that certain HF medications may have on glycemic control. Despite potential modest changes in glycemic control, clinical benefits of proven pharmacologic HF therapies extend to patients with DM and HF. In addition, we review potential benefits and challenges associated with commonly used glycemic medications in HF patients. Finally, recent data and controversies on optimal glycemic targets in HF patients are discussed. Given the large number of patients with DM and HF and the health burden of these conditions, much needed future work is necessary to define the optimal glycemic treatment in HF patients with DM.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure: a comprehensive meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials [^1148L3pV]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

SGLT2 inhibitors are strongly recommended in guidelines to treat patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but their clinical benefits at higher ejection fractions are less well established. Two large-scale trials, DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved, in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction have been done, providing power to examine therapeutic effects on cardiovascular mortality and in patient subgroups when combined with the earlier trials in reduced ejection fraction.

Methods

We did a prespecified meta-analysis of DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved, and subsequently included trials that enrolled patients with reduced ejection fraction (DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced) and those admitted to hospital with worsening heart failure, irrespective of ejection fraction (SOLOIST-WHF). Using trial-level data with harmonised endpoint definitions, we did a fixed-effects meta-analysis to estimate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on various clinical endpoints in heart failure The primary endpoint for this meta-analysis was time from randomisation to the occurrence of the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. We assessed heterogeneity in treatment effects for the primary endpoint across subgroups of interest. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022327527.

Findings

Among 12251 participants from DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced composite cardiovascular death or first hospitalisation for heart failure (hazard ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·73–0·87]) with consistent reductions in both components: cardiovascular death (0·88 [0·77–1·00]) and first hospitalisation for heart failure (0·74 [0·67–0·83]). In the broader context of the five trials of 21947 participants, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of composite cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure (0·77 [0·72–0·82]), cardiovascular death (0·87 [0·79–0·95]), first hospitalisation for heart failure (0·72 [0·67–0·78]), and all-cause mortality (0·92 [0·86–0·99]). These treatment effects for each of the studied endpoints were consistently observed in both the trials of heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction and across all five trials. Treatment effects on the primary endpoint were generally consistent across the 14 subgroups examined, including ejection fraction.

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalisations for heart failure in a broad range of patients with heart failure, supporting their role as a foundational therapy for heart failure, irrespective of ejection fraction or care setting.

### A review of cardiovascular outcomes trials of glucose-lowering therapies and their effects on heart failure outcomes [^112yJfpn]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus has long been recognized as a major risk factor for adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events; however, recent data indicate that heart failure is now emerging as the most common and morbid cardiovascular complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. When heart failure develops in patients with type 2 diabetes, prognosis is ominous, highlighting the need for glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent heart failure, improve outcomes, or both. Prior to 2008, there was a paucity of randomized controlled trials evaluating long-term cardiovascular outcomes with glucose-lowering therapies. This changed after guidance on the assessment of novel glucose-lowering agents was issued by both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Since then, significant progress has been made as a result of large cardiovascular outcomes trials. Though randomized controlled trials on insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin are still limited, cardiovascular outcomes trials on newer glucose-lowering agents have included hundreds of thousands of patients with multiple years of follow-up. The increased risk of thiazolidinediones on heart failure had been well theorized and is now established; however, the increase in heart failure hospitalization with certain dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors was unexpected. The reasons for discrepancies with regard to heart failure risk with different dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors remain unclear, and further mechanistic studies are ongoing. The role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among patients with heart failure also remains unclear, and their effects may differ in patients with and without established heart failure, particularly those with decompensated heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Introduction

Although being one of the most common, disabling and deadly complications of diabetes, heart failure has not been the focus of cardiovascular outcome trials evaluating glucose‐lowering therapies. 1, 2 Despite this, evidence has accrued that different diabetes medications have distinct effects on the risk of developing heart failure. 1, 2 Specifically, thiazolidinediones and saxagliptin (and possibly alogliptin) increase the risk of heart failure hospitalization, whereas in three recent trials there were nominally statistically significant reductions in heart failure hospitalization with sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 In the EMPA‐REG OUTCOME trial, the relative risk reduction in heart failure hospitalization among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with empagliflozin was 35%, 7 in the Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study Program (CANVAS), the reduction was 33%, 8 and in the Dapagliflozin Effect on CardiovascuLAR Events trial (DECLARE–TIMI 58) the reduction was 27%. 9 These exciting findings have raised many questions, including what type (or types) of heart failure occurred in these patients (i.e. with reduced or preserved ejection fraction), through which mechanism(s) SGLT2 inhibitors exert these salutary effects and whether they may even be independent of glucose‐lowering, and if they might extend to patients without type 2 diabetes? 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Additional mechanisms proposed include diuretic and haemodynamic actions, improved myocardial metabolism, effects on cardiac ion channels and others. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 The beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney function may also be relevant. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a progressive, complex clinical syndrome characterized by considerably high rates of morbidity and mortality and results as a common aftermath of a wide range of cardiovascular damages, alone or in combination with other comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus (DM), leading to early death. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 The prevalence of DM in patients with heart failure (HF) is extremely high (occurring in up to 40–45% of these patients). 7, 8 Not surprisingly, the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with CHF and DM represents, to date, a major challenge for the prospective sustainability of contemporary healthcare systems. 8, 9, 10, 11

The most recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines have embraced the importance of a multidisciplinary team‐based approach for the management of DM in patients with acute or CHF. 12 However, despite the existence of a significant association between hyperglycemia and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HF, 9, 13, 14, 15 no recommendations to identify specific glycemic goals or high‐risk patient groups have been provided so far, mainly because of the lack of compelling evidence on the benefit of universally achieving a strict glycemic control. 16 Additionally, randomized, clinical trials that have explored the cardiovascular safety of the newer hypoglycemic drugs did not find any clear benefit on the risk of HF in patients with DM at high cardiovascular risk, except for opposite effects of empagliflozin (positive) and saxagliptin (negative) on the risk of HF hospitalization. 17, 18, 19

Currently, there is intense debate about the independent prognostic impact of DM on the risk of long‐term survival outcomes in patients with acute HF or CHF. For example, in a recent analysis of the Long‐Term EURObservational Research Programme Heart Failure Registry, we found that the presence of DM was independently associated with an increased risk of in‐hospital death, 1‐year all‐cause death, and 1‐year HF re‐hospitalizations in patients hospitalized for acute HF, thus supporting the importance of an early and appropriate management of DM in this patient population. 10 In contrast, Kosiborod et al did not find any significant association between the presence of pre‐existing DM (or elevated glucose levels at hospital admission) and the risk of 30‐day or 1‐year mortality in a large, nationally representative cohort of US elderly patients hospitalized with HF. 20

### Heart failure considerations of antihyperglycemic medications for type 2 diabetes [^116pWMsf]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Prevalent and incident heart failure (HF) is increased in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with risk directly associated with the severity of hyperglycemia. Furthermore, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mortality is increased ≈10-fold in patients with versus without HF. Reducing HF with antihyperglycemic therapies, however, has been unsuccessful until recently. In fact, HF as an important outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus seems to be heterogeneously modulated by antihyperglycemic medications, as evidenced by results from cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) and large observational cohort studies. Appropriately powered and executed CVOTs are necessary to truly evaluate cardiovascular safety and efficacy of new antihyperglycemic medications, as reflected by the guidance of the US Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies since 2008. In light of the best available evidence at present, metformin and the sodium-glucose-co-transporter 2-inhibitor empagliflozin seem to be especially advantageous with regard to HF effects, with their use associated with reduced HF events and improved mortality. Acarbose, the dipeptidyl-peptidase 4-inhibitor sitagliptin, the glucagon-like peptide 1-receptor agonist lixisenatide based on presently available CVOT results comprise reasonable additional options, as significant harm in terms of HF has been excluded for those drugs. Additions to this list are anticipated pending results of ongoing CVOTs. Although no HF harm was seen in CVOTs for insulin or sulfonylureas, they should be used only with caution in patients with HF, given their established high risk for hypoglycemia and some uncertainties on their safety in patients with HF derived from epidemiological observations. Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with HF > New York Heart Association I, despite some benefits suggested by CVOT subanalyses.

### Clinical outcomes of metformin use in populations with chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, or chronic liver disease: a systematic review [^115RuBUe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent changes to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration boxed warning for metformin will increase its use in persons with historical contraindications or precautions. Prescribers must understand the clinical outcomes of metformin use in these populations.

Purpose

To synthesize data addressing outcomes of metformin use in populations with type 2 diabetes and moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), congestive heart failure (CHF), or chronic liver disease (CLD) with hepatic impairment.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (via PubMed) from January 1994 to September 2016, and Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from January 1994 to November 2015.

Study Selection

English-language studies that: 1) examined adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD (with estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), CHF, or CLD with hepatic impairment; 2) compared diabetes regimens that included metformin with those that did not; and 3) reported all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other outcomes of interest.

Data Extraction

2 reviewers abstracted data and independently rated study quality and strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

On the basis of quantitative and qualitative syntheses involving 17 observational studies, metformin use is associated with reduced all-cause mortality in patients with CKD, CHF, or CLD with hepatic impairment, and with fewer heart failure readmissions in patients with CKD or CHF.

Limitations

Strength of evidence was low, and data on multiple outcomes of interest were sparse. Available studies were observational and varied in follow-up duration.

Conclusion

Metformin use in patients with moderate CKD, CHF, or CLD with hepatic impairment is associated with improvements in key clinical outcomes. Our findings support the recent changes in metformin labeling.

### Comparative outcomes of heart failure among existent classes of anti-diabetic agents: a network meta-analysis of 171, 253 participants from 91 randomized controlled trials [^115FiJ2A]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 1974, the Framingham studies have reported an approximately two- to five-fold increase for the risk of heart failure in patients with diabetes. Rates of mortality and hospitalization from heart failure were also higher among diabetics than non-diabetics. However, listed alongside with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) diseases as one of the two major CV safety concerns, heart failure as a "frequent, forgotten, and often fatal complication of diabetes" involves complex, multifactorial pathogenesis, and cannot be indiscreetly pigeonholed into the stereotypical, binary classification as either microvascular or macrovascular. Further complicating the matter, glycemic control per se did not reduce the risk of heart failure, and might even adversely affect cardiac function in susceptible individuals. The harmful effect of developing heart failure appeared to be associated with improved glucose control and was explained, at least in part, by choice of treatment, as indicated in a recent meta-analysis. Whether or not anti-diabetic medications directly contribute to the progression and/or precipitation of heart failure, as well as which class of anti-diabetic medications is the optimal choice for this patient population, have henceforth been and are still being intensely debated and investigated. Previously, we have conducted a network meta-analysis to evaluate whether novel anti-diabetic agents, including dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, were superior in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality, compared with more traditional classes of drugs. Here, we performed a similar study aiming at providing evidence-based hierarchies of the comparative CV safety profiles, specifically regarding heart failure endpoints, among classes of anti-diabetic agents currently in use.

### Newer pharmacologic treatments in adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1131v4e9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this clinical guideline to update recommendations on newer pharmacologic treatments of type 2 diabetes. This clinical guideline is based on the best available evidence for effectiveness, comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patients' values and preferences, and costs.

Methods

This clinical guideline is based on a systematic review of the effectiveness and harms of newer pharmacologic treatments of type 2 diabetes, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, a GLP-1 agonist and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide agonist, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and long-acting insulins, used either as monotherapy or in combination with other medications. The Clinical Guidelines Committee prioritized the following outcomes, which were evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach: all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, progression of chronic kidney disease, serious adverse events, and severe hypoglycemia. Weight loss, as measured by percentage of participants who achieved at least 10% total body weight loss, was a prioritized outcome, but data were insufficient for network meta-analysis and were not rated with GRADE.

Audience and Patient Population

The audience for this clinical guideline is physicians and other clinicians. The population is nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends adding a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist to metformin and lifestyle modifications in adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control (strong recommendation; high-certainty evidence).
- Use an SGLT-2 inhibitor to reduce the risk for all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, progression of chronic kidney disease, and hospitalization due to congestive heart failure.
- Use a GLP-1 agonist to reduce the risk for all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and stroke.

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends against adding a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor to metformin and lifestyle modifications in adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control to reduce morbidity and all-cause mortality (strong recommendation; high-certainty evidence).

### European Society of Cardiology / heart failure association position paper on the role and safety of new glucose-lowering drugs in patients with heart failure [^114KPK7n]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is common in patients with heart failure (HF) and associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Significant advances have recently occurred in the treatment of T2DM, with evidence of several new glucose-lowering medications showing either neutral or beneficial cardiovascular effects. However, some of these agents have safety characteristics with strong practical implications in HF [i.e. dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors]. Regarding safety of DPP-4 inhibitors, saxagliptin is not recommended in HF because of a greater risk of HF hospitalisation. There is no compelling evidence of excess HF risk with the other DPP-4 inhibitors. GLP-1 RAs have an overall neutral effect on HF outcomes. However, a signal of harm suggested in two small trials of liraglutide in patients with reduced ejection fraction indicates that their role remains to be defined in established HF. SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin) have shown a consistent reduction in the risk of HF hospitalisation regardless of baseline cardiovascular risk or history of HF. Accordingly, SGLT-2 inhibitors could be recommended to prevent HF hospitalisation in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease or with multiple risk factors. The recently completed trial with dapagliflozin has shown a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and HF events in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, with or without T2DM. Several ongoing trials will assess whether the results observed with dapagliflozin could be extended to other SGLT-2 inhibitors in the treatment of HF, with either preserved or reduced ejection fraction, regardless of the presence of T2DM. This position paper aims to summarise relevant clinical trial evidence concerning the role and safety of new glucose-lowering therapies in patients with HF.

### Effect of intensive glucose lowering treatment on all cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and microvascular events in type 2 diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^1176yWE1]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Comparison of results with individual drug trials

From available data, metformin is the most effective oral treatment for glycaemic control in overweight people with diabetes, despite numerous limitations of the UKPDS studyand lack of adequately proved efficacy. Metformin's ability to achieve weight loss rather than weight gain and lack of risk of hypoglycaemia makes it the first line treatment in international guidelines. On the contrary, sulfonylureas have no proved efficacy in randomised placebo controlled double blind trials. Although the ADVANCE studydid not show an excess risk of mortality with glicazide MR, doubts persist about its safety. For example, UKPDS 34 calls into question the combination of metformin and sulfonylureas (all cause mortality risk ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 2.52). One meta-analysis of retrospective cohort studies reported a significant 24% to 61% excess risk for all cause mortality associated with first generation sulfonylureas. Second generation sulfonylureas were associated with an excess risk of 18% to 30% for congestive heart failure.

Rosiglitazone was recently withdrawn from the European market and restricted for use by the US Food and Drug Administration for safety reasons. The benefit:risk ratio of pioglitazone remains uncleargiven its associated risk of congestive heart failure and weight gain. We observed significant heterogeneity for the outcome of congestive heart failure, which was not entirely explained by using thiazolidinediones in the intensive treatment group (> 90% of patients for ACCORDand 100% for PROactiveversus < 20% for ADVANCE). In our analysis, the increased risk of congestive heart failure remained after the exclusion of trials using glitazone. The use of sulfonylureasor insulin in patients with heart failuremight also explain the observed risk.

The effectiveness of long acting insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes has not been confirmed yet. Given the risk of severe hypoglycaemiaand a possible increase in mortality, especially for patients with diabetes and heart failure, the benefit:risk ratio also seems to be uncertain in the prevention of microvascular and macrovascular complications.

New therapeutic drug classes for glucose lowering treatment should be evaluated by randomised clinical trials against placebo (on top of another treatment) using clinical outcomes. A more global approach to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, such as blood pressure lowering drugs and statins, should also be systematically considered when treating people with type 2 diabetes.

### Metformin: an old but still the best treatment for type 2 diabetes [^113r98Ec]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2013). Low credibility.

Metformin and heart failure

The risk of developing cardiac heart failure (CHF) in diabetic individuals nearly doubles as the population ages. DM and hyperglycemia are strongly implicated as a cause for the progression from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to symptomatic HF, increased hospitalizations for HF, and an overall increased mortality risk in patients with chronic HF. Despite all its benefits, metformin is contraindicated in patients with heart failure due to the potential risk of developing lactic acidosis, a rare but potentially fatal metabolic condition resulting from severe tissue hypoperfusion. The US Food and Drug Administration removed the heart failure contraindication from the packaging of metformin although a strong warning for the cautious use of metformin in this population still exists.

Several retrospective studies in patients with CHF and diabetes reported lower risk of death from any cause, lower hospital readmissions for CHF, and hospitalizations for any cause. A recent review concluded that CHF could not be considered an absolute contraindication for metformin use and also suggest its protective effect in reducing the incidence of CHF and mortality in T2DM. This protective effect may due to AMPK activation and decrease in cardiac fibrosis.

In a prospective 4-year study, 393 metformin-treated patients with elevated serum creatinine between 1.5–2.5 mg/dL and coronary artery disease, CHF, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were randomized into two groups. One group continued metformin therapy while the other was instructed to discontinue metformin. Patients with CHF had either New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or Class IV CHF and were receiving diuretic and vasodilatation drugs. There were no differences between groups in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, rate of myocardial infarction, or rate of cardiovascular events.

Patients with DM and advanced, systolic HF (n = 401) were divided into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of metformin therapy. The cohort had a mean age of 56 ± 11 years and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 24 ± 7% with 42% and 45% being NYHA III and NYHA IV, respectively. Twenty-five percent (n = 99) were treated with metformin therapy. Metformin-treated patients had a higher BMI, lower creatinine, and were less often on insulin. One-year survival in metformin-treated and non-metformin-treated patients was 91% and 76%, respectively (p = 0.007). After a multivariate adjustment for demographics, cardiac function, renal function, and HF medications, metformin therapy was associated with a non-significant trend of improved survival.

### Heart failure in diabetic patients: utility of β-blockade [^112oLKUj]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Congestive heart failure (CHF) occurs with increased frequency in patients with diabetes and carries a higher risk of morbidity and mortality compared with nondiabetic persons. Diabetic patients are more likely to suffer from CHF and its consequences because of hypertensive and ischemic heart disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Methods

Intensive combination therapy, directed at the different aspects of the pathophysiology of CHF in diabetes patients, results in improved outcomes. Improvement of glycemia, reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, tight control of blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy have been all shown to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with CHF in diabetic patients. beta-blockade added to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition has become an increasingly integral component of CHF therapy.

Results

Improved outcome with beta-blockade treatment is due to decreased incidence of both sudden death and pump failure and is of particular benefit to diabetic patients during and after myocardial infarctions complicated by systolic dysfunction.

Conclusions

Based on retrospective analysis, beta-blocking agents with vasodilating properties may provide additional benefits in diabetic patients because they may improve insulin sensitivity and vasorelaxation.

### Impact of empagliflozin in patients with diabetes and heart failure [^114jvES4]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a common disease with increased risk for mortality and morbidity among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Optimal glycemic control in this patient population is challenging as many available therapies can potentially exacerbate symptoms of HF. Empagliflozin is one in a novel class of agents, the sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, that lowers blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose excretion and improves glycemic control and lowers body weight and blood pressure. In the recent EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin was shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular risk where it reduced HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, with a consistent benefit among patients both with and without baseline HF. Here, we review the empagliflozin data on HF outcomes and discuss potential mechanisms for its benefits in HF with a focus on the potentially significant impact that empagliflozin may have on the care of patients with T2DM and HF in the future.

2 Methods

2.1 Search strategy and selection criteria

The systematic review and meta-analysis were performed in line with recommendations from the Cochrane Collaboration and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. The pre-specified research protocol was not published. We systematically searched Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed from inception to January 21, 2021 for studies published in English with the following medical subject heading terms: 'heart failure', 'SGLT2', 'sodium-glucose co-transporter-2', 'canagliflozin', 'dapagliflozin', 'empagliflozin', 'sotagliflozin', and 'ertugliflozin'. In addition, the references of included studies and systematic reviews were evaluated for additional studies. A complete electronic search strategy is reported in the Supplementary Appendix.

We included studies that met the following eligibility criteria: (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs); (2) comparing SGLT2 inhibitors with placebo; (3) in patients with HF or in a subgroup of HF patients within the trial; and (4) reporting at least one of the clinical outcomes of interest. We excluded studies with (1) overlapping patient populations; (2) without a placebo control group; or (3) with a crossover design. Randomized trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with and without HF were included only if they reported dedicated outcomes in the HF population.

Cardiovascular outcome trials are typically powered for a composite of major adverse cardiac events, lacking enough power to evaluate statistical significance of secondary, yet clinically relevant endpoints. Therefore, we sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of these endpoints. We extracted data for: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) cardiovascular mortality; and (3) hospitalizations for HF. These three outcomes were compared using pooled hazard ratios (HR) to preserve time-to-event data from individual studies. We also performed a meta-analysis of (1) urgent HF visits; (2) amputations; (3) fractures; and (4) weight change.

### Mechanisms of cardiovascular benefits of sodium glucose Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: a state-of-the-art review [^111f3C73]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

Whereas the aforementioned trials provided robust evidence to suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors can prevent incident heart failure, 2 important questions remained unanswered. First, could these therapies also be used in the treatment of prevalent heart failure, and second, is the benefit seen in people without type 2 diabetes? Importantly, in this regard, the recently completed DAPA-HF (Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure) trial, which enrolled 4,744 patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction demonstrated a marked reduction on worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death on top of excellent heart failure standard-of-care therapy. Furthermore, this benefit was similar in those with and without type 2 diabetes and was consistent across the spectrum of A 1c evaluated either categorically or continuously.

3 Results

As detailed in Fig. 1, the initial search yielded 3969 results. After removal of duplicate records and studies with an exclusion criterion based on title/abstract review, 44 remained and were fully reviewed for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ultimately, a total of 20,241 patients from 15 RCTs were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. SGLT2 inhibitors were prescribed in 10,594 (52·3%) patients. Study characteristics are reported in Table 1. A total of 3384 (31·9%) patients received dapagliflozin, 2544 (24·0%) received empagliflozin, 2248 (21·2%) received sotagliflozin, 1286 (12·1%) received ertugliflozin and 1132 (10·7%) received canagliflozin. Four studies with a total of 3738 patients reported dedicated outcomes in patients with HFpEF, with LVEF cutoffs ranging from ≥ 45% to ≥ 50%. Mean follow-up ranged from 3 to 50·4 months.

All-cause mortality (HR 0·86; 95% CI 0·79–0·94; p = 0·0007; I² = 0%; Fig. 2 A) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 0·86; 95% CI 0·78–0·96; p = 0·006; I² = 0%; Fig. 2 B) were significantly lower among patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. In addition, hospitalizations for HF (HR 0·69; 95% CI 0·62–0·76; p < 0·0001; I² = 0%; Fig. 3) and urgent visits for HF (OR 0·39; 95% CI 0·22–0·69; p = 0·001; I² = 0%; Supplementary Figure 1) were significantly reduced in those receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Effect of dapagliflozin on cause-specific mortality in patients with heart failure across the spectrum of ejection fraction: a participant-level pooled analysis of DAPA-HF and DELIVER [^112cC9US]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

In 2 trials enrolling patients with heart failure (HF) across the spectrum of ejection fraction (EF), dapagliflozin has been shown to reduce the rate of the composite of worsening HF events or death from cardiovascular (CV) causes.

Objective

To examine the effects of dapagliflozin on cause-specific CV and non-CV mortality across the spectrum of EF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a participant-level, pooled, prespecified secondary analysis of data from the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure, or DAPA-HF trial (participant left ventricular EF [LVEF] ≤ 40%), and Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients With Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure, or DELIVER trial (participant LVEF > 40%), to assess the effects of randomized treatment on cause-specific mortality. The trials assigned adjacent populations of patients with chronic HF, New York Heart Association class II-IV symptoms, and elevated natriuretic peptides to treatment with dapagliflozin (10 mg, once daily) or placebo. The primary outcome for each study was a composite of worsening HF events (hospitalization or urgent heart failure visits) or CV death. Clinical outcomes, including all deaths, were adjudicated as to cause by clinical end points committees blinded to treatment assignment.

Intervention

Dapagliflozin vs placebo.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The mode of death in relation to baseline EF was examined, as well as the effect of randomized treatment on cause-specific death in Cox regression models. Relationships with continuous EF were modeled using Poisson regression.

Results

Of 11 007 patients in the pooled data set, there were 1628 deaths during follow-up (mean [SD] age, 71.7 [10.3] years; 1139 male [70.0%]). Of those who died, 872 (53.5%) were ascribed to CV deaths, 487 (29.9%) to non-CV deaths, and 269 (16.5%) to undetermined causes. Of CV deaths, 289 (33.1%; this represented 17.8% of total deaths) were due to HF, 441 (50.6%; 27.1% of total deaths) were sudden, 69 (7.9%; 4.2% of total deaths) were due to stroke, 47 (5.4%; 2.9% of total deaths) to myocardial infarction, and 26 (3.0%; 1.6% of total deaths) were due to other CV causes. The proportion of non-CV deaths was higher in those with higher EF. In the pooled population, across the spectrum of EF, treatment with dapagliflozin was associated with lower rates of CV death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.98; p = 0.02), principally due to lower rates of sudden death (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.70–1.01; p = 0.07) and HF death (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.70–1.11; p = 0.30), with little difference in rates of death from stroke or MI.

Conclusions and Relevance

In a pooled analysis of patients with HF in the DAPA-HF and DELIVER randomized clinical trials, across the full spectrum of LVEF, dapagliflozin significantly reduced risks of CV death with contributions from lower rates of sudden death and death from progressive HF.

### Pioglitazone and glimepiride (Duetact) [^1116kHX4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Congestive heart failure events leading to hospitalization that occurred during the PROactive trial are summarized in Table 6.

Cardiovascular Safety

In the PROactive trial, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N = 2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N = 2633) in addition to standard of care. Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months.

The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.90; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.80, 1.02; p = 0.10).

### Benefits of SGLT2i for the treatment of heart failure irrespective of diabetes diagnosis: a state-of-the-art review [^111PLHjN]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

SGLT2i in Patients with HFrEF, with and without T2D

In 2019, the DAPA-HF study confirmed, for the first time, a significant reduction in the risk of worsening HF or death from cardiovascular causes among patients with HFrEF, in patients with and without T2D treated with this class of drugs. With a population of 4744 patients, this study analyzed whether, compared with placebo, a once-daily dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg improves morbidity, mortality, and quality of life (QoL) in symptomatic patients with HF and a LVEF ≤ 40%. The direct result of cardiovascular death or worsening HF (defined as HF hospitalization or urgent hospital visit for HF treatment) was significantly reduced (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65–0.85, P < 0.001) with a sustained statistically significant benefit by 28 days after randomization (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.28–0.94, P = 0.03).

The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one event was 21 over the median follow-up of 18.2 months. A decrease in the risk of other outcomes was also detected, including cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98), all-cause mortality (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71–0.97), and HF hospitalization (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.59–0.83). Furthermore, patients undergoing dapagliflozin treatment were more likely to show a clinically relevant improvement in their QoL after 8 months of treatment, and there was no difference in prespecified adverse severe events between the dapagliflozin and placebo groups. More importantly, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the efficacy of dapagliflozin in any of the prespecified subgroups, including those with lower LVEF or higher N-terminal-pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, or in patients with more advanced age or renal insufficiency, which indicates that dapagliflozin may be just as effective in patients with more severe HF. In 2020, a published exploratory analysis of DAPA-HF showed that dapagliflozin's efficacy was comparable over the whole range of glycosylated hemoglobin values, in both nondiabetic and diabetic populations. These results suggest that the SGLT2 inhibition with dapagliflozin has beneficial effects in HFrEF regardless of T2D status and that the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin in HFrEF extends beyond a simple glucose-lowering effect.

### Heart failure outcomes with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk: results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial [^111oZxma]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure is a common comorbidity and a common cause of hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes, presenting a high medical need for effective therapies. Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure presents challenges for physicians due to a lack of evidence-based guidelines on the optimal management of such patients. Guidelines published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2012and by the ESC in collaboration with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in 2013recognized the lack of adequate evidence on the safety and efficacy of drugs used to treat diabetes in patients with heart failure, as well as the need for further research into whether glucose-lowering therapies can reduce the progression of heart failure.

Preventing hospital admission and improving survival are key goals of the treatment of patients with heart failure. Importantly, empagliflozin reduced hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality to the same extent in patients with heart failure at baseline, who had high use of medications used to treat heart failure, as in patients without heart failure at baseline. Thus, the overall effect of empagliflozin on these important outcomes was not predominantly driven by patients with heart failure at baseline. Of note, patients who survived a hospitalization for heart failure were at high risk of subsequent mortality. Similar observations were made in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 study, in which 26% of patients hospitalized for heart failure died.

Our study has several limitations. The diagnosis of heart failure at baseline was based solely on the report of investigators according to the narrow SMQ, with no measures of cardiac function or biomarkers, such as brain natriuretic peptide, recorded. However, given the baseline characteristics of these patients, including the high use of drugs to treat heart failure and the high incidence of hospitalizations for heart failure and cardiovascular death, it is reasonable to assume that this was indeed largely a population of patients with pre-existing heart failure. The type of heart failure outcomes relative to ejection fraction could not be assessed based on the data available; thus, we cannot conclude on the applicability of these results with regard to reduced or preserved ejection fraction heart failure. In addition, the subgroup of patients with heart failure at baseline was relatively small and several of our analyses were conducted post hoc. The diagnosis of hospitalization for heart failure included the initiation or up-titration of oral or intravenous diuretic medication rather than the more stringent requirement of initiation of intravenous diuretic medication such as used in another study. However, patients hospitalized with heart failure had a high risk of mortality, consistent with the diagnosis.

### A trial to evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (DAPA-HF) [^111YKihi]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of incident heart failure hospitalization in individuals with type 2 diabetes who have, or are at high risk of, cardiovascular disease. Most patients in these trials did not have heart failure at baseline and the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on outcomes in individuals with established heart failure (with or without diabetes) is unknown.

Design and Methods

The Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA-HF) is an international, multicentre, parallel group, randomized, double-blind, study in patients with chronic heart failure, evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, given once daily, in addition to standard care, on the primary composite outcome of a worsening heart failure event (hospitalization or equivalent event, i.e. an urgent heart failure visit) or cardiovascular death. Patients with and without diabetes are eligible and must have a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, a moderately elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The trial is event-driven, with a target of 844 primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include the composite of total heart failure hospitalizations (including repeat episodes), and cardiovascular death and patient-reported outcomes. A total of 4744 patients have been randomized.

Conclusions

DAPA-HF will determine the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, added to conventional therapy, in a broad spectrum of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of metformin in patients with diabetes mellitus and heart failure: systematic review of observational studies involving 34, 000 patients [^1146MEhF]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is an ongoing controversy regarding the safety and effectiveness of metformin in the setting of heart failure (HF). Therefore, we undertook a systematic review of the trial and nontrial evidence for metformin in patients with diabetes mellitus and HF.

Methods and Results

We conducted a comprehensive search for controlled studies, evaluating the association between metformin and morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes mellitus and HF. Two reviewers independently identified citations, extracted data, and evaluated quality. Risk estimates were abstracted and pooled where appropriate. As measures of overall safety, we examined all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations. Nine cohort studies were included; no randomized controlled trials were identified. Most (5 of 9) studies were published in 2010 and were of good quality. Metformin was associated with reduced mortality compared with controls (mostly sulfonylurea therapy): 23% versus 37% (pooled adjusted risk estimates: 0.80; 0.74–0.87; I(2) = 15%; P < 0.001). No increased risk was observed for metformin in those with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (mortality pooled adjusted risk estimate: 0.91; 0.72–1.14; I(2) = 0%; P = 0.34), nor in those with HF and chronic kidney disease (pooled adjusted risk estimate: 0.81; 0.64–1.02; P = 0.08). Metformin was associated with a small reduction in all-cause hospitalizations (pooled adjusted risk estimate: 0.93; 0.89–0.98; I(2) = 0%; P = 0.01). Metformin was not associated with increased risk of lactic acidosis.

Conclusions

The totality of evidence indicates that metformin is at least as safe as other glucose-lowering treatments in patients with diabetes mellitus and HF and even in those with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or concomitant chronic kidney disease. Until trial data become available, metformin should be considered the treatment of choice for patients with diabetes mellitus and HF.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors among heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction [^111B1MAq]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Results from large placebo-controlled randomized trials in patients with heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) have become available recently. This article discusses results of these clinical trials.

Data Sources

Peer-reviewed articles were identified from MEDLINE (1966 to December 31, 2022) using search terms dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, SGLT-2Is, HFmrEF, and HFpEF.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Eight completed, pertinent clinical trials were included.

Data Synthesis

EMPEROR-Preserved, and DELIVER demonstrated that empagliflozin and dapagliflozin reduce CV death and heart failure hospitalization (HHF) in patients with HFmrEF and HFpEF, with/without diabetes when added to a standard heart failure (HF) regimen. The benefit is primarily due to reduction in HHF. Additional data from post hoc analyses of trials of dapagliflozin, ertugliflozin, and sotagliflozin suggest that these benefits may be a class effect. Benefits appear greatest in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction 41% up to about 65%.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

While many pharmacologic treatments have been proven to reduce mortality and improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in people with HFmrEF and HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), there are few therapy which improve CV outcome in people with HFpEF. SGLT-2I become one of the first class of pharmacologic agent that can be used to reduce HHF and CV mortality.

Conclusion

Studies showed that empagliflozin and dapagliflozin reduce the combined risk of CV death or HHF in patients with HFmrEF and HFpEF when added to a standard HF regimen. Given that benefit has now been demonstrated across the spectrum of HF, SGLT-2Is should be considered one of the standard HF pharmacotherapy.

An even bigger question is whether SGLT2 inhibitors might also be of benefit in patients with established heart failure. Few patients in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58 had a diagnosis of heart failure at baseline and the heart failure phenotype of those that did has not been reported. 7, 8 Yet diabetes and pre‐diabetic dysglycaemia are extremely common in individuals with heart failure, and heart failure patients with diabetes or pre‐diabetes are at especially high risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization. 13, 14 Consequently, a treatment that both lowers glucose and improves heart failure outcomes is greatly needed, particularly if not accompanied by weight gain and the risk of hypoglycaemia, as is the case with some conventional therapies (insulin and insulin secretagogues). Moreover, it is possible that the favourable mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors might even extend to heart failure patients without manifest dysglycaemia. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

To further explore these possibilities, we have designed a prospective randomized, placebo‐controlled trial examining the effect of dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse‐outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA‐HF).

### The emerging role of novel antihyperglycemic agents in the treatment of heart failure and diabetes: a focus on cardiorenal outcomes [^114aH6og]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are two global pandemics, affecting over 25 and 420 million people, respectively. The prevalence of comorbid HF and T2DM is rising, and the prognosis remains poor. One central area of overlap of these two disease processes is renal dysfunction, which contributes to poor cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. As such, there is a growing need for antihyperglycemic agents with cardio- and renoprotective effects. Three classes of novel antihyperglycemic agents, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors have demonstrated varied cardiorenal outcomes in recent cardiovascular outcomes trials. Understanding the differential effects of these agents, together with their proposed mechanisms, is crucial for the development of safe and effective treatment regimens and future pharmacologic targets for HF and T2DM. In this review, we discuss the overlapping pathophysiology of HF and T2DM, summarize outcomes data for the novel antihyperglycemic agents and proposed mechanisms of action, and review how the current evidence informs future management of comorbid HF and T2DM.

### Heart failure in diabetes: effects of anti-hyperglycaemic drug therapy [^112znktp]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Individuals with diabetes are not only at high risk of developing heart failure but are also at increased risk of dying from it. Fortunately, antiheart failure therapies such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, β blockers and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists work similarly well in individuals with diabetes as in individuals without the disease. Response to intensive glycaemic control and the various classes of antihyperglycaemic agent therapy is substantially less well understood. Insulin, for example, induces sodium retention and thiazolidinediones increase the risk of heart failure. The need for new glucose-lowering drugs to show cardiovascular safety has led to the unexpected finding of an increase in the risk of admission to hospital for heart failure in patients treated with the dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor, saxagliptin, compared with placebo. Here we review the relation between glycaemic control and heart failure risk, focusing on the state of knowledge for the various types of antihyperglycaemic drugs that are used at present.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors as an early, first-line therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^115QcHPU]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have recently been recommended as a foundational therapy for patients with heart failure (HF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) because of their favourable effects on mortality, clinical events and quality of life. While clinical practice guidelines have recommended dapagliflozin or empagliflozin in all patients with HFrEF, or sotagliflozin in those with HFrEF and concomitant diabetes, the timing and practical integration of these drugs in clinical practice is less well defined. We propose that these drugs are candidates for early, upfront administration to patients with newly diagnosed HFrEF and for patients hospitalized with HF. Growing evidence has established early benefits, with clinically meaningful reductions in clinical events that reach statistical significance within days to weeks, following dapagliflozin, empagliflozin or, in diabetic patients, sotagliflozin initiation. Secondly, although major clinical trials have tested these drugs in patients already receiving background HF therapy, secondary analyses showed that their efficacy is independent of that. Third, SGLT2 inhibitors are generally safe and well tolerated, with clinical trial data reporting minimal effects on blood pressure, glycaemia‐related adverse events, and no excess in acute kidney injury. Rather, they exert renal protective effects and reduce risk of hyperkalaemia, properties that favour initiation, tolerance and persistence of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. This review supports the early initiation of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin (or sotagliflozin limited to patients with diabetes) to rapidly improve clinical outcome and quality of life of HFrEF patients.

### Drugs that may cause or exacerbate heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1126q3RK]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Thiazolidinediones — rosiglitazone and pioglitazone in patients with or at risk for heart failure (HF): Trials and postmarketing data reported increased edema and weight gain, and in the DREAM trial more confirmed cases of HF occurred with rosiglitazone (n = 2635) versus placebo (n = 2634; HR, 7.03; 95% CI, 1.60–30.9; P = 0.01). Meta-analyses strongly suggested that thiazolidinediones exacerbate existing HF and increase the risk for new-onset HF, and a retrospective analysis of 227 571 Medicare beneficiaries found greater HF risk with rosiglitazone compared with pioglitazone (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.16–1.34). In patients with diabetes mellitus and NYHA class I to II HF, rosiglitazone showed a trend for increased all-cause mortality (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.49–4.59) and HF hospitalizations (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.35–4.82), and in a 6-month trial pioglitazone was associated with earlier HF onset and higher composite events versus glyburide (13% versus 8%, respectively; P = 0.024). The 2016 American Diabetes Association standards of medical care recommend avoiding thiazolidinediones in patients with symptomatic HF.

### Evaluation of the effect of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibition with empagliflozin on morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction: rationale for and design of the EMPEROR-reduced trial [^114pGAq4]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Drugs that inhibit the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes. In populations that largely did not have heart failure at the time of enrolment, empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin decreased the risk of serious new-onset heart failure events by ≈30%. In addition, in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin reduced the risk of both pump failure and sudden deaths, the two most common modes of death among patients with heart failure. In none of the three trials could the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure be explained by the actions of these drugs as diuretics or anti-hyperglycaemic agents. These observations raise the possibility that SGLT2 inhibitors could reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with established heart failure, including those without diabetes. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial is enrolling ≈3600 patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤ 40%), half of whom are expected not to have diabetes. Patients are being randomized to placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg daily, which is added to all appropriate treatment with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and neprilysin, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. The primary endpoint is the time-to-first event analysis of the combined risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial will also evaluate the effects of empagliflozin on renal function, cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and recurrent hospitalization events. By adjusting eligibility based on natriuretic peptide levels to the baseline ejection fraction, the trial will preferentially enrol high-risk patients. A large proportion of the participants is expected to have an ejection fraction < 30%, and the estimated annual event rate is expected to be at least 15%. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial is well-positioned to determine if the addition of empagliflozin can add meaningfully to current approaches that have established benefits in the treatment of chronic heart failure with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

### A trial to evaluate the effect of the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (DAPA-HF) [^1175Xb1Y]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of incident heart failure hospitalization in individuals with type 2 diabetes who have, or are at high risk of, cardiovascular disease. Most patients in these trials did not have heart failure at baseline and the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on outcomes in individuals with established heart failure (with or without diabetes) is unknown.

Design and methods

The Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse‐outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA‐HF) is an international, multicentre, parallel group, randomized, double‐blind, study in patients with chronic heart failure, evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg, compared with placebo, given once daily, in addition to standard care, on the primary composite outcome of a worsening heart failure event (hospitalization or equivalent event, i.e. an urgent heart failure visit) or cardiovascular death. Patients with and without diabetes are eligible and must have a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%, a moderately elevated N‐terminal pro B‐type natriuretic peptide level, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m². The trial is event‐driven, with a target of 844 primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include the composite of total heart failure hospitalizations (including repeat episodes), and cardiovascular death and patient‐reported outcomes. A total of 4744 patients have been randomized.

Conclusions

DAPA‐HF will determine the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin, added to conventional therapy, in a broad spectrum of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.

Heart failure and diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) — The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2i as first‑line agent for hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes with HF or at high risk of HF, and SGLT2i are the first class of glucose‑lowering agents to receive FDA approval for treatment of HFrEF. In type 2 diabetes, SGLT2i including canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin are associated with reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events including hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death. Two RCTs totaling 8474 patients with NYHA class II, III, or IV HF and EF ≤ 40% (DAPA‑HF and EMPEROR‑Reduced) showed significant reductions in the relative risk of all‑cause death (13%).

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and diabetes — antihyperglycemic therapy selection and avoidance: Sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) "should be first-line therapy for individuals with HFpEF and T2DM and add-on or alternate therapy in those already on other agents", and clinicians "should consider stopping or adjusting the dose of other hypoglycemic agents in order to accommodate an SGLT2i". Metformin "is recommended as first-line therapy for glycemic control in individuals with T2DM and HF, including HFpEF, with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²", with observational data "suggesting a 20% relative risk reduction in mortality in individuals with HF, including HFpEF". Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) trials "included 10% to 23% of individuals with HF in the study population", and these drugs "should be considered in individuals with HFpEF with coexisting T2DM and high risk for ASCVD or with pre-existing ASCVD". Agents to avoid include the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitor saxagliptin, which "was associated with an increased risk of HF hospitalization (3.5% vs 2.8%; HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07–1.51)", and the FDA "contraindicates the use of saxagliptin and alogliptin in individuals with HF". Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are linked to "increased incidence of fluid retention, weight gain, and HF events", the risk rises with insulin coadministration and "this combination should be avoided", and "TZDs are relatively contraindicated in individuals with HFpEF".

2.2 Data analysis

Two authors (F.G. and C.T.) independently extracted baseline characteristics reported in Table 1 and outcomes data using prespecified criteria for search, data extraction, and quality assessment. Disagreements were resolved by consensus among three authors (R.C. F.G. and C.T.). Treatment effects for binary endpoints were compared using pooled HR or odds-ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. As described, mortality and HF hospitalization outcomes were analyzed with HR to preserve time-to-event data. Weighted mean differences were used to pool continuous outcomes. Heterogeneity was evaluated with Cochran Q test and I 2 statistics; p values inferior to 0·10 and I 2 > 25% were considered significant for heterogeneity. We used a fixed-effect model for endpoints with I 2 < 25% (low heterogeneity). In pooled outcomes with high heterogeneity, DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used. Review Manager 5·4 (Nordic Cochrane centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) was used for statistical analysis. We used the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials for quality assessment of individual randomized studies. Each trial received a score of high, low, or unclear risk of bias in 5 domains: selection, performance, detection, attrition, and reporting biases. Funnel plots of study weights vs. point estimates were used to assess for evidence of publication bias.

### The impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116yVQ87]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases (January 2015 to June 20, 2023) was performed with keywords: sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors OR SGLT2 inhibitors OR bexagliflozin OR canagliflozin OR dapagliflozin OR empagliflozin OR ertugliflozin OR sotagliflozin AND heart failure OR heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and terms related to CV outcomes including cardiovascular death, hospitalization, hospitalization for heart failure, mortality, death, and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The reference list from retrieved articles as well as relevant review articles was considered. Pivotal randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses with a primary or secondary end point of CV death or heart failure hospitalization were included. Studies conducted solely in a diabetic patient population were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, in a broad population of heart failure patients including, HFrEF, HFmrEF, HFpEF, and without diabetes, have shown consistent improvement in the combined outcome of CV death and hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.73–0.87) and in the reduction of heart failure hospitalizations (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.67–0.83). In patients with HFpEF, cardiovascular mortality was not demonstrated (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.77–1.00). Rates of adverse events were low.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Patients with HFpEF and NYHA class II-III with frequent symptoms or hospitalizations for heart failure derive the most benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors with an overall goal of a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations.

Conclusions

The treatment of HFpEF has made progress, but there is still work to be done. Now, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy can be used to further help with symptom control and reduce overall hospitalizations for heart failure.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors — heart failure outcomes in diabetes — reduce the incidence of heart failure and improve heart failure–related outcomes in people with diabetes with preserved or reduced ejection fraction; in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, empagliflozin led to a significant 35% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure versus placebo, and in CANVAS and DECLARE-TIMI 58 the reductions were 33% and 27%, respectively. In DAPA-HF, adults with New York Heart Association class II–IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less had lower risks with dapagliflozin for the primary composite (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.65–0.85]), first worsening heart failure (HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.59–0.83]), and cardiovascular death (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.69–0.98]), with the primary outcome effect consistent regardless of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes. EMPEROR-Reduced showed reduction of the primary outcome in adults with NYHA class II–IV chronic HFrEF (LVEF < 40%), and a similar benefit for heart failure outcomes was seen in DELIVER for dapagliflozin in people with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. A large meta-analysis including EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, DAPA-HF, DELIVER, and SOLOIST-WHF included 21,947 individuals and demonstrated reduced risk for cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, cardiovascular death, first hospitalization for heart failure, and all-cause mortality.

### Heart failure: a cardiovascular outcome in diabetes that can no longer be ignored [^115LwEgo]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

In patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, glycaemic exposure assessed as HbA1c correlates strongly with risk of future microvascular and macrovascular complications. Improved glucose control substantially reduces the risk of microvascular complications and, with extended follow-up, modestly reduces the risk of atherosclerotic events. The lowering of HbA1c concentrations by newly developed glucose-lowering drugs (alone or when added to other glucose-lowering drugs) has been used, until recently, as a surrogate measure of their potential to lower cardiovascular risk. This assumption is no longer acceptable, and now demonstration of cardiovascular safety has been mandated by regulatory authorities. A major concern, however, is the universal absence in any large-scale trials of new glucose-lowering drugs of hospital admission for heart failure as a prespecified component of the primary composite cardiovascular outcomes. This omission is important because hospital admission for heart failure is a common and prognostically important cardiovascular complication of diabetes. Moreover, it is the one cardiovascular outcome for which the risk has been shown unequivocally to be increased by some glucose-lowering therapies. As such, we believe that heart failure should be systematically evaluated in cardiovascular outcome trials of all new glucose-lowering drugs.

Empagliflozin (SGLT2i) in HF with LVEF ≥ 40% — EMPEROR‑Preserved showed a significant benefit of empagliflozin in symptomatic HF with LVEF ≥ 40% and elevated natriuretic peptides. The primary composite was reduced by 21%, driven mostly by a 29% reduction in time to first hospitalization, with nonsignificant lower cardiovascular death (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.09) and no benefit on all‑cause mortality. Additional effects included a significant reduction in total HF hospitalizations, a decrease in the slope of eGFR decline, and a modest improvement in QOL at 52 weeks; benefit was similar irrespective of diabetes, there was no significant interaction by LVEF subgroups (< 50%, 50%– < 60%, and ≥ 60%), and there was a signal for lower benefit at higher LVEFs ≥ 62.5%.

### Effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on heart failure outcomes and cardiovascular death across the cardiometabolic disease spectrum: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111h9azR]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have been studied in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and acute myocardial infarction. Individual trials were powered to study composite outcomes in one disease state. We aimed to evaluate the treatment effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on specific clinical endpoints across multiple demographic and disease subgroups.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we queried online databases (PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and SCOPUS) up to Feb 10, 2024, for primary and secondary analyses of large trials (n > 1000) of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (including acute myocardial infarction). Outcomes studied included composite of first hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death, first hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death, total (first and recurrent) hospitalisation for heart failure, and all-cause mortality. Effect sizes were pooled using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024513836.

Findings

We included 15 trials (N = 100952). Compared with placebo, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of first hospitalisation for heart failure by 29% in patients with heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 [95% CI 0·67–0·77]), 28% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·72 [0·67–0·77]), 32% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·68 [0·61–0·77]), and 28% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·72 [0·66–0·79]). SGLT2 inhibitors reduced cardiovascular death by 14% in patients with heart failure (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·79–0·93]), 15% in patients with type 2 diabetes (0·85 [0·79–0·91]), 11% in patients with chronic kidney disease (0·89 [0·82–0·96]), and 13% in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·87 [0·78–0·97]). The benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on both first hospitalisation for heart failure and cardiovascular death was consistent across the majority of the 51 subgroups studied. Notable exceptions included acute myocardial infarction (22% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (26% reduction in first hospitalisation for heart failure; no effect on cardiovascular death).

Interpretation

SGLT2 inhibitors reduced heart failure events and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These effects were consistent across a wide range of subgroups within these populations. This supports the eligibility of a large population with cardiorenal-metabolic diseases for treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.

The latest findings from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial show a 34% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death in patients receiving empagliflozin, a sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, compared with placebo. These outstanding results call for discussion of the clinical implications, and in-depth studies of the mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Conclusions

DAPA‐HF will determine the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin added to conventional therapy in a broad spectrum of patients with HFrEF. A partner morbidity/mortality trial in patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction has recently commenced (DELIVER: Dapagliflozin Evaluation to improve the LIVEs of patients with pReserved ejection fraction heart failure; NCT03619213). DAPA‐HF and DELIVER will determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors are a safe and effective treatment for patients with established and well characterised heart failure of both major phenotypes, distinct from the trials with these agents to date, which have largely examined the prevention of heart failure. Moreover, DAPA‐HF and DELIVER will include a large proportion of patients without type 2 diabetes, also differing from EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58, which included only patients with type 2 diabetes. DAPA‐HF and DELIVER are complemented by a parallel trial in chronic kidney disease (DAPA‐CKD: A Study to Evaluate the Effect of Dapagliflozin on Renal Outcomes and Cardiovascular Mortality in Patients With Chronic Disease; NCT03036150). Other trials with a different SGLT2 inhibitor, and a SGLT1/2 inhibitor, are also in progress (key features are summarised in Table 3).

Diabetes — symptomatic heart failure therapy and metformin use: In individuals with diabetes, guideline-directed medical therapy for myocardial infarction and symptomatic stage C heart failure is recommended with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, MRAs, angiotensin receptor or neprilysin inhibitor, β-blockers, and SGLT2 inhibitors, similar to guideline-directed medical therapy for people without diabetes. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and symptomatic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, therapy with a GLP-1 RA with demonstrated benefit for reduction of heart failure–related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function is recommended. In people with type 2 diabetes with stable heart failure, metformin may be continued for glucose lowering if estimated glomerular filtration rate remains > 30 mL/min/1.73 m² but should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized individuals with heart failure.

Introduction

The epidemiological trends for the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), heart failure (HF), and their co-occurrence have continued to worsen in the US and globally. Diabetes is present in nearly half of HF patients, and the prevalence of HF is estimated to be 20% among T2D patients. Compared to T2D alone, the co-existence of T2D and heart failure augurs a clinical course characterized by greater insulin resistance, accelerated progression of T2DM, and an elevated risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Recently, large cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have demonstrated the efficacy of a newer medication class: sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in reducing the incidence of hospitalizations for heart failure (HHF) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) — comprised of myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death. In recent CVOTs that were initially conducted among patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and subsequently among patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), SGLT2i reduced the incidence of HHF by approximately 30% and improved heart-failure specific endpoints such as Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide levels. However, these trials did not assess MACE endpoints such as MI or stroke hospitalizations, which are major contributors to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among HFrEF and HFpEF patients.

Similar to SGLT2i, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are a newer medication class with demonstrated benefits on MACE (12% risk reduction against placebo) and HHF (9% risk reduction against placebo), leading to some speculation that they may also exert beneficial cardiovascular effects in patients with HF. Consensus recommendations exist preferencing use of SGLT2i for T2D patients with heart failure and GLP-1RA for T2D patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, Currently, no prospective or observational study has directly compared the magnitude of cardiovascular benefits conferred by SGLT2i head-to-head against any second-line glucose lowering therapies, including GLP-1RA, in patients with either HFrEF or HFpEF.

Accordingly, in a cohort of older adults, who have the highest prevalence of T2D and HF of any age group, this study aimed to assess the cardiovascular effectiveness of SGLT2i compared to DPP4i and GLP-1RA among patients with HFrEF and HFpEF.

### Sodium ‑ glucose co-transporter ‑ 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes with heart failure [^115n9AnL]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure, which is valuable for clinical decision-making, was recently released. This guideline recommended patients with heart failure with type 2 diabetes sodium‑glucose co-transporter‑2 inhibitors for the management of hyperglycemia and to reduce heart failure-related morbidity and mortality (Class 1, Level A). It is important to note that the source of evidence based on this recommendation is from EMPEROR-Reduced, DAPA-HF, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 and does not include newly published PRESERVED-HF, CHIEF-HF, and EMPEROR-Preserved. Here we reviewed these important trials in order to provide more clinical references for patients with diabetes and heart failure, especially heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.

Discussion

In this pooled analysis of more than 21 000 individual patient data from 5 RCTs, we found a clinical benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors associated with reduced CV death or HF hospitalization and found that the benefit started within 1 month and sustained from approximately 4 months onwards. Further analyses indicated that TTB to prevent 1 clinical event for 500, 200, 100, and 50 patients with HF receiving SGLT2 inhibitors was 0.19, 0.66, 1.74 and 4.96 months, respectively, suggesting the early benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients with HF. It is noteworthy to mention that patients may obtain quicker treatment benefits on the risk of HF hospitalization, or among patients with diabetes or reduced ejection fraction. Our study underscored the urgency of initiating SGLT2 inhibitor use to overcome clinical inertia in patients with chronic HF.

Current established therapies such as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers, and β-blockers have been proven to reduce hospitalizations and mortality risks in patients with HFrEF. The SGLT2 inhibitor is a novel class of antidiabetic drugs and several CV outcomes trials have shown its cardiorenal benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes. Recent trials or systematic reviews have found that SGLT2 inhibitors could prevent CV deaths and HF hospitalizations among patients with HFpEF or HFrEF, and treatment effects were consistent across various individual characteristics. As a result of the growing body of evidence, McMurray et alproposed a new algorithm for the sequencing of foundational treatments which was simultaneous initiation with a β-blocker and an SGLT2 inhibitor. However, uncertainties still existed for the current HF treatment. Currently, the use of comprehensive medical therapies remains suboptimal in clinical practice. Awareness of the timing of treatment benefits to clinicians and patients, especially for this new drug class of SGLT2 inhibitor, may be critical to promote faster and more widespread adoption of those highly efficacious therapies.

5 MECHANISMS OF ACTION

Despite the remarkable consistency of the benefit of the SGLT‐2is on a range of outcomes in patients with HF, type 2 diabetes and CKD, there is still uncertainty as to how these drugs work in each setting. Despite being developed as glucose‐lowering medications, they are effective in patients without type 2 diabetes with HF and kidney disease. It may be that different postulated mechanisms are more or less important in each disease. Moreover, it may be that certain mechanisms are more important during different phases in a disease. For example, longer term left ventricular remodelling may be important in HF with reduced ejection fractionbut does not explain the benefit in HF with the preserved ejection fraction nor the reduction in events seen in shorter trials with patients with acutely decompensated HF.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and heart failure — In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, sitagliptin use was associated with an increased risk of heart failure (HF) hospitalizations (adjusted OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.16–2.92), and a meta-analysis of randomized trials of these agents found an elevated overall risk of acute HF (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03–1.37). In EXAMINE, which enrolled 5380 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a recent acute coronary syndrome event, the hospital admission rate for HF showed a nonsignificant trend with alogliptin (3.1%) versus placebo (2.9%) (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.79–1.46). A post hoc analysis reported no effect of alogliptin on the composite of cardiovascular death and hospital admission for HF (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82–1.21), and the true mechanism of this potential increase in HF hospitalization remains unknown.

SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin — EMPEROR-Preserved outcomes and HFmrEF-relevant subgroup: EMPEROR-Preserved showed a significant benefit of the SGLT2i, empagliflozin, in patients with symptomatic HF, with LVEF > 40% and elevated natriuretic peptides. The 21% reduction in the primary composite endpoint of time to HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death was driven mostly by a significant 29% reduction in time to HF hospitalization (nonsignificant lower cardiovascular death [HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.0]), with no benefit on all-cause mortality. Empagliflozin also resulted in a significant reduction in total HF hospitalizations, decrease in the slope of the eGFR decline, and a modest improvement in QOL at 52 weeks, and the benefit was similar irrespective of the presence or absence of diabetes at baseline. In a subgroup of 1983 patients with LVEF 41% to 49% in EMPEROR-Preserved, empagliflozin reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for HF, and the benefit in the primary endpoint did not have a significant interaction by LVEF subgroups (41%–49%, 50%– < 60%, and ≥ 60%).

### The effect of diabetes on outcomes of patients with advanced heart failure in the BEST trial [^112atnre]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This was a retrospective analysis to determine the effect of diabetes on outcome in patients with advanced heart failure (HF), and to determine the effect of beta-blockade in patients with HF with and without diabetes mellitus.

Background

In chronic HF the impact on clinical outcomes and therapeutic response of the prevalent comorbid condition diabetes mellitus has not been extensively investigated.

Methods

We assessed the impact of diabetes on prognosis and effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy with bucindolol in patients with HF enrolled in the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST). We conducted a retrospective analysis to examine the prognosis of patients with advanced HF with and without diabetes, and the effect of beta-blocker therapy on mortality and HF progression or myocardial infarction (MI). The database was the 2,708 patients with advanced HF (36% with diabetes and 64% without diabetes) who were randomized to the beta-blocker bucindolol or placebo in BEST and followed for mortality, hospitalization, and MI for an average of two years.

Results

Patients with diabetes had more severe chronic HF and more coronary risk factors than patients without diabetes. Diabetes was independently associated with increased mortality in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (adjusted hazard ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.58, p = 0.001), but not in those with a nonischemic etiology (adjusted hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.30, p = 0.89). Compared with patients without diabetes, in diabetic patients beta-blocker therapy was at least as effective in reducing death or HF hospitalizations, total hospitalizations, HF hospitalizations, and MI. Ventricular function and physiologic responses to beta-blockade were similar in patients with and without diabetes.

Conclusions

Diabetes worsens prognosis in patients with advanced HF, but this worsening appears to be limited to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In advanced HF beta-blockade is effective in reducing major clinical end points in patients with and without diabetes.

AACE 2022 diabetes — dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors: DPP-4 inhibitors do not cause weight gain; linagliptin can be administered in chronic kidney disease at full dosage since it is not cleared by the kidneys, whereas sitagliptin, saxagliptin and alogliptin are renally cleared and require appropriate dose adjustment in decreased eGFR. These agents do not have significant gastrointestinal adverse effects and may be used in early combination with metformin. Cardiovascular outcomes trials with DPP-4 inhibitors achieved non-inferiority compared with placebo for major adverse cardiovascular events, and a saxagliptin trial showed increased likelihood of hospitalization for congestive heart failure without increase in mortality; prescribing information advises clinicians to consider the risks and benefits of saxagliptin in patients who have known risk factors.

### Heart failure drug treatment: the fantastic four [^1161cZZx]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

In a recent update from the Heart Failure Association on SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure, dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are recommended to reduce the risk of heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death in HFrEF patients already receiving guideline-directed medical therapy, regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Also in the SGLT2 inhibitor trials, the treatment effect emerged quickly, with the curves diverging within the first month. Such early effects have similarly been observed with the SGLT2 inhibitor sotagliflozin in the SOLOIST-WHF trial that randomized patients with type 2 diabetes after a recent hospitalization for worsening heart failure. Substantial benefit occurred early after randomization regarding the primary endpoint of cardiovascular deaths, total hospitalizations, and urgent visits for heart failure.

In summary, the totality of evidence now suggests that patients with HFrEF should be treated early with a combination of the four drugs: an ARNI, beta-blocker, MRA, and SGLT2 inhibitor in order to benefit from substantial and sustained reductions of mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and symptoms. The important task is now to ensure access to this evidence-based therapy for all HFrEF patients.

### Heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology update on sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors in heart failure [^111RxXaQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

The Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has recently issued a position paper on the role of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in heart failure (HF). The present document provides an update of the position paper, based of new clinical trial evidence. Accordingly, the following recommendations are given:

- Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin empagliflozin, or ertugliflozin are recommended for the prevention of HF hospitalization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease or at high cardiovascular risk.
- Dapagliflozin or empagliflozin are recommended to reduce the combined risk of HF hospitalization and cardiovascular death in symptomatic patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction already receiving guideline-directed medical therapy regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Contributory risk and management of comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome in chronic heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^1177HhaH]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Metformin in heart failure with diabetes mellitus — randomized clinical trials, including a subset of the UKPDS 34 study and a trial of 390 diabetic patients receiving background insulin therapy, have demonstrated metformin-associated reductions in macrovascular events, including MI and all-cause mortality, but no prospective studies assessing the safety and efficacy of metformin in patients with HF have been published; the American Diabetes Association statement specifies, "In patients with stable CHF, metformin may be used if renal function is normal but should be avoided in unstable or hospitalized patients with HF", and current US prescribing guidelines state that metformin should not be used in men with a creatinine level ≥ 1.5 mg/dL and in women with a creatinine level ≥ 1.4 mg/dL; in the United Kingdom, guidelines suggest metformin can be used down to an estimated glomerular filtration of 30 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2 with a dose reduction advised at an estimated glomerular filtration < 45 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2; lactic acidosis risk is a concern, particularly with renal disease.

### Dapagliflozin for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: will the DELIVER study deliver? [^112qnEyc]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug therapies for people with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are often limited to diuretics to improve symptoms as no therapies demonstrate a mortality benefit in this cohort. People with diabetes have a high risk of developing HFpEF and vice versa, suggesting shared pathophysiological mechanisms exist, which in turn engenders the potential for shared treatments. Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor which has demonstrated significantly improved cardiovascular and hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF) outcomes in previous cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs). These CVOTs include the DECLARE-TIMI and DAPA-HF studies which observed significant benefits for people with heart failure and specifically those with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), respectively. The ongoing DELIVER study is evaluating the use of dapagliflozin specifically in people with HFpEF, which may have enormous implications for treatment and considerable economic consequences. This will complement previous and other ongoing CVOTs evaluating dapagliflozin use. In this review we discuss the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in HFrEF and HFpEF with a focus on the DELIVER study and its potential health and economic implications.

### Benefits of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors across the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases [^117EnPNJ]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as a class of medications with positive cardiovascular (CV) effects across a spectrum of patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D). In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, there is clear evidence that SGLT2i reduce hospitalisations and mortality regardless of the presence of diabetes, and they are now recognised as the fourth pillar of pharmacological management. Recent trial data also indicate promising effects in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In patients with T2D and atherosclerotic CV diseases, multiple CV outcomes trials have shown reductions in major adverse CV events. Meta-analysis of these trials also shows lower rates of incident and recurrent atrial fibrillation with SGLT2i. Concerns regarding utilisation in patients with chronic kidney disease have been allayed in trials showing SGLT2i in fact have renoprotective effects. Questions still remain regarding the safety of SGLT2i in the acute heart failure setting and immediately post myocardial infarction, as well as in patients with more advanced stages of chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, studies are underway evaluating SGLT2i in patients with heart valve disease, where positive effects on left ventricular remodelling may, for example, improve functional mitral regurgitation. In this review, we summarise the available evidence of recent CV outcomes trials of SGLT2i, focusing particularly on the application of these agents across various CV diseases. We detail evidence to support increased utilisation of these drugs, which in many cases will reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients routinely encountered by the CV specialist physician.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116JMpZG]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — key medication recommendations: In patients with HFrEF with current or previous symptoms, use of one of the three mortality-proven beta blockers (bisoprolol, carvedilol, sustained-release metoprolol succinate) is recommended to reduce mortality and hospitalizations; in patients with HFrEF and NYHA class II to IV symptoms, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone) is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality if estimated glomerular filtration rate is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and serum potassium is < 5.0 mEq/L, with careful monitoring of potassium, renal function, and diuretic dosing at initiation and thereafter; and in patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF, SGLT2i are recommended to reduce hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular mortality irrespective of the presence of type 2 diabetes.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart failure: a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^117Vnb2n]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

The coexistence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and heart failure (HF), either with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is frequent (30–40% of patients) and associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization, all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality. The most important causes of HF in T2DM are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and a direct detrimental effect of T2DM on the myocardium. T2DM is often unrecognized in HF patients, and vice versa, which emphasizes the importance of an active search for both disorders in the clinical practice. There are no specific limitations to HF treatment in T2DM. Subanalyses of trials addressing HF treatment in the general population have shown that all HF therapies are similarly effective regardless of T2DM. Concerning T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the first-line choice. Sulphonylureas and insulin have been the traditional second- and third-line therapies although their safety in HF is equivocal. Neither glucagon-like preptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk for HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have both shown a significant reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with established CV disease or at risk of CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide an insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, treatment intensification, ACP 2024 guidelines recommend to add a SGLT-2 inhibitor (to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, progression of CKD, and hospitalization due to congestive HF) or GLP-1 agonist (to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, and stroke) to metformin and lifestyle modifications in adult patients with T2DM with inadequate glycemic control.

Power calculations and statistical analysis

Key questions in designing DAPA‐HF were what rate might be anticipated for the novel primary composite endpoint and what treatment effect size is clinically relevant and realistic? The event rate was estimated based on recent trials, particularly PARADIGM‐HF. 32 A treatment effect size of 20% was chosen as clearly clinically relevant and reasonably conservative in light of the ∼30% relative risk reduction in heart failure hospitalization observed in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME, CANVAS and DECLARE–TIMI 58. 7, 8, 9 DAPA‐HF is powered for this treatment effect on the primary composite outcome and not the individual components of the composite, particularly cardiovascular death. Furthermore, for nearly all other plausible scenarios, using the treatment effect sizes observed in DECLARE–TIMI 58 and in the SGLT2 inhibitor trial meta‐analysis, DAPA‐HF has ≥ 80% power to detect a benefit of dapagliflozin. 7, 8, 9

Safety considerations

In view of the safety information collected in prior trials, including DECLARE–TIMI 58, adverse event reporting has been simplified (with agreement of the regulatory authorities) — only serious adverse events, adverse event leading to treatment discontinuation/interruption/dose reduction and adverse event of special interest are collected. Adverse events of interest (in light of the profile of dapagliflozin above and concerns with SGLT2 inhibitors and other diabetes drugs more generally) include volume depletion, renal dysfunction, major hypoglycaemic episodes, fractures, and diabetic ketoacidosis. There is also a regulatory requirement to document amputations as a result of observations in the canagliflozin development programme but not in EMPA‐REG OUTCOME or DECLARE–TIMI 58. 43

Current status

The first enrolment (Visit 1) took place 8 February 2017 and the first randomization (Visit 2) occurred 15 February 2017. Subsequent recruitment in DAPA‐HF was rapid, and randomization was completed 17 August 2018.

### Contributory risk and management of comorbidities of hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome in chronic heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114e4Jxp]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Diabetes pharmacotherapy and heart failure outcomes — Incretin-based therapies (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors), insulin, and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are described with heart failure (HF) endpoints. The safety and efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists have "not been studied extensively in patients with established HF", and although "there were no significant changes with the use of DPP-4 inhibitors in cardiovascular outcomes in large-scale clinical studies", the SAVOR–TIMI 53 trial "showed a 27% increase in hospitalization for HF" with saxagliptin versus placebo; "12.8% of patients had a history of HF at baseline", and the composite risk with saxagliptin was "similar for patients with history of HF compared with patients without a history of HF". A meta-analysis "suggests that DPP-4 inhibitor use is associated with an increased risk of HF". In a randomized trial of "12537 patients" assigned to insulin glargine versus standard care, "rates of cardiovascular outcomes (including HF events) were similar". For sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition, empagliflozin added to standard care "was shown to reduce cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and HF hospitalizations"; "Hospitalization for HF was reduced by 35%; 10% of the patients had pre-existing HF", but "among patients with HF, improvement in clinical outcomes including reductions in mortality, cardiovascular death, or HF hospitalizations did not reach significance", and "There was no measure of LVEF or natriuretic peptides in the trial".

The efficacy and safety of FARXIGA 10 mg were assessed independently in two Phase 3 trials in adult patients with heart failure.

Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF, NCT03036124) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV] with reduced ejection fraction [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 40% or less] to determine whether FARXIGA reduces the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure. Of 4744 patients, 2373 were randomized to FARXIGA 10 mg and 2371 to placebo and were followed for a median of 18 months.

Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the LIVEs of Patients with PReserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER, NCT03619213) was an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients aged ≥ 40 years with heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) with LVEF > 40% and evidence of structural heart disease to determine whether FARXIGA reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure or urgent heart failure visits. Of 6263 patients, 3131 were randomized to FARXIGA 10 mg and 3132 to placebo and were followed for a median of 28 months. The trial included 654 (10%) heart failure patients who were randomized during hospitalization for heart failure or within 30 days of discharge.

Sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors in hospital — "robust evidence supports the use of SGLT inhibitors to further reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic HF across a wide spectrum of left ventricular ejection fractions and with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)", and "evidence now supports initiating or continuing their use in the hospital setting for patients admitted with acute decompensated HF". Multiple trials "have all demonstrated that these medications can be safely started in inpatients". Before initiation, similar clinical stability criteria were used, "consisting of a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of at least 100 mm Hg, no inotropic support for at least 24 hours, no symptoms of hypotension, no increase in intravenous (IV) diuretic agent dose in the previous 6 hours, and no IV vasodilators". Additional trial data "showed that SGLT inhibition augmented urine output and diuretic response", and early initiation "decreased congestion and shortened length of stay; the primary endpoint of diuretic efficiency (cumulative change in weight per cumulative diuretic agent dose) was not met".

### Efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin according to background use of cardiovascular medications… [^114CpRjv]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In patients receiving ACEI/ARBs + β-blockers + diuretics, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death/HHF and of the kidney-specific outcome by 24% and 38%, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of CV and kidney outcomes irrespective of background use of various CV medications without any treatment interaction for key safety events. These data show the clinical benefit and safety of dapagliflozin in a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of background therapy. Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of CV death/HHF regardless of the background use of CV medications, including ACEI/ARBs, β-blockers, diuretics, and MRAs.

The reduction in CV death/HHF with dapagliflozin also did not differ between patients with the concurrent use of all 3 of ACEI/ARBs, β-blockers, and diuretics and those with 2 or fewer of these medications. Even in patients receiving ACEI/ARBs + β-blockers + diuretics, dapagliflozin reduced the risk of CV death/HHF and of the kidney-specific outcome by 24% and 38%, respectively. There were no significant treatment interactions by the concomitant CV medications for adverse events, including symptoms of volume depletion, acute kidney injury, and hyperkalemia. Dapagliflozin consistently reduced the risk of CV death/HHF and progression of kidney disease irrespective of the baseline concurrent use of various CV medications commonly used for HF and kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, with significant reductions in the risk of both even in patients receiving ACEI/ARBs, β-blockers, and diuretics.

The safety profile of dapagliflozin was consistent in patients regardless of their use of these medications. These data support efforts to develop and implement strategies to optimize the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in a broad range of patients with type 2 diabetes regardless of background therapy.

### Empagliflozin vs dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure… [^114ia32y]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Data Sharing Statement SGLT2 indicates SGLT2i indicates sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Shaded area indicate 95% CI. Question What are the comparative outcomes of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin in reducing all-cause mortality and hospitalizations in patients with heart failure. Findings In this cohort study of 28 075 patients with heart failure naive to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor therapy, patients who started using empagliflozin were less likely to experience the primary outcome of composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization compared with those who started using dapagliflozin. All-cause mortality did not differ between exposure groups. There was no difference in mean hemoglobin A1c or adverse events between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, patients who initiated empagliflozin were less likely to experience the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization compared with patients who started dapagliflozin. Additional studies are needed to confirm these finding. For example, carvedilol reduces mortality by 16% relative to metoprolol in patients with heart failure, 2 and chlorthalidone is more potent than hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of essential hypertension. 3 In patients with diabetes, empagliflozin may be associated with greater weight loss. Similarly, among those with HFpEF, patients who received empagliflozin were less likely to experience all-cause mortality or hospitalization compared with those who received dapagliflozin.

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study that used clinical data, patients who initiated empagliflozin were less likely to experience the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization compared with patients who initiated dapagliflozin. These results were determined by differences in rates of hospitalization. Our results suggest that there were possible differences in medication outcomes between specific medications within the SGLT2 inhibitor class. Future studies are needed to clarify potential mechanisms that could explain the observed differences.

### Metformin and thiazolidinedione use in Medicare patients with heart failure… [^114eori2]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Similar increases were seen among patients of all age groups, all races, and both sexes. Conclusions The use of metformin and thiazolidinediones is common and has increased rapidly in Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes and heart failure in direct contrast with explicit warnings against this practice by the Food and Drug Administration. Further studies to establish the safety and effectiveness of this practice are needed to ensure optimal care of patients with diabetes and heart failure. Our objective was to determine the rates of prescription of these medications in a contemporary national sample of Medicare patients discharged after hospitalization for heart failure. Given the high prevalence of diabetes among populations with heart failure, this represents an unexplored area with significant potential implications for the safety of patients with both conditions. The characteristics of the patients in the 2 samples are shown in Table 1. In 1998–1999,
7.

1% of diabetic patients were treated with metformin at hospital discharge. By 2000–2001, metformin was prescribed to 11. 2% of diabetic patients, a relative increase of 61%. In this study of nationally representative samples of hospitalized heart failure patients with diabetes, the use of antihyperglycemic agents not recommended in the package insert in this setting was widespread. This practice nearly doubled between 1998–1999 and 2000–2001, reflecting increasing popularity and familiarity with these agents by prescribing physicians. Use of these drugs in patient populations at particularly high risk for adverse events also increased. Both metformin and thiazolidinediones exert positive effects on cardiovascular risk factors. 17, 19, 20 Metformin also decreases the risk of macrovascular events in overweight patients with newly diagnosed diabetes.

21 Despite these potential advantages, however, the FDA does not support the current patterns of use of insulin sensitizers in patients with diabetes and coexisting heart failure. Until further data clarify the safety and effectiveness of these medications in patients with heart failure, clinicians must practice contrary to explicit recommendations or use a more limited armamentarium in the treatment of diabetes in patients with heart failure. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that elderly, diabetic patients hospitalized with heart failure are commonly treated with antihyperglycemic drugs that are not recommended for patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure. There is a need for all parties interested in safe diabetes treatment to increase awareness of the recommended approach to diabetes in patients with heart failure.

### Impact of diabetes on mortality in patients with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction… [^113pTS1g]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

SAVE was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial that tested whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy with captopril decreases morbidity and mortality in survivors of acute MI. Among the patients with diabetes treated with insulin, peak creatine kinase analysis suggested a possible but nonsignificant trend to a smaller size of presenting infarct but lower LVEF. In univariate analyses, insulin-treated patients had higher total and cardiovascular mortality rates compared with non–insulin-treated patients with diabetes. In multivariate analyses, among the subgroup of patients with diabetes, insulin therapy was a significant predictor of total mortality as well as cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In multivariate analyses captopril significantly decreased total mortality as well as cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Furthermore, the significant benefit of captopril was similar among patients with and without diabetes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are of clear benefit among patients with diabetes in reducing subsequent risks of major cardiovascular events as well as to slow their deterioration of renal function. In these data, captopril had a similar relative benefit among patients with and without diabetes and a similar absolute benefit among nondiabetic patients compared with patients with diabetes. In addition in that study, there was no evidence for adverse cardiovascular outcomes for patients receiving insulin or sulfonylurea therapy.

In another recently reported randomized trial, patients at risk of development of diabetes assigned to sulfonylurea treatment had a 34% risk reduction, but those assigned to sulfonylurea treatment and therapeutic life style changes had a 68% risk reduction. 37.

### Antidiabetic use in patients with diabetes and heart failure… [^112VPKC7]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

Background: Although heart failure is a common comorbidity in patients with diabetes, the optimal therapy is highly controversial. Survival in patients with heart failure has been linked to individual antidiabetic agents and to tight glycemic control, regardless of the agent used. Eurich and colleagues evaluated the association between diabetic therapy and outcomes in patients with diabetes and heart failure. Insulin was associated with worse outcomes in at least three large studies. In the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement trial, 168 patients treated with insulin had significantly increased rates of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with 328 patients treated with diet and a sulfonylurea or metformin.

Similarly, data from the Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity study showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or hospital admission for heart failure in patients treated with insulin compared with patients treated with other antidiabetic therapies. Data from a third study of patients referred to a university medical center showed an unadjusted risk ratio for all-cause mortality of 3. 42 at one year in patients treated with insulin compared with those not treated with insulin. Conversely, a retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients with heart failure discharged from the hospital found no excessive mortality risk associated with insulin therapy. The pooled effect of the metformin studies suggests a statistically significant reduction in hospital admission rates.

A large retrospective cohort study of hospitalized Medicare patients and a study of administrative records reported significantly lower all-cause mortality and readmission for heart failure in patients treated with metformin. The pooled effect of the thiazolidinedione studies suggests a reduced all-cause mortality rate, but an increased risk of hospital readmission for heart failure. Conclusion: The authors conclude that, based on evidence mainly from observational studies, metformin is the only therapy studied that was not associated with harm in patients with heart failure and diabetes. They stress the urgent need for more research in this area because of the growing number of patients with diabetes and heart failure.
