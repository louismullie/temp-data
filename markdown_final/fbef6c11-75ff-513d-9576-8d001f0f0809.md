## Question

Edoxaban vs. dual antiplatelet therapy post TAVR

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how edoxaban compares to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients without an indication for chronic anticoagulation, including effects on leaflet thrombosis, cerebral embolism, clinical outcomes, and bleeding, and what the practical implications are for care. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why this question matters. Then, I should verify the pivotal randomized trial (ADAPT-TAVR) and its primary and secondary endpoints. Next, I will examine dose-stratified analyses and imaging substudies. After that, I should review meta-analyses and guideline positions to contextualize the findings. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight uncertainties and ongoing research.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this comparison is important. Patients undergoing TAVR face competing risks of thromboembolism — including subclinical leaflet thrombosis — and major bleeding, and the optimal antithrombotic strategy in those without a separate indication for anticoagulation remains unsettled, with prior guidance often defaulting to DAPT for 3–6 months followed by aspirin monotherapy, albeit with limited direct evidence at the time [^114QhotF] [^113MLDRN].

> I will now examine the pivotal randomized evidence. The ADAPT-TAVR trial enrolled 229 patients without an indication for chronic anticoagulation and compared edoxaban (30–60 mg daily) versus DAPT (aspirin 100 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily) for 6 months, with 4D-CT–assessed leaflet thrombosis as the primary endpoint and brain MRI lesions and neurocognitive outcomes as key secondary endpoints. Wait, let me verify the primary result: edoxaban reduced leaflet thrombosis numerically but the difference did not reach statistical significance (9.8% vs 18.4%; absolute difference −8.5%; 95% CI −17.8% to 0.8%; P = 0.076), so the primary endpoint was neutral [^115HnZDX] [^1121iLjy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check dose-stratified analyses. A prespecified subgroup analysis showed that standard-dose edoxaban (60 mg) significantly reduced leaflet thrombosis versus DAPT (2.4% vs 18.3%; OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01–0.55; P = 0.03), whereas low-dose edoxaban (30 mg) did not (15.0% vs 18.3%; OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.32–1.81; P = 0.58). This dose-response pattern strengthens the biological plausibility that effective anticoagulation mitigates HALT, even though the overall trial was underpowered for the primary endpoint [^113DfSip].

> Next, I should review cerebral embolic and neurocognitive outcomes. I need to ensure we don't over-interpret imaging signals. New cerebral lesions on brain MRI were not significantly different between edoxaban and DAPT (25.0% vs 20.2%; difference 4.8%, 95% CI −6.4% to 16.0%), and there were no differences in serial neurological or neurocognitive function, suggesting that the reduction in leaflet thrombosis did not translate into measurable short-term neurological benefits in this cohort [^115HnZDX] [^1121iLjy].

> I should double-check bleeding and safety. The ADAPT-TAVR trial reported no significant difference in any or major bleeding between edoxaban and DAPT, which is reassuring in this specific population and regimen, although the trial was not powered for bleeding and patients were carefully selected, so generalizability requires caution [^115HnZDX] [^1121iLjy].

> Let me consider the broader evidence base to avoid overgeneralization. Meta-analyses of randomized trials in patients without an indication for anticoagulation show that DOAC strategies (including rivaroxaban and apixaban) reduce valve thrombosis on imaging but increase all-cause mortality, largely driven by noncardiovascular deaths, without reducing ischemic stroke, reinforcing that imaging benefits do not reliably translate into clinical net benefit. GALILEO with rivaroxaban was terminated early for harm, and ATLANTIS with apixaban was neutral for clinical outcomes despite less valve thrombosis on CT, which aligns with the ADAPT-TAVR signal of no clinical outcome advantage for edoxaban [^112dj3RJ] [^111t4TML] [^1135z5wc].

> But wait, what if the issue is timing or mechanism rather than anticoagulation per se? I should review mechanistic and durability data. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis is common after TAVR and can evolve from fibrin-rich acute thrombus to fibrotic pannus, and while anticoagulation can reduce early HALT, its impact on long-term valve durability and clinical events remains unproven; moreover, HALT in ADAPT-TAVR was not associated with worse hemodynamics at 6 months, tempering immediate clinical concern despite biological plausibility [^114PDfpK] [^111hZLvX].

> Next, I should review guideline direction to ensure alignment. Contemporary guidance emphasizes minimizing bleeding in patients without an anticoagulation indication, with a preference for single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) rather than DAPT, and does not recommend routine anticoagulation solely to prevent leaflet thrombosis. This reflects the lack of demonstrated clinical benefit and the consistent signal of more bleeding with intensified strategies, including DAPT and DOAC-based regimens, in this population [^114QhotF] [^112pyefV].

> I will now examine practical implications and risk stratification. For patients without an indication for chronic anticoagulation, SAPT with aspirin is preferred over DAPT given lower bleeding without loss of ischemic protection, and edoxaban should not be used routinely after TAVR in this scenario. If a patient has documented HALT with elevated gradients or symptoms, a time-limited course of anticoagulation may be considered case-by-case, balancing bleeding risk and evidence gaps, but routine DOAC therapy solely to prevent subclinical thrombosis is not supported [^114QhotF] [^112pyefV] [^1138AawW].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing nuances if edoxaban is ever considered off-label. In ADAPT-TAVR, the signal of benefit was with standard-dose edoxaban (60 mg), not low-dose (30 mg), and dose reductions in edoxaban are indicated for renal impairment, low body weight, or interacting drugs; importantly, in AF patients after TAVR, ENVISAGE-TAVI AF showed edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin for a composite outcome but increased major bleeding, especially gastrointestinal bleeding, underscoring the fragility of the bleeding balance in this elderly population [^113DfSip] [^112dX6C6] [^113t63Z2].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. In patients without an indication for chronic anticoagulation after TAVR, edoxaban is not superior to DAPT for reducing leaflet thrombosis in the overall analysis, shows a promising signal only with standard-dose edoxaban in a subgroup, does not reduce cerebral embolic lesions or improve neurocognitive outcomes, and is not recommended as routine therapy. Current best practice favors SAPT, reserving anticoagulation for selected cases with evidence of clinically significant HALT/RLM or other indications, pending larger trials that link imaging findings to hard outcomes [^115HnZDX] [^113DfSip] [^114QhotF] [^112pyefV].

Edoxaban is **not superior to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)** for preventing leaflet thrombosis or cerebral embolism after TAVR in patients without an indication for anticoagulation [^115HnZDX]. While edoxaban reduced leaflet thrombosis numerically (9.8% vs 18.4% with DAPT), the difference was not statistically significant [^115HnZDX]. There was also **no significant difference** in new cerebral lesions, neurological or neurocognitive outcomes, or major bleeding between groups [^115HnZDX]. Given the lack of clinical benefit and potential bleeding risk, edoxaban should not replace DAPT as standard post-TAVR therapy in patients without an anticoagulation indication [^115vPjLJ].

## Clinical trial evidence

### ADAPT-TAVR trial

- **Design**: Multicenter, open-label, randomized trial comparing edoxaban (30–60 mg daily) vs DAPT (aspirin 100 mg + clopidogrel 75 mg daily) for 6 months after successful TAVR in patients without an anticoagulation indication [^115HnZDX].

- **Primary endpoint**: Incidence of leaflet thrombosis on 4D-CT at 6 months [^115HnZDX].

- **Results**: Leaflet thrombosis occurred in 9.8% with edoxaban vs 18.4% with DAPT (absolute difference −8.5%; 95% CI −17.8% to 0.8%; P = 0.076) — not statistically significant [^115HnZDX].

- **Secondary endpoints**: No significant differences in new cerebral lesions on MRI (25.0% vs 20.2%), neurological or neurocognitive dysfunction, or major bleeding [^115HnZDX].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Leaflet thrombosis**: Edoxaban showed a numerical reduction but did not significantly outperform DAPT in preventing leaflet thrombosis [^115HnZDX].

- **Cerebral embolism**: No significant difference in new cerebral lesions or neurological outcomes, suggesting no clear reduction in cerebral embolism risk with edoxaban [^115HnZDX].

- **Bleeding risk**: No significant difference in major bleeding, but edoxaban's anticoagulant effect inherently carries a bleeding risk that must be weighed against limited clinical benefit [^115HnZDX].

## Comparison with other antithrombotic strategies

| **Antithrombotic strategy** | **Leaflet thrombosis incidence** | **Cerebral embolism incidence** | **Major bleeding incidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Edoxaban (ADAPT-TAVR) | 9.8% | 25.0% (new cerebral lesions) | Not significantly different |
| DAPT (ADAPT-TAVR) | 18.4% | 20.2% (new cerebral lesions) | Not significantly different |
| Rivaroxaban (GALILEO) | Lower HALT incidence but higher death/thromboembolism | Not specified | Higher major bleeding |
| Apixaban (ATLANTIS) | Lower valve thrombosis but no clinical outcome benefit | Not specified | Similar major bleeding |

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines recommend **DAPT for 3–6 months** followed by lifelong single antiplatelet therapy in patients without an anticoagulation indication [^114QhotF] [^112GrjLH]. Edoxaban is **not recommended** as a routine alternative to DAPT in this setting [^115vPjLJ].

---

## Limitations and future research

- **Sample size**: ADAPT-TAVR was underpowered; larger trials are needed to confirm findings [^115HnZDX].

- **Patient selection**: Excluded patients with anticoagulation indications, limiting generalizability [^115HnZDX].

- **Long-term outcomes**: Longer follow-up is needed to assess durability and clinical impact of leaflet thrombosis reduction [^1138AawW].

---

Edoxaban is **not superior to DAPT** for preventing leaflet thrombosis or cerebral embolism after TAVR in patients without an anticoagulation indication. There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes or major bleeding, so edoxaban should not replace DAPT as standard therapy in this population [^115HnZDX].

### Edoxaban versus standard of care and their effects on clinical outcomes in patients having undergone transcatheter aortic valve implantation in atrial fibrillation-rationale and design of the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^115yWKH6]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation, also called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), is the treatment of choice for patients with severe aortic stenosis and intermediate to high operative risk. A significant portion of TAVR patients have atrial fibrillation (AF) requiring chronic oral anticoagulation. In moderate- to high-risk AF patients, the direct factor Xa inhibitor edoxaban is noninferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for prevention of stroke or systemic embolism with less bleeding and cardiovascular deaths. ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (NCT02943785) is a multinational, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point evaluation study comparing edoxaban to VKA-based therapy in approximately 1,400 patients with an indication for chronic oral anticoagulation after successful transfemoral TAVR. The coprimary end points are to assess the differential effects of the 2 treatments (a) on net adverse clinical events (the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, and major bleeding events) and (b) on major bleeding. Twelve hours to 5 days after successful TAVR, patients will be randomized to 60 mg daily oral edoxaban or any VKA (international normalized ratio: 2.0–3.0 or 1.6–2.6 [numbers inclusive] in Japan if age ≥ 70 years). Antiplatelet therapy may be administered per physician's discretion. Randomization will be stratified by edoxaban dose reduction (per local label). Treatment duration will be up to 36 months. The study is powered (80%) to detect noninferiority (margin for the hazard ratio: 1.38) for the composite primary end points, followed by superiority testing.

### Edoxaban versus dual antiplatelet therapy for leaflet thrombosis and cerebral thromboembolism after TAVR: the ADAPT-TAVR randomized clinical trial [^115HnZDX]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

It is unknown whether the direct oral anticoagulant edoxaban can reduce leaflet thrombosis and the accompanying cerebral thromboembolic risk after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. In addition, the causal relationship of subclinical leaflet thrombosis with cerebral thromboembolism and neurological or neurocognitive dysfunction remains unclear.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, open-label randomized trial comparing edoxaban with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) in patients who had undergone successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement and did not have an indication for anticoagulation. The primary end point was an incidence of leaflet thrombosis on 4-dimensional computed tomography at 6 months. Key secondary end points were the number and volume of new cerebral lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging and the serial changes of neurological and neurocognitive function between 6 months and immediately after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Results

A total of 229 patients were included in the final intention-to-treat population. There was a trend toward a lower incidence of leaflet thrombosis in the edoxaban group compared with the dual antiplatelet therapy group (9.8% versus 18.4%; absolute difference, -8.5% [95% CI, -17.8% to 0.8%]; P = 0.076). The percentage of patients with new cerebral lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (edoxaban versus dual antiplatelet therapy, 25.0% versus 20.2%; difference, 4.8%; 95% CI, -6.4% to 16.0%) and median total new lesion number and volume were not different between the 2 groups. In addition, the percentages of patients with worsening of neurological and neurocognitive function were not different between the groups. The incidence of any or major bleeding events was not different between the 2 groups. We found no significant association between the presence or extent of leaflet thrombosis with new cerebral lesions and a change of neurological or neurocognitive function.

Conclusions

In patients without an indication for long-term anticoagulation after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement, the incidence of leaflet thrombosis was numerically lower with edoxaban than with dual antiplatelet therapy, but this was not statistically significant. The effects on new cerebral thromboembolism and neurological or neurocognitive function were also not different between the 2 groups. Because the study was underpowered, the results should be considered hypothesis generating, highlighting the need for further research.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): a network meta-analysis [^116nCcEL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Balancing the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains clinically challenging. Questions regarding the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after TAVR still need to be definitively answered.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs after TAVR in individuals with and without indication for anticoagulation.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 7 October 2023 together with reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NOACs versus antiplatelet therapy or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR in adults with or without an indication for anticoagulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods and conducted random-effects pair-wise analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs). Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and major bleeding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included four RCTs with 4808 participants in the NMA. Of these, one compared rivaroxaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared apixaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation or versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared edoxaban versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; and one compared edoxaban with antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR. The mean age of trial participants was 81 years. Follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 18 months. Overall, we judged the risk of bias in the included trials to be low in all domains except for blinding, which was assessed as high in all four studies. No studies evaluated dabigatran. In people without an indication for anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality after TAVR as compared to antiplatelet therapy (rivaroxaban: risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.46; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence; apixaban: RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.02; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence), while edoxaban may result in little or no difference (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.36; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality (rivaroxaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.10; studies = 1, participants = 1644; apixaban: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.65; studies = 1, participants = 1049; edoxaban: RR 7.44, 95% CI 0.39 to 142.38; studies = 1, participants = 229) and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke (rivaroxaban: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00; studies = 1, participants = 1644; edoxaban: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.42; studies = 1, participants = 229). While rivaroxaban versus antiplatelets probably increases major bleeding after TAVR (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.65; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence), there may be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.64; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if edoxaban has an effect on major bleeding, although the point estimate suggests increased bleeding (versus antiplatelets: RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.30; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). In people with an indication for anticoagulation, low-certainty evidence suggests apixaban or edoxaban may result in little to no difference in our predefined primary efficacy outcomes after TAVR when compared to VKA (all-cause mortality: apixaban: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20; studies = 1, participants = 1426; cardiovascular mortality: apixaban: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.57; studies = 1, participants = 1426; stroke: apixaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; studies = 1, participants = 1426). While apixaban may result in a similar rate of bleeding as VKA in this population, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding after TAVR in people with an indication for anticoagulation (apixaban: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.54; studies = 1, participants = 451; low-certainty evidence; edoxaban: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; studies = 1, participants = 1426; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In people without an indication for oral anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality when compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban may result in little or no difference. There might be little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality, and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke. While rivaroxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR, there might be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and the effect of edoxaban on major bleeding remains unclear. In people with an indication for anticoagulation, apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as VKA in preventing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and stroke. Apixaban may lead to a similar rate of major bleeding as VKA in this population. However, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR when compared to VKA. Our NMA did not show superiority of one NOAC over another for any of the primary outcomes. Head-to-head trials directly comparing NOACs against each other are required to increase the certainty of the evidence.

### Comparing major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving edoxaban versus warfarin after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: results from the randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^117XSD6H]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Study Design and Patients

The detailed study design for the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF trial was previously reported. Briefly, ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF was a prospective, randomized, controlled, open‐label, adjudicator‐masked trial comparing edoxaban with VKAs in patients with prevalent or incident AF after successful TAVR. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years with AF after successful TAVR for severe aortic stenosis. Successful TAVR was defined as the implantation of any approved transcatheter bioprosthetic aortic valve into the proper anatomic location with the intended valve performance and without unresolved periprocedural complications. Patients identified to be at high risk of bleeding due to existing conditions (active peptic ulcer with upper gastrointestinal bleeding within the 90 days before randomization, malignancy, recent brain or spinal surgery, arteriovenous malformations) or dealing with serious unresolved periprocedural complications were excluded from this analysis. An indication for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for > 3 months was also an exclusion criterion.

The trial was conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonization and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the ethics committees and corresponding health authorities for all sites. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed all serious adverse events to ensure patients' safety.

Study Drug

Patients were randomized 1:1 to either edoxaban or VKAs 12 hours to 7 days after successful TAVR for severe aortic stenosis. Patients randomized to edoxaban received 60 mg once daily or 30 mg once daily if any of the dose adjustment criteria were met (creatinine clearance of ≤ 50 mL/min, body weight ≤ 60 kg [not used as a dose reduction criterion in US patients], or concomitant therapy with certain P‐glycoprotein inhibitors [not used as a dose reduction criterion in US patients]). The study sponsor supplied edoxaban to the sites, and VKAs were supplied according to local practice. The target international normalized ratio for patients randomized to the VKA arm was 2.0 to 3.0; this range was adjusted to 1.6 to 2.6 for patients aged ≥ 70 years in Japan. Prespecified use of an antiplatelet therapy in addition to edoxaban or VKAs was permitted and at the discretion of each treating physician.

### Edoxaban versus dual antiplatelet therapy for leaflet thrombosis and cerebral thromboembolism after TAVR: the ADAPT-TAVR randomized clinical trial [^1121iLjy]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

The study ADAPT-TAVR was published by Duk-Woo Park and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the ADAPT-TAVR study, the trial question was: is edoxaban superior to dual antiplatelet therapy in patients who had undergone successful TAVR? In the ADAPT-TAVR study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ADAPT-TAVR study, the population was: 229 patients (133 female, 96 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients without an indication for long-term anticoagulation who had undergone successful TAVR for severe aortic stenosis. The key exclusion criteria were indication for anticoagulation; absolute indication for dual antiplatelet therapy; severe renal insufficiency prohibiting CT imaging. In the ADAPT-TAVR study, the interventions were: n = 111 edoxaban (30–60 mg once daily for 6 months) n = 118 dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin at 100 mg once daily plus clopidogrel at 75 mg once daily for 6 months). In the ADAPT-TAVR study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in leaflet thrombosis at 6 months (9.8% vs. 18.4%; ARD -8.5, 95% CI -17.8 to 0.8). In the ADAPT-TAVR study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in patients with new cerebral lesions (25% vs. 20.2%; AD 4.8%, 95% CI -6.4 to 16) No significant difference in patients with worsening of serial neurological testing (5% vs. 3.7%; AD 1.3%, 95% CI -4.3 to 6.9) No significant difference in patients with worsening of neurocognitive function (30% vs. 22.2%; AD 7.8%, 95% CI -4.2 to 19.7). In the ADAPT-TAVR study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in any or major bleeding events. In the ADAPT-TAVR study, the conclusion was: in adult patients without an indication for long-term anticoagulation who had undergone successful TAVR for severe aortic stenosis, edoxaban was not superior to dual antiplatelet therapy with respect to leaflet thrombosis at 6 months.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between VKAs and DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111yu44B]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior and new atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with severe AS receiving TAVR, and AF is associated with increased mortality and adverse ischemic and bleeding events. Warfarin is the main anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in patients with AF, but it has disadvantages such as narrow treatment window, variable dose–response, interaction with drugs and food, and the need for international normalized ratio (INR) detection. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that DOAC is as good or better than warfarin for antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF. The guidelines recommend DOACs as the first choice for anticoagulant therapy in patients with DOACs indications.DOACs are increasingly being used in place of warfarin, but the evidence for their effectiveness and safety in patients with valvular AF remains limited. The 2021 ESC/EACTS (European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery) guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease recommend that patients with TAVR without anticoagulant indications receive single antiplatelet drug therapy for life after 3–6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (Class I recommendation, Level A evidence). In addition, lifetime anticoagulant therapy is recommended for patients with anticoagulant indications (Class I recommendation, Level B evidence). Due to the scarcity of data on patients after TAVR, no strong anticoagulation recommendations have been made so far. The ATLANTIS (Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke) trial failed to demonstrate the superiority of full‐dose apixaban over the current standard of treatment in patients with or without indications for oral anticoagulants, apixaban was not different from standard care for the primary endpoint of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, intracardiac or valvular thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, or major bleeding. The ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of edoxaban and VKAs in AF patients after TAVR. The results showed that edoxaban was not inferior to VKA in terms of combined adverse events, but increased the risk of major bleeding.

Compared with VKAs, the effect of DOACs on AF after TAVR has not been thoroughly studied, so we conducted a meta‐analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of VKAs and DOACs in patients with AF after TAVR.

### Post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement antithrombotic treatment in nonindicated patients: updated systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111NYJ1X]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a minimally invasive and efficient approach for treating symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis who were considered high risk for traditional surgery. However, concerns regarding potential complications persist, ranging from thromboembolic events (eg, valve thrombosis) as well as bleeding caused by post-TAVR treatment to risks of mortality and cardiac death. This complexity makes post-TAVR antithrombotic therapy uniquely challenging, mainly as TAVR is currently used for patients with low surgical risk and those with no clear indication for anticoagulation. Recent evidence has shown that single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with aspirin offers more significant benefits than dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel by preventing ischemic complications and reducing the risk of bleeding in patients with no prior need for oral anticoagulants (OACs). The American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines recommend lifelong SAPT, preferably aspirin, as a class 2A strategy for post-TAVR patients without anticoagulation indications. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) consistently suggests lifelong SAPT with aspirin or clopidogrel with a Class I recommendation for patients without a clear OAC indication. However, growing concerns about antiplatelet insufficiency in managing post-TAVR valve thrombosis have shifted attention to OACs, particularly vitamin K antagonists (VKA), which have proven more effective than DAPT in preventing valve thrombosis. Additionally, several studies have explored the benefits of direct OACs (DOAC) such as edoxaban, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dual-agent therapy with rivaroxaban plus aspirin following TAVR, especially in reducing the risk of valve thrombosis. While DOACs effectively alleviated the risk of post-TAVR valve thrombosis, they did not show superiority over VKAs or antiplatelets in patients without clinical indications for OAC. Given the ongoing debates in this field, we aimed to utilize a comprehensive network meta-analysis to determine the safety and efficacy of different post-TAVR antithrombotic therapies in patients without a clear indication for anticoagulation.

### Comparing major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving edoxaban versus warfarin after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: results from the randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^1168BYgL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this subanalysis of the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF trial, MGIB occurred in 6.0% of patients with prevalent or incident AF after successful TAVR, with only 1 MGIB event being fatal. There was a higher risk of MGIB events in patients with AF receiving edoxaban compared with those receiving VKAs after TAVR, and most MGIB events occurred during the first 6 months after randomization. Patients with a recent PCI are at a higher risk of MGIB due to use of antiplatelet therapy on top of oral anticoagulant therapy, so physicians may need to tailor oral anticoagulant therapy to each patient. Given its impact on morbidity and death, a priori identification of predictors of MGIB may help with the optimization of TAVR outcomes.

### Low-or standard-dose edoxaban versus antiplatelet therapy for leaflet thrombus and cerebral thromboembolism after TAVR: a prespecified analysis of randomized ADAPT-TAVR trial [^113DfSip]. American Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The risks of leaflet thrombosis and the associated cerebral thromboembolism are unknown according to different anticoagulation dosing after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The aim was to evaluate the incidence of leaflet thrombosis and cerebral thromboembolism between low-dose (30 mg) or standard-dose (60 mg) edoxaban and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after TAVR.

Methods

In this prespecified subgroup analysis of the ADAPT-TAVR trial, the primary endpoint was the incidence of leaflet thrombosis on 4-dimensional computed tomography at 6-months. Key secondary endpoints were new cerebral lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging and neurological and neurocognitive dysfunction.

Results

Of 229 patients enrolled in this study, 118 patients were DAPT group and 111 were edoxaban group (43 [39.1%] 60 mg vs 68 [61.3%] 30 mg). There was a significantly lower incidence of leaflet thrombosis in the standard-dose edoxaban group than in the DAPT group (2.4% vs 18.3%; odds ratio [OR] 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01–0.55; P = 0.03). However, no significant difference was observed between low-dose edoxaban and DAPT (15.0% vs 18.3%; OR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.32–1.81; P = 0.58). Irrespective of different antithrombotic regiments, the percentages of patients with new cerebral lesions on brain MRI and worsening neurological or neurocognitive function were not significantly different.

Conclusions

In patients without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR, the incidence of leaflet thrombosis was significantly lower with standard-dose edoxaban but not with low-dose edoxaban, as compared with DAPT. However, this differential effect of edoxaban on leaflet thrombosis was not associated with a reduction of new cerebral thromboembolism and neurological dysfunction.

### Optimal antithrombotic strategy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: is the "Less is more" concept always better? [^116edhPj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

However, is "less‐is‐more" concept (ie, less potent, more benefit) always better for TAVR recipients? Given that reported incidence of life‐threatening or disabling bleeding was approximately > 2 times than those of stroke or transient ischemic attack after TAVR, 16 RCTs adopting bleeding events (even including minor) or net adverse clinical events as primary outcome can always achieve positive primary results with less potent antithrombotic regimens in the contemporary TAVR settings. 9, 12, 13 However, it is still questioned whether there is really a benefit to net clinical benefit in testing antithrombotics in complex TAVR population (ie, older age, a high burden of atherosclerotic comorbidities, and vulnerable to both ischemic and bleeding events). 17 Recent PARTNER‐3 (the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves) trial reported that leaflet thrombosis was more frequent after TAVR than after surgical aortic valve replacement and also late valve thrombosis was much more common after TAVR. 18, 19 Given that OAC is more effective than SAPT or DAPT for prevention or treatment of leaflet thrombosis, a tailored antithrombotic strategy more adequate in balancing both thrombotic and bleeding events is required and may be more optimal rather than simple "less‐is‐more" strategy with SAPT (only targeting for bleeding events) after TAVR. In addition, the clinical impact of leaflet thrombosis on thromboembolic complications and structural valve degeneration needs further research. Regarding this important issue, there are several ongoing RCTs to address optimal antithrombotic strategies after TAVR (Figure). The release of the key results of such consecutive RCTs can provide compelling scientific evidence to resolve the clinical unmet needs for optimal antithrombotic regimens in patients undergoing TAVR. In addition, our upcoming ADAPT‐TAVR (Anticoagulation Versus Dual Antiplatelet Therapy for Prevention of Leaflet Thrombosis and Cerebral Embolization After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) trial (NCT03284827) will provide valuable insight into mechanisms underlying the association of leaflet thrombosis and cerebral thromboembolic events as well as the therapeutic effects ofNOAC (non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants) (edoxaban). 20

### Comparing major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving edoxaban versus warfarin after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: results from the randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^1151AyJq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) offer several advantages over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), including enhanced safety profiles, effectiveness, and practicality.NOACs are associated with a reduced risk of hemorrhagic stroke, all‐cause death, and intracranial hemorrhage when compared with VKAs. As a result, NOACs are currently recommended over VKAs as first‐line therapy in patients with nonvalvular AF. A meta‐analysis of 4 randomized trials comparing the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin revealed higher rates of major gastrointestinal bleeding (MGIB) with NOACs versus VKAs. After successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), patients who are older and frail generally have worse outcomes with MGIB versus without MGIB, including death.

The NOAC edoxaban is an oral, reversible, direct factor Xa inhibitor, recently shown in the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) randomized trial to be noninferior to VKAs with regards to the composite primary efficacy end point of net adverse clinical events, including thromboembolic and bleeding complications, in patients with prevalent or incident AF who underwent successful TAVR. However, edoxaban versus VKA use was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding, exclusively driven by a higher rate of MGIB. This on‐treatment analysis evaluated the incidence, predictors, and impact of MGIB among patients in the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF trial.

### Transcatheter aortic valve durability: focus on structural valve deterioration [^114haCBA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Overall, it is important to note that no clear clinical benefit of anticoagulation for the prevention of SLT has been demonstrated so far. While anticoagulant strategies may help mitigate the risk of leaflet thrombosis and potentially reduce the incidence of BVD, these benefits must be carefully weighed against the increased risk of bleeding events, particularly in frail, older, and comorbid populations, where the bleeding risk may outweigh any theoretical advantages. Recent research by our group has demonstrated that the inhibition of secondary hemostasis by OAC over primary hemostasis disorder may hamper the hemostatic process extensively, resulting in an increase in the prevalence of bleeding complications. Finding the optimal antithrombotic regimen after TAVR involves striking a balance between reducing the thrombotic burden and minimizing the bleeding risk. On a pragmatic approach, point‐of‐care assays such as closure time with adenosine diphosphate monitoring may serve as a useful tool to tailor and adjust the risk of antithrombotic therapy after TAVR. The current guidelines on antithrombotic treatment following TAVRare summarized in Figure 3. For patients without a concurrent indication for OAC, a single antiplatelet strategy is recommended if no percutaneous coronary intervention has been recently performed, and routine use of OAC is not indicated. If percutaneous coronary intervention was performed within the past 3 months, dual antiplatelet therapy is suggested for a duration tailored to patient and interventional characteristics, but it should be as short as possible (1–6 months) due to the high bleeding risk. For patients without another indication for OAC, further studies are required to explore alternative strategies, including the use of OAC at a lower dose or for a short period (as is frequently done after SAVR), followed by either no treatment or single antiplatelet therapy. In patients with a concurrent indication for anticoagulation, OAC should be continued after TAVR. If recent percutaneous coronary intervention was performed, single antiplatelet therapy should be added for 1 to 6 months, depending on patient and interventional characteristics. The choice between DOACs and VKAs in this context remains controversial. While several observational studies concluded that DOACs are associated with lower mortality rates and fewer bleeding events than VKAs, the randomized controlled trial ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF found a higher incidence of bleeding with edoxaban compared with VKA. Interestingly, patients who received a low dose of edoxaban (30 mg once daily) demonstrated a similar incidence of major bleeding compared with those treated with VKA. This finding suggests that a lower dose of DOAC may help mitigate the late bleeding risk following TAVR.

2 METHODS

2.1 Search strategy

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for pertinent studies published before September 28, 2021 using the following words: "DOAC OR NOAC OR anticoagulants OR edoxaban OR apixaban OR rivaroxaban OR dabigatran" AND "bioprosthesis OR transcatheter aortic valve OR TAVI OR TAVR". This review was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We retrieved data according to the PICOS framework: Population, patients with TAVR/TAVI; Intervention, NOAC (i.e. apixaban, edoxaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban); Comparison, VKA or warfarin; Outcome, all‐cause mortality or death, stroke, systemic embolism, major or life‐threatening bleeding; and Study type, RCTs or observational studies. There were no restrictions on publication year or language. Additionally, we searched for recent major cardiovascular meetings andfor further potential information.

2.2 Data extractions and risk of bias assessment

Two independent reviewers (L. L. and Y. F. C.) extracted relevant data. The following data were recorded from each trial: experimental design, basic information (sample size, mean age, proportion of males, proportion of AF, CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, HAS‐BLED score, STS score, duration of follow‐up, combination with antiplatelet therapy, and definition of outcomes), and original data (HRs of outcomes). The quality assessment of the studies was done independently by the two authors using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias 2.0 toolfor RCTs and the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus among all the authors.

2.3 Summary measures

The primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality and stroke or systemic embolism. The safety of outcome was major and/or life‐threatening bleeding. Stroke or systemic embolism was defined as transient ischemic attack (TIA), ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, arterial thromboembolism, and cerebrovascular events. We accepted the definition of major and/or life‐threatening bleeding from each study. The hazard ratios of each outcome were extracted for the meta‐analysis.

### Effect of edoxaban versus antiplatelet therapy on leaflet thrombosis and cerebral thromboembolism after TAVI according to major clinical and anatomic factors in prespecified subgroup analysis from the ADAPT-TAVR trial [^111PqKTo]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

It is unknown whether edoxaban versus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has differential treatment effects on leaflet thrombosis, cerebral thromboembolism, and neurologic or neurocognitive dysfunction according to clinical and anatomic factors after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. To investigate the relative effects of edoxaban and DAPT on leaflet and cerebral thromboembolism in patients with major risk factors. The primary end point of this study was the incidence of leaflet thrombosis on computed tomography at 6 months. The secondary end points were new cerebral lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging and neurologic and neurocognitive dysfunction between baseline and 6-month follow-up. Cox regression models assessed the consistency of the treatment effects in the prespecified subgroups. The favorable effect of edoxaban versus DAPT on the leaflet thrombosis was consistent across multiple clinical or anatomic subgroups, without significant interaction between the drug effect and each subgroup (p for interaction for age = 0.597, gender = 0.557, body mass index = 0.866, Society of Thoracic Surgeons score = 0.307, valve type = 0.702, edoxaban reduction criteria = 0.604, and valve morphology = 0.688). However, the incidence of new cerebral lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging and worsening of neurologic and neurocognitive function were not significantly different between the groups among the various key subgroups. The relative effects of edoxaban and DAPT on the risk of leaflet thrombosis, cerebral thromboembolism, and neurologic dysfunction were consistent across a diverse spectrum of clinical or anatomical factors. Further studies are required to define tailored antithrombotic therapy for high-risk groups with specific clinical or anatomic characteristics.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between VKAs and DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cPmhG]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

The choice of antithrombotic strategy after TAVR has been a hotly debated issue in the field. A meta‐analysis by Dr. Ueyama and colleagues included five studies comparing the safety and efficacy of DOACs versus VKAs in TAVR patients with an indication for anticoagulation, and they found that the risk of all‐cause mortality, bleeding, and stroke was similar between DOACs and VKAs. With the publication of RCT studies on antithrombotic strategies after TAVR, most notably the ATLANTIS study and the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF study, we have updated this topic. The ATLANTIS study investigated the feasibility of DOACs as an antithrombotic after TAVR compared to standard regimens. The ATLANTIS study showed that for all patients undergoing TAVR with or without an indication for oral anticoagulation, the efficacy of apixaban after TAVR was not superior to the current standard antithrombotic regimen in terms of net clinical benefit. The ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF study was designed to investigate the efficacy of edoxaban in patients with recurrent or new‐onset AF after TAVR. The primary endpoint event rate was not inferior to the VKAs group in the edoxaban group, but the incidence of major bleeding was higher than in the VKAs group, mainly due to more gastrointestinal bleeding in the edoxaban group. Compared with the previous meta‐analysis, we concluded that anticoagulation with DOACs in patients with TAVR combined with AF may be superior to VKAs, but we need more evidence to prove our point in the future, and the quest for the best antithrombotic treatment option after TAVR will continue.

Our meta‐analysis has several limitations. First, our study included two RCT, one CCT, and eight cohort studies. Although we adopted some quality evaluation methods, bias will inevitably occur, and more RCTs will be needed in the future to verify our conclusions. Second, some studies used antiplatelet drugs combined with anticoagulant therapy, while others did not. Due to limited data, we did not conduct a separate subgroup analysis. Also, we did not conduct a subgroup analysis of the patient population, so the heterogeneity of the patient population should be considered when interpreting the study results. Finally, due to the lack of data, we did not conduct a subgroup analysis of the types of DOACs and could not evaluate the individual category effect of each DOAC.

### Transcatheter aortic valve durability: focus on structural valve deterioration [^116BbSWJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The ENVISAGE‐TAVI (Edoxaban Versus Standard of Care and Their Effects on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial demonstrated the noninferiority of edoxaban versus VKAs in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing TAVR regarding the composite of all‐cause death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, or major bleeding events. More recently, the ATLANTIS (Antithrombotic Strategy After Trans‐Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis) trial compared the use of apixaban with antiplatelets alone or VKAs according to the presence or not of an indication for OAC. While apixaban was not superior to the standard of care in the clinical outcomes, this strategy reduced SLT in the majority of patients undergoing TAVR without established indication for anticoagulation.

A shifting balance: navigating the prothrombotic-to-bleeding risk in transcatheter aortic valve replacement

Antithrombotic therapy following TAVR remains a dynamic and rapidly evolving area of investigation. Recent clinical trials have explored various antithrombotic strategies, aiming to define optimal regimens that balance thromboembolic prevention with bleeding risk while supporting individualized patient care(Table 2). The current focus centers on tailoring early intensive antithrombotic therapy postimplantation while minimizing long-term bleeding risks. The dichotomy between favorable imaging findings and increased clinical adverse events with OAC compared to antiplatelet therapy in patients without a formal indication for OAC has been highlighted by key trials such as the ATLANTIS (Antithrombotic Strategy After Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis) 4D-CT and GALILEO-4D studies. The GALILEO trial examined a rivaroxaban-based regimen for patients without long-term anticoagulation indication. The CT substudy demonstrated a reduction in HALT at 90 days post-TAVR, but the main trial revealed a concerning increase in mortality, thromboembolic events, and bleeding complications compared to an antiplatelet-based strategy. Although the ATLANTIS trial's 4D CT substudy demonstrated that apixaban reduced valve thrombosis compared with antiplatelet therapy, there was a significant increase in noncardiovascular mortality in the apixaban arm in stratum 2 (patients without an indication of OAC) in the main trial reported. These findings should be interpreted with caution and in light of the main ATLANTIS trial results, which showed that apixaban was not superior to the standard of care. The ADAPT-TAVR trial evaluated an edoxaban-based regimen (60 mg or 30 mg daily) vs dual antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of leaflet thrombosis following TAVR. At 6 months, there was an absolute reduction of 8.5% in leaflet thrombosis with edoxaban; but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, the reduction in leaflet thrombosis was not associated with a corresponding decrease in new cerebral lesions on magnetic resonance imaging or improvements in neurological or neurocognitive outcomes. The findings of this trial were limited by being underpowered, constraining the ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding clinical efficacy.

### Edoxaban monotherapy and incidence of transcatheter heart valve leaflet thrombosis-the rotterdam edoxaban (REDOX) study [^112eDLpM]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The REDOX study evaluated the effects of edoxaban monotherapy on the incidence of HALT and RLM at 3 months following TAVI in patients without formal indication for oral anticoagulation. Any HALT occurred in 12.0% and HALT grade ≥ 3 in 4.0%. There were no cases of RLM. Treatment with edoxaban was safe, with only one major bleeding event in the context of a pseudo‐aneurysm.

The 12.0% incidence of any HALT in the REDOX study is comparable to the incidence in the rivaroxaban group of the GALILEO trial (12.4%) and the edoxaban arm of ADAPT TAVR trial (9.8%), and is slightly (albeit not significantly) lower than the incidence in the apixaban group of stratum 2 of the ATLANTIS trial (17.1%). Of note, all patients in GALILEO and 46.2% of patients receiving apixaban in ATLANTIS received concomitant antiplatelet therapy. Importantly, REDOX was not powered to demonstrate a difference between NOACs in the prevention of HALT. In an exploratory analysis we found a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of HALT with edoxaban monotherapy when compared to the control arms receiving single or dual antiplatelet therapy in GALILEO and ATLANTIS. Interestingly, there was no evidence for a statistically significant difference with the dual‐antiplatelet group of the ADAPT TAVR trial. However, more balloon‐expandable valves were used in these randomized trials than in REDOX (GALILEO: 48.2% and 43.9%, ATLANTIS: 47.2% and 48.5%, and ADAPT TAVR: 91% and 90%; vs. 32.8%). A recent meta‐analysis found a 59% higher incidence of SLT including HALT with balloon expandable valves than with self‐expanding valves. Furthermore, the ADAPT TAVR trial was a Korean study and people with a Southeast Asian descent seem to have enhanced pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to most antithrombotic agents, but reduced responsiveness to clopidogrel and edoxaban. This may have affected safety and efficacy outcomes of the ADAPT TAVR.

### Edoxaban monotherapy and incidence of transcatheter heart valve leaflet thrombosis-the rotterdam edoxaban (REDOX) study [^111zBL4z]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis is a rare but serious complication after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). It is associated with increased incidence of stroke and may progress to bioprosthetic valve failure, causing progressive heart failure symptoms and increased mortality. Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (SLT) is more common and can be identified by multislice‐computed tomography (MSCT). SLT covers a spectrum of hypo‐attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) with or without reduced leaflet motion (RLM). Clinical significance of SLT remains unclear, but it has been linked to neurological events, increased transprosthetic gradients and increased rates of symptomatic hemodynamic valve deterioration.

The incidence of SLT after TAVI varies between 2.9% and 40.0%. MSCT substudies of the pivotal TAVI trials suggest a lower incidence in patients on oral anticoagulants. This preventive effect was confirmed by randomized trials in patients without formal indication for oral anticoagulation that compared non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with or without single antiplatelet therapy versus antiplatelet‐based strategies. However, these trials also demonstrated a signal of harm with NOAC through higher mortality and bleeding rates.

In the randomized ADAPT TAVR trial, edoxaban monotherapy was associated with numerically lower SLT rate than dual antiplatelet therapy in a Korean TAVI population.

The Rotterdam Edoxaban (REDOX) study aims to evaluate the impact of edoxaban monotherapy on the incidence of HALT and RLM after TAVI in a western population and to evaluate safety in terms of mortality, ischemic events, and major bleedings.

### Comparing major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving edoxaban versus warfarin after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: results from the randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^1152YJXc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

A low baseline hemoglobin level was associated with increased risk of MGIB in the current study. A systematic review and meta‐analysis of patients undergoing TAVR found baseline anemia was associated with an increased risk of complications after TAVR, such as postprocedural transfusion, acute kidney injury, and death. With anemia being a well‐established predictor of bleeding, low hemoglobin levels may be indicators of patients with increased risk of MGIB in the setting of underlying gastrointestinal pathology, particularly in frail patients undergoing TAVR.

The concomitant use of DAPT in the setting of recent coronary stenting increases the risk of MGIB due to stacking of antithrombotic agents. A nationwide cohort study of Danish patients with AF found that those on triple therapy (DAPT+oral anticoagulation) experienced higher rates of MGIB compared with patients on dual therapy or monotherapy. In the current study, 12.1% of patients with an MGIB event during the study received triple therapy. Most MGIB events occurred in the first 6 months after randomization, which may be due in part to concomitant antiplatelet therapy and oral anticoagulant therapy. Additionally, arteriovenous malformations and acquired von Willebrand disease may contribute to the incidence of MGIB in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Potential strategies that can be used in clinical practice to mitigate stroke and bleeding risk in this vulnerable population include avoiding the use of concomitant oral antiplatelets whenever possible, strict adherence to the edoxaban dose reduction criteria per label instructions, and nonpharmacological approaches.

Finally, smoking is a well‐known risk factor for both stroke and cardiovascular death. Smoking status is also associated with a number of adverse events in patients with AF, including major bleeding and MGIB, irrespective of use of oral anticogulation. In an analysis of the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 trial that investigated predictors, outcomes, and laboratory variables associated with first‐time MGIB events, smoking was one of the strongest independent predictors of MGIB events. This highlights the importance of identifying risk factors to optimize treatment.

### Oral anticoagulation for atrial Fibrillation After TAVR: is vitamin K antagonist still the primary option? [^1118gbuX]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Two recent studies have specifically investigated the use of NOAC in the context of patients with AF after TAVR. The ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (Edoxaban Versus Standard of Care and Their Effects on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation [TAVI]-in Atrial Fibrillation) investigated the effect of edoxaban vs warfarin in 1,426 patients and reported that edoxaban was noninferior to VKA for the primary composite endpoint of net adverse clinical outcomes (death from any cause, myocardial infarction ischemic stroke, systematic thromboembolic event, valve thrombosis, or major bleeding). However, the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding occurred 40% (95% CI: 3%-91%) more frequently among patients receiving edoxaban than among those receiving VKA. This was exclusively related to a 2-fold increase in gastrointestinal (GI) major bleeding (edoxaban, n = 56, vs VKA, n = 27) without any increase in non-GI major bleeding (edoxaban, n = 42, vs VKA, n = 41).

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the better safety profile of VKA in that study: 1) the TAVR population is 10 years older and had more comorbidities than the population included in previous nonvalvular AF studies; 2) VKA was often "subtherapeutic", with only 65% of international normalized ratio values within the therapeutic range; 3) VKA was more frequently discontinued than NOAC (40.5% vs 30.2%); and 4) concomitant use of oral antiplatelet therapy, which was frequent (50% of the study population), was associated with a 60% increase of major bleeding in the NOAC group but not in the VKA group. Importantly, the observation that the increase in major bleeding was exclusively related to an increase in GI bleedings could also suggest a specific role of acquired von Willebrand disease and angiodysplasia in patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR.

Study Limitations

The limitations of the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF trial are published and should be taken into account when interpreting the results of the current subanalysis. Key limitations include the open‐label design, which may have introduced reporting bias, and follow‐up visits affected by the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic since 2020 possibly resulting in unaddressed mild to moderate clinical events. Additionally, the predictors of MGIB identified in this analysis are applicable only to patients with an indication for oral anticoagulation because of AF after successful TAVR. Furthermore, the on‐treatment approach taken in this analysis may fail to capture some drug‐related adverse events that occur after stopping the drug. Finally, it is unknown whether the resumption of oral anticoagulation after MGIB may lead to recurrent bleeding and will require further studies.

### Edoxaban versus vitamin K antagonist for atrial fibrillation after TAVR [^112dX6C6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

The role of direct oral anticoagulants as compared with vitamin K antagonists for atrial fibrillation after successful transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) has not been well studied.

Methods

We conducted a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, adjudicator-masked trial comparing edoxaban with vitamin K antagonists in patients with prevalent or incident atrial fibrillation as the indication for oral anticoagulation after successful TAVR. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of adverse events consisting of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, or major bleeding. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. On the basis of a hierarchical testing plan, the primary efficacy and safety outcomes were tested sequentially for noninferiority, with noninferiority of edoxaban established if the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio did not exceed 1.38. Superiority testing of edoxaban for efficacy would follow if noninferiority and superiority were established for major bleeding.

Results

A total of 1426 patients were enrolled (713 in each group). The mean age of the patients was 82.1 years, and 47.5% of the patients were women. Almost all the patients had atrial fibrillation before TAVR. The rate of the composite primary efficacy outcome was 17.3 per 100 person-years in the edoxaban group and 16.5 per 100 person-years in the vitamin K antagonist group (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 1.31; P = 0.01 for noninferiority). Rates of major bleeding were 9.7 per 100 person-years and 7.0 per 100 person-years, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.91; P = 0.93 for noninferiority); the difference between groups was mainly due to more gastrointestinal bleeding with edoxaban. Rates of death from any cause or stroke were 10.0 per 100 person-years in the edoxaban group and 11.7 per 100 person-years in the vitamin K antagonist group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.11).

Conclusions

In patients with mainly prevalent atrial fibrillation who underwent successful TAVR, edoxaban was noninferior to vitamin K antagonists as determined by a hazard ratio margin of 38% for a composite primary outcome of adverse clinical events. The incidence of major bleeding was higher with edoxaban than with vitamin K antagonists. (Funded by Daiichi Sankyo; ENVISAGE-TAVI AF ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02943785.).

### Sex differences among patients receiving edoxaban vs vitamin K antagonist for atrial fibrillation after TAVR [^115X1oJq]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this secondary analysis of the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial, assessing the impact of sex on the efficacy and safety of edoxaban vs VKA in 1,377 patients with AF after successful TAVR can be summarized as follows
- Women as compared to men were older, less likely to have cardiovascular risk factors or comorbidities, but had higher thromboembolic and surgical preoperative risks;
- Women and men had a similar unadjusted and adjusted risk of ischemic and bleeding complications after TAVR;
- Consistently in both sexes, Edoxaban and VKA had a similar effect on the primary composite endpoint of ischemic and bleeding events;
- Edoxaban was associated with higher risk of major bleeding irrespective of sex; however, the risk increase was attenuated in women

Women represent roughly half of patients undergoing TAVR and are at higher risk of major procedural and post-procedural bleeding, vascular complications and stroke, but have a better survival after TAVR. AF, which is observed in up to 40% of women undergoing TAVR, is associated with an increased hazard of death and stroke. The primacy of oral anticoagulation over antiplatelet agents or placebo in reducing stroke in patients with AF has been established in the context of nonvalvular AF. New oral anticoagulants showed a similar efficacy to VKAs in reducing ischemic events but superior safety, given the lower rate of intracranial bleeding associated with these new agents. With edoxaban, all types of bleeding, including major, intracranial, and life-threatening bleeding were reduced in the setting of non-valvular AFand the extent of these benefits was even larger in women. Yet, an advantage of edoxaban over VKA was not observed in patients with AF after successful TAVR; indeed, in this population edoxaban was noninferior to VKA with regard to the composite outcome of bleeding and ischemic events but was associated with more major bleedings.

### Edoxaban monotherapy and incidence of transcatheter heart valve leaflet thrombosis-the rotterdam edoxaban (REDOX) study [^1138TXL1]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Trials comparing non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) versus antiplatelet-based strategies have shown a reduction of subclinical leaflet thrombosis at the cost of increased mortality and major-bleedings. NOACs were often combined with antiplatelet therapy.

Aims

The Rotterdam Edoxaban (REDOX) study aimed to evaluate the impact of edoxaban monotherapy on the incidence of hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) and reduced leaflet motion (RLM) and to evaluate safety in terms of mortality, thromboembolic events and major bleeding.

Methods

The REDOX study is a single-arm, open-label trial including patients after successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) with no formal indication for oral anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy. Patients received edoxaban monotherapy for 3 months, followed by multislice computed tomography (MSCT). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of HALT. Clinical follow-up continued up to 1 year after TAVI.

Results

We included 58 patients, of which 50 reached study completion including MSCT scanning and eight withdrew consent before end of study. At 3-months follow-up, HALT of any grade was detected in 12.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.0%-23.1%) of patients. HALT grade ≥ 3 occurred in 4.0% (95% CI: 0.8%-12.2%) of patients. At 1 year follow-up, all patients were alive and free of disabling strokes. Three patients had a non-disabling stroke and one patient had a major bleeding.

Conclusions

In the REDOX study, edoxaban monotherapy after TAVI was associated with a 12.0% incidence of any HALT and a 4.0% incidence of HALT grade ≥ 3. HALT was not associated with clinical events.

### Oral anticoagulation for atrial Fibrillation After TAVR: is vitamin K antagonist still the primary option? [^116mNUiS]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the last years, several randomized studies have established transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as the primary treatment option in symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is present in 30% to 40%of those patients, and while it is associated with a higher risk of death and stroke during follow-up, the ideal oral anticoagulation (OAC) management remains to be defined.

POPULAR TAVI(Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) has shown that adding antiplatelet agents to patients requiring OAC, mainly for AF, is not associated with a reduction of the ischemic risk while increasing the risk of bleeding, and such association is no longer recommended.

In patients with AF from a nonvalvular cause, it has been shown that new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), including edoxaban, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and dabigatran, are noninferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent the risk of stroke while being associated with a lower risk of major bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage.

While, based on these findings, it would be very attractive to recommend NOAC in patients with AF after TAVR, only a few hundred of patients included in those studies had a bioprosthetic heart valve. Furthermore, an observational report including 962 patients with AF undergoing TAVR suggested that the use of NOAC (rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) as compared to VKA was associated with a 40% increase in the composite risk of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or any cerebrovascular event. Therefore, the last American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease acknowledged the paucity of data to support the use of NOAC for AF within 3 months after implantation of a surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic heart valve.

### Comparing major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving edoxaban versus warfarin after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: results from the randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^115f4k2G]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants are recommended over vitamin K antagonists in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding may be higher with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists. Patients after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) who are elderly and frail have worse outcomes with major gastrointestinal bleeding (MGIB), including death. This study evaluated incidence, predictors, and impact of MGIB among patients with AF after successful TAVR.

Methods

This on-treatment analysis of ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) included patients who received ≥ 1 dose of the study drug. Demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics were compared between patients with versus without an MGIB event. Cox multivariable regression analysis identified predictors of MGIB.

Results

Of 1377 patients in this analysis, 83 (6.0%) experienced MGIB, with 56 (67.5%) of these patients receiving edoxaban. Patients with versus without MGIB were more likely to have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention ≤ 30days before TAVR (9.6% versus 4.2%; P = 0.03), a higher ejection fraction (mean ± SD, 58.0 ± 10.4 versus 55.3 ± 11.5; P = 0.04), and carotid artery disease (13.3% versus 6.6%; P = 0.04). Edoxaban without dose adjustment versus vitamin K antagonist use (P = 0.003), smoking (P = 0.01), low hemoglobin levels (P < 0.0001), and percutaneous coronary intervention ≤ 30days before TAVR (P = 0.01) emerged as predictors of MGIB.

Conclusions

In this ENVISAGE-TAVI AF subanalysis, MGIB occurred in 6.0% of patients with prevalent or incident AF undergoing TAVR, and those receiving edoxaban versus vitamin K antagonists had a higher risk of MGIB. A priori identification of risk factors for MGIB may help optimize outcomes for patients with AF undergoing TAVR.

### Post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement antithrombotic treatment in nonindicated patients: updated systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115vPjLJ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal antithrombotic strategy following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains controversial.

Objectives

The authors aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of various antithrombotic regimens in patients without an indication for anticoagulation following TAVR.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov until August 2024 for studies investigating antithrombotic regimens after TAVR in patients without an indication for chronic oral anticoagulation. The analysis compared single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), direct oral anticoagulants, and oral anticoagulant (OAC) plus SAPT. A frequentist network meta-analysis was employed to evaluate the post-TAVR risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, total bleeding, and life-threatening or major bleeding.

Results

Eleven studies (8 randomized controlled trials and 3 propensity score-matched cohorts) comprising 5,821 patients undergoing TAVR were included. SAPT significantly reduced the risk of life-threatening/major bleeding compared with DAPT (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.35–0.80), OAC (OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.28–0.99), and OAC + SAPT (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.13–0.76). No significant differences were observed in the risk of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction between antithrombotic regimens. Subgroup analysis indicated an increased risk of mortality with low-dose rivaroxaban+3-month SAPT compared with SAPT (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.35–0.89) and DAPT (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.38–0.88). Meta-regression identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the only significant modifier of bleeding risk following TAVR.

Conclusions

Our findings support current guidelines recommending SAPT as the preferred antithrombotic strategy post-TAVR in patients without an indication for anticoagulation, demonstrating optimal safety without compromising efficacy.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulant and outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: insights from the STS / ACC TVT registry [^112YT4VM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Thromboembolic and bleeding complications after TAVR have been the major concerns. The risk factors of stroke in TAVR vary based on the timing of stroke occurrence. Strokes that occur periprocedurally result from embolization of thrombus, calcification, and valve tissue/arterial wall‐derived debris, and the risk is potentially modifiable by the use of cerebral embolic protection devices. In subacute and late stroke, AF and systemic atherosclerosis are well‐known risk factors. However, the association of AF and late stroke is not consistent in some studies, raising the concern of leaflet thrombosis causing stroke in patients with TAVR. Although neither antiplatelet therapy nor OAC therapy was associated with the risk of 30‐day neurologic events in the recent study, the lack of OAC was associated with late ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (> 30 days postprocedure). Optimal antithrombotic management in patients undergoing TAVR with or without AF is still debated. The clinical trials in patients with TAVR with an indication for OAC are limited. The only clinical trial to assess the use of VKA versus DOAC (edoxaban) in patients with an indication for OAC after TAVR is ENVISAGE TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation). The study demonstrated that the outcomes of edoxaban use were comparable with warfarin use in all‐cause mortality, ischemic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage. However, the incidence of major bleeding was higher with edoxaban than with warfarin, mainly owing to more gastrointestinal bleeding. Several factors could possibly explain the difference in bleeding outcomes between ENVISAGE TAVI AF and our study. Endoxaban is the least commonly dispensed DOACs in the United States and apixaban is the most commonly dispensed DOACs. The different bleeding profiles in each DOAC, different antiplatelet protocol in ENVISAGE‐TAVI (dual antiplatelet for 3 months or single antiplatelet indefinitely), and the selected population for DOACs in our observational study could contribute to the different findings.

### Antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111JzMDw]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2021). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a treatment option for symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis who are candidates for a bioprosthesis across the entire spectrum of risk. However, TAVR carries a risk for thrombotic and bleeding events, underscoring the importance of defining the optimal adjuvant antithrombotic regimen. Antithrombotic considerations are convoluted by the fact that many patients undergoing TAVR are generally elderly and present with multiple comorbidities, including conditions that may require long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) (eg, atrial fibrillation) and antiplatelet therapy (eg, coronary artery disease). After TAVR among patients without baseline indications for OAC, recent data suggest dual-antiplatelet therapy to be associated with an increased risk for bleeding events, particularly early postprocedure, compared with single-antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. Concerns surrounding the potential for thrombotic complications have raised the hypothesis of adjunctive use of OAC for patients with no baseline indications for anticoagulation. Although effective in modulating thrombus formation at the valve level, the bleeding hazard has shown to be unacceptably high, and the net benefit of combining antiplatelet and OAC therapy is unproven. For patients with indications for the use of long-term OAC, such as those with atrial fibrillation, the adjunctive use of antiplatelet therapy increases bleeding. Whether direct oral anticoagulant agents achieve better outcomes than vitamin K antagonists remains under investigation. Overall, single-antiplatelet therapy and OAC appear to be reasonable strategies in patients without and with indications for concurrent anticoagulation. The aim of the present review is to appraise the current published research and recommendations surrounding the management of antithrombotic therapy after TAVR, with perspectives on evolving paradigms and ongoing trials.

### Comparing major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving edoxaban versus warfarin after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: results from the randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^115a7Djq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants are recommended over vitamin K antagonists in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding may be higher with non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists. Patients after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) who are elderly and frail have worse outcomes with major gastrointestinal bleeding (MGIB), including death. This study evaluated incidence, predictors, and impact of MGIB among patients with AF after successful TAVR.

Methods

This on‐treatment analysis of ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF (Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) included patients who received ≥ 1 dose of the study drug. Demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics were compared between patients with versus without an MGIB event. Cox multivariable regression analysis identified predictors of MGIB.

Edoxaban without dose adjustment versus vitamin K antagonist use (P = 0.003), smoking (P = 0.01), low hemoglobin levels (P < 0.0001), and percutaneous coronary intervention ≤ 30 days before TAVR (P = 0.01) emerged as predictors of MGIB.

Conclusions

In this ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF subanalysis, MGIB occurred in 6.0% of patients with prevalent or incident AF undergoing TAVR, and those receiving edoxaban versus vitamin K antagonists had a higher risk of MGIB. A priori identification of risk factors for MGIB may help optimize outcomes for patients with AF undergoing TAVR.

### Sex differences among patients receiving edoxaban vs vitamin K antagonist for atrial fibrillation after TAVR [^112c5LGM]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Population characteristics

From the total population of 1,426 patients enrolled in ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial, 49 individuals (3.4%), who did not receive at least 1 dose of the study drug, were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. Out of the 1,377 patients included in the per-protocol analysis, 658 (47.8%) were women (Figure 1). Women were slightly older, less likely to be smokers or to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, concomitant coronary, peripheral or carotid artery disease but more likely to have chronic kidney disease or a history of thromboembolic events not affecting the central nervous system. CHA2DS2-VASc, Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, and EuroScore I values were higher in women than in men. AF was diagnosed before TAVR in almost all patients (99%) and had a paroxysmal pattern more frequently in women than men. A supra-annular self-expandable valve was more often implanted in women, a balloon expandable device in the male counterpart (Table 1). Women met the criteria of edoxaban dose adjustment (57% vs 36.4%, P < 0.001) and discontinued the study treatment (46.7% vs 40.2%, P = 0.017) more frequently than men. In both sexes, VKA was more frequently interrupted than edoxaban (52.5% vs 41.1% in women and 45.9% vs 34.4% in men). The main reason for discontinuation in women was subject's withdrawal, in men adverse event (Supplemental Table 3). The proportion of patients receiving antiplatelet therapy in addition to the study regimen was similar in women and men (Supplemental Table 4). Baseline, procedural characteristics and medication were well balanced between the 2 treatment arms in both sexes (Supplemental Table 4).

### Single vs dual antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a systematic review [^114wp82a]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

There is wide variability in prescribing of antiplatelet regimens following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The objective of this review was to evaluate published and unpublished reports regarding the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) compared with a single antiplatelet agent in patients undergoing TAVI. We searched MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Embase, and unpublished sources of literature from inception to December 2014 using terms synonymous with TAVI and DAPT. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort or case-control studies that compared DAPT with a single antiplatelet agent post-TAVI. Four articles met the inclusion criteria (2 RCTs, 2 cohort studies), of which all were deemed to be at high risk of bias, for a total of 662 patients. Compared with a single antiplatelet agent, DAPT did not significantly reduce all-cause mortality (risk ratio: 1.22, 95% confidence interval: 0.72–2.09, I(2) = 0%). Due to selective outcome reporting and variable follow-up, other outcomes of interest could not be meta-analyzed; however, evaluation of individual studies demonstrated no significant reduction in thrombotic events with DAPT and a similar or higher risk of bleeding. Current evidence, though limited by low methodological quality, suggests a lack of benefit and potential harm with DAPT compared with a single antiplatelet agent in patients post-TAVI. Therefore, clinicians should evaluate the use of DAPT in patients post-TAVI on a case-by-case basis until more robust evidence is available to guide practice.

### Novel oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in transcatheter aortic valve replacement treated patients-patients' vulnerability still matters [^111uKfVm]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Key points

Current meta‐analysis suggests that outcomes with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not significantly differ compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), in particular, NOACs failed to demonstrate a better safety profile than VKAs in this clinical setting.
Accordingly, the choice between NOACs and VKAs in AF patients after TAVR is left to clinical judgment.
Future large‐scale clinical trials are warranted to establish a clinically superior anticoagulant regime in this clinical setting, based on risk profile and need for concomitant antiplatelet therapy.

### Direct oral anticoagulant versus antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients without prior or concurrent indication for anticoagulation: a meta-analysis of randomized studies [^112dj3RJ]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The antithrombotic management following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients who do not have a concurrent indication for long-term anticoagulation therapy is an ongoing source of debate.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) versus antiplatelet therapy after TAVR in patients without a concomitant indication for chronic oral anticoagulation. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched. Only randomized controlled trials were included. Risk ratios (RR) with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Three studies were included, with 2922 patients who underwent TAVR, of whom 1463 (50.1%) received DOACs. Patients who received DOACs therapy had significantly higher all-cause mortality (RR: 1.68; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.22–2.30; p = 0.001) and non-cardiovascular mortality (RR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.13–4.80; p = 0.02). The incidence of major bleeding was not significantly different between the groups (5.3% vs. 3.8%; RR: 1.44; 95% CI: 0.90–2.32; p = 0.13). There was no difference between DOACs and antiplatelet therapy in terms of: ischemic stroke (RR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.76–2.15; p = 0.35) and cardiovascular mortality (RR: 1.36; 95% CI: 0.92–2.03; p = 0.13). Lastly, the DOACs group had a significantly lower risk of valve thrombosis than the antiplatelet group (0.8% vs. 3.2%; RR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.14–0.51; p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

In this meta-analysis of randomized studies comparing DOACs to antiplatelet therapy after TAVR in patients without a concomitant indication for anticoagulation, DOACs were associated with a lower incidence of valve thrombosis and a higher rate of all-cause mortality, driven by an increase in noncardiac causes of death.

### Platelets: implications in aortic valve stenosis and bioprosthetic valve dysfunction from pathophysiology to clinical care [^117VUD9n]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

The optimal strategy of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy following TAVR for stroke risk reduction and prevention or treatment of leaflet thrombosis also remains a point of debate. Antiplatelet therapies developed to help prevent thrombotic events are not yet known because of wide variations in clinical practice and heterogeneous trial populations. It is also not known whether thromboembolic complications and leaflet thrombosis following TAVR occur predominantly because of platelet- or thrombin-mediated clot formation, which could also alter the strategy of anticoagulation post-procedure. Current U.S. guidelines advocate for dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) for 6 months post-TAVR followed by lifelong aspirin monotherapy in patients with no other indication for anticoagulation (such as atrial fibrillation), or 3 months of anticoagulation with warfarin for patients with low bleeding risk to prevent valve thrombosis. Three large, randomized trials have assessed clinical outcomes with various antiplatelet/anticoagulation strategies in patients undergoing TAVR (Table 2). In the large (n = 1,644, mean age 80 years, 50% females) GALILEO (Global Study Comparing a revaroxaban-based Antithrombotic Strategy to an antiplatelet-based Strategy After Transcatheter aortic valve replacement to Optimize Clinical Outcomes) trial, patients following TAVR (46% balloon-expandable, 46% self-expandable, 8% other) without another clinical indication for oral anticoagulation were randomly assigned to receive 3 months of treatment with either the direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban plus aspirin or dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. After a median follow-up duration of 17 months, treatment with rivaroxaban was associated with a higher risk of death and thromboembolic events (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.01–1.81), as well as major, disabling, or life-threatening bleeding (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.95–2.37). However, in a substudy of 231 patients from the trial who underwent CT approximately 90 days after randomization, the incidence of HALT was significantly lower in the rivaroxaban arm of the trial compared with those who received dual antiplatelet therapy (HALT identified in 2.1% versus 10.9%, respectively). In the recent POPULAR TAVR (Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial, patients without a clinical indication for anticoagulation were randomized to receive 3 months of aspirin monotherapy versus dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel following TAVR. The incidence of bleeding and the composite of bleeding or thromboembolic events at 1 year were lower with aspirin monotherapy. Similarly, in patients with a preexisting clinical indication for anticoagulation receiving either vitamin K antagonist or a direct oral anticoagulant, the addition of clopidogrel for 3 months following TAVR was associated with higher rates of bleeding without conferring any benefit on stroke or myocardial infarction at 12 months. Last, in a small (n = 94, mean age 73 years, 30% female) randomized trial in low-risk patients undergoing TAVR (50% balloon-expandable, 42% self-expandable, 7% other), the combination of aspirin plus warfarin was associated with a lower prevalence of HALT and/or valve dysfunction at 30 days, compared with aspirin monotherapy. To date no studies have evaluated the impact of P2Y 12 -receptor antagonists other than clopidogrel, such as ticagrelor and prasugrel, which may have more potent antiplatelet effects (Central Illustration). However, these agents are themselves associated with increased risks of major bleeding when used in patients following acute coronary syndromes and may pose the same challenges with regard to safety as anticoagulants. At present, it is reasonable to reserve anticoagulation following TAVR only for those patients with HALT and restricted leaflet motion with elevated AV gradients on echocardiography, unless otherwise indicated.

Comparative Overview of Designs and Key Outcomes in the GALILEO, LRT 2.0, ADAPT-TAVR, and ATLANTIS Trial

The GALILEO-4D, ATLANTIS 4D CT, and ADAPT-TAVR trials underscore the ongoing need for adequately powered trials to elucidate the role of anticoagulation strategies in reducing thrombotic complications and improving neurological outcomes following TAVR. The ACASA-TAVItrial aims to compare antifactor Xa direct oral anticoagulants (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) with antiplatelet therapy by assessing HALT incidence at 12 months. The NOTION-4 trialaims to address a critical knowledge gap in antithrombotic management following TAVR by enrolling patients without an indication for OAC. The trial compares lifelong single antiplatelet therapy against an early 3-month course of direct oral anticoagulant therapy followed by single antiplatelet therapy. Serial CT evaluations at 3 months, 1 year, and 5 years postrandomization are expected to provide deeper insights into the natural history of HALT and its clinical implications. In addition, this trial will assess whether an early intensive antithrombotic approach can yield sustained clinical benefits, balancing thrombotic protection with bleeding risk over time. Indeed, recent analyses indicate that HALT arises not only from acute thrombus formation but also from organizing or organized thrombus (ie, pannus), with progressive evolution over time. As thrombi mature, their composition shifts from fibrin and platelets (ie, the targets of antithrombotic therapy) to smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix, likely rendering them resistant to treatment which underscores the potential benefit of early detection and timely intervention. The NOTION-4 trial will be instrumental in refining the evidence base for tailored antithrombotic strategies in TAVR recipients.

### Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in post transcatheter aortic valve replacement patients with clinical indication for oral anticoagulation: a meta-analysis [^114p3WX3]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

With recent improvements in technology, transcatheter aortic valve replacement/implantation (TAVR/TAVI) has developed into an available treatment for not only high surgical risk patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) but also intermediate and low surgical risk patients with AS. During clinical practice, more than 30% of patients who underwent TAVR are needed to maintain long‐term oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment, mostly due to atrial fibrillation (AF), and around 9% of patients with early post‐TAVR will develop an additional AF, which leads to the increasing number of patients after TAVR with OAC.

Many national society and expert groups recommend oral anticoagulants for patients post‐TAVR with an indication for permanent OAC, but specific anticoagulant regimens in the post‐TAVR setting still remain unclear. The choice of non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is usually debated and based on the local expert opinion because of the lack of evidence to guide the post‐TAVR anticoagulation. The previous study had shown that the NOAC group was significantly related to a lower rate of all‐cause mortality compared with the VKA group (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.29–0.96, p = .04) in patients with AF after a successful TAVR. The rates of life‐threatening or major bleeding were comparable between the two groups. However, a multicenter, open‐label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) indicated that edoxaban in AF patients who underwent TAVR was noninferior to VKAs for a composite outcome of adverse clinical events (HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.85–1.31, p = .01 for noninferiority), and the incidence of major bleeding was higher with the edoxaban than with the VKAs (HR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.03–1.91, p = .93 for noninferiority). Therefore, we performed a meta‐analysis of studies for comparing the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus VKAs in post TAVR patients, requiring OAC therapy.

The primary outcome of this meta‐analysis was the composite of all‐cause mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction at 30 days and 3 months. The co‐primary outcome was the composite of all‐cause mortality, major or life‐threatening bleeding, and stroke or myocardial infarction at 30 days and 3 months. The secondary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, major or life‐threatening bleeding, stroke and myocardial infarction at 30 days and 3 months.

### Oral anti-Xa anticoagulation after trans-aortic valve implantation for aortic stenosis: the randomized ATLANTIS trial [^113JXo58]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antithrombotic treatment regimen following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is not evidence-based. Apixaban, a non-vitamin K direct anticoagulant (NOAC) was shown to be superior to VKA and superior to aspirin to prevent cardioembolic stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It may have the potential to reduce TAVR-related thrombotic complications including subclinical valve thrombosis along with a better safety than the standard of care.

Design

ATLANTIS is a multicenter, randomized, phase IIIb, prospective, open-label, superiority study comparing standard of care (SOC Group) versus an apixaban-based strategy (Anti-Xa Group) after successful TAVR (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 02664649). Randomization is stratified according to the need for chronic anticoagulation therapy for a reason other than the TAVR procedure. In the experimental arm, patients receive 5 mg bid of apixaban or a reduced dose of 2.5 mg bid according to the drug label or when apixaban is combined with antiplatelet therapy. In the control arm, patients receive VKA therapy if there is an indication for oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy alone (single or dual) or the combination of both if needed. The primary study end point is the composite of all-cause death, TIA/stroke, myocardial infarction, symptomatic valve thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, systemic embolism, life-threatening, disabling or major bleeding, according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium definitions.

Conclusions

ATLANTIS tests the superiority of an apixaban-based strategy versus the recommended standard of care strategy to reduce the risk of post-TAVR thromboembolic and bleeding complications in an all comer population.

### Comparing major gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving edoxaban versus warfarin after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: results from the randomized ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^112ShTHc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This on‐treatment analysis of the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF trial investigated the incidence, predictors, and impact of gastrointestinal bleeding among patients with AF after successful TAVR. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study designed specifically to identify predictors of MGIB in the very high‐risk population of patients with AF on oral anticoagulants after successful TAVR. Consistent with the main ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF trial, the current analysis found that MGIB occurred in 6.0% of patients, the majority (67.5%) of whom were in the edoxaban arm. Additionally, the principal findings of this study were that predictors of MGIB included edoxaban use without dose adjustment, smoking, low hemoglobin level, and DAPT use in the setting of recent PCI ≤ 30 days before TAVR; MGIB events occurred mostly during the first 6 months after randomization.

Edoxaban use without dose adjustment (60 mg) versus VKA use was identified as a significant predictor of MGIB in patients with AF after successful TAVR. In accordance with prescribing information, edoxaban dose should be adjusted when patients are indicated. Edoxaban dose adjustment decreases bleeding risk in patients with impaired kidney function or low body weight, and in those on potent P‐glycoprotein inhibitors, as each of these factors are reported to elevate the blood concentration of edoxaban. Bleeding risk may increase if patients meet > 1 of the dose adjustment criteria. A retrospective analysis of patients receiving 30 mg/d of edoxaban found that the incidences of major bleeding were 7.3% and 20.0% when patients met 2 or 3 dose adjustment factors, respectively. Additionally, edoxaban dose reduction in older patients (aged ≥ 75 years) with AF decreased major bleeding risk with edoxaban versus warfarin.

### An investigator-sponsored pragmatic randomized controlled trial of antiCoagulation vs acetylSalicylic acid after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: rationale and design of ACASA-TAVI [^1147uq3W]. American Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is unknown. Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) is associated with adverse outcomes and may be prevented by anticoagulation therapy. A dedicated randomized trial comparing monotherapy NOAC to single antiplatelet therapy has not been performed previously. We hypothesize that therapy with any anti-factor Xa NOAC will reduce BVD compared to antiplatelet therapy, without compromising safety.

Methods

ACASA-TAVI is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint, all-comers trial comparing a monotherapy anti-factor Xa NOAC strategy (intervention arm) with a single antiplatelet therapy strategy (control arm) after successful TAVI. Three-hundred and sixty patients without indication for oral anticoagulation will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either apixaban 5 mg twice per day, edoxaban 60 mg daily, or rivaroxaban 20 mg daily for 12 months followed by acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg daily indefinitely, or to acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg daily indefinitely. The 2 co-primary outcomes are (1) incidence of Hypo-Attenuated Leaflet Thickening (HALT) on 4-dimensional cardiac CT at 12 months, and (2) a Safety Composite of VARC-3 bleeding events, thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction and stroke), and death from any cause, at 12 months.

Results

The first 100 patients had a mean age of 74 ± 3.6 years, 33% were female, the average body-mass index was 27.9 ± 4.4 kg/m 2, and 15% were smokers. A balloon-expanded valve was used in 82% and a self-expandable valve in 18%.

Conclusions

The trial is planned, initiated, funded, and conducted without industry involvement.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT05035277.

### Comparison of efficacy and safety between VKAs and DOACs in patients with atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116BF6mu]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data sources and study search strategy

We conducted a comprehensive search of studies comparing the efficacy and safety of VKAs or DOACs in patients with AF after TAVR in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), andwebsites. The search term included "transcatheter aortic valve implantation or transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVI or TAVR; AF; anticoagulation or anticoagulant or antithrombotic or vitamin K antagonist or VKA or Coumadin or Warfarin or novel oral anticoagulant or NOAC or direct oral anticoagulant or DOAC or Dabigatran or Apixaban or Rivaroxaban or Edoxaban".

2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were included in our meta‐analysis when the following criteria were met: (1) The study is limited to English and human subjects. (2) The study compared the efficacy or safety of VKAs and DOACs in patients with AF after TAVR. (3) At least one of these outcomes was reported in the study: all‐cause mortality, death from cardiovascular causes, stroke, and major and/or life‐threatening bleeding.

2.3 Data extraction and endpoints

All data were independently extracted from text, tables, and graphs by two authors (J. Y. and M. L.). Disagreements among reviewers were resolved through discussion to reach a consensus. The primary endpoint of this meta‐analysis was all‐cause mortality (death from all causes). Secondary endpoints were stroke (ischemic stroke) and cardiovascular death (death from cardiovascular causes). The safety endpoint is major and/or life‐threatening bleeding.

### Post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement antithrombotic treatment in nonindicated patients: updated systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114WLywM]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review and network meta-analysis adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The study was also registered in the PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) database.

Search strategy

We conducted a systematic literature search to find studies comparing various antithrombotic regimens in patients undergoing TAVR without a chronic indication for OAC. We searched the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases until August 2024. Following the PICO framework, the search strategy focused on 3 components: the population (TAVR patients without an indication for OAC), the intervention (various antithrombotic regimens), and the outcome (major adverse cardiac events [MACE], stroke, mortality, bleeding, and vascular complications). To ensure comprehensive retrieval of relevant studies, medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and keywords for population (eg, "TAVR"), interventions (eg, "SAPT", "DAPT", "OAC", "DOAC", "VKA"), and outcomes (eg, "total bleeding", "life-threatening bleeding", "major bleeding", "minor bleeding", "stroke", "myocardial infarction", and "cardiovascular mortality"), along with their equivalent keywords. The full search strategy and the queries used for each database can be found in Supplemental Table 1.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were included if they matched the following criteria:

- Adult patients who received TAVR without indications for chronic antithrombotic treatment (eg, atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valves, cardiovascular interventions).
- Studies with any antithrombotic treatment, including SAPT, DAPT, and OAC consisting of VKA or DOAC and including at least one of the following outcomes: MACE, stroke, all-cause mortality, life-threatening/major bleeding, or vascular complications were included. We included the most recent publication with long-term outcomes for studies with multiple reports. This strategy was selected to ensure the most recent and thorough data.
- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and propensity score matched (PSM) cohort studies were considered for inclusion.

Studies including patients already receiving OAC for baseline atrial fibrillation or other indications and those comparing different P2Y12 inhibitor regimens in both case and control arms were excluded. This exclusion criterion was applied to ensure consistency and comparability of control interventions across all included trials. Cohorts without PSM, case reports, reviews, commentaries, and nonhuman studies were also excluded.

### Optimal antithrombotic strategy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: is the "Less is more" concept always better? [^113LXnxr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Prior landmark registries reported that subclinical leaflet thrombosis was not rare (≈15%) after TAVR, and there was a possibility of leaflet thrombosis with increased risk of cerebrovascular events (eg, stroke or transient ischemic attack). 6, 7 Also, several studies reported that OAC was more effective than DAPT for prevention or treatment of subclinical leaflet thrombosis or cerebrovascular event after TAVR. 7, 8 Until recently, to resolve this unmet issue, several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted. The ARTE (Aspirin Versus Aspirin Plus Clopidogrel Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial compared DAPT and single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) in 222 patients without OAC indications undergoing TAVR with a balloon‐expandable valve and showed that DAPT was associated with a higher rate of major or life‐threatening bleeding events without difference in death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular event at 3 months. 9 The GALILEO (Global Study Comparing a Rivaroxaban‐Based Antithrombotic Strategy to an Antiplatelet‐Based Strategy After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Optimize Clinical Outcomes) trial randomized 1644 patients without OAC indications after successful TAVR and demonstrated that low‐dose (10 mg) rivaroxaban (with low‐dose aspirin for the first 3 months) was significantly associated with a higher risk of death or thromboembolic complications and a higher risk of bleeding than DAPT strategy. 10 However, GALILEO‐4D (an imaging substudy of GALILEO; N = 231) showed that rivaroxaban was more effective than DAPT strategy in preventing subclinical leaflet motion abnormalities (2.1% versus 10.9%) and leaflet thickening (12.4% versus 32.4%). 11 The Popular TAVI trial (Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic‐Valve Implantation) trial cohort A (665 patients without OAC indications) and cohort B (313 patients with OAC indications) showed that aspirin or OAC alone was significantly associated with a lower risk of bleeding without differences in thromboembolic events (death from cardiovascular causes, ischemic stroke, or myocardial infarction) compared with aspirin or OAC plus clopidogrel. 12, 13 On the basis of these cumulative RCTs, updated 2020 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association valve guidelines proposed various recommendations of antithrombotic strategies: aspirin monotherapy in the absence of OAC indications (class IIa), DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for 3 to 6 months (class IIb), vitamin K antagonist for at least 3 months (class IIb), and low‐dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin (class III). 14

### Sex differences among patients receiving edoxaban vs vitamin K antagonist for atrial fibrillation after TAVR [^116BUgYy]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in high-income countries and has a relevant impact on morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) emerged as an effective treatment option for elderly patients for which a valve intervention is indicated. Approximately 50% of patients undergoing TAVR are women and up to 40% have atrial fibrillation (AF). Among women undergoing TAVR, AF has been associated with an increased risk of death and stroke at 1 year. In patients with AF not undergoing TAVR, edoxaban, an oral, reversible, direct factor Xa inhibitor, was noninferior to vitamin K antagonist (VKA), in the prevention of thromboembolic events, including stroke, and yielded lower rates of bleeding complications and cardiovascular fatalities. In patients with AF who underwent successful TAVI, the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (Edoxaban vs Standard of Care and Their Effects on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation–Atrial Fibrillation) showed that edoxaban was noninferior to VKA with respect to a composite of ischemic and bleeding adverse clinical events, but was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding.

Women have been shown to be at higher risk of bleeding, vascular complications and stroke than men after TAVR irrespective of the concomitant anticoagulant treatment. Among patients with AF not undergoing TAVR, women derived a greater benefit than men from edoxaban as compared to VKA with respect to bleeding risk reduction. Whether the effect of edoxaban on outcomes may vary in relation to sex in patients with AF undergoing TAVR is unclear.

The aim of this secondary analysis of ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial was to explore the impact of sex on safety and efficacy of edoxaban vs VKA in patients with AF after successful TAVR.

### Duration of antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111abh8c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an established treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 Selection of optimal antithrombotic regimens in patients with TAVR are complex because these patients are often at high risk for both bleeding and stroke because of older age and high burden of atherosclerotic comorbidities. Furthermore, concomitant presence of atrial fibrillation is common, and the selection of antithrombotic regimen becomes even more challenging. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 As such, various regimens including single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), and oral anticoagulants have been used in patients after TAVR.

A randomized controlled trial (RCT) has recently demonstrated that oral anticoagulant without concomitant use of antiplatelet had lower bleeding risk when the patient had clinical indication for oral anticoagulant (ie, atrial fibrillation). 8 Another study showed that SAPT had lower bleeding events compared with DAPT at 1 year in TAVR recipients. 9 Although there is an accumulating evidence for the regimen of antithrombotics in patients with TAVR, the optimal duration of antithrombotic remains largely under investigated. Current guidelines recommend DAPT for 3 to 6 months following TAVR 10, 11 but this is based on expert opinion and underlying evidence is scarce.

Herein, we conducted a network meta‐analysis to compare the outcome of antiplatelet‐based strategies based on different duration; SAPT versus DAPT for 3 months versus DAPT for 6 months, following TAVR.

### Optimal antithrombotic strategy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: is the "Less is more" concept always better? [^1161ZPvE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis is one of the most common valvular heart diseases in the elderly population, and its prevalence substantially increases as the population ages. 1 Over more than decade, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a valuable alternative treatment to surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, even including low‐risk population. 2, 3 Despite an iteration in TAVR device technologies and improved patient selection and management through the multidisciplinary heart teams, a balancing of ischemic and bleeding risks after TAVR remains a matter of considerable debates. Although the clinical guidelines recommend an empirical antiplatelet regimen with 3 to 6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (ie, aspirin plus clopidogrel) for patients without indication of oral anticoagulation (OAC), 4, 5 this is mostly based on expert consensus and thus the optimal antithrombotic strategies as well as their duration after TAVR are still undetermined.

### Impact of leaflet thrombosis on valve haemodynamic status after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^111hZLvX]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The effect of subclinical leaflet thrombosis, characterised by hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT), on the valve haemodynamic function and durability of the bioprosthetic valve, is not yet determined. We determined the impact of HALT on valve haemodynamics after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and the predictors of haemodynamic structural valve deterioration (SVD).

Methods

The Anticoagulation vs Dual Antiplatelet Therapy for Prevention of Leaflet Thrombosis and Cerebral Embolization after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement(ADAPT-TAVR) trial is a multicenter, randomised trial that compared edoxaban and dual antiplatelet therapy in patients who had undergone successful TAVR. The presence of HALT was evaluated by four-dimensional CT at 6 months and serial echocardiography performed at baseline, immediately post-TAVR and after 6 months. SVD was defined as at least one of the following: (1) mean transprosthetic gradient ≥ 20 mm Hg, (2) change in the mean gradient ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline, or (3) new or increase in intraprosthetic aortic regurgitation of at least ≥ 1 grade, resulting in moderate or greater regurgitation.

Results

At 6 months, HALT was found in 30 of 211 (14.2%) patients. The presence of HALT did not significantly affect aortic valve mean gradients (with vs without HALT; 14.0 ± 4.8 mm Hg vs 13.7 ± 5.5 mm Hg; p = 0.74) at 6 months. SVD was reported in 30 of 206 patients (14.6%) at 6-month follow-up echocardiography. Older age (OR: 1.138; 95% CI: 1.019 to 1.293; p = 0.033), use of aortic valve size ≤ 23 mm (OR: 6.254; 95% CI: 2.230 to 20.569; p = 0.001) and mean post-TAVR pressure gradient (OR: 1.233; 95% CI: 1.123 to 1.371; p < 0.001) were independent predictors of haemodynamic SVD; however, the presence of HALT was not identified as a predictor of SVD.

Conclusions

In patients who had undergone successful TAVR, aortic valve haemodynamic status was not influenced by the presence of HALT. Although HALT was not a predictor of haemodynamic SVD at 6 months, it warrants further longer-term follow-up to evaluate the effect on long-term valve durability.

### Duration of antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113LjEF5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Although current guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 3 to 6 months following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), there are no studies directly comparing outcomes of different durations of DAPT following TAVR. Methods and Results PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database were searched through November 2020 to identify clinical studies that investigated single antiplatelet therapy versus DAPT use following TAVR. Studies using oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet therapy concomitantly were excluded. The DAPT group was subdivided by the duration of DAPT. We extracted the risk ratios (RRs) of major or life-threatening bleeding, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Four randomized controlled trials, 2 propensity-score matched studies, and 1 observational study were identified, yielding a total of 2498 patients who underwent TAVR assigned to the single antiplatelet therapy group (n = 1249), 3-month DAPT group (n = 485), or 6-month DAPT group (n = 764). Pooled analyses demonstrated that when compared with the single antiplatelet therapy group, the rates of major or life-threatening bleeding were significantly higher in the 3- and 6-month DAPT groups (RR [95% CI] = 2.13 [1.33–3.40], P = 0.016; RR [95% CI] = 2.54 [1.49–4.33], P = 0.007, respectively) with no difference between the 3-month DAPT versus 6-month DAPT groups. The rates of stroke and all-cause mortality were similar among the 3 groups. Conclusions In this network meta-analysis of antiplatelet therapy following TAVR, single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin had lower bleeding without increasing stroke or death when compared with either 3- or 6-month DAPT.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from Dr. J.M. ten Berg upon reasonable request.

Search Strategy

A systematic review of the published data on antithrombotic therapy after TAVI in patients without an established indication for oral anticoagulation was conducted, in accordance with the guidance and reporting items specified in the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis (PRISMA) statement. 13 A literature search in the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane was last performed on September 1, 2020. Additionally, conference proceedings and abstracts, and the bibliography of review articles, meta‐analyses, or original studies identified by the literature search were screened for other eligible studies. The search included the following terms: "TAVI", "TAVR", "transcatheter aortic valve implantation", "transcatheter aortic valve replacement", "antiplatelet therapy", "single antiplatelet therapy", "dual antiplatelet therapy", "SAPT", "DAPT", "aspirin", "clopidogrel", "antiplatelet", and "antithrombotic therapy" (Complete search is provided in Data S1). Only prospective, randomized clinical trials were selected for inclusion in this meta‐analysis; other study designs were excluded. Ultimately, 4 prospective randomized clinical trials investigating aspirin alone compared with aspirin with clopidogrel after TAVI were included in the meta‐analysis: (1) the POPular TAVI trial; (2) the ARTE (Aspirin Versus Aspirin Plus Clopidogrel Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial; (3) the SAT‐TAVI (Single Antiplatelet Therapy for TAVI) trial; and (4) the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Versus Aspirin Alone in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation trial from Ussia et al. 9, 10, 11, 12 Access to the anonymized patient‐level data of all eligible trials was granted by the principal investigator of each trial. Data on baseline characteristics, procedural characteristic, and outcomes were verified using the original publications, and pooled into 1 single database. Two independent reviewers (J.B. and V.J.N.) assessed the risk of bias for all included trials using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials (available in Tables S1 through S4). 14 All included trials were approved by the local ethics committee and institutional review board of each participating center and all patients provided written informed consent.

### Anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: national database insights [^116Te9t3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a therapeutic intervention for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Compared with surgical aortic valve replacement, TAVR has demonstrated noninferiority, particularly in high‐risk or inoperable patients.

Recently, the indications for TAVR have expanded to include low‐risk cases. As the procedure became more widely available, the choice of antithrombotic therapy also diverged. Despite these advances, the incidence of thromboembolic and bleeding events after TAVR remains a major concern, underscoring the ongoing debate regarding the optimal antithrombotic therapy selection and combination.

Current guidelines, based on previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) results, recommend monotherapy for patients undergoing TAVR with an indication for anticoagulation. Although these trials have demonstrated that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are noninferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for thromboembolic events, the choice between DOACs and VKAs remains debated. In the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF (Edoxaban Versus Standard of Care and Their Effects on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation–Atrial Fibrillation) trial, edoxaban was associated with a higher incidence of bleeding events than VKA. Conversely, the ATLANTIS (Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke) trial, which compared apixaban with standard therapy, including VKA, found no difference in bleeding events.

The diverse backgrounds of patients undergoing TAVR may result in discrepancies between the results of RCTs and observational studies. A previous observational study demonstrated that a higher risk of thromboembolic and bleeding events occurred among older adults, and these studies showed that VKA may pose a higher risk than DOAC. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the association between the choice of anticoagulants post‐TAVR and thromboembolic and bleeding events using a nationwide database covering almost the entire population of Japan.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and valve replacement or repair [^1175FknB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with TAVR, results are less consistent in the literature. In the randomized ATLANTIS (Anti‐Thrombotic Strategy to Lower All Cardiovascular and Neurologic Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Events after Trans‐Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis) trial, the use of apixaban 5 mg twice daily in patients with an indication for anticoagulation was associated with similar primary outcome of time to death, thromboembolic or major bleeding events compared with warfarin. In the 4D computed tomography subset cohort from the same study, apixaban was associated with a statistically nonsignificant increase in the primary outcome of ≥ 1 prosthetic leaflet with reduced leaflet motion grade 3/4 or hypoattenuated leaflet thrombosis grade 3/4 at 90 days. Four observational studies further added to the debate. In a Danish nationwide study with a total of 735 patients, there was no difference in the risk of arterial thromboembolism, bleeding, or mortality between DOACs and warfarin. In the OCEAN‐TAVI (Optimized Transcatheter Valvular Intervention) registry, DOACs were associated with less mortality, but similar rates of stroke and bleeding compared with warfarin. In the Registry of Aortic Valve Bioprostheses Established by Catheter, the risk of both mortality and bleeding was lower with DOAC, with similar rates of stroke, compared with warfarin. In contrast, a study that included 962 patients from 4 European tertiary centers demonstrated higher rates of composite outcome of mortality, bleeding, and stroke compared with warfarin, driven by increase in the rates of stroke. An important limitation to some of these registry studies is that therapy was assigned in the beginning of the study, and patients were assumed to have continued the same therapy during the study follow‐up period, without systematic assessment for continuation of assigned treatment in follow‐up, and hence, potential lack of capture of patients who stopped their treatment or crossed over to the other arm. The recently published ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF (Edoxaban versus Standard of Care and Their Effects on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation–Atrial Fibrillation) trial, edoxaban was noninferior to warfarin in patients with prevalent AF undergoing TAVR, but the incidence of major bleeding was higher with edoxaban compared with warfarin.

### 2018 joint European consensus document on the management of antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and / or undergoing percutaneous cardiovascular interventions: a joint consensus document of the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), European Society of Cardiology working group on thrombosis, European association of percutaneous cardiovascular interventions (EAPCI), and European association of acute cardiac care (ACCA) endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), Latin America Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS), and cardiac arrhythmia society of Southern Africa (CASSA) [^117CfiZh]. Europace (2019). High credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) — antithrombotic management and trials are outlined as follows: Among TAVI patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but without coronary artery disease (CAD), oral anticoagulation (OAC) is recommended in accordance with recommendations for AF alone, and TAVI patients taking OAC (e.g., for AF) and needing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) should be treated similarly to patients receiving a stent without TAVI. For those undergoing TAVI without concomitant need for OAC, patients should receive an antiplatelet regimen consisting of lifelong aspirin monotherapy or aspirin and clopidogrel for 3–6 months followed by aspirin monotherapy, and the use of prasugrel or ticagrelor in combination with aspirin or NOAC after TAVI has not been investigated and cannot be recommended at this time. Ongoing randomized studies include an anticoagulant-based strategy with apixaban 5 mg bid evaluated against standard-of-care with outcomes at 1 year follow-up, and a study comparing warfarin vs. edoxaban in a planned population of 1400 AF patients undergoing TAVI assessing overall side effects and major bleeding during 3 years follow-up.

End Points

This post hoc analysis focused on MGIB events, a subcategory of the ENVISAGE‐TAVI AF primary safety end point, major bleeding, as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis. Patient follow‐up occurred at 3 months after randomization and every 6 months thereafter (≥ 6 months to ≤ 36 months). The adjudication of all major adverse events was performed by an independent clinical events committee whose members were masked to the drug assignment.

Statistical Analysis

This on‐treatment analysis included patients who received ≥ 1 dose of the study drug (safety cohort). The time period for the primary analysis was the time from randomization to an end‐of‐treatment visit at 36 months, an end‐of‐trial visit, the patient's last visit, or death, whichever occurred first. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were stratified by the occurrence of an MGIB event. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables as means ± SD. Statistical comparisons for baseline characteristics of patients with versus without an MGIB were made using analysis of variance for numerical parameters and Fisher's exact test for categorical parameters.

Cox multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of MGIB events. The multivariable model was built by the stepwise selection method. Candidate variables for the model included all baseline characteristics, with parameters highly correlated with another existing parameter removed (Table S1). For a variable to remain in or enter into the model, a significance level of P < 0.1 was required. After the final model was obtained, only those variables with a significance level of P < 0.05 were included. Multivariable model results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 2‐sided 95% CIs. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the model with selected variables were analyzed. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.2 or newer (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

The impact of MGIB events in patients receiving edoxaban versus VKAs was qualitatively evaluated using estimations of cumulative event‐free survival by means of Kaplan–Meier analyses. A post hoc 30‐day landmark analysis was performed due to the prevalence of DAPT use during this period.

Table 2
Three months MSCT results at patient and leaflet level.

In the MSCT substudy of the GALILEO trial, incidence of any HALT in the control arm (receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel) was 33/102 (32.4%) patients. Using a Chi‐square test for proportions, we found that this was significantly higher than the incidence of HALT in our cohort (p = 0.002). In the rivaroxaban arm, incidence of any HALT was 12/97 (12.4%), which was not statistically different from our reported rates (p = 0.936).

The MSCT substudy of the ATLANTIS trial found an incidence of any thrombus (as surrogate for HALT) in 82/283 (29.0%) of patients in the control arm of the stratum 2 cohort (i.e. without indication for oral anticoagulation and receiving single or dual antiplatelet therapy using aspirin and/or clopidogrel), which was significantly higher than the incidence in our cohort (p = 0.008). HALT ≥ grade 3 in the ATLANTIS 4D‐MSCT substudy occurred in 39/283 (13.8%) of patients in the stratum 2 antiplatelet group, which was significantly higher than in our study patients on edoxaban monotherapy (p = 0.045). In the apixaban arm of the stratum 2 cohort, incidence of any thrombus/HALT was 47/275 (17.1%) and incidence of HALT ≥ grade 3 was 22/275 (8.0%), which were numerically (but not significantly) higher than the incidences in REDOX (p = 0.339 and p = 0.124, respectively).

In the ADAPT TAVR trial, incidence of any HALT in the control arm (receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel) was 20/109 (18.4%) patients, which was not statistically significantly different from the incidence in our cohort (p = 0.363). The incidence of any HALT in the Edoxaban arm of ADAPT TAVR was 10/102 (9.8%) and was not statistically different from the incidence in REDOX (p = 0.602).

### Rationale and design of the CREATE trial: a multicenter, randomized comparison of continuation or cessation of single antithrombotic therapy at 1 Year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^112Aqkqh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines and expert consensus recommend lifelong single antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement who have no indication for anticoagulation or dual antiplatelet therapy. However, there is no direct evidence from randomized controlled trials supporting this practice. Furthermore, the optimal duration of antiplatelet therapy in this population has not been adequately investigated.

Methods and Results

CREATE (A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Study to Evaluate Cessation of Antithrombotic Therapy at 1 Year in TAVR Patients–The CREATE Study) is a prospective, multicenter, open‐label, randomized controlled trial for patients who have undergone successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement and have no indication for long‐term oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Eligible patients are free from major bleeding and ischemic events for 1 year postprocedure before being randomized 1:1 to single antiplatelet therapy (control group) or no antiplatelet therapy (experimental group). The primary efficacy end point is the incidence of bleeding events, defined by the VARC‐3 (Valve Academic Research Consortium‐3) criteria, at 1‐year postrandomization. The primary safety end point is a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke at 1 year. The trial is powered for both superiority in efficiency and noninferiority in safety. Accordingly, a total of 3380 patients will be enrolled.

Conclusions

The CREATE trial aims to assess if stopping antiplatelet therapy at 1‐year after transcatheter aortic valve replacement reduces bleeding risk without increasing ischemic events in patients not requiring chronic antithrombotic therapy.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation trials — ongoing randomized studies of antiplatelet and anticoagulant strategies are described. The Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (POPUlar TAVI, n = 1000) randomizes patients to aspirin alone versus aspirin plus clopidogrel for 3 months and evaluates freedom of non-procedure-related bleeding complications at 1 year follow-up; in patients with an indication for oral anticoagulation (OAC), clopidogrel plus OAC is compared with OAC alone (NCT02247128). The Global Study Comparing a rivaRoxaban-based Antithrombotic Strategy to an antiplatelet-based Strategy after Transcatheter aortic valve rEplacement to Optimize Clinical Outcome (Galileo, n = 1520) assigns patients in the OAC arm to receive 10 mg of rivaroxaban up to 25 months plus low-dose aspirin during the first 3 months versus dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel (for 3 months) followed by aspirin alone, assessing reduction of death or first clinical thromboembolic events with no increase in bleeding complications (NCT02556230).

### A controlled trial of rivaroxaban after transcatheter aortic-valve replacement [^111t4TML]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether the direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban can prevent thromboembolic events after transcatheter aortic-valve replacement (TAVR) is unclear.

Methods

We randomly assigned 1644 patients without an established indication for oral anticoagulation after successful TAVR to receive rivaroxaban at a dose of 10 mg daily (with aspirin at a dose of 75 to 100 mg daily for the first 3 months) (rivaroxaban group) or aspirin at a dose of 75 to 100 mg daily (with clopidogrel at a dose of 75 mg daily for the first 3 months) (antiplatelet group). The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of death or thromboembolic events. The primary safety outcome was major, disabling, or life-threatening bleeding. The trial was terminated prematurely by the data and safety monitoring board because of safety concerns.

Results

After a median of 17 months, death or a first thromboembolic event (intention-to-treat analysis) had occurred in 105 patients in the rivaroxaban group and in 78 patients in the antiplatelet group (incidence rates, 9.8 and 7.2 per 100 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio with rivaroxaban, 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.81; P = 0.04). Major, disabling, or life-threatening bleeding (intention-to-treat analysis) had occurred in 46 and 31 patients, respectively (4.3 and 2.8 per 100 person-years; hazard ratio, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.95 to 2.37; P = 0.08). A total of 64 deaths occurred in the rivaroxaban group and 38 in the antiplatelet group (5.8 and 3.4 per 100 person-years, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.53).

Conclusions

In patients without an established indication for oral anticoagulation after successful TAVR, a treatment strategy including rivaroxaban at a dose of 10 mg daily was associated with a higher risk of death or thromboembolic complications and a higher risk of bleeding than an antiplatelet-based strategy.

### Direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention after acute coronary syndromes… [^1175d6Qs]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

The APPRAISE, APPRAISE-J, Rivaroxaban versus Placebo in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes, and Dose Finding Study for Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome clinical trials reported 6-month follow-up outcomes, 12, 13, 15, 18 while APPRAISE 2 and ATLAS-ACS 2 TIMI 51 reported 8-month and 13-month follow-up, respectively. 14, 16. Figure 2 summarizes risks of the primary efficacy and safety end points with DOAC in addition to APT as compared with APT alone in studies that reported outcomes that were stratified by type of ACS. Among patients presenting with STEMI, DOAC in addition to APT resulted in a significantly lower risk of the primary efficacy end point as compared with patients who were treated with APT alone, with no evidence of heterogeneity. Specifically, rivaroxaban, 2.

5 mg twice daily, in addition to dual APT was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality as compared with a standard dual APT regimen, with a 2-fold increase in the risk of major bleeding. 16 To improve safety, the. Adding rivaroxaban to aspirin lowered the risk of major vascular events as well as cardiovascular and all-cause mortality but increased the risk of major bleeding as compared with aspirin alone. The results of the COMPASS clinical trial suggest that low-intensity simultaneous inhibition of both coagulation and platelet activity could be more effective in terms of preventing ischemic events as compared with APT alone. The findings of this meta-analysis indicate that the clinical benefits of DOAC in addition to APT for secondary prevention after ACS might depend on the type of ACS. In patients with NSTE-ACS, the risk-benefit profile of DOAC in addition to APT appears to be unfavorable.

In patients with STEMI, DOAC in addition to APT appears to improve outcomes in terms of ischemic events at the cost of a marginally increased risk of major bleeding. Future studies should focus on the role of DOAC in addition to APT in patients with STEMI who are at low bleeding risk. Published Online: February 7, 2018. doi: 10.1001/jamacardio.2017.5306

### Aspirin alone versus dual antiplatelet therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis [^114E63Z6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this patient‐level meta‐analysis of all available prospective randomized trials, we investigated the effect of aspirin alone compared with DAPT after TAVI on thromboembolic and bleeding complications in patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation. In summary, aspirin alone significantly reduced the rate of the composite of major and life‐threatening bleeding or thromboembolic events (including all‐cause mortality, major and life‐threatening bleeding, stroke, or myocardial infarction), compared with DAPT. The difference was caused by a large increase of major and life‐threatening bleeding complications in patients receiving DAPT as compared with patients receiving aspirin alone. Moreover, aspirin alone after TAVI was not associated with an increased incidence of the composite of thromboembolic complications (including all‐cause mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction). Also, the individual incidences of all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction outcome were comparable between both groups.

Even decades after its introduction, the ideal antithrombotic strategy following TAVI is not completely determined yet. In order to minimize both the thromboembolic risk and the bleeding risk, an optimal balance in antithrombotic therapy should be pursued. The current guidelines on antithrombotic therapy following TAVI in patients without a long‐term indication for oral anticoagulation recommend DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for the first 3 to 6 months, followed by aspirin alone. 7, 8 However, these statements rely on expert consensus, rather than prospective randomized evidence. Antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin is considered to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications in the first period after TAVI, as was observed in patients undergoing coronary artery stenting. 16 After this initial period, the thromboembolic risk is thought to return to that of the general elderly population and therefore does not need strong antithrombotic therapy. 17

### Trial design: rivaroxaban for the prevention of major cardiovascular events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: rationale and design of the GALILEO study [^112dHvUf]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Optimal antithrombotic treatment after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unknown and determined empirically. The direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban may potentially reduce TAVR-related thrombotic complications and premature valve failure.

Design

GALILEO is an international, randomized, open-label, event-driven, phase III trial in more than 1,520 patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation who underwent a successful TAVR (ClinicalTrials.govNCT02556203). Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio), 1 to 7days after a successful TAVR, to either a rivaroxaban-based strategy or an antiplatelet-based strategy. In the experimental arm, subjects receive rivaroxaban (10mg once daily [OD]) plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 75-100mg OD) for 90days followed by rivaroxaban alone. In the control arm, subjects receive clopidogrel (75mg OD) plus ASA (as above) for 90days followed by ASA alone. In case new-onset atrial fibrillation occurs after randomization, full oral anticoagulation will be implemented with maintenance of the original treatment assignment. The primary efficacy end point is the composite of all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, symptomatic valve thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, and systemic embolism. The primary safety end point is the composite of life-threatening, disabling, and major bleeding, according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium definitions.

Conclusions

GALILEO will test the hypothesis that a rivaroxaban-based antithrombotic strategy reduces the risk of thromboembolic complications post-TAVR with an acceptable risk of bleeding compared with the currently recommended antiplatelet therapy-based strategy in subjects without need of chronic oral anticoagulation.

### Antithrombotic therapy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^114FpbXR]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

The performance of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has expanded considerably during the past decade. Technological advances and refinement in implantation techniques have resulted in improved procedural outcomes, whereas indications are progressively extending toward lower-risk patients. Ischemic/embolic complications and major bleeding remain important and strongly correlate to mortality. In this regard, the optimal antithrombotic regimen after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement remains unclear, in the absence of randomized trials. For patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation, empirical treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 3 to 6 months is currently recommended. However, dual antiplatelet therapy has been preliminarily associated with increased risk of bleeding compared with single antiplatelet therapy without significant ischemic benefit. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants and warfarin have also entered clinical investigation, to address the issue of preexisting or new-onset of atrial fibrillation and potentially attenuate subclinical leaflet thrombosis. Clinical trials are necessary to systematically address the risks and benefits of these approaches. In this review, we present the pathophysiological mechanisms of post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement complications and provide updated insights on the rationale behind the various antithrombotic regimens being currently evaluated in large randomized trials.

### Adjunctive antithrombotic therapy for patients with aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^112pyefV]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established alternative to surgery for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Adjunctive antithrombotic therapy used to mitigate thrombotic risks in patients undergoing TAVR must be balanced against bleeding complications, since both are associated with increased mortality.

Observation

Stroke risk associated with TAVR is lower than that associated with surgical aortic valve replacement in recent trials including patients at intermediate or low risk, but it is constant beginning at the time of implant and accrues over time based on patient risk factors. Patients with aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR also have a sizable risk of life-threatening or major bleeding. Although dual antiplatelet therapy for 3 to 6 months after TAVR is the guideline-recommended regimen, this practice is not well supported by current evidence. In patients with no indication for oral anticoagulation, current registry-based evidence suggests that single antiplatelet therapy may be safer than dual antiplatelet therapy. Similarly, oral anticoagulation monotherapy appears superior to anticoagulation plus antiplatelet therapy in those where oral anticoagulant use is indicated. To date, no risk prediction models have been established to guide antithrombotic therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite the growing volume of TAVR procedures to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis, evidence for adjunctive antithrombotic therapy remains rather scarce. Ongoing clinical trials will provide better understanding to guide antithrombotic therapy.

### Leaflet immobility and thrombosis in transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^1138AawW]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Based on the current evidence, the diagnosis and management of THV thrombosis should be based on the combined anatomic (i.e. the presence of HALT with or without RLM on 4D MDCT), functional (i.e. transvalvular gradients on echocardiography), and clinical evaluation of patient's symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea from severe stenosis, patient–prosthesis mismatch, or thromboembolism) as shown in Take home figure. However, there are several questions on THV thrombosis that need to be answered in future research. The current foremost research question is the unclear clinical significance/implications of subclinical THV thrombosis. If it is not associated with increased adverse outcomes such as heart failure, thromboembolism, or death compared with controls, there will be no clinical indication for regular surveillance or treatment. It is likely that the current absence of clinical outcomes associated with subclinical THV thrombosis is due to the small number of patients in studies and the short duration of follow-up. Alternatively, thrombosis may be part of the natural healing response after TAVR without clinical sequalae in majority of patients. If future research suggests that regular surveillance is required, the variable natural history of THV thrombosis may entail regular echocardiography instead of 4D MDCT be used to detect haemodynamically severe and symptomatic valvular obstruction without the risks of repeated radiation exposure. However, the frequency and duration of periodic surveillance is unknown. Finally, the optimal type (anticoagulation vs. antiplatelet) and duration of therapy after TAVR is also unknown. As before, routine indiscriminate use of anticoagulation in all TAVR patients is likely inappropriate and anticoagulation should probably only be given to patients with symptomatic THV thrombosis (e.g. dyspnoea from severe stenosis or severe patient–prosthesis mismatch, or evidence of thromboembolism) or pre-existing indications. Some of these research questions may be potentially answered by several upcoming clinical trials. For example, the DAPT vs. Oral Anticoagulation for a Short Time to Prevent Cerebral Embolism After TAVI (AUREA) (NCT01642134) trial will compare DAPT against VKA. The Anti-Thrombotic Strategy After Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis (ATLANTIS) (NCT02664649) trial aims to demonstrate the superiority of monotherapy anticoagulation with Apixaban 5 mg twice daily compared with either VKA or DAPT. Finally, the Edoxaban Compared to Standard Care After Heart Valve Replacement Using a Catheter in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation (ENVISAGE-TAVI AF) (NCT02943785) trial compares Edoxaban vs. VKA in TAVR patients with atrial fibrillation. Since TAVR is increasingly utilized in lower-risk patients, it is of upmost importance to answer these clinical questions.

### Aspirin alone versus dual antiplatelet therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis [^1136qHn5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Since its introduction, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has evolved as the alternative treatment for surgery in patients with severe symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Newer device technologies and better implantation techniques have largely improved the outcomes of TAVI over the past years. One aspect that has not been sufficiently investigated yet is the optimal antithrombotic treatment after TAVI. What we do know is that both bleeding and thromboembolic risk are high in patients undergoing TAVI. However, the optimal antithrombotic strategy to minimize both these risks is unknown in patients without a long‐term indication for oral anticoagulation after TAVI. The latest guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel for the first 3 to 6 months, followed by aspirin alone lifelong. 7, 8 Small underpowered randomized trials suggested that aspirin alone after TAVI reduced the incidence of bleeding, and did not increase thromboembolic events compared with DAPT. 9, 10, 11 The recently published POPular TAVI cohort A (Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) trial in patients without a long‐term indication for oral anticoagulation after TAVI confirmed a lower incidence of bleeding and no increase of thromboembolic events with aspirin alone compared with DAPT. 12 The POPular TAVI trial was powered for bleeding events and a composite end point including bleeding and thromboembolic events but not for thromboembolic events alone. In order to increase statistical power, we performed a pooled individual patient‐level meta‐analysis from randomized clinical trials, to further evaluate the efficacy of aspirin alone compared with DAPT for preventing both thromboembolic and bleeding events after TAVI in patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation.

The MGIB events in the edoxaban arm occurred in 3 phases: (1) the most rapid rate during the first 30 days after randomization; (2) a steady rate up to ≈6 months after randomization; and (3) a near plateau thereafter (Figure 3A). A 30‐day landmark analysis further illustrated the rapid increase in MGIB events in the edoxaban arm over this time period (Figure 3B). In contrast, MGIB events in the VKA arm occurred at a steady rate from randomization to 4 months. Among the 83 patients who experienced an MGIB event, death occurred in 29 (34.9%) patients. The mean ± SD time from first MGIB to all‐cause death was 132.9 ± 160.8 days after the MGIB event. One MGIB event was fatal; the other deaths were not related to MGIB events.

In this patient‐level meta‐analysis of randomized trials investigating aspirin alone as compared with aspirin with clopidogrel after TAVI in patients without a chronic indication for oral anticoagulation, aspirin alone was associated with a significant reduction of the composite of major and life‐threatening bleeding or thromboembolic events (including all‐cause mortality, major and life‐threatening bleeding, stroke, or myocardial infarction), and major or life‐threatening bleeding, compared with DAPT at 30 days and 3 months. Furthermore, aspirin alone, compared with DAPT, did not increase the incidence of the composite of thromboembolic events (all‐cause mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction) at 30 days and 3 months.

### Comparison of single versus dual antiplatelet therapy after TAVR: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112FnBSo]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

We aim to evaluate the efficacy of dual versus single anti-platelet therapy (SAPT) after TAVR through a systematic review and meta-analysis of published research.

Background

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel is a commonly practiced strategy after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, there is lack of sufficient evidence supporting this approach.

Method

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, and the clinical trial registry maintained at clinicaltrials.gov for randomized control trials (RCT) and observational studies comparing DAPT with SAPT post TAVR. Event rates were compared using a forest plot of relative risk with 95% confidence intervals using a random-effects model assuming inter-study heterogeneity.

Results

A total of six studies (3 RCTs and 3 observational studies, n = 840) were included in the final analysis. Compared to SAPT, DAPT was associated with increased risk of significant bleeding (life threatening and major) [RR = 2.52 (95% CI 1.62–3.92, P < 0.0001)] with the number needed to harm for major or life-threatening bleeding calculated to be 10.4. There was no significant difference in the incidence of stroke [RR = 1.06 (95% CI, 0.43–2.60, P = 0.90)], spontaneous myocardial infarction [RR = 2.08 (95% CI, 0.56–7.70, P = 0.27)] and all-cause mortality [RR = 1.18 (95% CI, 0.68–2.05, P = 0.56] in the DAPT and SAPT groups.

Conclusion

In this small meta-analysis of DAPT versus SAPT after TAVR, DAPT did not prevent stroke, myocardial infarction or death while the risk of bleeding was higher. Results from ongoing trials are awaited to determine the best anti-thrombotic approach after TAVR.

### Duration of antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116vtT2d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

All data in our study are available as published papers given its nature of systematic review and meta‐analysis.

Search Strategy

All RCTs and observational studies which investigated SAPT versus DAPT following TAVR were identified using a 2‐level strategy. First, databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database were searched through November 6, 2020 using web‐based search engines (PubMed, OVID, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). Second, relevant studies were identified through a manual search of secondary sources including references of initially identified articles, reviews, and commentaries. All references were downloaded for consolidation, elimination of duplicates, and further analyses. Search terms included "transcatheter aortic valve replacement/implantation", and "antithrombotic", "antiplatelet", "aspirin", or "clopidogrel" (Figure S1). We did not apply language restriction. Two authors (Y.Y. and T.K.) reviewed the search results independently to select the studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus.

Inclusion/Exclusion and Quality Assessment

Included studies met the following criteria: (1) the study design was a RCT or an observational study of patients who underwent TAVR; (2) enrolled patients were assigned to or were in SAPT or DAPT group, and (3) outcomes included the rate of major or life‐threatening bleeding. Studies with undefined duration of DAPT or concomitant use of oral anticoagulants with antiplatelet therapy were excluded. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias 2.0 tool for an RCT, 12 and the Newcastle‐Ottawa Scale for observational studies 13, 14 by 2 investigators (Y.Y. and T.K.).

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the rate of major or life‐threatening bleeding. The secondary outcomes were the rates of stroke and all‐cause mortality. Outcomes were defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium 15 or Valve Academic Research Consortium‐2 16 criteria. Stroke was defined as both disabling and non‐disabling strokes and transient ischemic attack was not included.

In the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (Edoxaban vs Standard of Care and Their Effects on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation-Atrial Fibrillation) trial, edoxaban was noninferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for a composite outcome of ischemic and bleeding complications but increased major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Women are at higher risk of bleeding and stroke than men after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. It is unclear whether the effect of edoxaban on these complications varies in relation to sex.

Objectives

This study was to assess the effect of edoxaban vs VKA according to sex in the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial.

Methods

The primary outcomes were net adverse cardiovascular events (NACE) and major bleeding, assessed considering the effective time on study medication (safety analysis).

Results

Out of 1,377 patients, 658 (47.8%) were women. Risks for ischemic and major bleeding outcomes were similar between women and men. Edoxaban compared to VKA was associated with a similar risk of NACE in women (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.81–1.65) and men (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.76–1.53; P for interaction = 0.820) and a higher risk of major bleeding in both sexes (P for interaction = 0.170). The risk increase of major bleeding was attenuated in women (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.69–1.79) as compared to men (HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.07–2.85). There were no treatment-related differences for ischemic complications in both sexes.

Conclusions

Edoxaban compared to VKA was associated with a similar risk of NACE and higher risk of major bleeding in both sexes. The increase in bleeding complications with edoxaban was attenuated in women.

### Sex differences among patients receiving edoxaban vs vitamin K antagonist for atrial fibrillation after TAVR [^116GU2nB]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In both sexes, rates of MACCE, all-cause death and the single non-fatal ischemic components did not differ in patients treated with edoxaban vs VKA. However, there was an increase of cardiovascular death in women on edoxaban. The absolute number of this complication was low; in addition this effect was not present in the intention to treat population and in prior studies comparing edoxaban with VKA. Except for a single observational study, the rates of fatal and non-fatal ischemic events in patients treated with edoxaban vs VKA were similar in non-randomized studiesand in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, which compared these 2 treatments in 21,105 patients with non-valvular AF. In the ATLANTIS (Anti-Thrombotic Strategy to Lower All Cardiovascular and Neurologic Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Events after Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis) study, among the 451 TAVR patients (> 50% women) with an indication for oral anticoagulant, no differences could be observed for any of the ischemic or bleeding outcomes between apixaban and standard of care. For these reasons, the increase in cardiovascular fatalities observed in women treated with edoxaban is probably a result of chance.

In summary, our analysis showed that the effect of edoxaban vs VKA on NACE and major bleeding was consistent in women and men with AF after successful TAVR. However, a different effect of edoxaban in function of sex is not excluded and has to be verified in an adequately powered RCT.

Study Limitations

This is a secondary analysis and was not powered to assess the effect of edoxaban vs VKA in women or men. Therefore, the results have to be considered exploratory. Additional caution is needed when interpreting the results of single bleeding or ischemic outcomes because of the low number of events. Moreover, the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF had an open-label design that entailed a risk of reporting bias regarding the trial outcomes. The modest and asymmetric adherence to the experimental and control regimen might have affected the results. Finally, these results apply only to patients after successful TAVR with AF, intermediate operative risk, and symptomatic aortic stenosis.

### Apixaban vs. standard of care after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: the ATLANTIS trial [^1135z5wc]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

The respective roles of oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remain debated. ATLANTIS is an international, randomized, open-label, superiority trial comparing apixaban to the standard of care.

Methods and Results

After successful TAVI, 1500 patients were randomized (1:1) to receive apixaban 5mg (2.5mg if impaired renal function or concomitant antiplatelet therapy) (n = 749) twice daily, or standard of care (n = 751). Randomization was stratified by the need for chronic anticoagulation therapy. Standard-of-care patients received a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) (Stratum 1) or antiplatelet therapy (Stratum 2) if there was an indication for anticoagulation or not, respectively. The primary endpoint was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke or transient ischaemic attack, systemic embolism, intracardiac or bioprosthesis thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and life-threatening, disabling, or major bleeding over 1-year follow-up. The primary safety endpoint was major, disabling, or life-threatening bleeding. The primary outcome occurred in 138 (18.4%) and 151 (20.1%) patients receiving apixaban or standard of care, respectively [hazard ratio (HR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–1.16] and there was no evidence of interaction between treatment and stratum (Pinteraction = 0.57). The primary safety endpoint was similar in both groups (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.72–1.44). In Stratum 1 (n = 451), an exploratory analysis showed no difference for all endpoints between apixaban and VKA. In Stratum 2 (n = 1049), the primary outcome and primary safety endpoint did not differ, but obstructive valve thrombosis was reduced with apixaban vs. antiplatelet therapy (HR 0.19; 95% CI 0.08–0.46), while a signal of higher non-cardiovascular mortality was observed with apixaban.

Conclusion

After TAVI, apixaban was not superior to the standard of care, irrespective of an indication for oral anticoagulation.

### Treatment satisfaction and convenience for patients with atrial fibrillation on edoxaban or vitamin K antagonists after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a post hoc analysis from the ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial [^1164ciiX]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

ENVISAGE-TAVI AF (Edoxaban versus Standard of Care and Their Effects on Clinical Outcomes in Patients Having Undergone Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation-Atrial Fibrillation; NCT02943785) was a prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) edoxaban with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The effect of edoxaban- or VKA-based therapy on patient-reported outcomes remains unknown, as most studies focus on efficacy and safety. Pre-TAVR patient-reported expectations and post-TAVR Treatment Satisfaction and Convenience with edoxaban or VKA treatment (at months 3 and 12) were analyzed using the Perception of Anticoagulation Treatment Questionnaire (PACT-Q). This analysis included randomized and dosed patients with an evaluable PACT-Q1 assessment at baseline and ≥ 1 postbaseline assessment (PACT-Q2). Subanalyses included patients stratified by pre-TAVR anticoagulant (NOAC, VKA, no NOAC/VKA). Edoxaban- (n = 585) and VKA-treated (n = 522) patients had similar baseline characteristics and treatment expectations. Pre-TAVR anticoagulant use did not affect treatment expectations. After TAVR, edoxaban-treated patients had significantly higher Treatment Satisfaction and Convenience scores compared with VKA-treated patients at all time points (p < 0.001 for all). Among edoxaban-treated patients, those who received VKAs pre-TAVR were significantly more satisfied with treatment than those who received NOACs (p < 0.001) or no NOACs/VKAs (p = 0.003); however, there was no significant difference in the perception of convenience (p = 0.927 and p = 0.092, respectively). Conversely, among VKA-treated patients, the type of anticoagulant used pre-TAVR did not affect Treatment Satisfaction or Convenience scores post-TAVR. In conclusion, patients with atrial fibrillation who received edoxaban post-TAVR reported significantly higher Treatment Satisfaction and Convenience scores compared with those who received VKAs, resulting in a clinically meaningful difference between treatment groups.

### Direct oral anticoagulation vs antiplatelet therapy and risk of intracranial hemorrhage… [^115j8hFy]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Data Extraction and Synthesis The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guideline. Data were extracted independently by 2 researchers. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to report pooled treatment effects and 95% CIs. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage. Of these, 7 trials were double-blinded, randomized clinical trials, 13, 16–21 and 2 trials used a prospective randomized, open-label blinded–end point design. 22, 23 The intervention group was apixaban for 4 trials, 17, 20–22 dabigatran for 2 trials, 19, 23 and rivaroxaban for 3 trials. 13, 16, 18 Two trials, COMPASS16 and EINSTEIN13 choice, evaluated intermediate-dose rivaroxaban. There was heterogeneity among DOAC agents. In an analysis by DOAC agent, the respective estimates for ICH risk were as follows: rivaroxaban, OR, 2. 09; dabigatran, OR,

1.

00; and apixaban, OR, 0.
72. There was heterogeneity among DOAC agents. In an analysis by DOAC agent, the respective estimates for major hemorrhage risk were as follows: rivaroxaban, OR, 1. 91; dabigatran, OR,

### 2017 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the management of adults with aortic Stenosis: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^113MLDRN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) antithrombotic therapy — new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) after TAVR and pharmacotherapy guidance are as follows: the incidence of new-onset AF after TAVR ranges from < 1% to 8.6%. In the absence of clinical trials evaluating alternate antithrombotic regimens after TAVR, there is no consensus on the optimal agent(s) or duration of therapy, and there are no randomized studies of different antithrombotic regimens after TAVR. The current standard antithrombotic therapy after TAVR is clopidogrel 75 mg orally daily for 3 to 6 months with oral aspirin 75 mg to 100 mg daily lifelong. Patients with chronic AF or other indications for long-term anticoagulation should receive anticoagulation as per guidelines for AF in patients with prosthetic heart valves. Vitamin K antagonist therapy may be considered in the first 3 months after TAVR in patients who are at risk of AF or valve thrombosis; when vitamin K antagonist therapy is used, continuation of aspirin is reasonable, and it may be prudent to avoid other antiplatelet therapy given the increased risk of bleeding with multiple simultaneous antithrombotic agents. For surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement, data support a Class IIb indication for 3 months of vitamin K antagonist therapy after valve implantation, but whether these data apply to TAVR is unknown.

### Comprehensive update on the new indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the latest 2017 European guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease [^112GrjLH]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Post-TAVR management

Patients who receive a surgical or transcatheter heart valve should have a transthoracic echocardiography before discharge. Echocardiography should be routinely performed within 30–90 days to establish baseline valve function, at 1 year after AVR and then annually thereafter. Important parameters to follow are (the temporal evolution of) the transvalvular gradient, the degree of PVR/central regurgitation and the overall left ventricular function.

Regarding antithrombotic treatment following TAVR, the new 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines state that dual antiplatelet therapy should be considered for 3–6 months after TAVR, followed by lifelong single therapy in patients who do not need oral anticoagulation for other reasons (class IIa, LoE C). Single antiplatelet therapy may be considered after TAVR in the case of bleeding risk (class IIb, LoE C). In patients with TAVR with atrial fibrillation, novel oral anticoagulants should be considered as an alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) after the third month of valve implantation (class IIa, LoE C).

Recently, subclinical leaflet thrombosis has been reported to occur in bioprosthetic aortic valves, more commonly in transcatheter than in surgical valves. This subclinical thrombosis of bioprosthesis may be more frequent when assessed by cardiac CT and associated with a moderate increase in transprosthetic gradients but the clinical consequences are unknown. It has been speculated that this phenomenon has importance with regard to increased risk of thromboembolic (neurological) events and/or reduced valve durability. Anticoagulation, but not dual antiplatelet therapy, is effective in prevention or treatment of subclinical leaflet thrombosis. Anticoagulant using a VKA and/or unfractionated heparin is the first-line treatment of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis. Despite excellent outcomes after TAVR with the new-generation valves, prevention and treatment of subclinical leaflet thrombosis might offer a potential opportunity for further improvement in clinical outcomes. Two ongoing randomised controlled trials (GALILEO, ATLANTIS) are specifically investigating which antithrombotic strategy might be best following TAVR.

Finally, in case of bioprosthetic valve failure with severe restenosis or aortic regurgitation (eg, degenerative, post-endocarditis), transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation is an option in this higher risk patient population.

### Direct oral anticoagulation for post-TAVI atrial fibrillation | NEJM resident 360… [^112Tibxz]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

After a mean follow up of 1. 5 years, edoxaban was found to be noninferior to warfarin for the composite primary efficacy outcome of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, or major bleeding. These results suggest that in patients such as the one described above with atrial fibrillation following TAVI with a bioprosthetic valve, edoxaban may be a reasonable alternative to warfarin. The following NEJM Journal Watch Summary provides further details of the study. Mark S. Link, MD, reviewing Van Mieghem NM et al. N Engl J Med 2021 Aug 28.

Patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement traditionally receive vitamin K antagonists because of the long history of warfarin use in patients with valve replacements and the inferiority of direct-acting oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in those with mechanical valves. In the industry-funded, multicenter, open-label ENVISAGE-TAVI AF trial, researchers compared the safety and efficacy of the DOAC edoxaban and a VKA in this setting. Among 1426 patients randomized to edoxaban or a VKA for prevalent or incident AF after successful TAVR, during a median follow-up of approximately 1. 5 years, the groups had similar rates of the composite primary efficacy outcome of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, systemic thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, or major bleeding. The rate of major bleeding was significantly higher with edoxaban compared with VKA. The excess bleeding risk in the edoxaban group was largely attributable to GI bleeding.

### Usefulness of antiplatelet therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^114jTQXp]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The rationale for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is to facilitate endothelialization of metallic struts of the transcatheter heart valve and to prevent thrombosis that could lead to thromboembolic events. Based on expert consensus, current societal guidelines recommend DAPT for 1 to 6 months after TAVI with weak evidence. Although the pivotal TAVI trials mandated this regimen, the evidence for the efficacy of DAPT to prevent transcatheter heart valve thrombosis is limited to 3 small trials and a handful of observational studies. Multiple coronary trials have demonstrated that DAPT is associated with increased bleeding in comparison with single antiplatelet therapy, especially in elderly patients. TAVI patients are predominantly elderly and frequently have risk factors that predispose them to bleeding. Herein, we summarize the evidence for antiplatelet therapy after TAVI and explore the theoretical benefit of DAPT to prevent thromboembolic events versus the risk of increased bleeding.

### Frequency, predictors, and clinical impact of valvular and perivalvular thrombus after transcatheter aortic Valve replacement [^1139ZoGh]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclinical aortic valve complex (valvular and perivalvular) thrombus is not rare after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The risk factors and clinical implications of these findings remain uncertain.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the frequency, predictors, and clinical outcome of aortic valve complex thrombus after TAVR.

Methods

In the ADAPT-TAVR (Anticoagulation Versus Dual Antiplatelet Therapy for Prevention of Leaflet Thrombosis and Cerebral Embolization After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) trial comparing edoxaban vs dual antiplatelet therapy in TAVR patients without an indication for chronic anticoagulation, the frequency of valvular (subclinical leaflet thrombus) and perivalvular (supravalvular, subvalvular, and sinus of Valsalva) thrombus was evaluated by 4-dimensional computed tomography at 6 months. The association of these phenomena with new cerebral thromboembolism on brain magnetic resonance imaging, neurologic and neurocognitive dysfunction, and clinical outcomes was assessed.

Results

Among 211 patients with 6-month computed tomography evaluations, 91 patients (43.1%) had thrombus at any aortic valve complex, 30 (14.2%) patients had leaflet thrombus, and 78 (37.0%) patients had perivalvular thrombus. A small maximum diameter of the stent at the valve level and low body surface area were independent predictors of aortic valve complex and perivalvular thrombus, and decreased renal function was an independent predictor of leaflet thrombus. No significant differences were observed in new cerebral lesions, neurologic or neurocognitive functions, or clinical outcomes among patients with or without valvular or perivalvular thrombus.

Conclusions

Subclinical aortic valve complex (valvular and perivalvular) thrombus was common in patients who had undergone successful TAVR. However, these imaging phenomena were not associated with new cerebral thromboembolism, neurologic or neurocognitive dysfunction, or adverse clinical outcomes.

### Subclinical leaflet thrombosis and subclinical aortic valve complex thrombosis in TAVR [^113GB4uF]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

SLT has evolved into a broader concept known as subclinical aortic valve–complex thrombosis (Figure 3), which encompasses both valvular and perivalvular thrombi. Perivalvular thrombi, including supravalvular, subvalvular, and sinus of Valsalva regions, have been reported, refining the understanding of thrombosis affecting TAVR devices and the surrounding native environment. A substudy of the ADAPT-TAVR (Anticoagulation vs Dual Antiplatelet Therapy for Prevention of Leaflet Thrombosis and Cerebral Embolization After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) trial, aimed to investigate the effect of edoxaban compared with dual antiplatelet therapy on preventing leaflet thrombosis and the associated risks of cerebral thromboembolism and neurological or neurocognitive dysfunction after TAVR. Specifically, Choi et al.reported that 91 of 211 patients (43.1%) with CT scans had thrombus at any location within the aortic valve complex: 14.2% had a leaflet thrombus, 37.0% had a perivalvular thrombus, and 8.1% had both a leaflet and perivalvular thrombus. Moscarelli et al.reported a 44% incidence of thrombosis involving any component of the aortic valve complex at 6-month follow-up. Moreover, Zhou et al. analyzed a small cohort of 61 patients who underwent long-term annual cardiac computed tomography angiography follow-ups for over 5 years after TAVR. Their findings revealed that HALT occurred in 54.1% of cases, hypoattenuated filling defects in the aortic sinus occurred in 37.7% of cases, and structural filling defects within the stent occurred in 73.8% of patients. However, no study to date has comprehensively evaluated how valvular, perivalvular, or combined pathologies distinctly influence valve durability or the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, highlighting a critical gap in current cardiovascular research. Evidence linking SLT to long-term valve durability remains inconclusive, and conflicting data on antithrombotic strategies preclude routine anticoagulation for durability enhancement without an individualized bleeding risk assessment.

### Warfarin and antiplatelet therapy versus Warfarin alone for treating patients With Atrial fibrillation undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^116qWf5G]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study sought to examine the risk of ischemic events and bleeding episodes associated with differing antithrombotic strategies in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF).

Background

Guidelines recommend antiplatelet therapy (APT) post-TAVR to reduce the risk of stroke. However, data on the efficacy and safety of this recommendation in the setting of a concomitant indication for oral anticoagulation (due to atrial fibrillation [AF]) with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) are scarce.

Methods

A multicenter evaluation comprising 621 patients with AF undergoing TAVR was undertaken. Post-TAVR prescriptions were used to determine the antithrombotic regimen used according to the following 2 groups: monotherapy (MT) with VKA (n = 101) or multiple antithrombotic therapy (MAT) with VKA plus 1 or 2 antiplatelet agents (aspirin or clopidogrel; n = 520). Endpoint definitions were in accordance with Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. The rate of stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death), major or life-threatening bleeding events, and death were assessed by a Cox multivariate model regression survival analysis according to the antithrombotic regime used.

Results

During a median follow-up of 13 months (interquartile range: 3 to 31 months) there were no differences between groups in the rate of stroke (MT: 5%, MAT: 5.2%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45 to 3.48; p = 0.67), major adverse cardiovascular events (MT: 13.9%, MAT: 16.3%; adjusted HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 0.75 to 2.36; p = 0.33), and death (MT 22.8%, MAT: 19.2%; adjusted HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.50; p = 0.76). A higher risk of major or life-threatening bleeding was found in the MAT group (MT: 14.9%, MAT: 24.4%; adjusted HR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.28; p = 0.04). These results remained similar when patients receiving VKA plus only 1 antiplatelet agent (n = 463) were evaluated.

Conclusions

In TAVR recipients prescribed VKA therapy for AF, concomitant antiplatelet therapy use appears not to reduce the incidence of stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events, or death, while increasing the risk of major or life-threatening bleeding.

### Cerebrovascular events in patients undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a pooled patient-level study [^115yUSRb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite lower‐risk patients, improved valve design, and growing operator experience, stroke rates did not decline over the years. To reduce cerebrovascular event rates, various anticoagulation and antiplatelet strategies have been evaluated.

The GALILEO (Global Study Comparing a Rivaroxaban‐based Antithrombotic Strategy to an Antiplatelet‐based Strategy after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement to Optimize Clinical Outcomes) trial randomized 1644 patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation to either rivaroxaban with aspirin (plus 3 months clopidogrel) or aspirin only (plus 3 months clopidogrel). The trial was halted prematurely due to higher bleeding and death rates in the rivaroxaban group, whereas there was no difference in cerebrovascular event rates.

The ATLANTIS (Anti‐Thrombotic Strategy to Lower All Cardiovascular and Neurologic Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Events after Trans‐Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Stenosis) trial stratum 2 randomized 1049 patients without an indication for anticoagulation to apixaban or standard of care (single or dual antiplatelet therapy). There were no differences in the combined primary end point of death, stroke, major bleeding, systemic embolism, cardiac or valve thrombosis.

POPular TAVI (Antiplatelet Therapy for Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic‐Valve Implantation) trial randomized 690 patients without an indication for anticoagulation to aspirin plus 3 months clopidogrel or aspirin only. Aspirin only was superior for reduction of bleeding, but there was no difference in cerebrovascular event rates between treatment groups.

Cerebral protection devices were developed to prevent cerebrovascular events by periprocedural capturing (or deflection) of emboli. These devices capture debris in up to 99% of patients. The PROTECTED‐TAVR (Stroke Protection with Sentinel During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) study randomized 3000 patients to TAVI with versus without cerebral protection. There was no reduction in clinical stroke, but rates of disabling stroke were lower. However, this finding should be interpreted with caution, because disabling stroke was 1 of 15 secondary end points for which the study was not powered.

In summary, more intensive anticoagulation resulted in higher bleeding risk without a benefit on cerebrovascular event rates. Also, routine use of cerebral protection devices did not reduce overall cerebrovascular event rates.

In the current study, major bleeding incidence in patients with stroke was higher than in patients without stroke, which may be explained by hemorrhagic strokes or as a result of stroke therapy with thrombolysis or thrombectomy. Alternatively, frail patients are at increased risk for both bleeding and thromboembolic events.

### Antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^117LTnJ6]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

There is limited evidence to support decision making on antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of aspirin-only (ASA) versus dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following TAVI.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and pooled analysis of individual patient data from 672 participants comparing single versus DAPT following TAVI. Primary endpoint was defined as the composite of net adverse clinical and cerebral events (NACE) at 1month, including all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, life-threatening and major bleeding.

Results

At 30days a NACE rate of 13% was observed in the ASA-only and in 15% of the DAPT group (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.43, p = 0.50). A tendency towards less life-threatening and major bleeding was observed in patients treated with ASA (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.11, p = 0.09). Also, ASA was not associated with an increased all-cause mortality (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.27, p = 0.83), ACS (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.51, p = 0.57) or stroke (OR 1.21; 95% CI 0.36 to 4.03, p = 0.75).

Conclusions

No difference in 30-day NACE rate was observed between ASA-only or DAPT following TAVI. Moreover, a trend towards less life-threatening and major bleeding was observed in favour of ASA. Consequently the additive value of clopidogrel warrants further investigation.

### Meta-analysis of studies comparing dual-versus mono-antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^114kiDjU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), although some studies suggest mono-antiplatelet therapy is equally efficacious with an improved safety profile. We performed a meta-analysis of studies comparing DAPT with mono-antiplatelet therapy after TAVI. Study quality and heterogeneity were assessed using Jadad score, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and Cochran's Q statistics. Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using fixed effect models as the primary analysis. Eight studies including 2,439 patients met the inclusion criteria. At 30 days, DAPT was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (OR 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34 to 3.18, p = 0.001), major or life-threatening bleeding (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.59, p < 0.001), and major vascular complications (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.51 to 3.06, p < 0.001). There was no difference in the rate of the combined end point of stroke or transient ischemic attack, or myocardial infarction. Outcome data up to 6 months were available in 5 studies; all-cause mortality and stroke were similar between groups, although major or life-threatening bleeding was more frequent with DAPT. In conclusion, in patients undergoing TAVI, DAPT is associated with increased risk at 30 days of all-cause mortality, major or life-threatening bleeding, and major vascular complications without a decrease in ischemic complications; at 6 months, the excess bleeding risk persisted. These data suggest a safety concern with DAPT and justify further investigation of the optimal antiplatelet therapy regimen after TAVI.

### Off-label use of direct oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin for left ventricular thrombi… [^1151JrVV]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Type and duration of anticoagulant use. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinically apparent SSE. Results. Conclusions and Relevance In this multicenter cohort study of anticoagulation strategies for LV thrombi, DOAC treatment was associated with a higher risk of SSE compared with warfarin use, even after adjustment for other factors. These results challenge the assumption of DOAC equivalence with warfarin for LV thrombi and highlight the need for prospective randomized clinical trials to determine the most effective treatment strategies for LV thrombi. The median time to the second study was 328 days. A total of 231 patients had echocardiographically confirmed resolution of their thrombus, including 56 while being treated with a DOAC, 131 while being treated with warfarin, 21 during treatment with parenteral anticoagulation, and 23 without any anticoagulation.

In this analysis, there were 98 patients who discontinued therapy after completing at least 90 days of anticoagulation. Of these, 64 patients had follow-up associated with warfarin, and 34 patients had follow-up associated with a DOAC. Also of interest is the late separation of event curves, largely after the initial anticoagulation window associated with LV thrombi. One potential explanation is that some late embolic events are associated with phenomena outside the LV, such as vascular atheroemboli or calcifications, leaflet thrombosis, or septic vegetations that, in turn, may be differentially suppressed by DOACs compared with warfarin. Finally, it may be that some LV thrombi are markers of longer-term thrombotic risk that persists after the initial period of anticoagulation and even despite thrombus resolution.

The present study has several limitations by virtue of its retrospective nature, particularly the possibility of unmeasured confounders accounting for the difference in embolic events between DOACs and warfarin. However, there was no significant difference between most of the clinical variables that were measured. Even so, after adjustment for known factors associated with embolic risk from prior literature, including thrombus morphologic characterstics and mobility, as well as those identified here, the difference between DOAC treatment and warfarin treatment persisted.

### Comparison of warfarin versus antiplatelet therapy after surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement [^111NCac4]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After aortic valve replacement (AVR), patients still experience excess mortality compared with the general population. The observed excess mortality can be partly attributed to morbidity related to the prosthesis and associated medication. Biological as compared with mechanical prostheses require less intensive antithrombotic therapy and are therefore the first-line choice in most patients undergoing surgical AVR.

The reported incidence of long-term thromboembolic events after aortic valve surgery with a bioprosthesis (bioSAVR) vary considerably, and generalisation of historical reports to current AVR cohorts must be done with caution. Patient characteristics have changed over the years with higher mean age, more atrial fibrillation (AF), concomitant coronary disease and comorbidities that contribute to increased risk of thromboembolic events yet with a lower 30-day mortality. There is a substantial amount of data supporting long-term oral anticoagulant treatment (OAC) after valve intervention in patients with AF but whether the majority of patients without prior AF benefit from OAC treatment is not established. In the absence of other indications for OAC, current guidelines recommend oral antithrombotic treatment with aspirin or warfarin for 3 months after bioSAVR. This recommendation is based on a low level of evidence and should be regarded as expert opinions only.

The occurrence of leaflet thrombosis and immobility in bioprostheses with the potential influence on the risk of ischaemic stroke has been increasingly recognised after both transcatheter AVR (TAVI) and bioSAVR. However, the true incidence is unclear and the clinical relevance of subclinical leaflet thrombosis is not well established. The incidence of thromboembolic events during the first 3 months after discharge is low and in some series the majority of valve thrombosis cases after SAVR occur > 1 year after implantation. Altogether, these data suggest that it might be beneficial to prolong the duration and/or intensity of antithrombotic treatment. On the contrary, bleeding risk increases with longer duration. In summary, there are conflicting opinions on the optimal antithrombotic treatment, including strategy and duration of treatment after intervention with a biological prosthesis. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of different antithrombotic therapies to identify the antithrombotic regimen that yields highest possible balance between thrombotic and bleeding risks following bioSAVR.

### Meta-analysis comparing single versus dual antiplatelet therapy following transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^113ChH1s]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

To compare dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) as antithrombotic treatment after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for the prevention of ischemic events, vascular and bleeding events, and death. Data from the 3 randomized trials comparing DAPT versus SAPT post-TAVI were pooled and analyzed in a patient-level meta-analysis. The primary end point was the occurrence of death, major or life-threatening bleedings, and major vascular complications at 30-day follow-up. Events were adjudicated according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 definitions. A total of 421 patients randomized to DAPT (210 patients) or SAPT (211 patients) post-TAVI were analyzed. There were no differences between groups in baseline clinical and procedural characteristics. The occurrence of the 30-day combined primary end point was higher in the DAPT group (17.6% vs 10.9%, odds ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 2.98, p = 0.050), with an increased rate of major or life-threatening bleeding events in the DAPT group (11.4% vs 5.2%, odds ratio 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 4.46, p = 0.022). There were no differences between DAPT and SAPT groups in the incidence of death (5.2% vs 3.8%, p = 0.477), global ischemic events (3.8% vs 3.8%, p = 0.999), or stroke (2.4% vs 2.4%, p = 0.996). DAPT (vs SAPT) was associated with a higher rate of major adverse events after TAVI, mainly driven by an increased risk of major or life-threatening bleeding complications along with a lack of beneficial effect on ischemic events. These results do not support the current recommendation of DAPT as antithrombotic therapy after TAVI.

Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Therapy

OACs were prescribed based on prescription information and national guidelines.VKA doses were adjusted to maintain a prothrombin time–international normalized ratio of 1.6 to 2.5 or 2.0 to 3.0 according to periodic guidelines. Patients taking DOACs were mostly selected based on their creatinine clearance levels, whether nominal‐ or half‐dose DOACs were prescribed. In some patients, dual antiplatelet therapy was prescribed for 3 to 6 months. Continuation of single antiplatelet therapy was recommended; however, owing to the high risk of bleeding, antiplatelet therapy was discontinued at the clinician's discretion. Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies after TAVR were administered at the discretion of the heart team at each institution, considering the risk of bleeding, stroke, and thrombosis.
