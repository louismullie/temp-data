## Question

How is MAP calculated

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how mean arterial pressure (MAP) is calculated, including the standard formula, alternatives, physiological rationale, limitations, and practical implications for measurement and targets. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiological definition of MAP and why it matters. Then, I should verify the standard empirical formula and its derivation. Next, I will examine alternative formulas and heart rate–corrected variants. After that, I need to check the evidence on accuracy and bias versus invasive reference standards. Then, I should review device-specific issues, especially oscillometric algorithms. Finally, I will consider clinical thresholds, special populations, and synthesize a pragmatic recommendation with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the physiological definition so I don't anchor on a heuristic. MAP is the time-weighted average arterial pressure over a single cardiac cycle, reflecting the perfusion pressure driving organ blood flow; clinically, it is a better indicator of tissue perfusion than systolic or diastolic pressure alone, which is why guidelines and studies use MAP thresholds for risk stratification and therapy targets [^112XgRCX].

> Now, I should verify the standard empirical formula. The most commonly used estimate is MAP = diastolic blood pressure (DBP) + 1/3 × pulse pressure (PP), where PP = systolic blood pressure (SBP) − DBP; this is often algebraically rearranged as MAP = (SBP + 2 × DBP)/3, which weights diastolic pressure more because diastole occupies a greater portion of the cardiac cycle at typical heart rates [^112XgRCX] [^113DicpQ] [^113UGSYD].

> Wait, let me verify the physiological rationale before I overstate it. The 1/3 coefficient assumes that the mean of the arterial waveform sits roughly one-third of the way up from diastolic to systolic; however, this is an approximation that presumes a fixed waveform morphology and ignores the fact that the relative time spent in systole lengthens with higher heart rates, potentially altering the weighting of systolic versus diastolic contributions to the true mean pressure [^112XgRCX] [^116rm17K].

> Hold on, I should review alternatives that attempt to improve accuracy. Several formulas adjust the PP coefficient: 0.40 or 0.412 instead of 0.33, and some add a constant offset (e.g., +5 mmHg), while others incorporate heart rate explicitly; for example, Razminia et al. proposed MAP = DBP + [0.33 + (HR × 0.0012)] × PP to account for the systolic time fraction increasing with HR, and Chemla et al. explored a geometric mean approach, √[SBP × DBP], though the latter is less commonly used clinically [^112XgRCX] [^116rm17K].

> I need to check how these formulas perform against the gold standard. Invasive studies using the area under the arterial pressure waveform show that the 0.33 coefficient tends to underestimate true MAP by about 1–2 mmHg on average, whereas 0.412 provides a closer estimate with minimal mean bias; pooled analyses also show excellent agreement (ICC > 0.95) across multiple formulas, indicating that while small systematic differences exist, clinical significance is modest in most settings [^112XgRCX] [^113JSAc2] [^114VM2Jh].

> But wait, what if the waveform shape varies between individuals or within the same person over time? Tonometric and waveform studies demonstrate substantial interindividual and intraindividual variability in the optimal PP fraction, ranging roughly from 0.23 to 0.58, which means fixed-coefficient formulas cannot perfectly capture the true mean for all patients; this variability is influenced by vascular compliance, wave reflections, and hemodynamic state, reinforcing that the "best" coefficient is population- and context-dependent [^112hXDCF] [^113JLsQu].

> I should double-check device-specific issues because clinical MAP often comes from oscillometry. Oscillometric devices directly measure MAP from the cuff oscillation envelope and then derive SBP and DBP using proprietary algorithms; importantly, displayed MAP values can differ meaningfully from invasive MAP, and differences in cuff MAP are associated with discrepancies in SBP and DBP, underscoring that manufacturer algorithms are not interchangeable and may introduce both systematic and random error [^111mudQF] [^11319oWr] [^114FjyYD].

> Let me consider the clinical implications of these small biases. In routine care, the standard 1/3 PP formula remains acceptable, but awareness that it tends to slightly underestimate true MAP can inform thresholds and trend interpretation; for research or when precision matters, using 0.412 may reduce bias, and in tachycardic patients, a heart rate–corrected formula may better approximate the true mean, though most bedside contexts still rely on the simple 1/3 rule for expediency [^113JSAc2] [^116rm17K] [^112XgRCX].

> Next, I should review commonly used clinical thresholds so I don't overgeneralize. A MAP of about 65 mmHg is widely used as a minimum perfusion target in adult shock and sepsis, with randomized data showing no mortality benefit to targeting higher MAPs (e.g., 75–85 mmHg) overall, though a subgroup with chronic hypertension may have less renal replacement therapy at higher MAP targets; in neurocritical care, some guidelines and studies suggest higher targets (e.g., 75–90 mmHg) after cardiac arrest or spinal cord injury, but feasibility and evidence vary, and individualized autoregulation-guided targets are an emerging area with heterogeneity in methods and outcomes [^111Yskyf] [^111Yskyf] [^1142pqNJ] [^114PgJAi].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In pediatrics, age-appropriate MAP targets are typically referenced to the 5th percentile for age, and in brain death evaluation, adult MAP should generally be maintained at or above 75 mmHg to avoid false-positive assessments; in pregnancy, MAP is incorporated into preeclampsia risk tools and management thresholds, reflecting its physiologic and prognostic relevance in obstetric populations [^114swthD] [^116tDCw9] [^112XgRCX].

> Hold on, I should verify practical measurement advice. When both invasive and noninvasive MAP are available, prefer the invasive value for decision-making; when using oscillometric devices, recognize that displayed MAP is device-specific and may not align with invasive MAP, so trends and clinical context matter; and when precision is needed, consider using a 0.412 coefficient or a heart rate–adjusted formula, acknowledging that even then, interindividual waveform variability limits perfect accuracy [^114kV357] [^11319oWr] [^112dS1QU].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line. MAP is best conceptualized as the time-averaged arterial pressure over a cardiac cycle; the standard estimate MAP = DBP + 1/3 × PP is simple and widely used, tends to underestimate true MAP by about 1–2 mmHg, and remains clinically adequate for most routine decisions; using 0.412 instead of 0.33 can reduce bias, and heart rate–corrected formulas may help in tachycardia, but device-specific oscillometric MAP and individual waveform variability mean that clinical judgment and, when available, invasive measurements should guide critical decisions [^112XgRCX] [^113JSAc2] [^112dS1QU] [^11319oWr].

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is the average arterial pressure over a cardiac cycle and is most commonly calculated as **MAP = DBP + 1/3(SBP − DBP)** [^113DicpQ], where DBP is diastolic and SBP is systolic pressure. This formula weights diastolic pressure more because diastole lasts longer than systole at typical heart rates [^113DicpQ]. For higher accuracy, especially at elevated heart rates, a **heart rate–adjusted formula** [^116rm17K] (MAP = DBP + [0.33 + 0.0012 × HR] × PP) can be used. MAP is a key perfusion metric; maintaining MAP ≥ 65 mmHg is standard in critical care to support organ blood flow [^111Yskyf].

---

## Physiological basis of MAP

MAP reflects the average pressure driving organ perfusion and is shaped by **cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and arterial compliance** [^112f674y]. Diastolic pressure contributes more to MAP because diastole occupies about two-thirds of the cardiac cycle at normal heart rates, so MAP is closer to diastolic than systolic pressure [^116rm17K].

---

## Standard formula for MAP calculation

The most commonly used formula is:

MAP = DBP + 1/3(SBP − DBP)

This simplifies to:

MAP = (SBP + 2 × DBP) / 3

This weighting assumes a 2:1 diastolic-to-systolic ratio, which is reasonable at typical heart rates [^116rm17K].

---

## Alternative formulas and adjustments

Several **alternative formulas** have been proposed to improve accuracy across varying hemodynamics:

| **Formula** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| MAP = DBP + 0.4(SBP − DBP) | Uses a 0.4 coefficient to better match waveform-derived MAP in some populations [^112hXDCF] [^11119fBn] |
| MAP = DBP + 0.412(SBP − DBP) | Statistically optimal coefficient in recent validation work [^113JSAc2] [^116GVSut] |
| MAP = DBP + [0.33 + 0.0012 × HR] × (SBP − DBP) | Heart rate–adjusted formula for higher accuracy at elevated HR [^116rm17K] |

---

These alternatives reduce bias from fixed coefficients but still rely on assumptions about waveform shape and vascular properties [^112hXDCF].

---

## Clinical significance of MAP

MAP is a **practical surrogate for organ perfusion pressure** and guides therapy in critical care:

- **General critical care target**: MAP ≥ 65 mmHg to support organ perfusion [^112bnE62].
- **Post–cardiac arrest**: MAP ≥ 75 mmHg is often targeted to protect cerebral perfusion [^112qqNSD].
- **Septic shock**: Higher MAP targets (75–85 mmHg) may benefit patients with chronic hypertension [^111Yskyf].
- **Neurogenic shock**: MAP 85–90 mmHg is recommended early after spinal cord injury [^1142pqNJ].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While MAP is useful, **limitations** include:

- **Oscillometric devices**: MAP is often estimated by proprietary algorithms; accuracy varies and may differ from invasive measurements [^11319oWr] [^111eEzVo].
- **Individual variability**: Waveform shape and vascular properties can cause small but clinically relevant errors in formula-based MAP [^112hXDCF].
- **Clinical context**: MAP alone does not capture regional perfusion or microcirculatory flow, so it must be interpreted with other clinical data [^112f674y].

---

## Summary of MAP calculation methods

| **Method** | **Formula** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Standard formula | MAP = DBP + 1/3(SBP − DBP) | Widely used; adequate for most clinical scenarios [^112XgRCX] |
| Adjusted coefficient | MAP = DBP + 0.412(SBP − DBP) | Statistically optimal; slightly more accurate [^113JSAc2] |
| Heart rate–adjusted | MAP = DBP + [0.33 + 0.0012 × HR] × (SBP − DBP) | More accurate at elevated heart rates [^116rm17K] |

---

MAP is best estimated by **DBP + 1/3(SBP − DBP)** for routine use, with adjusted coefficients or heart rate–corrected formulas when greater accuracy is needed or heart rate is high. Maintaining MAP ≥ 65 mmHg is a practical target to support organ perfusion, but clinical context and measurement method must always be considered [^112YM8bV].

### Validation of a new formula for mean arterial pressure calculation: the new formula is superior to the standard formula [^116rm17K]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2004). Low credibility.

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) has traditionally been derived from systolic and diastolic pressures, weighted 1/3 systolic and 2/3 diastolic. No correction is made for the increasing time dominance of systole with increasing heart rates. In a previous study, we developed a new and more accurate heart rate-corrected MAP formula from central aorta pressure determinations in a large number of patients: MAP = DP + [0.33 + (HR × 0.0012)] × [PP] where SP and DP are systolic and diastolic pressure and HR is heart rate. The current study validates the new MAP formula in the same patient at increasing paced heart rates. A central aorta catheter was used to obtain computer-determined systolic, diastolic, and MAP in 12 patients. Values were obtained at baseline and then at increasing right atrial paced heart rates. The new and standard MAP formula-derived values were compared with computer-determined values. The new formula showed a much closer correlation with the computer-derived values for MAP. Standard MAP calculations for MAP can easily be improved by inclusion of a heart rate factor.

Background

There are six different formulae for estimating mean arterial pressure (MAP) from systolic and diastolic pressure readings. This study is to determine the optimum formula for calculating MAP when compared to the gold standard approach, which is the area under the curve of an invasively measured pulse waveform divided by the cardiac cycle duration.

Methods

Eight live pigs were used as the experimental model for the invasive measurement of femoral artery pressure (AP) by a fluid filled catheter connected with a pressure transducer. In addition, intraocular pressure (IOP) and jugular vein pressure (JVP) were also recorded. The mean pressure (MP) was calculated from digital waveforms sampled at 1,000 points per second with the six formulae and area method for AP, IOP and JVP.

Results

The absolute mean difference between the area MAP and each formula's MAP ranged from 0.98 to 3.23 mm Hg. Our study also found that even under physiological conditions, area MAP can vary between successive pulses by up to 5 mm Hg. For mean IOP and JVP, the mean difference between a formula's MP and the area method's was less than 1 mm Hg for most formulae. With the pooled data, there was excellent agreement amongst all formulae for MAP with the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) ranging from 0.97 to 0.99, while the ICC of most formulae for IOP and JVP was 1.0.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that all current formulae are adequate for estimating MAP, though some formulae are not suitable for mean IOP and JVP.

### Optimal calculation of mean pressure from pulse pressure [^112XgRCX]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is defined as the mean blood pressure throughout one cardiac cycle. The normal range of MAP in humans is generally understood to be between 70 and 100 mm Hg. The perfusion pressure for an organ is the difference between its inflow and outflow pressure.MAP is generally considered as the inflow pressure to the major organs of the body, and a better indicator of tissue and organ perfusion than systolic blood pressure. Determining accurate levels of MAP is significant for determining therapeutic treatment, assessing progress of therapy and as a predictive tool. For example, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend maintaining MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg, and the Japanese Society of Hypertension recommends that a MAP > 130 mm Hg is an indication for antihypertensive therapy for cerebral hemorrhage in the acute phases. Further, for severe pre-eclampsia treatment protocols a MAP threshold of 125 mm Hg has commonly been used as a cut-off point. For risk stratification, the universal screening of pregnant women for pre-eclampsia includes MAP levels in the risk calculation, and cumulative MAP levels have been identified as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular eventsand ischemic stroke in patients with hypertension. Additionally, combining MAP thresholds with systolic and diastolic blood pressure may also have a role in refining cardiovascular event risk predictors.

Blood pressure can be measured invasively or non-invasively, with non-invasive cuff readings providing systolic pressure (SP) and diastolic pressure (DP) to estimate MAP. Six mathematical functions of SP and DP have been developed to estimate MAP; the pulse pressure (PP) in the formulae is the difference between SP and DP. The most commonly used, or "standard", estimate for MAP is Gauer's method (DP + 1/3 × PP) devised in 1960. Predating the standard formula was Wezler's formula (0.42 × SP + 0.58 × DP) in 1939. An alternative to this formula (DP + 0.412 × PP) was proposed in 2000 by Meaney et al. Chemla et al. in 1999 suggested an improvement to Gauer's method with the expression: DP + 1/3 × PP + 5. As previous formulas were proposed to be inaccurate at higher heart rates, in 2004, heart rate (HR) was factored into the equation by Razminia et al. (DP + [1/3 + 0.0012 × HR] × PP). Finally, Chemla et al. in 2005 estimated MAP as the geometric mean of SP and DP: √(SP × DP).

Abstract

BACKGROUND

There are six different formulae for estimating mean arterial pressure (MAP) from systolic and diastolic pressure readings. This study is to determine the optimum formula for calculating MAP when compared to the gold standard approach, which is the area under the curve of an invasively measured pulse waveform divided by the cardiac cycle duration.

METHODS

Eight live pigs were used as the experimental model for the invasive measurement of femoral artery pressure (AP) by a fluid filled catheter connected with a pressure transducer. In addition, intraocular pressure (IOP) and jugular vein pressure (JVP) were also recorded. The mean pressure (MP) was calculated from digital waveforms sampled at 1,000 points per second with the six formulae and area method for AP, IOP and JVP.

RESULTS

The absolute mean difference between the area MAP and each formula's MAP ranged from 0.98 to 3.23 mm Hg. Our study also found that even under physiological conditions, area MAP can vary between successive pulses by up to 5 mm Hg.

Our study suggests that all current formulae are adequate for estimating MAP, though some formulae are not suitable for mean IOP and JVP.

DISCUSSION

MAP

To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing the agreement between all six MAP formulae with invasive measurements of a peripheral arterial pressure curve. Note that measuring blood pressure experimentally using an invasive fluid filled catheter and pressure transducer enabled the area method to be compared as the gold standard. The definition of MAP is the mean blood pressure for one cardiac cycle alone and not for all cardiac cycles. This distinction may be important due to the variation in blood pressure demonstrated in Figure 3A, where MAP values could vary as much as 5 mm Hg between successive pulses (as calculated by the area method). Our study has also demonstrated that each formula can both underestimate and overestimate the area MAP (Figure 4). Yet for both a single representative curve and pooled data analysis, the agreement for all six formulae with the area method is excellent, as evidenced by both ICC and LCCC being > 0.95.

### Optimal calculation of mean pressure from pulse pressure [^116GVSut]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Accurate MAP values are important for estimating organ perfusion pressures. The lower threshold for concern regarding MAP is generally understood to be around 60 mm Hg, with the criteria for intraoperative hypotension being diverse in terms of absolute and relative MAP reduction from baseline (e.g. ≥ 20% reduction). For non-cardiac surgeries, having a MAP of 50 mm Hg for even a minute can increase mortality risk by 5%. From a vascular viewpoint, peripheral vascular resistance can be estimated from cardiac output and MAP values, and MAP may have prognostic value in patients who have suffered myocardial infarction or who have uncontrolled hypertension.

Although a PP coefficient of 0.412 has relatively better statistical agreement with the area calculated MAP, these differences appear to not be clinically significant. While a coefficient of 0.33 underestimates MAP on average by 1.77 mm Hg, a coefficient of 0.412 on average overestimates MAP by 1.12 mm Hg. Additionally, estimating MAP by these formulae may spuriously underestimate or overestimate MAP by 5 mm Hg too. Non-invasive blood pressure cuff readings approximate the true value of MAP and are unable to capture temporal fluctuations in MAP, which our study has demonstrated could be as large as 5 mm Hg between successive pulses. Overall, all formulae have excellent agreement with the gold standard, though a coefficient of 0.412 may be used for a statistically optimal estimation. Practically, being aware that the standard formula on average will underestimate MAP may prompt for successive MAP calculations or adoption of a PP coefficient of 0.412 in the research setting to determine if this statistically optimal estimation translates to superior prognostic or clinical benefit.

### The highs and lows of blood pressure: toward meaningful clinical targets in patients with shock [^113DicpQ]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" for COVID-19 infection, preeclampsia, perioperative bleeding, perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, thoracic aortic dissection, brain death, cardiac arrest, cervical spine injury, traumatic brain injury, traumatic hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, hepatorenal syndrome, liver cirrhosis, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, cardiogenic shock and sepsis and septic shock.

MAP calculates average arterial pressure during a cardiac cycle using systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

In the context of assessing circulatory health, the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) calculator is a tool that processes two main inputs: systolic and diastolic blood pressures. These inputs are measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), adhering to certain acceptable ranges for accuracy and safety — systolic values between 60 and 300 mmHg and diastolic values from 20 to 180 mmHg.

The calculation of MAP provides a crucial insight into the perfusion pressure experienced by vital organs, relying on a straightforward formula:

MAP = diastolic blood pressure + one-third of the pulse pressure (where pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressures).

This equation highlights that diastolic pressure, representing the longer-lasting phase of the cardiac cycle, exerts more influence in the calculation than systolic pressure. The resultant MAP, expressed in mmHg and ranging logically from 0 to 200 mmHg, signifies the average driving force of blood through the systemic circulation in a single cardiac cycle.

Understanding MAP values is essential in clinical environments:

- A MAP between 70 and 100 mmHg is typically ideal, suggesting optimal organ perfusion.
- MAP values falling below 60 mmHg may indicate potential risk for organ under-perfusion, a critical concern in intensive care settings.
- MAP exceeding 100 mmHg often points toward possible hypertension or other cardiovascular anomalies, necessitating further evaluation.

This calculated MAP value provides invaluable information used widely in clinical practice for observing and managing patients' blood pressure, aiding in the maintenance of proper organ function and overall cardiovascular health.

### Analysis of the evidence for the lower limit of systolic and mean arterial pressure in children [^114swthD]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) are essential evaluation elements in ill children, but there is wide variation among different sources defining systolic hypotension in children, and there are no normal reference values for MAP. Our goal was to calculate the 5th percentile SBP and MAP values in children from recently updated data published by the task force working group of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program and compare these values with the lowest limit of acceptable SBP and MAP defined by different sources.

Design

Mathematical analysis of clinical database.

Methods

The 50th and 95th percentile SBP values from task force data were used to derive the 5th percentile value for children from 1 to 17 yrs of age stratified by height percentiles. MAP values were calculated using a standard mathematical formula. Calculated SBP values were compared with systolic hypotension definitions from other sources. Linear regression analysis was applied to create simple formulas to estimate 5th percentile SBP and 5th and 50th percentile MAP for different age groups at the 50th height percentile.

Results

A 9–21% range in both SBP and MAP values was noted for different height percentiles in the same age groups. The 5th percentile SBP values used to define hypotension by different sources are higher than our calculated values in children but are lower than our calculated values in adolescents. Clinical formulas for calculation of SBP and MAP (mm Hg) in normal children are as follows: SBP (5th percentile at 50th height percentile) = 2 x age in years + 65, MAP (5th percentile at 50th height percentile) = 1.5 x age in years + 40, and MAP (50th percentile at 50th height percentile) = 1.5 x age in years + 55.

Conclusion

We developed new estimates for values of 5th percentile SBP and created a table of normal MAP values for reference. SBP is significantly affected by height, which has not been considered previously. Although the estimated lower limits of SBP are lower than currently used to define hypotension, these values are derived from normal healthy children and are likely not appropriate for critically ill children. Our data suggest that the current values for hypotension are not evidence-based and may need to be adjusted for patient height and, most important, for clinical condition. Specifically, we suggest that the definition of hypotension derived from normal children should not be used to define the SBP goal; a higher target SBP is likely appropriate in many critically ill and injured children. Further studies are needed to evaluate the appropriate threshold values of SBP for determining hypotension.

### Mean arterial pressure values calculated using seven different methods and their associations with target organ deterioration in a single-center study of 1878 individuals [^1174bsSY]. Hypertension Research (2016). Low credibility.

To assess the differences among seven different methods for the calculation of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and to identify the formula that provides MAP values that are more closely associated with target organ deterioration as expressed by the carotid cross-sectional area (CSA), carotid-to-femoral pulse-wave velocity (cf-PWV) and left ventricular mass (LVM). The study population consisted of 1878 subjects who underwent noninvasive cardiovascular risk assessment. Blood pressure (BP) was assessed in all subjects, and MAP was calculated by direct oscillometry and six different formulas. Carotid artery ultrasound imaging was performed in 1628 subjects. The CSA of the right and left common carotid artery (CCA) were calculated and used as surrogates of arterial wall mass and hypertrophy. Aortic stiffness was evaluated in 1763 subjects by measuring the cf-PWV. Finally, 218 subjects underwent echocardiographic examination for the assessment of LVM. Among the examined methods of MAP calculation, the formula MAP1 = [diastolic BP]+0.412 × [pulse pressure] yielded the strongest correlations with the LVM, cf-PWV and CSA of the right and left CCA, even after adjusting for age and gender. The MAP calculation using the 0.412 was superior compared with the traditional formula that uses the 0.33 for the discrimination of subjects with left ventricular and carotid wall hypertrophy, as well as subjects with increased aortic stiffness. MAP estimated with the 0.412 is better correlated with target organ deterioration compared with other formulas. Future studies are needed to explore the accuracy of these formulas for MAP estimation compared with direct intra-arterial BP measurement.

### Mean arterial pressure estimated by brachial pulse wave analysis and comparison with currently used algorithms [^112hXDCF]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is usually calculated by adding one-third of pulse pressure (PP) to DBP. This formula assumes that the average value of pulse waveform is constant in all individuals and coincides with 33.3% of PP amplitude (MAP = DBP+PP×0.333). Other formulas were lately proposed to improve the MAP estimation, adding to DBP an established percentage of PP: MAP = DBP+PP×0.40; MAP = DBP+PP×0.412; MAP = DBP+PP×0.333+5mmHg.

Methods

The current study evaluated the integral of brachial pulse waveform recorded by applanation tonometry in 1526 patients belonging to three distinct cohorts: normotensive or hypertensive elderly, hypertensive adults, and normotensive adults.

Results

The percentage of PP to be added to DBP to obtain MAP was extremely variable among individuals, ranging from 23 to 58% (mean: 42.2 ± 5.5%), higher in women (42.9 ± 5.6%) than men (41.2 ± 5.1%, P < 0.001), lower in the elderly cohort (40.9 ± 5.3%) than in the general population cohort (42.8 ± 6.0%, P < 0.001) and in the hypertensive patients (42.4 ± 4.8%, P < 0.001). This percentage was significantly associated with DBP (β = 0.357, P < 0.001) and sex (β = 0.203, P < 0.001) and significantly increased after mental stress test in 19 healthy volunteers (from 39.9 ± 3.2 at baseline, to 43.0 ± 4.0, P < 0.0001). The average difference between MAP values estimated by formulas, compared with MAP assessed on the brachial tonometric curve, was (mean ± 1.96×SD): -5.0 ± 6.7mmHg when MAP = DBP+PP×0333; -1.2 ± 6.1mmHg when MAP = DBP+PP×0.40; -0.6 ± 6.1mmHg when MAP = DBP+PP×0.412; -0.4 ± 6.7mmHg when MAP = DBP+PP×0.333+5.

Conclusion

Due to high interindividual and intraindividual variability of pulse waveform, the estimation of MAP based on fixed formulas derived from SBP and DBP is unreliable. Conversely, a more accurate estimation of MAP should be based on the pulse waveform analysis.

### Optimal calculation of mean pressure from pulse pressure [^112dS1QU]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Our data demonstrates that all studied MAP formulae have excellent agreement with the true MAP values at the femoral artery (Table 1). This would suggest they may be suitable at the brachial artery of humans too. The findings from this study are consistent with a previous paper that found substantial agreement (ICC > 0.95) between the formulae and the area method using non-invasive cuff readings of systolic and diastolic pressure, and continuous non-invasive brachial artery waveform data. Previous invasive studies have also concluded that a PP coefficient of 0.33 underestimates MAP, and that a PP coefficient closer to 0.4 agrees more with the invasive readings. However, these studies had blood pressure readings taken from the human aorta and have not been validated at a peripheral artery yet. The distinction between aortic and peripheral artery pressures may be significant due to the phenomenon of SP amplification,: due to the difference in elasticity between aortic and brachial arteries, the SP measured at the brachial artery is amplified from reflected waves and can thus introduce errors when applying centrally derived formulas to peripheral measurements. Routine measurements of blood pressure are not conducted centrally, therefore it is important to validate and determine the optimal MAP formula at a peripheral artery for comparable results. Our study has demonstrated that all formulae substantially agree with the area method and that the standard formula underestimated MAP on average by only 2 mm Hg, while a PP coefficient of 0.412 overestimates MAP on average by only 1 mm Hg.

### Optimal calculation of mean pressure from pulse pressure [^113JSAc2]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Our study has demonstrated that the statistically optimal formula with the best agreement to calculate invasively measured MAP has a PP coefficient of 0.412. However, all formulae for MAP evaluated in this study had excellent agreement with the gold standard, and so there is only a slight improvement in using the optimal formula to estimate MAP. Therefore, the current standard formula for assessing MAP non-invasively is adequate for routine MAP assessment, noting that its value on average underestimates true MAP. Regarding mean IOP and JVP, these can be determined from their systolic and diastolic pressures over a cardiac cycle with most MAP formulae.

### Individualized mean arterial pressure targets in critically ill patients guided by non-invasive cerebral-autoregulation: a scoping review [^113Dr3Ku]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Technological advancements have made it feasible to determine personalized MAP targets in critically ill patients. Most evidence in this emerging field is observational and shows high variability in MAP values associated with intact autoregulation. While some studies suggest associations with clinical outcomes, methodological inconsistencies and feasibility challenges, such as signal loss, variable calculation methods, and inability to keep MAP above LLA, limit interpretability and generalizability. To move the field forward, future studies should prioritize validating algorithms across diverse patient populations, standardizing within critically ill sub-populations, and identifying strategies to overcome practical barriers to implementation. Efforts should be tailored to the unique physiological profiles of critically ill sub-groups and will likely lead to a better understanding of the complex, multifactorial nature of cerebrovascular regulation.

### Optimal calculation of mean pressure from pulse pressure [^111eEzVo]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Non-invasive MAP readings determined by proprietary algorithms of automatic oscillometric sphygmomanometers return a different MAP according to their manufacturer. The most accurate method to ascertain MAP is to invasively measure the arterial blood pressure curve and average the area under the curve over the duration of a cardiac cycle. Previous invasive studies demonstrated that the "standard" formula with a PP coefficient of 0.33 underestimates MAP, and that the PP coefficient may be closer to 0.4. However, these studies were limited by low sampling frequencies of arterial blood pressure and some studies invasively measured blood pressure at the aorta. Although Gauer's formula is most widely used, there is currently no consensus on which of these formulae optimally determines MAP.

The mean pressure (MP) concept is also relevant to intraocular and venous pressure due to their pulsatility and the influence of the PP created by the cardiovascular system. However, unlike MAP, our literature search yielded no articles for the discussion of standard formulae for determining their MP values.

The objective of this study was to determine the optimal approach for calculating MAP at a peripheral artery from the existing formulae, and evaluate the performance of these functions for estimating mean intraocular pressure (IOP) and jugular vein pressure (JVP). This was achieved by calculating MAP and mean IOP and JVP using the six formulae discussed previouslyand comparing these values with the MPs calculated using the area method as a gold standard.

### Mean arterial pressure differences between cuff oscillometric and invasive blood pressure [^117WW4xu]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The difference between oscillometric MAP and invasive MAP was associated with the difference in cuff systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with invasive BP. Efforts to improve oscillometric BP measurement methods should be prioritised. Advocacy to increase transparency of oscillometric algorithms used in BP devices is also needed to understand the way that BP is measured and enable open-source availability of deidentified cuff oscillometric traces to accelerate research on the topic.

### Determining optimal mean arterial pressure after cardiac arrest: a systematic review [^114PgJAi]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

The use of cerebral autoregulation monitoring to identify patient-specific optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP OPT) has emerged as a technique to augment cerebral oxygen delivery in post-cardiac arrest patients. Our systematic review aims to determine (a) the average MAP OPT in these patients, (b) the feasibility of identifying MAP OPT, (c) the brain tissue oxygenation levels when MAP is within proximity to the MAP OPT and (d) the relationship between neurological outcome and MAP OPT -targeted resuscitation strategies. We carried out this review in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We included all studies that used cerebral autoregulation to determine MAP OPT in adult patients (> 16 years old) who achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following cardiac arrest. All studies had to include our primary outcome of MAP OPT. We excluded studies where the patients had any history of traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage. We identified six studies with 181 patients. There was wide variability in cerebral autoregulation monitoring methods, length of monitoring, calculation and reporting of MAP OPT. Amongst all studies, the median or mean MAP OPT was consistently above 65 mmHg (range 70–114 mmHg). Definitions of feasibility varied among studies and were difficult to summarize. Only one study noted that brain tissue oxygenation increased as patients' MAP approached MAP OPT. There was no consistent association between targeting MAP OPT and improved neurological outcome. There is considerable heterogeneity in MAP OPT due to differences in monitoring methods of autoregulation. Further research is needed to assess the clinical utility of MAP OPT -guided strategies on decreasing secondary injury and improving neurological outcomes after ROSC.

### Age-and blood pressure-dependent form factors: reevaluating arterial waveforms and blood pressure assessment [^113JLsQu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Form factor (FF), calculated as (mean arterial pressure [MAP]−diastolic blood pressure [DBP])/pulse pressure [PP]×100, serves as a morphological indicator of arterial pulse waveforms. A high FF value typically indicates a wide and short arterial waveform with diminished PP, whereas a low FF value generally signifies a thin and tall waveform. Central aortic MAP denotes the average pressure within the aorta throughout a cardiac cycle. The ascending aorta's anatomical proximity to the brain, kidneys, and other vital organs renders central systolic blood pressure (SBP) more pathophysiologically linked to hypertension‐induced organ damage. Numerous studies indicate that central SBP serves as a superior predictor of cardiovascular events compared with brachial SBP. Nonetheless, accurate measurement of central SBP or central MAP poses challenges in clinical practice owing to the necessity of catheterization. Fortunately, peripheral MAP serves as a surrogate in both clinical contexts and hemodynamic research, because MAP experiences a slight decline yet demonstrates minimal variation from the aorta to peripheral arteries. Similarly, DBP remains largely unchanged in value from the aorta to the periphery, as demonstrated by prior research. Theoretically, we could estimate central PP using peripheral MAP, peripheral DBP, and the central FF, which would allow us to derive central SBP.

Fixed central and peripheral FF of 41.2% and 40%, respectively, have been proposed for estimating central and peripheral MAP. Although peripheral FF appears relatively constant and unaffected by age, central FF may be influenced by factors such as age, aortic pressure, and wave reflection. The assumption of fixed central and peripheral FF implies that aortic‐to‐peripheral PP amplification remains unchanged, which contradicts evidence showing that PP amplification diminishes with age and increased PP. Schultz et alexamined the use of fixed radial and brachial FFs (0.33 and 0.4, respectively) to estimate central MAP using invasively measured brachial and radial SBP and DBP. They found that the brachial FF‐derived MAP underestimated central MAP by 2.5 mm Hg, whereas the radial FF‐derived MAP overestimated it by 3.9 mm Hg. These findings suggest that estimating central MAP using peripheral FF and blood pressure may be inaccurate.

### Inaccuracy in determining mean arterial pressure with oscillometric blood pressure techniques [^114DP9eY]. American Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Accurate determination of MAP is important in the calibration of pressure waveforms for calculating central blood pressure (BP). Currently, a precise, individualized measurement of mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be obtained only with intra-arterial measurements of BP or with applanation tonometry. We conducted a study of whether easy-to-use oscillometric devices, validated for systolic and diastolic BP measurements (BHS protocol), give accurate determinations of MAP.

Methods

We compared measurements of MAP made with the WatchBP Office oscillometric monitor in 102 subjects with values of MAP assessed by pulse-wave analysis (PWA) (SphygmoCor).

Results

The mean (± SD) oscillometric MAP assessed with the WatchBP Office monitor was 97 ± 12.5 mm Hg, which was equivalent to 23.6 ± 9.1% of the pulse pressure (PP) above diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The MAP as assessed through PWA was 106 ± 14.6 mm Hg (P < 0.01), or 37.7 ± 3.9% of the PP above DBP. In simultaneous measurements made on both arms with the WatchBP Office monitor we observed individual differences in pressure in the left vs. the right arm.

Conclusions

The MAP displayed by the WatchBP Office monitor is too imprecise to be used for calibrations. We suggest that devices for measuring BP not display MAP unless their accuracy is tested.

### Mean arterial pressure differences between cuff oscillometric and invasive blood pressure [^11319oWr]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Differences between automated cuff oscillometric blood pressure (BP) and invasive measurements are well described, but the causes are not fully understood. Automated BP devices record cuff oscillometric mean arterial pressure (MAP) as a key measurement step that is presumed to be accurate, but if not, could create error in cuff systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) estimations. This has never been determined and was the aim of the study. Data from five studies with similar protocols were analysed (N = 262 patients undergoing coronary angiography, 61 ± 11 years, 65% male). Cuff oscillometric MAP was measured using five different models of automated cuff BP devices simultaneous to invasively measured MAP (fluid-filled or solid-state catheters). Cuff SBP and DBP were estimated by device-specific algorithms. Differences (∆) were calculated as cuff-invasive aortic BP. There were significant associations between ∆MAP and ∆SBP in four out of five devices (unstandardised β range = 0.42–1.04). The ∆MAP explained 6–52% of the variance in ∆SBP. In the same four devices, there were significant associations between ∆MAP and ∆DBP (unstandardised β range = 0.57–0.97) and ∆MAP explained 35–52% of the variance in ∆DBP. In conclusion, there are differences between cuff oscillometric MAP and invasive MAP which are associated with ∆SBP and ∆DBP. Further research is required to improve cuff oscillometric BP and greater transparency needed to understand algorithms used in these devices.

### Mean arterial pressure differences between cuff oscillometric and invasive blood pressure [^116HiWLg]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading global risk factor for death and disability. High-quality BP measurement is essential for correct hypertension diagnosis and management, and for this purpose, automated upper-arm cuff BP measurement devices are the recommended clinical standard. These devices are supposed to emulate the BP values recorded by manual auscultation as an indirect measure of invasive BP. However, meta-analyses of individual patient data have shown that automated cuff BP measurement devices have a significant level of both random and systematic error when compared with invasive BP measurement at the brachial or central aortic arteries. Systematic error is associated with increasing age (cuff systolic BP underestimation and diastolic BP overestimation) and sex (underestimation of cuff systolic BP in women) and random error occurs between different devices. The cause of differences between automated cuff BP and invasive BP have not been fully determined but are essential to understand so that the quality of clinical BP measurement and risk stratification can be improved.

A critical measurement step that is common between different automated upper-arm cuff BP devices is the identification of the point of maximal amplitude on the oscillometric waveform envelope. This feature is derived from the cuff deflation (or sometimes inflation) curve using proprietary algorithms (i.e. not publicly available) and is assumed to accurately represent the mean arterial pressure (MAP) based on intra-arterial confirmation in early studies of the 1970's. Once cuff oscillometric MAP has been identified, systolic and diastolic BPs can be estimated, again, using proprietary algorithms that are unique to each BP manufacturer (of which there are more than 450 internationally). Nevertheless, it is thought that many of these algorithms derive systolic and diastolic BP values relative to the cuff oscillometric MAP on the oscillometric waveform. Therefore, any differences in the cuff oscillometric MAP to a reference standard may be associated with differences of consequent cuff systolic and diastolic BP values compared to the reference standard. This concept has never been explored and we sought to achieve this in the current study. We hypothesized there would be direct associations in the direction and magnitude of differences between cuff oscillometric MAP and intra-arterial MAP, and the consequent differences between systolic and diastolic BPs and intra-arterial measurements.

### Blood pressure and the brain: how low can you Go? [^117CvwZB]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

There are occasionally intraoperative circumstances in which reduction of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to levels well below those that occur in nonanesthetized adults is necessary or unavoidable. In these situations, clinicians are inevitably concerned about the limits of the tolerance of the brain for hypotension. Reference to the phenomenon of cerebral blood flow autoregulation is frequently made in discussions of safe MAP limits. However, in several respects, prevalent conceptions about cerebral blood flow autoregulation may be incomplete or inaccurate. The principal theses offered by this review are: (1) that the average lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation in normotensive adult humans is not less than a MAP of 70 mm Hg; (2) that there is considerable intersubject variability in both the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation and the efficiency of cerebral blood flow autoregulation; (3) that there is a substantial blood flow reserve that buffers the normal central nervous system against critical blood flow reduction in the face of hypotension; (4) that there are several common clinical phenomena that have the potential to compromise that buffer, and that should be taken into account in decision making about minimum acceptable MAPs; and (5) that the average threshold for the onset of central nervous system ischemic symptoms is probably a MAP of 40–50 mm Hg at the level of the circle of Willis in a normotensive adult in a vertical posture and 45–55 mm Hg in a supine subject. However, these MAPs should probably only be approached deliberately when the exigencies of the surgical situation absolutely require it.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112bnE62]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — shock treatment and interventions include oxygen titration, perfusion and metabolic assessment, vascular access, fluid resuscitation, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets. Oxygen is administered with a target of achieving 94–98% saturation. Perfusion assessment notes that an end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) reading of less than 25 mmHg may be sign of poor perfusion. Metabolic thresholds include correction of blood glucose if less than 60 mg/dL and recognition that lactate greater than 2 mmol/L is abnormal. If intravenous (IV) access is not obtained within two attempts or less than 90 seconds, place an intraosseous (IO) needle. For fluids, give boluses that are pressure infused over less than 15 minutes each to achieve a MAP, calculated as (MAP = [(2 × diastolic) + (systolic)/3]). Adult targets specify a physiologic MAP goal 65 mmHg and a fluid goal of up to 30 mL/kg using rapid, predetermined boluses (e.g., 500 mL) unless the MAP goal is achieved, or pulmonary edema develops; if available, packed red blood cells or whole blood may be indicated for hemorrhagic shock.

### Is measurement of central venous pressure required to estimate systemic vascular resistance? A retrospective cohort study [^117KU7eS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In addition to providing adequate anesthesia to patients, anesthesiologists must maintain stable blood pressure, especially as clinical outcomes are closely related to the intraoperative management of hemodynamics. Because blood pressure is a product of cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), it is also essential to understand and estimate each of these components. To date, however, no tool has been available that can directly measure SVR intraoperatively. Rather, SVR can only be indirectly estimated using mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), CO, and central venous pressure (CVP), with SVR calculated as (MAP – CVP) / CO.

The clinical range of CVP (typically 5 to 15 mmHg) is, however, much less than the range of MAP (60 to 120 mmHg), suggesting that CVP may have little impact on estimation of SVR. Few studies to date have specifically addressed this question. The accuracy and feasibility of using an arbitrary CVP rather than actual CVP for the estimation of SVR is not known, especially during the intraoperative period. Using vital records obtained from patients who underwent neurological and cardiac surgery, the present study retrospectively calculated SVR using fixed values of CVP (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mmHg) and randomly changing values of CVP (5 to 15 mmHg) and compared these calculated SVRs with actual SVR, calculated using actual CVP.

Mean MAP and vasopressor use among periods and groups

Mean MAP while receiving vasopressors was 72.5 (5.1) in the pre-trial period vs 72.4 (5.0) mmHg in the during-trial period (p = 0.76; Table 3). Figure 2 shows the overall mean MAP while receiving vasopressors by month relative to trial initiation across all sites. The mean prescribed target MAP (mean, pre-trial period: 64.7 [3.1] vs. during-trial period: 65.3 [3.7] mmHg; p = 0.08), duration of vasopressor therapy (mean, pre-trial period: 48.5 [44.3] vs. during-trial period: 43.6 [40.5] hours; p = 0.24), and total vasopressor dose (mean, pre-trial period: 60.1 [122] vs. during-trial period: 56.6 [104.9] mg norepinephrine equivalents; p = 0.75) were similar between periods. Comparing between 3 groups, we found no difference in mean MAP while receiving vasopressors (mean, pre-trial group: 72.5 [5.1] vs non-enrolled group: 72.3 [5.1], vs. usual care control group: 72.5 [4.9] mmHg; p = 0.92).

### Influence of age and central hypertension on the form factor needed to estimate mean aortic pressure, and its implications for pulse pressure amplification: a secondary data analysis [^116Luvxb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mean aortic pressure (MAP) plays a pivotal role in both cardiovascular dynamics and the noninvasive estimation of systolic aortic pressure. MAP can be estimated by adding a fraction of the pulse pressure (PP) to the diastolic aortic pressure, known as the form factor (FF = 100×[MAP−diastolic aortic pressure]/PP). A 41.2% FF is recommended, yet this single value may not adequately account for age‐ and pressure‐related changes in both pressure waveform and central‐to‐peripheral pulse pressure amplification (pulse pressure amplification = peripheral PP/central PP = central FF/peripheral FF).

Methods and Results

This secondary analysis included data extracted from 11 high‐fidelity invasive pressure studies. Individual data on age, high‐fidelity systolic aortic pressure, diastolic aortic pressure, and time‐averaged MAP were reanalyzed to calculate FF values and assess the influence of age and central hypertension on FF. The pooled data included 320 adults, comprising our own database (n = 139). Among them, 97 subjects were initially categorized as "normal", 82 with hypertension, and 141 with diverse cardiac conditions (median age, 48 years; MAP, 102 mm Hg). The FF value (mean, 44%) decreased with age (r 2 = 0.29, P < 0.0001). A value of 50% was most appropriate for the youngest subjects, while FF tended toward 40% in older subjects. FF was lower in subjects with central hypertension (systolic aortic pressure/diastolic aortic pressure ≥ 130/90 mm Hg; n = 169) compared with those without. In both groups, FF decreased with age, showing similar slopes for the FF–age relationship.

Conclusions

Aortic FF decreased with age and was lower in subjects with central hypertension. Unlike applying a fixed FF, this decline aligned with pathophysiological changes in pressure waveform and pulse pressure amplification, with potential implications for improving MAP estimation.

### Percentage of mean arterial pressure as a marker of atherosclerosis for detecting patients with coronary artery disease [^114QAFgD]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The percentage of mean arterial pressure (%MAP) is the height of the mean arterial waveform divided by the peak amplitude of the waveform of pulse volume recording. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cutoff value of 45% for %MAP at the ankle, which is recommended for the diagnosis of lower extremity artery disease, in combination with ankle-brachial index (ABI) is useful for detecting patients with clinical coronary artery disease (CAD) and investigate the optimal cutoff value of %MAP to diagnose patients with CAD. We measured ABI and %MAP in 2213 subjects (mean age: 61.2 ± 15.5 years). Multivariate analysis revealed that %MAP ≥ 45% was significantly associated with a higher risk of CAD after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.43–3.21; p < 0.001). However, the association was no longer significant after adjusting for ABI (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.83–2.33; p = 0.21), whereas ABI was significantly associated with CAD (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; p = 0.005). The optimal cutoff value of %MAP derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve to diagnose CAD was 40.3%. Multivariate analysis revealed that %MAP ≥ 40.3% was significantly associated with a higher risk of CAD (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.19–2.24; p = 0.002) independent of ABI (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; p = 0.002). The cutoff value of 40.3%, but not 45%, for %MAP may be useful for detecting patients with advanced atherosclerosis and for cardiovascular risk assessment independent of ABI.

### Mean arterial pressure targets and patient-important outcomes in critically ill adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111Yskyf]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether targeting a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) compared with a lower MAP in adults with shock results in differences in patient important outcomes.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov through May 2021.

Study Selection

Titles and abstracts were screened independently and in duplicate to identify potentially eligible studies, then full text for final eligibility. We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials in adult patients with a diagnosis of shock requiring vasoactive medications. The higher MAP group was required to receive vasoactive medications to target a higher MAP as established by study authors, whereas the lower MAP group received vasoactive medications to target lower MAP.

Data Extraction

In triplicate, reviewers independently extracted data using a prepiloted abstraction form. Statistical analyses were conducted using the RevMan software Version 5.3.

Data Synthesis

Six randomized controlled trials (n = 3,690) met eligibility criteria. Targeting a higher MAP (75–85mm Hg) compared with lower MAP of 65mm Hg resulted in no difference in mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98–1.15; I2 = 0%; p = 0.12; moderate certainty. Targeting a higher MAP resulted in no difference in the risk of undergoing renal replacement therapy (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83–1.11; I2 = 24%; p = 0.57; moderate certainty); however, a subgroup analysis comparing patients with and without chronic hypertension demonstrated that a higher MAP may reduce the risk of undergoing renal replacement therapy (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71–0.98; I2 = 0%; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated with moderate certainty that there is no difference in mortality when a higher MAP is targeted in critically ill adult patients with shock. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of mean arterial pressure on need for renal replacement therapy in this population.

### Association of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes with 24-hour mean arterial pressure [^117XSQnH]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The fit of the associations of the primary end point with MAP and systolic BP, both analyzed as continuous variables, were similar if the base model included only the covariables accounted for in adjusted analyses, but if the base model also included systolic and diastolic BP, continuous MAP did no longer add to the model fit (Table S11). These observations are in line with the concept that diastolic BP is the main determinant of MAP and that MAP captures information related to both systolic and diastolic BP. If the BP indexes were dichotomized, using the ACC/AHA thresholds for systolic (125 mm Hg) and diastolic (75 mm Hg) BP and the outcome-driven MAP threshold derived in this article (92 mm Hg), MAP did add to a model including covariables and both systolic and diastolic BP thresholds. The log likelihood ratios and generalized R 2 statistics only evaluate model fit but not the strength of the association of an end point with a BP index, as shown in Figure 2. As demonstrated by numerous placebo and actively controlled trialsand long-term cohort studies of populationsand patients, BP is the overriding modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Small increments in R 2 challenge this concept. However, major irreversible risk factors, such as sex and age, on their own already generate an R 2 of 23.94%. Consequently, adding BP to multivariable-adjusted models that already account for sex, age, and other risk factors cannot substantially augment R 2. Under such conditions, many researchers share the opinion that markers of model fit are imprecise and that clinical relevance is of greater importance than the improvement of the model fit.

### The meaning of blood pressure [^112f674y]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Mean arterial pressure is determined by cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and a critical closing pressure at the level of the arterioles. Each of these factors is controlled by mechanisms that work at the level of the whole organism, but also interact with important local regulatory mechanisms. Arterial pulse pressure brings in another set of variables which are related to the elastance of the aortic wall, the volume of blood in the aorta, the cardiac frequency, and the proportion of time in systole and diastole. Because of the complexities of these interactions, it is not possible to make simple predictions of the response to vasopressor therapies. This becomes even more complicated when pathologies are added that alter the potential of vessels to respond, or because there are fixed obstructions to flow. Only empiric studies can determine the best approach for the management of hypotension and hypoperfusion. Finally, it must be remembered that what counts for tissues is blood flow and not the arterial pressure and, even more importantly, the matching of flow to metabolic needs. The body does this masterfully through multiple counteracting control mechanisms. It is very unlikely that a single therapeutic agent can match the naturally occurring well-orchestrated control mechanisms.

### Validation of non-invasive central blood pressure devices: ARTERY society task force consensus statement on protocol standardization [^115NG7ci]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Data from meta-analysis indicate that using MAP and DBP could be a preferred calibration option to provide a relatively more accurate non-invasive estimation of central SBP. Several methods may be used to derive MAP, including by calculation from potentially inaccurate brachial cuff BP [e.g. DBP + 1/3 (or 40%) pulse pressure, or from integration of the pressure waveforms calibrated to cuff BP], or estimation from the peak oscillometric signal, but information regarding the accuracy of these approaches is limited. Central BP indices derived from oscillometric MAP and DBP calibrated peripheral waveforms show stronger associations with hypertension-related end organ disease and outcomes than either brachial BP or central BP derived by calibration using brachial oscillometric SBP and DBP. These data come from independent investigators that have used the same device, and it remains to be clarified if the findings may be more widely generalizable or if this is a device-specific phenomenon. The observation that much of the inaccuracy in estimated central BP lies with poor calibration from inaccurate brachial cuff BP, implies that better BP risk stratification might be achieved with more accurate brachial cuff BP per se. Indeed, calls have been made for more rigorous brachial BP accuracy criteria.

### Mean arterial pressure differences between cuff oscillometric and invasive blood pressure [^11231o81]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine if the difference between automated cuff oscillometric MAP and invasive MAP may relate to the difference in cuff systolic BP and diastolic BP compared with invasive measurement. This was determined using an invasive reference standard across five unique automated cuff BP measurement devices. The main findings were that ∆MAP was associated with ∆systolic BP in four of five devices, whereas ∆MAP was associated with ∆diastolic BP in all five devices. The strength of the associations between ∆MAP and ∆systolic or ∆diastolic BP, and magnitude of the differences were device specific. These data highlight that equivalence between cuff oscillometric MAP and invasive MAP cannot be assumed, and this could be a significant factor contributing to ∆systolic or ∆diastolic BP. Efforts to improve oscillometric BP measurement methods are needed, as well as greater transparency of the BP estimation algorithms that are used in commercially available devices.

### A low-power wearable acoustic device for accurate invasive arterial pressure monitoring [^116Mu9Rn]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The mean arterial pressure measured by the clinical transducer, when compared to the calculated mean arterial pressure using the height tracking system, differed on average by 0.19 ± 2.8 mmHg as shown in Fig. 6 a with 90% of the measurements within 4.3 mmHg (Fig. 6 b). Given the use of a height conversion factor to calculate the pressure difference, it was important to assess for measurement bias as the distance from the lowest bed height increased. A linear fit of the difference between the clinical and calculated mean arterial pressure was performed and showed a slope of 0.4 mmHg over a height range of 50 cm.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^111mudQF]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Oscillometric versus auscultatory blood pressure measurement — although pediatric normative BP data are based on auscultatory measurements, oscillometric BP devices have become commonplace in health care settings. Unlike auscultatory measurement, however, oscillometric devices measure the oscillations transmitted from disrupted arterial flow by using the cuff as a transducer to determine mean arterial pressure (MAP). Rather than directly measuring any pressure that correlates to SBP or DBP, the device uses a proprietary algorithm to calculate these values from the directly measured MAP, and because the algorithms vary for different brands of oscillometric devices, there is no standard oscillometric BP.

Blood pressure

Blood pressure was measured two times on the right arm in a sitting position after a few minutes rest. If the difference between the measurements was more than 10 mmHg for either systolic or diastolic pressure, a third measurement was obtained. The device used was the Omron 705 IT (Omron Healthcare Inc, Bannockburn, IL, USA) with an appropriate sized cuff. Outcome measures were systolic pressure (SP), diastolic pressure (DP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP), all expressed in mmHg. MAP was calculated using the following equation: MAP = DP + 1/3 (SP-DP).

### Can we reliably use pulse pressure as a surrogate for stroke volume? Physiological background and potential clinical implications for shock resuscitation [^115z8Dzc]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Critically ill patients often exhibit cardiovascular disturbances that impair oxygen delivery, leading to organ dysfunction. Monitoring tissue perfusion and identifying predominant hemodynamic patterns are essential clinical objectives for guiding tailored resuscitative strategies. This approach is particularly important in the early stages of disease, when timely interventions can significantly impact outcomes. Cardiac output (CO) monitoring is central to hemodynamic assessment, offering insights into global blood flow and distinct hemodynamic profiles. However, its widespread use is limited by high costs, invasiveness, and the need for specialized training, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

Invasive arterial pressure monitoring, a standard technique in critically ill patients, provides diverse relevant signals beyond mean arterial pressure (MAP) including systolic arterial pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), and pulse pressure (PP) among others. A key question is if, and to what extent any of these variables may aid clinicians in predicting stroke volume (SV) to decide on initial resuscitative interventions before more advanced hemodynamic monitoring, including echocardiography, has been placed or performed. MAP is considered as the global perfusion pressure and exerts the greatest influence on blood flow autoregulation within organs. However, nor an isolated MAP value, physiologically determined by both SV and systemic vascular resistance, or its changes after an acute hemodynamic intervention may predict SV. Indeed, MAP changes are conditioned by the status of dynamic elastance after a fluid challenge, while some patients increase SV without proportional changes in MAP or vice versa.

On the other hand, SAP relates to the work that the left ventricle must perform to generate an adequate SV and reflects the interplay between cardiac performance and heart rate, the buffer mechanical function of the aorta, and peripheral resistances. Therefore, SAP cannot be directly linked with SV. Conversely, DAP is mainly determined by vascular tone and remains nearly constant from the ascending aorta to the peripheral vessels. Evaluation of the loss of vascular tone or vasoplegia through the severity of diastolic hypotension could have profound implications on therapeutic decisions, such as early use of norepinephrine in septic shock.

Thus, it appears that the signal that may offer more insights into the status of SV is pulse pressure, as discussed below. However, the PP-SV relationship is influenced by complex physiological factors, complicating its bedside interpretation. This review explores the physiological basis of the PP-SV relationship, the factors affecting it, and providing perspectives on the clinical utility in hemodynamic profiling and shock resuscitation.

### How to assess mean blood pressure properly at the brachial artery level [^11119fBn]. Journal of Hypertension (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Mean arterial pressure at the upper arm is traditionally calculated by adding one-third of the pulse pressure to the diastolic pressure. We questioned the general validity of this formula.

Methods

We used previously recorded resting intrabrachial pressure and Riva-Rocci Korotkoff blood pressure measurements in 57 subjects (study A) and 24-h intra-arterial recordings obtained in 22 ambulant subjects (study B).

Results

In study A the intra-arterially measured 'real' mean pressure was found at 39.5 ± 2.5% of pulse pressure above diastolic pressure, namely at a level higher than the expected 33.3% of pulse pressure, in all individuals. Results were not related to age, blood pressure, pulse pressure or heart rate levels. Mean pressure calculated with the traditional one-third rule therefore underestimated 'real' mean pressure by 5.0 ± 2.3 mmHg (P < 0.01) when calculated from intra-arterial pressure readings, and by 4.9 ± 5.3 mmHg (P < 0.01) when calculated from Riva-Rocci Korotkoff readings. In study B we showed activity-related variations in the relative level of the 'real' mean pressure, which increased by 1.8 ± 1.4% (P < 0.01) during sleep, and decreased by 0.5 ± 0.9% during walking (P < 0.05) and by 0.8 ± 1.3% during cycling (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

The mean pressure at the upper arm is underestimated when calculated using the traditional formula of adding one-third of the pulse pressure to the diastolic pressure. This underestimation can be avoided by adding 40% of pulse pressure to the diastolic pressure. The proposed approach needs to be validated through larger scale studies.

### Is measurement of central venous pressure required to estimate systemic vascular resistance? A retrospective cohort study [^113Bqim6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The vital data was recorded in 1 second interval for both MAP and mean CVP and 2 seconds interval for cardiac output. Since these values displayed on the monitor are instantaneous, we extracted mean values for every 10-s interval based on the assumption that at least 10 s of observation is needed for clinical decision. Then the extracted data were filtered for error values so that MAP was > 30 mmHg and < 140 mmHg and mean CVP was > 0 mmHg and < 30 mmHg. After the filtration, as the data processing interval of FloTrac™/EV1000™ system and HemoSphere advanced monitoring platform were 20 and 60 s, respectively, the extracted data was further averaged accordingly (every 20 or 60 s) (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Data processing work-flow diagram. NA, not available; CO, cardiac output; CVP, central venous pressure; MAP: mean arterial blood pressure

Hemodynamic variables

SVR was calculated based on actual, fixed, and random values for CVP. Fixed CVP values were set at 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 mmHg, whereas random CVP values were determined by random sampling between 5 and 15 mmHg, with replacement allowed at every time point; i.e. every 20 s for neurosurgery and every 60 s for cardiac surgery. SVRs for actual CVP (SVRa); for CVPs fixed at 0 mmHg (SVRf0), 5 mmHg (SVRf5), 10 mmHg (SVRf10), 15 mmHg (SVRf15), and 20 mmHg (SVRf20); and for random CVPs (SVRr) were subsequently calculated using the equation: SVR (dynes/sec/cm⁻⁵) = 80 × (MAP [mmHg] – actual, fixed, or random CVP [mmHg]) ÷ CO (L/min).

### Optimal mean arterial pressure in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: an analysis of area below blood pressure thresholds [^112qqNSD]. Resuscitation (2018). Low credibility.

Aim Of The Study

To determine the optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the early-to-intermediate phase care of comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Methods

We identified consecutive comatose survivors of OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm. Using blood pressure-over-time plots, we calculated the area below pre-specified MAP thresholds (ABT; mmHg*hours) during the first 96 h of admission. We used incremental MAP thresholds ranging between 65 and 85 mmHg. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between ABT and clinical outcomes for each MAP threshold and to adjust for age, duration of cardiac arrest, and bystander CPR. The primary outcome was severe neurological dysfunction as defined by a cerebral performance category (CPC) ≥ 3.

Results

We identified 122 consecutive OHCA patients meeting inclusion criteria. The rate of the primary outcome was 33%. There was a significant association between ABT and the rate of the primary outcome when MAP thresholds of 60 (p = 0.01), 65 (p < 0.01), 70 (p < 0.01), 75 (p < 0.01), and 80 mmHg (p < 0.01) were used. This association was lost once a MAP threshold of 85 mmHg was reached (p = 0.63). In the adjusted analysis, the association between ABT and the primary outcome was no longer present when the MAP threshold reached 75 mmHg.

Conclusions

In comatose survivors of OHCA with an initial shockable rhythm, higher ABT is associated with increased rates of severe neurological dysfunction when MAP thresholds < 75 mmHg are used. The current findings support the hypothesis that higher MAP targets (≥ 75 mmHg) may be indicated in this patient population.

### The relationship between mean arterial pressure and decreased glomerular filtration rate in rural areas of northeast China [^114tzUjP]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as a global public health problem, and patients with CKD have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Mild renal insufficiency has been considered to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the correlation in people, in the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors has been confirmed. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is considered to be the perfusion pressure for the organs of the body. Low MAP can cause low renal blood flow (RBF) and damage the kidney. However, this doesn't mean that RBF increases as the MAP increases.

Recent interest has been aroused in the relationship of renal damage with arterial stiffness evaluated by the augmentation index (AIx) and blood pressure including central blood pressure (cBP) and peripheral blood pressure (pBP). Several studies have investigated the association of AIx, cBP and pBP with glomerular filtration rate (GFR), but they have obtained inconsistent results. How MAP affects kidney function and gender differences in this mechanism remains unclear.

In the general population, is unknown how MAP influences the GFR? This study examined the relation between MAP and decreased GFR in participants aged ≥ 35 years from the Liaoning province of China. Further, we studied the relationship to see if there was a difference between the sexes.

### Blood pressure measurement and assessment of arterial structure and function: an expert group position paper [^113zbuAm]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

CENTRAL AORTIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND PULSE WAVE ANALYSIS

The pressure pulse generated in the proximal aorta due to left ventricular ejection generally increases in amplitude as it propagates towards the periphery due to characteristics of structure and function of the arterial vasculature. In large arteries, mean arterial pressure (MAP) is constant, so change in pulse amplitude is always associated with alterations in wave morphology, such that the area under the central and peripheral pulse wave is similar. In addition, central (cDBP) and peripheral (pDBP) arterial diastolic pressure are also almost similar, so changes in the shape of the pressure pulse wave are predominantly related to differences in central (cSBP) and peripheral (pSBP) systolic pressure. These fundamental physiological observations have been made from invasive measurements and are consistent with physiological considerations of pulse wave propagation. The differences between cSBP and pSBP have been shown to spread over the range of 0–30 mmHg, with an average difference of 12 mmHg. Because of the distribution of differences, it is not possible to estimate cSBP by subtracting 12 mmHg from measured pSBP. This would only capture 19% of the values that would be in the similarity range of MAP and DBP. These considerations generated interest in using the peripheral pulse wave to uncover the quantitative relative difference in cSBP and pSBP from noninvasive measurements.

The peripheral pressure pulse can be readily obtained noninvasively from the radial or carotid arteries using applanation tonometry or from the brachial artery using a partially inflated cuff. Analytical techniques of pulse wave analysis (PWA) are used to obtain a central aortic pressure waveform which is calibrated using the conventional measurement of blood pressure (BP) with a brachial cuff sphygmomanometer. Methodology for this calibration varies and can potentially give different estimations of cSBP. The pulse waveform can be calibrated using MAP and pDBP or pSBP and pDBP and these differences have been assigned to the designation of specific device types. Therefore, CBP can be calculated noninvasively from peripheral BP waveforms using tonometry or cuff-based devices and dedicated algorithms.

The use of PWA for computation of the central aortic pulse varies from a direct tonometric registration of the carotid pulse to the use of mathematical models to transform the time-sampled peripheral pulse to a central aortic pulse, from which pulse components and features can be obtained (e.g. augmentation index, subendocardial viability ratio).

### Blood pressure response to interrupting workplace sitting time with non-exercise physical activity: results of a 12-month cohort study [^113UGSYD]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Data Manipulation and Statistical Analyses

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated ([systolic blood pressure + 2 × diastolic blood pressure]/3) from each blood pressure reading. To determine the impact of the intervention for those people with clinically elevated blood pressure, participants were categorized into normotensive (blood pressure < 120/80 mmHg), prehypertensive (systolic 120 to 139 and/or diastolic 80 to 89 mmHg) and hypertensive (systolic ≥ 140 and/or diastolic 90 mmHg) based on their baseline blood pressure.

Intention to treat, mixed effects regression analyses were conducted using STATA statistical software (STATA SE 14x, StataCorpLP, College Station, TX) used to determine differences in blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and MAP) over time as well as changes to the number of times the e-health solution was utilized during the workday. Blood pressure data were adjusted for age, BMI, and sex during analyses. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Holm test. Data were graphically plotted using Prism version 7.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA.

### Relationship between body mass index and mean arterial pressure in normotensive and chronic hypertensive pregnant women: a prospective, longitudinal study [^116aCdA4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

MAP model

The model for MAP during pregnancy was again of a similar form to (2). Its estimates are presented in Table 4. The correlation coefficient (95% CI) between the two random-effects was estimated to be −0.871 (−0.828, −0.772). The variance-covariance matrix of the within group errors was diagonal with a power variance function based on the fitted values; the variance function coefficient (95% CI) was estimated to be −1.632 (−2.206, −1.058).

For the MAP model, two cubic parallel curves, one for each hypertensive status, were predicted, and the MAP values were significantly higher in the hypertensive group than the normotensive group (Fig. 4). Between 12–14 weeks, the average MAP values were 82.42 mmHg and 95.43 mmHg in the NT and HT groups, respectively. The values decreased during weeks 18–22, reaching a minimum of 80.43 mmHg and 93.44 mmHg in the NT and HT groups, respectively. After week 22, the values increased until delivery, reaching a maximum of 85.05 mmHg and 98.06 mmHg, respectively.

### What links ventilator driving pressure with survival in the acute respiratory distress syndrome? A computational study [^116VD4r9]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Measurements of key physiological variables and VILI indices

After establishing the capability of the simulator to reproduce the responses of all 25 ARDS patients to variations in ventilator settings, measurements were made of changes in all relevant physiological variables as the in silico patients were subjected to the same levels of driving pressure and PEEP that were analyzed in the study of Amato and colleagues. Driving pressure was determined as the difference between the plateau pressure and the PEEP. To observe the cardio-pulmonary effects of interest, the following values were recorded: arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2), arterial pH (pH), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2) and SvO 2, volume of individual alveolar compartments at end of inspiration and end of expiration (V alv_insp and V alv_exp, respectively), and pressure of individual compartments at end of inspiration and end of expiration (P alv_insp and P alv_exp, respectively), cardiac output (CO; cardiac index was calculated from CO indexed to body surface area), the mean arterial pressure (MAP), the mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) and oxygen delivery (DO 2; using the values of CO, SaO 2 and PaO 2 and given hemoglobin level (Hb)). Recruitment was calculated as the fraction of alveoli receiving zero ventilation subsequently achieving ventilation. Several proposed indices of VILI were calculated, e.g. respiratory system compliance (C RS), intra-tidal recruitment, mechanical power, mean alveolar pressure (P alv), and the strain on the lung (both dynamic and static). C RS is calculated as ∆V/ (P plat - PEEP), where P plat is the plateau pressure. The dynamic strain is calculated as ∆V / V frc, where V frc is V alv_exp at PEEP = 0 cmH 2 O and ∆V = V alv_insp -V alv_exp. Static strain was calculated as V alv_exp / V frc. Intra-tidal recruitment was calculated as the difference between the fraction of total ventilated lung at the end of inhaling and end of exhaling, expressed as a percentage. The mean alveolar pressure, P alv, is calculated as the average end-inspiratory pressure (of the highest 20% values) distributed across the lung, which is a better indicator for end-inspiratory lung pressure than the often used surrogate, plateau pressure. Gattinoni and colleagues have suggested that instead of separately considering the mechanical factors (pressure, volume, rate and flow) associated with VILI, it may be better to combine these factors as the 'mechanical power' imparted to the lung by the ventilator, which we calculated using the following equation (Eq. 6 from):

### Percentage of mean arterial pressure as a marker of atherosclerosis for detecting patients with coronary artery disease [^114jvyvu]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Cutoff values of ABI and %MAP

The 2016 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on the management of peripheral artery disease (PAD) recommend that ABI in the range of 1.00–1.40 should be classified as normal for the diagnosis of LEAD. In addition, a previous study showed that low ABI (< 1.00) was associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events than was normal ABI (1.00–1.40). Therefore, participants were divided into two groups based on the cutoff value of ABI: subjects with low ABI when ABI on either side was < 1.00 and subjects with normal ABI when ABIs on both the left and right sides were ≥ 1.00.

To our knowledge, there has been no report in which a cutoff value of %MAP for cardiovascular disease was proposed in the general population. Therefore, in accordance with the recommended cutoff value of %MAP for diagnosis of LEAD in the 2013 Japanese Circulation Society guidelines for a noninvasive vascular function test and in the 2022 Japanese Circulation Society guideline on the management of PAD and a cutoff value of %MAP proposed from the results of a recent study in which the optimal cutoff value of %MAP for diagnosis of LEAD was investigated, participants were divided into two groups: subjects with %MAP < 45% when the %MAPs on both the left and right sides were < 45% and subjects with %MAP ≥ 45% when %MAP on either side or %MAPs on both sides were ≥ 45%. In the present study, these cutoff values of ABI and %MAP were used for severity assessment of atherosclerosis but not for diagnosis of LEAD.

The optimal cutoff value of %MAP

The optimal cutoff value of %MAP derived from an ROC curve to diagnose clinical CAD was 40.3%. Subjects were divided into two groups according to the cutoff value of %MAP: subjects with %MAP < 40.3% (n = 1410) and subjects with %MAP ≥ 40.3% (n = 803). The clinical characteristics of subjects according to the cutoff value of %MAP are summarized in Supplementary Table 10. The prevalence of CAD was significantly higher in subjects with %MAP ≥ 40.3% than in subjects with < 40.3% (18.2% vs. 11.2%, p < 0.001). In an unadjusted analysis of the relationship between CAD and %MAP ≥ 40.3%, %MAP ≥ 40.3% was significantly associated with a higher risk of CAD (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.38–2.25; p < 0.001) (Supplementary Table 11). When the ABI value was entered into the model, the association between %MAP ≥ 40.3% and CAD remained significant (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.19–2.24; p = 0.002) (Supplementary Table 11, Model 3). The AUC value of the ROC curve for %MAP ≥ 40.3% was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.54–0.60). The addition of %MAP ≥ 40.4% to ABI < 1.00 significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy for clinical CAD [AUC: 0.56 (95% CI, 0.53–0.58) to 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56–0.62), p = 0.006].

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for management of blood pressure in CKD [^114vv475]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 6.2 in children with CKD ND — evidence basis and feasibility are questioned: Recommendation 6.2 is problematic for several reasons. First, there is no scientific evidence to support a measurable benefit from reducing office blood pressure to less than the 50th percentile in children with CKD. In the ESCAPE trial, enhanced blood pressure control, defined as 24-hour mean ambulatory blood pressure lower than the 50th percentile, resulted in a slower rate of progression in children with stage 2–4 CKD. Second, the document suggests reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure to lower than the 50th percentile, while the evidence is based on mean ambulatory blood pressure lower than the 50th percentile. Ambulatory blood pressure values are generally higher than the office values in children, and there are no data indicating the level of office systolic or diastolic blood pressure equivalent to the 50th percentile ambulatory mean arterial pressure (MAP), leaving clinicians uncertain about the corresponding office level and making implementation challenging.

Background

Blood pressure is one of the most commonly measured clinical parameters and blood pressure values are major determinants of therapeutic decisions. However, interpretation of the physiological meaning of blood pressure in an individual patient is not always an easy task. This paper reviews the physical basis and physiological determinants of arterial pressure, and the relationship of arterial pressure to tissue perfusion. Some of the issues have been covered in a previous review on blood pressure. The objective of this paper is to provide guidance when considering therapeutic options but it is not possible to give a definitive algorithm with current knowledge.

Carotid Ultrasound

High‐resolution B‐mode carotid ultrasound imaging was performed using GE LogIQ 700 (9–13 MHz linear‐array transducer) by trained sonographersto obtain systolic and diastolic bilateral common carotid diameter measurements in mm. Carotid artery stiffness was measured in the right common carotid using the β stiffness indexand was defined as follows: β = ln(SBP/DBP)/strain, where strain = (carotid systolic diameter–carotid diastolic diameter)/carotid diastolic diameter. Carotid β stiffness index and DBP were used in the single‐site conversion equation for local carotid artery pulse‐wave velocity (PWV). Local carotid PWV was estimated as the square‐root of (β*DBP)/(2*ρ) according to single‐site conversion equation, where ρ is the density of blood assumed to be 1059 kg/m³. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound imaging was performed on bilateral common carotid arteries to obtain peak systolic and end‐diastolic blood flow velocities (BFVs).

Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) Doppler calculations for stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) — the baseline LVOT diameter in the mid‑esophageal long‑axis (LAX) view can be used to calculate area, which when combined with the LVOT velocity–time integral (VTI) and heart rate can be used to calculate SV and CO. SV is computed as Stroke volume (or flow) = Cross sectional area (cm2) × VTI (cm), and CO = SV × heart rate. For SVR in Wood units, SVR = MAP – RA pressure (mm Hg)/CO (L/min); to convert to conventional SVR units (dynes · sec/cm⁵), this value should be multiplied by 80. It was the recommendation of the committee that the stroke distance (LVOT and RVOT time‑velocity integrals) alone be used for serial measurements, assuming LVOT diameter remains constant.

### Mean arterial pressure differences between cuff oscillometric and invasive blood pressure [^112uhcVB]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study overview

Data are from five studies within the Invasive Blood Pressure Consortium with complete data relevant to this study aim. Each study recorded oscillometric MAP and invasive MAP measurements in addition to cuff and invasive aortic systolic and diastolic BPs among patients undergoing coronary angiography. The Invasive Blood Pressure Consortium was formed following a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. The rationale for using data from multiple studies was to understand if a consistent effect of differences in cuff oscillometric MAP compared with invasive MAP was observed across different automated cuff BP devices, each with unique proprietary algorithms. Although it would have been preferable to test multiple devices on the same patient, this was not feasible within the busy clinical centres where data was recorded.

All recordings were made under baseline hemodynamic conditions. In all studies the cuff and invasive aortic BP were measured contemporaneously. In three studies, cuff BP and invasive aortic BP was precisely simultaneous (one unpublished), in one study invasive aortic BP was recorded immediately prior to the cuff BP, and in one study cuff BP was recorded immediately prior to invasive aortic BP. Exclusion criteria across all studies included valvular heart disease and arrhythmia, on the basis that these conditions could influence the quality of the cuff and invasive aortic BP recordings. The rationale for comparing cuff and invasive aortic BP is that the cuff BP was originally intended to measure aortic BP as a marker of BP exposure of the central organs, and most automated cuff BP devices provide a closer estimate of aortic BP than upper arm BP. Each research site obtained local ethics approval and the data for this investigation was merged with the approval of all data custodians in accordance with Tasmanian Health and Medical Human Research Ethics Committee (reference: H0015048).

### Determining optimal mean arterial blood pressure based on cerebral autoregulation in children after cardiac surgery [^111dqkDH]. Pediatric Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the feasibility of continuous determination of the optimal mean arterial blood pressure (opt-MAP) according to cerebral autoregulation and to describe the opt-MAP, the autoregulation limits, and the time spent outside these limits in children within 48 h of cardiac surgery. Cerebral autoregulation was assessed using the correlation coefficient (COx) between cerebral oxygenation and MAP in children following cardiac surgery. Plots depicting the COx according to the MAP were used to determine the opt-MAP using weighted multiple time windows. For each patient, we estimated (1) the time spent with MAP outside the autoregulation limits and (2) the burden of deviation, defined as the area between the MAP curve and the autoregulation limits when the MAP was outside these limits. Fifty-one patients with a median age of 7.1 (IQR 0.7–52.0) months old were included. The opt-MAP was calculated for 94% (IQR 90–96) of the monitored time. The opt-MAP was significantly lower in neonates < 1 month old. The patients spent 24% (18–31) of the time outside of the autoregulation limits, with no significant differences between age groups. Continuous determination of the opt-MAP is feasible in children within the first 48 h following cardiac surgery.

Demographic predictors of personalized targets

Ten studies examined demographic and clinical predictors of personalized MAP targets to answer the question whether targets could be approximated using other parameters and further contextualize the underpinning biology of these targets. They found that most common demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors do not significantly predict individualized cerebral autoregulatory targets like MAPopt, LLA, or ULA (Fig. 4). Only a few associations were statistically significant, and even these demonstrated small effect sizes or marginal clinical relevance. Moreover, surgical and intraoperative variables had only minor predictive value in isolated models that explained little variance.

### New generation continuous cardiac output monitoring from carbon dioxide elimination [^111MPcBT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The need for better cardiac output monitoring options

Over the last 25 years, progress in technologies for perioperative measurement of cardiac output (CO) has been largely driven by the potential for advanced hemodynamic monitoring to deliver improvements in patient outcomes in major surgery. Much of this interest among clinicians and researchers relates to "goal directed" intravenous fluid administration, informed by our understanding of the relationship between circulatory volume status and stroke volume based on the Starling curve. This is manifested clinically as "fluid responsiveness", where cardiac output can be increased by greater ventricular preload to a maximal point representing "optimal" volume status. The potential clinical implications of this were articulated by Bellamy, who drew a theoretical U-shaped curve relating optimal fluid resuscitation and tissue perfusion to minimizing complication rates in surgical patients. Recent large trial data have supported, but not yet confirmed, this in high risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. In addition to fluid and volume titration, cardiac output measurement provides other important benefits such as improved diagnostic capability to help manage hypotension in the anesthetized patient and assist appropriate combination of fluid and vasopressor administration by calculation of systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from measurement of both systemic perfusion pressure (the difference between mean arterial pressure MAP and central venous pressure CVP) and blood flow (Eq. 1).

Invasive cardiac output measurement from right heart thermodilution using the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) became widespread practice in cardiac surgery forty years ago and remains routine in many centers worldwide. However the overall risk-benefit of the PAC has been difficult to demonstrate, and its invasiveness prevented its adoption in routine practice outside of the most challenging and high risk surgical populations. Nevertheless, the desire to generalize the potential benefits of advanced hemodynamic monitoring to a wider population has driven an explosive growth in the range of new less invasive alternatives. Several different physiological and bioengineering principles have been exploited to achieve this, including pulse pressure waveform interpretation, Doppler measurement of blood flow velocities in the great vessels, and thoracic electrical bioimpedance and velocimetry and related technologies. Testing and validation of these devices in the clinical environment has generally used thermodilution as the reference standard, and has usually been conducted in the setting of elective cardiac surgery. Interpretation and generalization of the findings of these validation studies is often made difficult by the narrow test population, as well as the imperfect precision of cardiac output measurement by thermodilution under real world clinical conditions.

Bar graphs show the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) according to percentage of mean arterial pressure (%MAP)

Table 2
Association between coronary artery disease and %MAP ≥ 45% %MAP indicates percentage of mean arterial pressure; ABI, ankle-brachial index

When the diagnostic accuracy of %MAP and that of ABI were compared as continuous values, there was no significant difference between the AUC value of %MAP to diagnose CAD and that of ABI [AUC: 0.56 (95% CI, 0.53–0.60) vs. 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55–0.63), p = 0.19]. The addition of %MAP to ABI as a continuous value did not improve the diagnostic accuracy for clinical CAD [AUC: 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55–0.63) to 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56–0.63), p = 0.51].

Association between %MAP and CAD in subjects with normal ABI

We divided the subjects with normal ABI (≥ 1.00) into two groups according to the cutoff value of 45% for %MAP. The clinical characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 3. Of the 1945 subjects with normal ABI, 99 (5.1%) had %MAP ≥ 45%. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of CAD between subjects with %MAP < 45% and subjects with %MAP ≥ 45% (12.2% vs. 12.1%, p = 0.97) among the subjects with normal ABI (Supplementary Table 3).

Blood pressure control and monitoring in the early postoperative period after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implant — Class I states that arterial line monitoring is recommended early after LVAD implant to allow for accurate blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Class IIa indicates it is reasonable to target a mean arterial pressure 75 to 90 mm Hg to reduce the risk of stroke in hospitalized patients. Class III notes there are no data to support aggressive afterload reduction after LVAD implant and that excessive pharmacologic hypotension (MAP < 75 mm Hg) should be avoided. When automated cuffs are used, the mean arterial pressure, rather than systolic or diastolic pressures, should be followed.

### New formula for predicting mean pulmonary artery pressure using systolic pulmonary artery pressure [^116sK5Ni]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) and systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) are used interchangeably to define pulmonary hypertension (PH). We tested the hypothesis that the measurement of MPAP and SPAP is redundant in resting humans over a wide pressure range.

Design

Prospective, observational study.

Setting

Catheterization laboratory in a university hospital.

Patients

This study involved 31 patients, as follows: primary PH, nine patients; chronic pulmonary thromboembolism, seven patients; venous PH, six patients; and control subjects with normal pulmonary artery pressure, nine patients.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Results

High-fidelity pulmonary artery pressures were obtained when patients were at rest. Over the wide MPAP range that was under study (10 to 78 mm Hg), MPAP and SPAP were strongly related (r(2) = 0.98). Regression analysis performed on the first 16 subjects (test sample) allowed us to propose a formula (MPAP = 0.61 SPAP + 2 mm Hg), the accuracy of which was confirmed in the remaining 15 subjects (validation sample bias, 0 ± 2 mm Hg). If PH was defined by an SPAP in excess of 30 or 40 mm Hg, this corresponded to an MPAP in excess of 20 or 26 mm Hg. If PH was defined by an MPAP of > 25 mm Hg, this corresponded to an SPAP of > 38 mm Hg.

Conclusions

In resting humans, MPAP can be accurately predicted from SPAP over a wide pressure range. The new formula may help to refine the threshold pressure values used in the diagnosis of PH. Further studies are needed to test the hypothesis that our formula may allow the noninvasive prediction of MPAP from Doppler-derived SPAP values.

Contractility, myocardial work, and cardiac power output (CPO) — measurement and prognostic value — are outlined, noting that contractility is an intrinsic property of cardiac tissue affected by the adrenergic state, drugs, and myocyte injury or loss; in clinical practice it is difficult to measure and common surrogates such as ejection fraction and +dP/dt are load dependent; pressure–volume–based assessment has been suggested but is mainly used for research; CPO is presented as a less commonly used indicator of myocardial contractility calculated as CPO = MAP × CO/451 and has been shown to predict worsening hemodynamics and mortality, with the figure noting that in the SHOCK trial a higher CPO was associated with lower in-hospital mortality.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults and special considerations in pulmonary hypertension: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^112whL6R]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) — noninvasive derivation and clinical role: The most common noninvasive formula is mPAP = 1/3 × (PASP) + 2/3 × (PAEDP), and a mPAP > 20 mm Hg is considered abnormal. Other formulas include mPAP = 79 − 0.45 × AccT; mPAP = 90 − (0.62 × AccT) when AccT < 120 ms; and mPAP = [PASP × 0.61] + 2 mm Hg. Although there are several echocardiographic methods to calculate mPAP, standard reporting of RVSP is generally preferred; when clinically relevant, such as screening and monitoring of patients with PH, reporting of mPAP can be considered when RVSP estimation is limited, and definitive diagnosis and classification of PH requires invasive hemodynamic confirmation by right heart catheterization (RHC).

### Blood pressure measurement and assessment of arterial structure and function: an expert group position paper [^114RCkY7]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The present Expert Group Position paper developed by international experts and endorsed by six scientific societies summarizes the characteristics of 11 methods for assessing arterial hemodynamics. Among these methods are those for measuring blood pressure, as well as those for assessing the structure and function of large arteries, small arteries, arterioles, and capillaries. Each of these techniques studies a specific aspect of circulatory hemodynamics with its advantages, limitations, indications, and normal values. Many research studies are needed to clarify questions on the methodology and benefits of applying several of these techniques in the clinical setting. For now, it is up to the user to follow the optimal methodology and conditions for their implementation and to interpret the results based on established normal values or thresholds, integrating their results into a comprehensive approach to the individual.

Clinical measurements

The clinical investigation of the retinal blood vessels and blood pressure was performed by a single trained examiner, following standardized guidelines. Children always gave their assent before measurements were initiated. The blood pressure of the participants was measured with an automated oscillometric upper-arm blood-pressure monitor (Omron 705IT, Omron Corporation, Japan). To ensure accurate measurements, cuffs adapted for children were used depending on the child's right upper arm circumference. Measurements were performed by a standardized method, as described by the European Society of Hypertension. In summary, after the child had rested for 10 min in supine position, a trained observer obtained five consecutive readings of the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure of the right arm, with 1-min intervals. Average SBP and DBP were based on the last three readings. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated via the equation: MAP = (2/3 × DBP) + (1/3 × SBP).

### Evaluation of various empirical formulas for estimating mean pulmonary artery pressure by using systolic pulmonary artery pressure in adults [^113TGP8z]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) may be estimated by using the classic rule of thumb, namely 2/3 × dPAP + 1/3 × sPAP, where dPAP = diastolic PAP and sPAP = systolic PAP. Studies have suggested that mPAP may be also estimated from sPAP alone. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is usually defined by an invasive mPAP > 25 mm Hg, but the corresponding sPAP threshold remains to be established. Our study evaluated the accuracy and precision of various empirical formulas relating mPAP and sPAP in resting adults.

Methods

Five previously published studies with individual high-fidelity PAPs were analyzed (n = 166 individuals, 57% of whom had PH). The time-averaged mPAP was compared with formula one (F1), the classic rule of thumb; formula two (F2) = dPAP + 0.41 x pulse PAP; formula three (F3) = √(sPAP × dPAP); formula four (F4) = 0.61 × sPAP + 2 mm Hg; and formula five (F5) = 2/3 × sPAP (parabolic shape).

Results

The mPAP ranged from 9 to 82 mm Hg and was related to sPAP (r(2) = 0.98). The most accurate formula was F4 (mean bias, 0.0 mm Hg). The most precise formula was F1 (SD of the bias, 1.6 mm Hg). Other formulas gave estimates of essentially similar accuracy, while F2 and F3 were more precise than F4 and F5. sPAP > 36 mm Hg could be used to diagnose PH (mPAP > 25 mm Hg) with a 97.9% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity.

Conclusion

In resting adults, the most accurate estimate of mPAP was obtained by using sPAP only, while the combination of sPAP and dPAP gave the most precise mPAP estimate. The sPAP threshold of 36 mm Hg could be used to diagnose PH with high sensitivity and high specificity.

### A meta-analysis of the haemodynamics of primary hypertension in children and adults [^1164oKNF]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

The role of increased cardiac activity (increased heart rate and stroke volume) and CO as the major haemodynamic determinant of primary hypertension in young to middle-aged persons has potential implications for the optimal treatment of primary hypertension. If this starts with cardiac overactivity, with a later increase in SVR due to arterial remodelling or other factors, then consideration should be given to interventions that may reduce cardiac overactivity. Specific treatments to reduce sympathetic drive and volume overload (which might reduce CO via effects on heart rate and SV) might prevent hypertension from progressing to the phase characterized by increased SVR. It is notable that obesity hypertension is thought to be characterized by both sympathetic activity and volume overload. Weight reduction, therefore, could be particularly important in normalizing hypertension in younger individuals. The relative benefits of different types of treatment could differ according to age and duration of treatment as hypertension transitions from a cardiac to vascular phenotype.

Strengths of the systematic review and meta-analysis include the systematic literature search using multiple databases based on a priori criteria to minimize publication bias, and use of well established meta-analysis procedures for our analysis. Limitations include the limited characterization of the hypertensive and normotensive groups, particularly with regard to ethnicity, hypertension sub-type (e.g. isolated systolic hypertension) and treatment. The majority of studies were performed on individuals who were untreated or in whom treatment was withdrawn for at least 7 days but residual effects of treatment might have been present. In a minority of studies mean values of CO were calculated from the product of the mean of CI and BSA, which would have led to a small underestimation of mean CO. Whether there is a transition within individual hypertensive individuals from a state characterized by cardiac overactivity at a young age to that characterized by increased SVR and less cardiac overactivity at older age would ideally be tested in longitudinal studies. However, it is not possible to perform such studies in un-treated individuals. Finally, our analysis focused on MAP rather than PP. However, MAP is highly predictive of outcomes in individuals of all age and is the component of BP mostly strongly related to outcomes in young to middle-aged individuals. Further work is required to determine the more complex haemodynamic determinants of a difference in PP between hypertensive and normotensive individuals. Finally, whilst the results of this meta-analysis are representative of mean values within normotensive and hypertensive individuals within the population, individual children and adults with hypertension may present a range of phenotypes across the spectrum of increased resistance to increased cardiac output.

### All over the MAP: describing pressure variability in acute spinal cord injury [^113kMEqy]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Observational study.

Objectives

To examine the feasibility of meeting the current clinical guidelines for the hemodynamic management of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) which recommend maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 85–90mmHg in the days following injury.

Methods

This study examined data collected minute-by-minute to describe the pressure profile in the first 5 days following SCI in 16 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at Vancouver General Hospital (40 ± 19 years, 13M/3F, C4-T11). MAP and intrathecal pressure (ITP) were monitored at 100Hz by arterial and lumbar intrathecal catheters, respectively, and reported as the average of each minute. Spinal cord perfusion pressure was calculated as the difference between MAP and ITP. The minute-to-minute difference (MMdiff) of each pressure variable was calculated as the absolute difference between consecutive minutes.

Results

Only 24 ± 7% of MAP recordings were between 85 and 90mmHg. Average MAP MMdiff was ~3mmHg. The percentage of MAP recordings within target range was negatively correlated with the degree of variability (i.e. MMdiff; r = -0.64, p < 0.008) whereas higher mean MAP was correlated with greater variability (r = 0.57, p = 0.021).

Conclusions

Our findings point to the 'real life' challenges in maintaining MAP in acute SCI patients. Given MAP fluctuated ~3 mmHg minute-to-minute, maintaining MAP within a 5mmHg range with conventional volume replacement and vasopressors presents an almost impossible task for clinicians and warrants reconsideration of current management guidelines.

### Development and evaluation of a risk-adjusted measure of intraoperative hypotension in patients having nonemergent, noncardiac surgery [^113YjpE6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcome

We defined the measure numerator — intraoperative hypotension — as MAP < 65 mm Hg for a cumulative duration of at least 15 minutes, based on research from Salmasi et al. To calculate cumulative duration, each MAP value < 65 mm Hg was counted for the number of minutes between the index reading and the next reading (typically 1–5 minutes later), capped at a maximum of 5 minutes. If blood pressure was monitored using both invasive and noninvasive means, direct measurements were used to determine the outcome. Artifactual blood pressure values were removed from the data set before calculating the outcome. Values presumed to be artifacts included those documented as an artifact by the clinician, systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 20 mm Hg or ≥ 300 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≤ 5 mm Hg or ≥ 225 mm Hg, readings with SBP and DBP within 5 mm Hg, or MAP ≤ 30 mm Hg or ≥ 250 mm Hg.

### Association between intraoperative mean arterial pressure variability and postoperative delirium after hip fracture surgery: a retrospective cohort study [^114kV357]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

In this retrospective cohort study, patients aged 65 and older who underwent hip fracture surgery at the First Medical Centre of the Chinese PLA General Hospital between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018, were included. The Chinese PLA General Hospital's Ethics Committee Board approved this study (protocol number: S2019–311–03) and waived informed consent requirements.

Patient selection

The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) patients aged 65 years and older; and 2) patients who underwent hip fracture surgery. A person who underwent a second surgery for hip fracture was considered a new patient. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) missing data on intraoperative blood pressure; and 2) missing information on primary medical records.

Data collection

Data were collected from the anesthesia information management system. A manual filter was applied to the raw data values in which either the systolic blood pressure or the diastolic blood pressure was 0 mmHg. The electronic hospital information system was used to collect demographic, preoperative and postoperative data and data on medication use. Laboratory tests were performed within three days before the surgery.

Blood pressure measurements

The patient's arterial blood pressure was measured from the time they entered the operating room to the time they left. Invasive blood pressure measurements were collected continuously, and non-invasive blood pressure measurements were collected every three or five minutes. All blood pressure values were recorded every 30 s.

Blood pressure data handling

The MAP was calculated as follows: (systolic blood pressure−diastolic blood pressure)/3 + diastolic blood pressure. Continuous invasive measurements as well as non-invasive measurements were used to extract the MAP. If both the invasive and non-invasive blood pressure measurements were available at a given time point, the information from the invasive measurement was used in the analysis since it is a direct measurement of the MAP as opposed to an estimation derived from the oscillometric measurement.

MAP variability exposure

The variability in a patient's blood pressure record was calculated to quantify fluctuations in blood pressure during surgery. Consequently, a patient with more blood pressure fluctuations has greater blood pressure variability than a patient with a relatively constant blood pressure during surgery. We developed an indicator of intraoperative MAPV to measure blood pressure fluctuation. MAPV was calculated as follows:whereis a patient's MAP at a given moment, andis the number of blood pressure records.

### Is measurement of central venous pressure required to estimate systemic vascular resistance? A retrospective cohort study [^114F7bhA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical range of central venous pressure (CVP) (typically 5 to 15mmHg) is much less than the range of mean arterial blood pressure (60 to 120mmHg), suggesting that CVP may have little impact on estimation of systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The accuracy and feasibility of using an arbitrary CVP rather than actual CVP for the estimation of SVR during intraoperative period is not known.

Methods

Using vital records obtained from patients who underwent neurological and cardiac surgery, the present study retrospectively calculated SVR using fixed values of CVP (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20mmHg) and randomly changing values of CVP (5 to 15mmHg) and compared these calculated SVRs with actual SVR, calculated using actual CVP. Differences between actual SVR and SVRs based on fixed and random CVPs were quantified as root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Bland-Altman analysis and four-quadrant plot analysis were performed.

Results

A total of 34 patients are included, including 18 who underwent neurosurgery and 16 who underwent cardiac surgery; 501,380s (139.3h) of data was analyzed. The SVR derived from a fixed CVP of 10mmHg (SVRf10) showed the highest accuracy (RMSE: 115 and 104 [dynes/sec/cm -5] and MAPE: 6.3 and 5.7% in neurological and cardiac surgery, respectively). The 95% limits of agreement between SVRf10 and actual SVR were -208.5 (95% confidence interval, -306.3 to -148.1) and 242.2 (95% CI, 181.8 to 340.0) dynes/sec/cm -5 in neurosurgery and-268.1 (95% CI, -367.5 to -207.7) and 163.2 (95% CI, 102.9 to 262.6) dynes/sec/cm -5 in cardiac surgery. All the SVRs derived from the fixed CVPs (regardless of its absolute value) showed excellent trending ability (concordance rate > 0.99).

Conclusions

SVR can be estimated from a fixed value of CVP without causing significant deviation or a loss of trending ability. However, caution is needed when using point estimates of SVR when the actual CVP is expected to be out of the typical clinical range.

Trial Registration

This study was registered Clinical Research Information Service, a clinical trial registry in South Korea (KCT0006187).

### Spine injury [^1142pqNJ]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Spine injury — neurogenic shock and systemic pressure-directed therapy — injuries to the cervical and high thoracic spine cause vasoplegia and neurogenic shock due to a loss of sympathetic tone. Avoid hypotension in spinal cord injury (SCI); the decision to use mean arterial pressure (MAP) goals of 85–90 mmHg for 7 days has to be weighed against the limitations of the data, and the risks for vasopressor use, prolonged immobilization, invasive monitoring, and prolonged consumption of limited critical care resources. Some report a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg as the threshold for relative hypotension, which corresponds to a calculated MAP of 70 mmHg, and the reported upper limit of normal blood pressure for younger patients is 120/80 mmHg, which corresponds to a calculated MAP of 93 mmHg; therefore, it can be argued that MAP targets of 85–90 mmHg represent normotension not augmentation. At least five clinical trials are ongoing or recently completed focused on MAP-directed therapy and/or spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP); measurement of SCPP is based on lumbar drains or pressure monitoring catheters (SCPP = MAP minus intrathecal pressure), and the risks of using lumbar drains and/or intrathecal catheters to lower the intrathecal pressure and increase perfusion pressure across the neuraxis include CSF leak, infection, and catheter placement complications. Treatment of hypotension due to neurogenic shock following SCI initially includes volume resuscitation, taking care to avoid volume overload, followed by vasopressors as needed; no consensus exists regarding the best vasoactive agent; however, an agent with both alpha- and beta-adrenergic activity is recommended to treat both hypotension and bradycardia associated with sympathetic denervation.

### The meaning of blood pressure [^112rU24M]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Critical closing pressure

Resistance to flow through a tube is calculated as the difference between the upstream and downstream pressures, divided by the flow between the two pressures. Accordingly, systemic vascular resistance typically is calculated as the difference between aortic mean pressure and the right atrial pressure, or central venous pressure, which usually are the same. This calculation assumes that the vascular system functions as a continuous tube, but this is not true. Most tissues have critical closing pressures at the level of the arterioles. These are also called vascular waterfalls or Starling resistors. The presence of a critical closing pressure creates the same phenomena that exist in veins when the pressure inside a vessel is less than the pressure outside, but in arterioles flow limitation likely is created by the flow characteristics in small vessels without true collapse. When waterfall-like properties exist, the downstream pressure no longer effects flow, and arterial resistance should be calculated from mean arterial pressure to the critical closing pressure, and not to the right atrial pressure. Animal studies suggest that the average critical closing pressure for the whole circulation is around 30 mmHg but the critical closing pressure differs among vascular beds. For example, in resting skeletal muscle the critical closing pressure was estimated to be over 60 mmHg. In the coronary circulation the critical closing pressure likely is in the range of 15 to 25 mmHg under baseline conditions. Unfortunately, mean arterial critical closing pressure currently cannot be assessed in an intact person either for the whole body or in local regions.

### Monitoring of perioperative tissue perfusion and impact on patient outcomes [^116Dj1CQ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The effect of blood pressure and tissue perfusion on patient outcomes

Study on the risk of blood pressure on organ injury and patient prognosis began in the early 1950s. In a previous study investigating risk factors for postoperative organ dysfunction, Fred Wasserman reported 25 cases of postoperative myocardial infarction and found that a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 40 mmHg (or more) and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more intraoperatively, was associated with postoperative myocardial infarction. Similarly, Lee Goldman found that a decrease in intraoperative systolic blood pressure (SBP) to less than 50% of preoperative levels or a decrease of 33% or more for more than 10 min was one of the independent correlates of perioperative cardiac complications. In a retrospective study carried out by Terri G. Monk, intraoperative SBP below 80 mmHg was an independent risk factor for increased one-year mortality after noncardiac surgery.

Recent evidence underscores the complex relationship between perioperative hypotension (POH) and adverse outcomes. Various studies have proposed different definitions for clinically significant hypotension, including systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg or a drop exceeding 20% of baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP). These discrepancies highlight the need for consensus on defining actionable thresholds to prevent adverse events. A summary of recent perspectives is provided in Table 1, showcasing emerging insights into the impact of POH on patient outcomes. This highlights the complexity of managing perioperative hemodynamics and the necessity of personalized approaches to patient. These perspectives emphasize the importance of integrating advanced monitoring techniques to identify perioperative hypotension early and guide hemodynamic optimization strategies tailored to individual patient risk profiles.

In exploring the relationship between MAP and mortality, it is important to note that while lower MAP has been associated with increased mortality, causality cannot be assumed. A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representation of the relationship between blood pressure and mortality highlights the potential confounding variables, such as underlying comorbidities, that could influence this relationship (Fig. 1). As shown in the DAG, while a direct relationship between lower MAP and increased mortality is evident, it is crucial to consider that this relationship may be influenced by unmeasured confounders. Thus, while the correlation between lower MAP and mortality is evident, further studies are needed to clarify whether this association is truly causal.

### Comparison of differences in cohort (forward) and case control (backward) methodologic approaches for validation of the hypotension prediction index [^113pNAQH]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analysis Method 2: Forward Analysis

We used receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to evaluate the performance of the same variables as in the backward analyses. As previously, a hypotensive event was defined by an MAP of less than 65 mmHg persisting at least 1 min, with all other pressures being considered nonhypotensive events. In this analysis, every data point except those that were during hypotensive events or that had an unreliable arterial line trace were examined. Every prediction index data point was compared to a threshold (for example 85), and a window of 5, 10, or 15 min immediately after the data point was searched to identify any hypotensive events. No gray zones were used in this analysis.

As in previous work assessing the performance of real-time and continuous risk scores,– the analysis sequence was as follows: A true positive prediction occurred when the index was above the designated threshold and there was a hypotensive event in the search window. A false positive prediction occurred when the index was above the designated threshold and there was no hypotensive event in the search window. A true negative prediction occurred when the index was below the designated threshold and there was no hypotensive event in the search window. A false negative prediction occurred when there was a hypotensive event that the index failed to predict at least 2 min in advance. The above process was repeated so that the designated threshold covers all possible values of the index. Similar analyses were also performed for other variables. A flow diagram illustrates the forward methodology in figure 2, similar to published clinical analyses of other real-time and continuous risk scores.–

Index versus MAP Analysis

The index versus MAP analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the index and MAP. All paired data points of the index and MAP from all patients were analyzed together; then, for each integer value of MAP, we calculated the mean, SD, minimum, and maximum of the corresponding index values. Similarly, we calculated the mean, SD, minimum, and maximum of corresponding MAP values for each integer value of the index. All statistics were performed with MATLAB (version R2021a; The MathWorks Inc. USA). The data are available upon reasonable request and institutional review board approval. The analysis script can be found at.

### Preoperative identification of patient-dependent blood pressure targets associated with low risk of intraoperative hypotension during noncardiac surgery [^113CTYY3]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly linked to organ system injuries and postoperative death. Blood pressure itself is a powerful predictor of IOH; however, it is unclear which pressures carry the lowest risk and may be leveraged to prevent subsequent hypotension. Our objective was to develop a model that predicts, before surgery and according to a patient's unique characteristics, which intraoperative mean arterial pressures (MAPs) between 65 and 100 mmHg have a low risk of IOH, defined as an MAP < 65 mmHg, and may serve as testable hemodynamic targets to prevent IOH.

Methods

Adult, noncardiac surgeries under general anesthesia at 2 tertiary care hospitals of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were divided into training and validation cohorts, then assigned into smaller subgroups according to preoperative risk factors. Primary outcome was hypotension risk, defined for each intraoperative MAP value from 65 to 100 mmHg as the proportion of a value's total measurements followed by at least 1 MAP < 65 mmHg within 5 or 10 minutes, and calculated for all values in each subgroup. Five models depicting MAP-associated IOH risk were compared according to best fit across subgroups with proportions whose confidence interval was < 0.05. For the best fitting model, (1) performance was validated, (2) low-risk MAP targets were identified according to applied benchmarks, and (3) preoperative risk factors were evaluated as predictors of model parameters.

Results

A total of 166,091 surgeries were included, with 121,032 and 45,059 surgeries containing 5.4 million and 1.9 million MAP measurements included in the training and validation sets, respectively. Thirty-six subgroups with at least 21 eligible proportions (confidence interval < 0.05) were identified, representing 92% and 94% of available MAP measurements, respectively. The exponential with theta constant model demonstrated the best fit (weighted sum of squared error 0.0005), and the mean squared error of hypotension risk per MAP did not exceed 0.01% in validation testing. MAP targets ranged between 69 and 90 mmHg depending on the subgroup and benchmark used. Increased age, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, and female sexindependently predicted (P < .05) hypotension risk curves with less rapid decay and higher plateaus.

Conclusions

We demonstrate that IOH risk specific to a given MAP is patient-dependent, but predictable before surgery. Our model can identify intraoperative MAP targets before surgery predicted to reduce a patient's exposure to IOH, potentially allowing clinicians to develop more personalized approaches for managing hemodynamics.

Post-cardiac arrest care — insights and implications for MAP thresholds state that the suggested MAP threshold of 65 mmHg was agreed upon by the ILCOR task force, that targeting a higher MAP was not found to have a statistically significant benefit or harm and an upper limit for MAP is unknown, and that indirect perioperative evidence from 33,330 noncardiac surgeries found an association between an intraoperative MAP less than 55 mmHg and adverse cardiac and renal-related outcomes.

Association between ∆MAP and ∆diastolic BP

The ∆MAP was associated with the ∆diastolic BP in the pooled dataset (Fig. 1). In all five devices, there were significant associations between the ∆MAP and ∆diastolic BP, including for measurement on inflate and deflate in the fifth device (Table 2). Across the individual devices, the strength of the associations between the ∆MAP and ∆diastolic BP were variable (unstandardised β and 95% CI: 0.31 (0.09–0.52) to 0.97 (0.62–1.32)). The ∆MAP explained between 28% and 52% of the variance in the ∆diastolic BP (adjusted R 2).

The ∆MAP remained significantly associated with ∆systolic BP and ∆diastolic BP after adjustment for age, sex, heart rate, body mass index and invasive BP (aortic systolic BP, aortic diastolic BP, aortic MAP or aortic pulse pressure each added to models separately; Table 3).

Figure 2
Time-dependent receiver operator characteristic curves for the co-primary endpoints in relation to the percentage of time with non-elevated 24–h ambulatory blood pressure. The non-elevated 24–h ambulatory blood pressure is < 115 mmHg systolic and < 65 mmHg diastolic. The area under the curve for total mortality (A) and the co-primary cardiovascular endpoint (B) increases with longer follow-up, because of the accrual of deaths and cardiovascular endpoints. The number of participants at risk and the number of deaths or cardiovascular endpoints is tabulated for 5-year intervals. The area under the curve is plotted for three models: (i) the base model including cohort (random effect), sex, age, body mass index, smoking and drinking, the total-to-HDL serum cholesterol ratio, antihypertensive drug treatment, and history of cardiovascular disease; (ii) the base model extended by the residual of 24–h mean arterial pressure regressed on percentage of time that the 24-h blood pressure is within the target range (R_MAP); and (iii) the base model extended by the residual of 24-h mean arterial pressure regressed on percentage of time that the 24-h blood pressure is within the target range (R_MAP) and percentage of time that the 24-h blood pressure is within the target range (PTTR). The insert is a magnification of the three plotted lines at 15 years of follow-up. The full model including covariables, 24–h residual of mean arterial pressure and 24–h percentage of time with non-elevated ambulatory blood pressure results in a significantly greater area under the curve compared with both other models (P < .001).

### Pediatric and adult brain death / death by neurologic criteria consensus guideline [^116tDCw9]. Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Brain death/death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC) evaluation — blood pressure prerequisites and targets: Hypotension may suppress brain function and lead to a falsepositive BD/DNC determination. Clinicians must ensure that the patient is not hypotensive before performing a BD/DNC evaluation (Level A), and intravenous administration of volume (crystalloid or colloid), with vasopressors or inotropes as needed for management of blood pressure, before and during BD/DNC evaluation, may facilitate this. In adults, clinicians should maintain SBP ≥ 100 mm Hg and mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 75 mm Hg; and in children, clinicians should maintain SBP and MAP ≥ 5th percentile for age (Level A). The same values are applicable for patients supported with venovenous ECMO. In adults supported by venoarterial (VA) ECMO, clinicians should target an MAP ≥ 75 mm Hg; and for children supported by VA ECMO, clinicians should target MAP ≥ 5th percentile for age (Level A). If an individual has a baseline blood pressure that varies significantly from their age-based normal range, clinicians should target an SBP and MAP that approximate the known chronic baseline for that individual patient (Level B).

### Clinical practice guidelines for vascular access [^1149a4c6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2006). Medium credibility.

Intra access pressure (IAP) ratio and access flow determinants — hemodialysis vascular access are defined and emphasized as follows: the IAP ratio refers to the actual pressure at the site of measurement divided by the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and in fistulae the effective ΔP generally is only 8 to 10 mm Hg, frequently 25%, and seldom more than half those noted in grafts, yet access flow in grafts and fistulae are approximately equal at 6 months because the overall ΔP is the same. It is immediately apparent that 2 anatomic factors determine access function, the quality and the physical dimensions of the artery and vein, and arteries at more distal sites have less capacity to dilate than more proximal sites (radial < brachial < axillary < femoral). If the artery is healthy, flow capacity will be determined by the characteristics of the vein used in access construction, and too small a vein will limit the flow in both a fistula and graft. Arterial disease is not uncommon, and access inflow stenosis occurs in one third of the patients referred to interventional facilities with clinical evidence of venous stenosis or thrombosis; it is very important to assess the access by using physical examination early after its construction, and because flow and pressure measurements are not performed routinely until the access is cannulated, initial assessment of the access depends on the physical examination.

### Blood pressure measurement and assessment of arterial structure and function: an expert group position paper [^117CSBCo]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

It is a matter of ongoing debate which BP variability methods, parameters, and indices –established or emerging – are the most powerful in predicting risk and more reproducible, and thus more useful and relevant for clinical practice. Moreover, there is no agreement on whether and how out-of-office BP measurement should be best incorporated and used in daily practice to assess BP variability, to enhance the management of hypertension and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events (Fig. 2).

FIGURE 2
Main indices of blood pressure variability.

Nevertheless, many studies have provided evidence on the prognostic importance of BPV independent of mean BP levels. In addition, the possibility to control BP variability with long-lasting antihypertensive drugs and drug combinations and by selecting specific drug classes has also been highlighted, although randomized controlled intervention trials on the possible impact on outcome of a reduction in BPV by treatment are not yet available. Even in absence of these trials, however, BPV appears as interesting as the other emerging cardiovascular risk factors mentioned in recent international guidelines for cardiovascular prevention and hypertension management (Table 4). Moreover, at variance from BPV, most of these novel risk factors have no formal evidence supporting their ability to reclassify risk and are not easily or not at all modifiable in individual patients, while accumulating evidence suggests that specific pharmacological interventions can modify BPV. On such a background the time may thus have finally come to seriously consider use of BPV in clinical practice as an additional BP-related, potentially modifiable risk factor (Table 4).

TABLE 4
Advantages, limitations, and thresholds values of blood pressure variability (BPV)

Because of the lack of some evidence, it is difficult to recommend BPV as a parameter to be used systematically in clinical practice, but BPV is of definite interest. Until specific studies to be carried out, BPV is currently limited to research and specialized centers; but this must not exclude its evaluation in patients with specific characteristics.

### Noninvasive hemodynamic assessment of the effect of mean arterial pressure on the amplitude of pulse pressure [^111SL6tt]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The present study compares the relationships between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP) in young and older men and whether MAP determines age-related changes in PP.

Methods

Impedance cardiography was used to evaluate systemic hemodynamics noninvasively in 189 unmedicated men referred to our hypertension unit. Patients were divided by age according to the median value (< and ≥ 40 years).

Results

In younger patients, increasing supine MAP was associated with a transition in the blood pressure pattern from systolic to diastolic, whereas in older patients, increasing MAP was associated with change from diastolic to systolic hypertension. In young patients elevation in MAP was associated with a parallel decrease in PP (P < .001) and stroke volume index (SVI) (P < .001), whereas in older patients higher MAP was associated with higher PP (P < .001) and PP/SVI ratio (P < .001), a measure of arterial stiffness. When the sample was divided according to the median value of MAP (< and ≥ 101 mm Hg), differences in the age-related change in PP and SVI became apparent. With a lower MAP, changes in PP and SVI remained parallel until the sixth decade, after which they began a progressive dissociation. In contrast, at higher MAP, the dissociation between PP and SVI began two decades earlier, indicating an acceleration of the age-related increase in arterial stiffness. Therefore, the relationship between MAP and PP was negative in younger men at the expense of a decrease in SVI, and positive in older men due to increasing arterial stiffness.

Conclusions

Noninvasive hemodynamic parameters from impedance cardiography provide a useful method to characterize the mechanism of increased blood pressure.

Results

The flowchart demonstrating patient enrollment and group allocation is presented in Fig. 1. The patient recruitment began on 22 March 2016 and was completed by 3 November 2017. The 6-month follow-up of the last patient was completed by 3 May 2018. The baseline characteristics and resuscitation-associated factors were comparable between the groups (Table 1). We observed a clear separation in MAP between the groups, p < 0.001 (Fig. 2). The median (inter-quartile range, IQR) noradrenalin dose used was 0.05 µg/kg/min (IQR 0.02–0.11 µg/kg/min) in the low-normal MAP group and 0.13 µg/kg/min (IQR 0.08–0.20 µg/kg/min) in the high-normal MAP group, p < 0.001.

### Can we reliably use pulse pressure as a surrogate for stroke volume? Physiological background and potential clinical implications for shock resuscitation [^116rcStq]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasoactive drugs

Vasoactive agents also influence the relationship between PP and SV by modifying arterial tone and resistance. Since vasoactive agents are the cornerstone of septic shock resuscitation, their effects on the vascular system are likely superimposed on the underlying pathophysiological alterations caused by septic shock. Interestingly, high doses of norepinephrine (> 0.3 µg/kg/min) partially reversed the vascular decoupling phenomenon in the radial arteries, though not in the femoral arteries, suggesting a regional variation in the drugs effects. Clinical studies also showed that decreasing norepinephrine doses in vasoplegic patients can lead to a reduction in PP, but not in SV, which could be attributed to an increase in arterial compliance. Furthermore, in experimental rat models, phenylephrine infusion increased PP disproportionately compared to SV, with PP rising by 58% while SV increasing by only 21%. These findings were also observed in critically ill patients, in whom introduction or increase in norepinephrine increased peripheral PP by far more than CO. This finding was attributed to the fact that vasopressors alter both arterial compliance and PWA, making PP less correlated to SV than during a fluid challenge.

Arterial line site

The site of arterial catheter may also influence PP recordings. Radial arteries, the most common site for arterial catheters, have smaller diameters and more muscular walls compared to central arteries, which may impair pressure transmission. This effect can be further amplified by vasopressor-induced vasoconstriction, resulting in lower radial SAP and MAP readings. In septic shock patients treated with norepinephrine, Kim et al. reported lower radial compared to femoral MAP (85 vs. 91 mmHg) and PP (62 vs. 65 mmHg). Of note, similar gradients have been observed in cardiac surgery patients, with lower radial MAP and PP compared to femoral measurements (radial MAP: 72 mmHg, radial PP: 38 mmHg; femoral MAP: 76 mmHg, femoral PP: 53 mmHg).

Despite all the confounders (Fig. 2), peripheral PP may still be a promising bedside indicator of SV, which could be particularly important during the early stages of shock resuscitation. A low PP may indicate low SV, often due to hypovolemia or myocardial dysfunction, common features of shock states. Such patients may benefit from early echocardiographic and fluid responsiveness assessment, to guide therapy (i.e. fluid boluses) aiming at restoring tissue perfusion. Conversely, a higher PP may help rule out very low SV, especially when accompanied by low DAP, suggesting vasoplegia as the predominant cause of circulatory dysfunction. In these cases, norepinephrine administration to restore DAP could improve global hemodynamics and tissue perfusion.

### Association of systemic vascular resistance analog and cardiovascular outcomes: the heart and soul study [^114o8WDm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrates the prognostic value of noninvasively estimated SVR in subjects with CHD. The ratio of SBP to LVOT‐VTI, eSVR, provided more robust risk estimation than SBP alone. An elevated eSVR was associated with higher risk of adverse outcomes, including HF, MACE, and all‐cause death. The risk trend of elevated eSVR was consistent, irrespective of age, sex, race, blood pressure, and previous history of HF or diabetes. Furthermore, a persistently elevated eSVR was also associated with a higher risk of adverse events.

Vascular resistance is a factor in maintaining organ perfusion, and the regulation of peripheral vascular resistance occurs at the arteriolar level. Maintenance of normal blood pressure is dependent on the balance between cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance. Prolonged constriction of arterioles is thought to induce structural thickening of the arteriolar walls possibly mediated by angiotensin, leading to an irreversible rise in peripheral resistance. Studies have shown a detrimental impact of increased SVR on cardiovascular risk. Systemic vascular resistance predicts the eventual onset of hypertension in young adults. Increased peripheral resistance is also a feature of chronic heart failure, where it serves as a compensatory mechanism to maintain organ perfusion as stroke volume declines. Fagard et al. demonstrated that exercise SVR added prognostic information about cardiovascular events and total mortality. In line with previous studies, our study indicates that noninvasively estimated eSVR is associated with cardiovascular end points: heart failure admission, MACE, and all‐cause death.

SBP was initially chosen as the basis for arterial resistance analog because our previous study documented the correlation of the ratio of peak mitral regurgitation velocity to LVOT‐VTI as an accurate means calculating invasive SVR. Peak MR jets are closely correlated with SBP (r = 0.43, P < 0.001), but technically adequate peak MR jets are available in only a small percentage of studies. Therefore, we used SBP as a logical substitute for peak MR. Conventionally, SVR is defined as the ratio of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac output. In comparing eSVR from SBP to eSVR from MAP, we found that SBP‐derived eSVR was as predictive of outcome as MAP‐derived eSVR (Table S3). SBP‐derived eSVR is more advantageous than MAP‐derived eSVR in that it is easier to calculate. Clinicians do not need to take an extra step to calculate the MAP beforehand.

### Accuracy and precision of continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring compared with invasive arterial pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113cr8qs]. Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring devices are available for bedside use, but the accuracy and precision of these devices have not been evaluated in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring with invasive arterial pressure monitoring. Random-effects pooled bias and SD of bias for systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure were calculated. Continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring was considered acceptable if pooled estimates of bias and SD were not greater than 5 and 8 mmHg, respectively, as recommended by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.

Results

Twenty-eight studies (919 patients) were included. The overall random-effect pooled bias and SD were -1.6 ± 12.2 mmHg (95% limits of agreement -25.5 to 22.2 mmHg) for systolic arterial pressure, 5.3 ± 8.3 mmHg (-11.0 to 21.6 mmHg) for diastolic arterial pressure, and 3.2 ± 8.4 mmHg (-13.4 to 19.7 mmHg) for mean arterial pressure. In 14 studies focusing on currently commercially available devices, bias and SD were -1.8 ± 12.4 mmHg (-26.2 to 22.5 mmHg) for systolic arterial pressure, 6.0 ± 8.6 mmHg (-10.9 to 22.9 mmHg) for diastolic arterial pressure, and 3.9 ± 8.7 mmHg (-13.1 to 21.0 mmHg) for mean arterial pressure.

Conclusions

The results from this meta-analysis found that inaccuracy and imprecision of continuous noninvasive arterial pressure monitoring devices are larger than what was defined as acceptable. This may have implications for clinical situations where continuous noninvasive arterial pressure is being used for patient care decisions.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^115QEbuE]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — central aortic pressure describes that various techniques allow aortic BP (central BP) to be derived from peripheral BP measurements using dedicated algorithms, and that in hypertensive patients central BP predicts cardiovascular (CV) events with a differential effect of antihypertensive drugs on central compared with brachial BP, although the incremental prognostic value of central vs. conventional clinic BP measurement remains unclear. An exception may be isolated systolic hypertension in the young, in whom peripheral BP may be disproportionately elevated relative to a normal central BP; this occurs in a small fraction of younger people, mainly men with isolated systolic hypertension, and it remains unclear whether such patients are at lower risk than suggested by their brachial office BP.

### Relationship between body mass index and mean arterial pressure in normotensive and chronic hypertensive pregnant women: a prospective, longitudinal study [^113yEcWn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Adjusted BMI effect on MAP (MAP-BMI Model)

The effect of BMI on MAP was obtained by adjusting the previous MAP model for the time-dependent BMI variable. The estimates obtained for the model effects are presented in Table 4. The correlation coefficient (95% CI) between the random effects was estimated to be −0.832 (−0.875, −0.776). The variance-covariance matrix of the within group errors was diagonal with a variance function that was a power of the fitted values; the variance function coefficient (95% CI) was estimated to be −1.740 (−2.300, −1.180).

The interaction between hypertensive status and BMI was not statistically significant (p = 0.275). Adjusting for BMI led to very similar conclusions regarding the time and the hypertension effects on MAP. With respect to the BMI effect, a 1-unit increase in BMI was predicted to produce an increase of 0.21 mmHg in MAP, or equivalently, a 5-unit increase in BMI was predicted to produce an increase of approximately 1 mmHg in the population MAP values (Fig. 5). This effect was independent of time period and hypertensive status; that is, regardless of the time period and hypertensive status, the predicted BMI effect on MAP remained the same.

COVID-19 Data Standards hemodynamic measures define mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure as "The pressure measured by wedging a pulmonary catheter with an inflated balloon into a small pulmonary arterial branch" and note it "May be recorded with or without V-wave". Cardiac output is defined as "The total volume of blood pumped by the heart over a set period of time, conventionally 1 min; it is calculated as heart rate times stroke volume and is additionally dependent on preload and afterload for functional output". Cardiac index is described as "The measure of an individual's cardiac output as divided by their body surface area). This calculation is a useful function to determine an individual's cardiac performance in relation to their body size, providing an overview of global cardiovascular function". Transpulmonary gradient is the "Difference between mean pulmonary artery pressure and mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure". Pulmonary vascular resistance is calculated as "Pulmonary vascular resistance is calculated as (mean PA pressure minus mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) divided by cardiac output" with permissible values "Numeric, Wood units or dynes/s/cm⁵", and is described as "The resistance to blood flow generated by the pulmonary vasculature, which is normally one-sixth of systemic vascular resistance" with the caution that "Prolonged elevated pulmonary vascular resistance can cause right HF". Systemic vascular resistance is calculated as "Systemic vascular resistance is calculated as the systemic mean arterial blood pressure minus right arterial pressure divided by cardiac output" with permissible values "Numeric, dynes/s/cm⁵", and reflects "The resistance to blood flow generated by all systemic vasculature, excluding pulmonary vasculature" where "The major determinant of systemic vascular resistance is arteriolar tone, but blood viscosity and vascular capacitance are also contributing factors". Mixed venous O2 saturation is "Saturation measured via a sample of blood from a pulmonary artery catheter measures the end result of O2 consumption and delivery, used in the ICU as a measure of O2 extraction by the body".
