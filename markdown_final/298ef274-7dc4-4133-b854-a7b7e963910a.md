## Question

Fibrinolytics for retinal detachment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fibrinolytics like tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) have a role or are effective in treating retinal detachment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and standard-of-care management for the different types of retinal detachment. Then, I should verify whether fibrinolytics have any documented role that addresses the mechanism of detachment itself. Next, I will review reports of adjunctive intraocular fibrinolytic use around retinal surgery, assess safety and toxicity, and finally check guidelines to ensure my conclusion is aligned with current standards before I synthesize an answer [^112aXic6] [^114Exqo1].

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism. Retinal detachment (rhegmatogenous, tractional, or exudative) is fundamentally a mechanical separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium, with standard treatments focused on closing retinal breaks, relieving traction, and draining subretinal fluid using pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckle, or pneumatic retinopexy with retinopexy and tamponade, rather than dissolving any fibrin clot or thrombus, which is not the driving pathology of detachment itself [^112aXic6] [^113oLjnF] [^111pq9Ui].

> Wait, let me verify whether fibrinolytics have been used as primary therapy for retinal detachment. I need to check the literature for direct indications. I see reports of intraocular tPA in contexts of ocular hemorrhage — suprachoroidal hemorrhage evacuation, submacular or subretinal hemorrhage displacement, or combined procedures for massive hemorrhagic detachments — but I do not find evidence of fibrinolytics being used to reattach the retina as a standalone treatment for retinal detachment itself, which reinforces a mechanism mismatch [^111xqeHB] [^112jjgz9] [^117XCNWt] [^1153CHBx] [^111fbb1N].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should examine the mechanism carefully. Fibrinolytics degrade fibrin in blood clots, whereas successful retinal detachment repair relies on mechanical retinal reapposition, sealing of breaks with laser or cryotherapy, and stabilization with gas or silicone oil tamponade; pharmacologic vitreolysis agents like ocriplasmin act on vitreoretinal adhesions but are not fibrinolytics and are used for vitreomacular traction or macular holes, not for rhegmatogenous detachment per se, which underscores that clot lysis does not address the core detachment mechanisms [^111pq9Ui] [^114Exqo1] [^116tLdHX] [^112e4ogD] [^113giG4Q].

> I need to check adjunctive scenarios where hemorrhage coexists with detachment. In massive subretinal or submacular hemorrhage, tPA may be used intravitreally or subretinally to liquefy blood and facilitate surgical drainage and displacement; similarly, r-tPA has been described to liquefy suprachoroidal clot to aid evacuation, but in each of these, the reattachment is achieved by the surgical steps (vitrectomy, retinotomy, perfluorocarbon, gas or oil tamponade), not by the fibrinolytic itself, so tPA is an adjunct for hemorrhage management rather than a treatment for detachment [^112jjgz9] [^111xqeHB] [^1153CHBx] [^113guEwT].

> I should confirm safety. Intraocular fibrinolytics can be toxic: intravitreal tenecteplase showed dose-dependent retinal toxicity in rabbits, with necrosis and even tractional detachment at higher doses, emphasizing a narrow safety margin; more broadly, intravitreal injections of various agents carry risks including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment, and pharmacologic vitreolysis can precipitate retinal breaks and detachments, so using fibrinolytics inside the eye without a compelling indication raises avoidable risk [^115Pbcsb] [^117XDoFP] [^112UFm5k] [^115hDvRU] [^1158ahUq] [^113giG4Q] [^116WafqJ].

> Let me double-check guideline direction. Cardiology guidelines reserve fibrinolytics for systemic thrombotic emergencies like STEMI, and hematology guidance on fibrinolytics focuses on managing bleeding in patients exposed to these agents, not on ophthalmic detachment care; contemporary retinal detachment references emphasize surgical approaches and do not endorse fibrinolytics for detachment repair, while exudative detachments are generally managed medically based on the underlying inflammatory or vascular cause rather than with clot lysis, reinforcing that no guideline supports fibrinolytics for retinal detachment [^113gQeUE] [^113L4QdV] [^111DNULh] [^11761eCf] [^111U4Pzq] [^112vR5Mc] [^112aXic6] [^114g5U4L].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could exudative detachment with hemorrhagic components be a niche where fibrinolysis treats the detachment itself? Let me reconsider. Even when submacular hemorrhage is displaced with subretinal tPA, the intervention addresses the blood burden and photoreceptor toxicity rather than the detachment mechanics; persistent or associated retinal detachment still requires definitive surgical or etiologic therapy, so my initial thought conflating hemorrhage treatment with detachment repair was off target here [^117XCNWt] [^1153CHBx] [^112aXic6].

> I will now synthesize. Fibrinolytics are not indicated as treatment for retinal detachment; they do not address the causative mechanics of detachment and entail intraocular risks, though they may occasionally serve as preoperative or intraoperative adjuncts to liquefy hemorrhage that complicates the surgical field, with the detachment itself managed by established surgical methods and retinopexy with tamponade, consistent with current evidence and practice standards [^112aXic6] [^114Exqo1] [^112jjgz9] [^115Pbcsb].

---

Fibrinolytics are **not used for retinal detachment** because the condition is not caused by fibrin clots [^111XcmN9], and there is no evidence that fibrinolytics improve outcomes. The **standard of care is surgical repair** [^114Exqo1] (pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, or pneumatic retinopexy) [^112aXic6]. Fibrinolytics are only used in retinal surgery to liquefy subretinal [^112jjgz9] or suprachoroidal hemorrhage [^111xqeHB] to facilitate drainage, not to treat the detachment itself [^117XCNWt]. They carry risks of intraocular bleeding and retinal toxicity, so their use is limited to specific hemorrhagic complications, not retinal detachment.

---

## Pathophysiology of retinal detachment

Retinal detachment is **classified into three main types** based on underlying mechanisms:

- **Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD)**: Caused by retinal breaks allowing vitreous fluid into the subretinal space, separating the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) [^112aXic6] [^113oLjnF].

- **Tractional retinal detachment (TRD)**: Resulting from vitreoretinal traction due to contracting membranes, commonly seen in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and other proliferative vitreoretinopathies [^112aXic6] [^1139W4Db].

- **Exudative retinal detachment (ERD)**: Caused by accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space due to inflammatory, vascular, or neoplastic conditions [^112aXic6] [^114g5U4L].

The primary goal of retinal detachment management is to **reattach the retina** [^112aXic6] and prevent further vision loss. This is typically achieved through surgical interventions such as pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling [^112J8sFv], or pneumatic retinopexy [^114Exqo1].

---

## Fibrinolytic agents: mechanism of action and clinical applications

Fibrinolytic agents, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase, and streptokinase, act by **converting plasminogen to plasmin**, which subsequently degrades fibrin clots, and are primarily used in clinical settings where fibrin clot dissolution is required, such as acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and ischemic stroke [^111DNULh]; in ophthalmology, fibrinolytic agents have been explored primarily for their ability to **liquefy organized blood clots** in the subretinal [^117XCNWt] or suprachoroidal space [^111xqeHB], facilitating surgical drainage and improving visual outcomes [^112jjgz9].

---

## Evidence for fibrinolytic use in retinal detachment

A comprehensive review of the literature reveals that fibrinolytic agents are **not used as primary treatments for retinal detachment** itself [^112aXic6]. Instead, their use is limited to specific clinical scenarios involving hemorrhagic complications associated with retinal detachment surgery or other retinal conditions.

---

### Subretinal hemorrhage management

Fibrinolytic agents, particularly tPA, have been used to **liquefy subretinal hemorrhages**, facilitating their displacement or drainage during surgical procedures. For example, in cases of massive subretinal hemorrhage associated with retinal detachment, intravitreal or subretinal injection of tPA has been employed [^112jjgz9] to liquefy the clot, allowing for easier surgical removal and potentially improving visual outcomes [^117XCNWt] [^1153CHBx].

---

### Suprachoroidal hemorrhage management

Similarly, fibrinolytic agents have been used to **liquefy organized clots** in the suprachoroidal space, facilitating surgical drainage and reducing intraocular pressure. This approach has been reported in cases of suprachoroidal hemorrhage complicating retinal detachment surgery [^111xqeHB].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications associated with fibrinolytic use

Use of fibrinolytic agents in ophthalmology is associated with several **potential complications**, including:

- **Intraocular hemorrhage**: Increased risk of bleeding due to fibrin clot dissolution [^111U4Pzq].

- **Retinal toxicity**: Potential retinal damage, particularly at higher doses, as demonstrated in animal studies [^115Pbcsb].

- **Endophthalmitis**: Risk of infection associated with intravitreal injections [^112UFm5k].

- **Retinal detachment**: Although rare, fibrinolytic agents have been associated with retinal detachment [^115Pbcsb] as a complication of intravitreal injections [^111ZA3EU] [^115VSCY1].

Given these potential complications, the use of fibrinolytic agents in ophthalmology is carefully considered and typically **reserved for specific clinical scenarios** where the benefits outweigh the risks.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not recommend the routine use** of fibrinolytic agents for the primary treatment of retinal detachment [^112aXic6]. Instead, fibrinolytic agents are reserved for specific clinical scenarios involving hemorrhagic complications, such as subretinal or suprachoroidal hemorrhages, where their use may facilitate surgical management and improve outcomes.

---

## Alternative treatments for retinal detachment

The **standard of care for retinal detachment remains surgical intervention**, including:

- **Pars plana vitrectomy**: Removal of vitreous gel and relief of tractional forces [^111STpYs].

- **Scleral buckling**: External indentation of the sclera to close retinal breaks [^112J8sFv].

- **Pneumatic retinopexy**: Injection of gas bubble to reattach the retina [^111pq9Ui].

These surgical approaches have well-established efficacy and safety profiles and remain the **primary treatment modalities** for retinal detachment [^112aXic6].

---

Fibrinolytic agents are **not used as primary treatments for retinal detachment** [^112aXic6]. Their use is limited to specific clinical scenarios involving hemorrhagic complications, such as subretinal [^117XCNWt] or suprachoroidal hemorrhages, where they may facilitate surgical management [^111xqeHB]. The standard of care for retinal detachment remains surgical intervention, including pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, and pneumatic retinopexy [^114Exqo1].

### Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the treatment of suprachoroidal hemorrhage [^111xqeHB]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Suprachoroidal hemorrhages are a vision-threatening complication, and poor visual outcomes are correlated with increasing hemorrhage complexity. The recommended time for surgical drainage is 10–14 days after the hemorrhage begins to liquefy. We describe a case in which recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA), alteplase, is injected within the suprachoroidal space before surgery to assist in the drainage of an organized clot prior to liquefaction. This technique involves using r-tPA in the intrachoroidal space to target the organized clot of suprachoroidal hemorrhage prior to drainage.

- **Case report**: A 62-year-old male presented 12 days after retinal detachment repair with sudden ocular pain and vision loss following a Valsalva maneuver. Vision was light perception only, and intraocular pressure was 43 mmHg. Diagnosed with hyphema and suprachoroidal hemorrhage, the patient underwent surgery the following day. An injection of r-tPA 100 μg was given intracamerally, and an additional dose of r-tPA 100 μg was injected into the suprachoroidal space prior to surgery. Liquefied by r-tPA, the clot was expressed through the sclerotomies. Best corrected vision in the eye eight months after the drainage procedure was 20/40.

- **Conclusion**: To the author's knowledge, this is the first reported case in which r-tPA was successfully injected in the suprachoroidal space to liquefy and drain a suprachoroidal hemorrhage prior to natural dissolution.

### Pars plana vitrectomy with peripheral retinotomy after injection of preoperative intravitreal tissue plasminogen activator: A modified procedure to drain massive subretinal haemorrhage [^112jjgz9]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to report the outcomes of a modified procedure for draining massive subretinal haemorrhages (SRHs). The methods involved reviewing the charts of eight consecutive eyes from eight patients with massive SRHs extending to the periphery, involving two or more quadrants, with haemorrhagic and bullous retinal detachment. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was injected intravitreally 12–24 hours preoperatively. Vitrectomy was carried out with peripheral retinotomy, drainage of the SRH from the retinotomy using perfluorocarbon liquid, and gas tamponade with prone positioning postoperatively.

The results indicated that preoperative visual acuities ranged from light perception to 20/200. Most of the subretinal haematomas moved postoperatively to the vitreous cavity through the peripheral retinotomy using perfluorocarbon liquid. Residual SRHs were drained from the anterior chamber at the bedside after prone positioning overnight. SRH recurred in one eye 14 months postoperatively and was successfully retreated. No other serious complications developed, and final visual acuity improved in seven eyes, ranging from 20/1000 to 20/60. Polypoidal lesions in choroidal vasculatures were present in three of seven patients.

In conclusion, the technique seems safe and effective for treating massive SRH. However, visual recovery is limited by the underlying macular pathology. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, other than age-related macular degeneration, may be another cause of massive SRHs.

### Retinal detachment [^112aXic6]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2024). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment (RD) occurs when the neurosensory retina, the neurovascular tissue responsible for phototransduction, is separated from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Given the importance of the RPE for optimal retinal function, RD invariably leads to decreased vision. There are three main types of RD: rhegmatogenous, tractional, and exudative (also termed serous) RD.

- **Rhegmatogenous RD**: One or more retinal breaks enable vitreous fluid to enter the subretinal space, separating the neurosensory retina from the RPE.

- **Tractional RD**: Preretinal, intraretinal, or subretinal membranes contract, exerting tangential forces that elevate the retina from the underlying RPE.

- **Exudative RD**: An underlying inflammatory condition, vascular abnormality, or tumor presence causes exudative fluid to accumulate in the subretinal space, exceeding the osmotic pump function of the RPE.

The surgical management of RD usually involves pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, or pneumatic retinopexy. The approach taken often depends on patient characteristics, as well as practitioner experience and clinical judgment. Advances in surgical technology and continued innovation have improved outcomes for many patients. However, even if retinal re-attachment is achieved, some patients still experience decreased vision or other visual symptoms, such as metamorphopsia, that diminish their quality of life. Continued research in the areas of neuroprotection and retinal biology, as well as ongoing surgical innovation, is necessary to enhance therapeutic options.

### Tamponade in the surgical management of retinal detachment [^114Exqo1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite treatment advances, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) can result in poor visual outcomes even with prompt and appropriate therapy. Pars plana vitrectomy is a leading management modality for RD treatment, and it is generally accompanied by the use of internal tamponade. Various gases and silicone oils may yield beneficial outcomes. Heavy silicone oils have been approved in some European nations but are not available in the United States. Different tamponade agents have unique benefits and risks; thus, the choice of the agent should be individualized based on the characteristics of the patient and RD, as well as perioperative and postoperative factors.

### Progress in the management of retinal detachment associated with morning glory syndrome [^111Kndei]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Morning glory syndrome (MGS) is a rare congenital optic disc malformation characterized by a distinctive funnel-shaped optic disc resembling a blooming morning glory flower. It is typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and primarily presents unilaterally, although bilateral cases have been reported. The anomaly features an enlarged optic disc, radiating blood vessels, and surrounding excavation. This results in visual impairment that can range from mild to profound.

The etiology of MGS is not fully understood but has been associated with genetic factors, particularly mutations in the PAX6 and PAX2 genes, which play critical roles in eye development. MGS is often linked with other ocular and systemic anomalies, including retinal detachment, a significant complication that may be exudative, tractional, or rhegmatogenous. Surgical interventions are generally employed to manage these complications, especially retinal detachments, with procedures such as vitrectomy, paraoptic disc laser photocoagulation, and the use of silicone oil or gas tamponade. However, success rates can vary widely.

Long-term outcomes for patients with MGS largely depend on the severity of associated complications and the timing of interventions. While some individuals may attain reasonable visual function post-treatment, others may continue to experience challenges due to the underlying malformation and its consequences. Thus, MGS remains a complex condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach for effective management and enhanced patient outcomes. This emphasizes the need for continued research into its management.

### Intraocular lens implantation after atopic cataract surgery decreases incidence of postoperative retinal detachment [^116bTeVW]. Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in reducing the incidence of postoperative retinal detachment after cataract surgery in patients with atopic dermatitis.

- **Design**: Retrospective review.

- **Participants**: One hundred sixty-nine eyes of 126 patients who underwent cataract surgery for atopic cataract were followed for more than 1 year. None of the eyes previously had a retinal detachment or retinal detachment surgery.

- **Methods**: The eyes were divided into 132 eyes of 95 patients with an IOL implantation (IOL group) and 37 eyes of 31 patients without an IOL implantation (aphakia group). The postoperative visual acuity and incidence of postoperative retinal detachment were compared between the two groups. The effects of the location of the causative retinal breaks, intraoperative posterior capsule rupture, and postoperative posterior capsulotomy on the incidence of retinal detachments were evaluated.

- **Main outcome measures**: The postoperative corrected visual acuity, incidence of postoperative retinal detachment, and influence of intraoperative posterior capsule rupture on the retinal detachment.

- **Results**: The final visual acuity was better than or equal to 20/20 in 128 eyes (97.0%) of the IOL group and in 29 eyes (78.4%) of the aphakia group (P = 0.0007). Retinal detachment after an uncomplicated cataract surgery occurred in 3 eyes (2.3%) of the IOL group and in 8 eyes (25.8%) of the aphakia group (P < 0.0001, Mantel-Cox). Two of 3 eyes (66.7%) in the IOL group and 1 of 8 eyes (16.7%) in the aphakia group that later developed a retinal detachment.

### Treatment of central retinal vein occlusion by vitrectomy with lysis of vitreopapillary and epipapillary adhesions, subretinal peripapillary tissue plasminogen activator injection, and photocoagulation [^111fbb1N]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this interventional case report is to describe a case of subretinal peripapillary tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) injection, combined with vitreopapillary and epipapillary membrane dissection and peripheral photocoagulation, in the treatment of central retinal vein occlusion.

A 79-year-old woman with a history of branch vein occlusion in the left eye presented with visual loss in the right eye for four months, secondary to unresolved central retinal vein occlusion. She underwent vitrectomy in the right eye, which included the lysis of vitreopapillary and epipapillary adhesions, hyaloid separation, subretinal peripapillary tissue tPA injection, peripheral photocoagulation, and air-fluid exchange.

Postoperative results revealed rapid improvement in funduscopic and fluorescein angiographic features of venous obstruction, with a prompt reduction in intraretinal hemorrhages and disk and macular edema. The patient reported subjective improvement in vision in her right eye, although the measured improvement was modest, progressing from finger counting to 20/400.

The conclusion is that subretinal administration of tPA, lysis of adhesions, and endophotocoagulation may be valuable in resolving the obstructive component of selected cases of chronic central retinal vein occlusion associated with vitreopapillary and epipapillary traction.

### Syfovre [^117XDoFP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:

	- **Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments (5.1)**: Intravitreal injections, including those with Syfovre, may be associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering Syfovre to minimize the risk of endophthalmitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately.

	- **Retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion (5.2)**: Retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, typically in the presence of intraocular inflammation, have been reported with the use of Syfovre [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Cases may occur with the first dose of Syfovre and may result in severe vision loss. Discontinue treatment with Syfovre in patients who develop these events. Patients should be instructed to report any change in vision without delay.

	- **Neovascular AMD (5.3)**: In clinical trials, use of Syfovre was associated with increased rates of neovascular (wet) AMD or choroidal neovascularization (12% when administered monthly, 7% when administered every other month, and 3% in the control group) by Month 24. Patients receiving Syfovre should be monitored for signs of neovascular AMD.

### Incidence of retinal detachment associated with atopic dermatitis in Japan: Review of cases from 1992 to 2011 [^1165UY4S]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Ocular complications of atopic dermatitis (AD) include blepharitis, keratoconjunctivitis, keratoconus, iritis, cataract, and retinal detachment. Among these, retinal detachment is the most severe complication, affecting the younger population and significantly impairing their quality of life. Previous single-center or multicenter retrospective studies declared the presence of a large number of retinal detachment patients with AD and an increase in such cases until 1993. The rise in retinal detachment among AD patients was attributed to the marked increase in severely affected AD patients in the late 1980s. However, no further detailed studies on retinal detachment with AD have been reported since the 2000s, leaving the current status of this condition unknown.

The prevalence of adolescent AD markedly increased from 1967 to 1996 in Japan. After 2000, AD therapies improved with the introduction of new therapeutic tools, including topical and systemic calcineurin inhibitors, and a new therapeutic strategy: proactive therapies with topical calcineurin inhibitors and/or corticosteroids. The improvement in AD therapies led to a decrease in the prevalence of AD in 2006 compared to 1993. In Japan, topical tacrolimus therapy is approved as an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with AD. These recent changes in AD therapies might influence the prevalence of retinal detachment associated with AD. Therefore, ophthalmologists, as well as dermatologists, have a great interest in the new trend in retinal detachment associated with AD.

### Tent-shaped retinal detachments in retinopathy of prematurity [^112oJ8ED]. Retina (2006). Low credibility.

Most retinal detachments associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) are radial, segmental, or circumferential, featuring cicatricial extraretinal fibrovascular proliferation (EFP) at the apex of the detachment. This report describes peculiar tent-shaped retinal detachments that developed among eyes with ROP.

- **Methods**: An observational case series consisting of 9 patients and 13 eyes with tent-shaped retinal detachments. Their morphology, clinical baseline, surgical course, and final retinal status were extracted from medical records.

- **Results**: Eight had simple tent-shaped retinal detachments, three had a double tent-shaped retinal detachment, one had a chevron-based retinal detachment, and one had a star-shaped retinal detachment. Each case had a disk-based stalk that extended to the apex of the traction retinal detachment and continued anteriorly; 12 stalks inserted in the retrolental space and 1 terminated in the mid vitreous. Six eyes were stage 4A, two eyes were stage 4B, and five eyes were stage 5. Vitrectomy surgery was performed on 11 eyes. Surgery resulted in retinal attachment in nine eyes, and two retinas remained detached.

- **Conclusion**: Tent-shaped retinal detachments are seen in patients with ROP. A stalk should be sought in the evaluation of these eyes. Vitreous surgery focused on relieving this traction is often successful.

### Supra choroidal buckling in managing myopic vitreoretinal interface disorders: 1-year data [^113nVWVi]. Retina (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy of the supra choroidal buckling procedure using a supra choroidal catheter, a new approach was used in treating myopic vitreomacular interface disorders. This approach is particularly applied in difficult cases of myopic traction maculopathy, with or without macular hole retinal detachment in posterior staphyloma, depending on the concept of indenting the choroid only. This evaluation is based on a 1-year data study.

- **Methods**: A newly developed supra choroidal catheter was used to deliver stabilized, cross-linked, long-acting hyaluronic acid as a filler in the supra choroidal space in the area of the staphyloma, forming a choroidal indenting effect. Before the injection, pars plana vitrectomy was performed without internal limiting membrane peeling to avoid the risk of breaking the roof of foveal detachment in cases of foveoschisis. This indentation procedure was applied to 11 patients with myopic foveoschisis and 12 patients with myopic macular hole retinal detachment, 5 of whom had experienced failed primary repair by vitrectomy before inclusion in this trial. Clinical and optical coherence tomographic evaluations of these patients were conducted over a 1-year follow-up.

- **Results**: Retinal layer restoration was achieved in all 11 eyes with myopic foveoschisis, gradually over a period of 2 to 6 weeks postoperatively. No recurrence over the 12-month follow-up was observed. Visual acuity improved by 1 line or more in 9 eyes (81.8%). Of the 12 eyes with macular hole detachment, 10 (83%) showed closure of the holes in association with the resolution of the detachment; 2 eyes showed resolution of the detachment.

### Retinal toxicity of intravitreal tenecteplase in the rabbit [^115Pbcsb]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

To investigate the retinal toxicity of intravitreal injection of a novel fibrinolytic tenecteplase in rabbit eyes:

- **Methods**: Tenecteplase (25–350 µg in 0.1 mL BSS) was injected into the vitreous cavity of normal rabbit eyes. Control (fellow) eyes received 0.1 mL of BSS. One day, 1 week, and 2 months post-injection, the eyes were examined by slit lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and electroretinography, and then harvested for histopathological examination.

- **Results**: No evidence of retinal toxicity was seen with tenecteplase doses up to and including 50 µg. At a dose of 150 µg, ophthalmoscopy was normal, but histology showed mild retinal damage in the inner nuclear layer, and electroretinography showed a temporary reduction in B-wave amplitude. At doses of 200 µg and above, there was evidence of retinal toxicity on electroretinography, ophthalmoscopy, and histology. Ophthalmoscopic findings included vitreal fibrosis, retinal necrosis, and tractional retinal detachment, and light microscopy revealed necrosis of retinal pigment epithelium and other retinal layers. Damage was centered around the injection site but was more widespread with the higher doses.

- **Conclusion**: A dose of 50 µg tenecteplase appears safe for intravitreal injection in the rabbit. Tenecteplase could have potential applications in the treatment of submacular hemorrhage and retinal vein occlusion.

### Acute coronary syndrome: Diagnosis and initial management [^111DNULh]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically with respect to fibrinolytic therapy, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of fibrinolytics, if not contraindicated, within 120 minutes of symptom onset when PCI is not available. Patients should be transferred after receiving fibrinolytic therapy to a center capable of performing PCI.

### Management of persistent exudative retinal detachment: Exploring etiology and surgical outcomes [^114g5U4L]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Exudative retinal detachment (ERD) is a condition that arises from dysfunction in the retinal pigment epithelium or vascular compromise, leading to the accumulation of subretinal fluid. Potential causes include inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic processes in the choroid or retina. The prognostic outcomes for ERD exhibit significant variability and are strongly influenced by the underlying etiology. Acute, self-resolving etiologies of ERD are associated with a favorable prognosis, while chronic, irreversible etiologies present a poor prognosis.

Medical management is the primary therapeutic approach for ERDs. However, pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) may be warranted in cases of persistent posterior pole involvement that demonstrate resistance to medical treatment. Surgical intervention is typically reserved as a salvage procedure; it plays a crucial role in optimizing visual outcomes or preventing enucleation in advanced presentations of ERD.

The management of ERD exhibits significant variability, with no universally accepted surgical algorithm. The role of vitreoretinal surgery in treating ERD remains a topic of debate within the ophthalmic literature. Existing studies have documented a range of surgical approaches based on the patient's etiology, age, and disease severity. The impaired blood-retinal barrier and increased inflammation in ERD cases may result in the recurrence of subretinal fluid (SRF), proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and ultimately surgical failure. This report aims to present the causes, clinical features, and surgical outcomes of ERD.

### Do patients with retinal artery occlusion need urgent neurologic evaluation [^112jDjvB]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

To describe a framework for logical, immediate action to manage patients with retinal artery occlusion, a literature review and perspective were conducted. The methods included a review of the literature and the author's experience. Since embolism is the most common factor causing retinal artery occlusion, the results highlighted the necessity for immediate evaluation and management of the source of embolism to prevent further episodes. The conclusion emphasizes that the logical, immediate action to manage patients with retinal artery occlusion should involve evaluation of the carotid artery and heart for embolism, fasting lipid levels, and a complete blood count.

### Oct-based interpretation of the vitreomacular interface and indications for pharmacologic vitreolysis [^112e4ogD]. Retina (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to review the role of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the diagnosis and management of vitreomacular disease. It also examines the impact of OCT on the potential uses of ocriplasmin, a new pharmacologic vitreolysis agent recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion.

- **Methods**: Analysis of literature regarding OCT in the diagnosis and management of vitreomacular interface disease.

- **Results**: Posterior vitreous detachment is typically a nonpathologic age-related event. Anomalous posterior vitreous detachment emerges when the vitreous cortex fails to cleanly detach from the macula, optic nerve, or other adherent sites. Focal vitreomacular adhesion is a nonpathologic anatomical designation associated with perifoveal posterior vitreous detachment but normal retinal morphology on OCT. Vitreomacular traction is a pathologic consequence of persistent vitreous attachment with structural disturbance of the macular retina visible on OCT. Full-thickness macular holes are foveal defects continuous through all retinal layers to the retinal pigment epithelium. Vitreomacular traction and macular hole with focal vitreomacular adhesion are indications for pharmacologic vitreolysis.

- **Conclusion**: Noninvasive high-resolution OCT imaging has transformed the understanding of vitreomacular interface disease. Careful evaluation of the vitreomacular interface with OCT has increased in importance with the introduction of ocriplasmin for vitreomacular adhesion associated with symptomatic anatomical retinal changes.

### Vabysmo [^112UFm5k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Adverse reactions associated with Vabysmo encompass several categories.

- **Potentially serious adverse reactions**: The following points summarize these reactions, as detailed in the labeling: hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]; endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]; increase in intraocular pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]; thromboembolic events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]; retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) reported in patients receiving Vabysmo were cataract (15%) and conjunctival hemorrhage (8%).

- **Clinical trials experience**: It is crucial to acknowledge that clinical trial conditions vary widely, and thus, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials for the same or different drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The data below describe the exposure to Vabysmo in 2,567 patients, which constituted the safety population in six Phase 3 studies [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2, 14.3)].

Less common adverse reactions reported in < 1% of the patients treated with Vabysmo included corneal abrasion, eye pruritus, ocular hyperemia, blurred vision, sensation of foreign body, endophthalmitis, conjunctival hyperaemia, reduced visual acuity, transiently reduced visual acuity, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal tear, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

### A paradigm shift in the management approaches of proliferative diabetic retinopathy: Role of anti-VEGF therapy [^1139W4Db]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

**Effect of anti-VEGF on tractional component**: Anti-VEGF agents have been noted to play a significant role when the tractional component of PDR is considered. A TRD is associated with multiplication of fibrous tissue or neovascular growth arising from retinal vasculature. Excessive tractional component occasionally leads to bleeding of intricate new vessels into the vitreous or preretinal space, leading to vitreous/subhyaloid haemorrhage and retinal detachment. If PRP is performed before the development of serious PDR complications, including TRD, the incidence of severe vision loss is reduced by 50%. Additionally, patients with extramacular TRD would require additional PRP to halt the extension of detachment to the macula. In patients affected by PDR with TRD, bevacizumab was injected to prepare prior to surgical intervention. It was noted that in the 38 eyes with PDR that received preoperative bevacizumab, two eyes suffered worsening retinal tractional within 1.5–2 months. In a separate series, worsening of tractional component within 3–31 days (13 days mean) of bevacizumab injection suggested a cause–effect relationship. Studies have thus proved that anti-VEGF agents can lead to worsening of TRD conditions in affected patients or might cause combined rhegmatogenous and tractional detachment.

### Retinal detachment in association with pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome [^115edzb6]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

To review case reports of retinal detachment in women with pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, a Medline search was conducted. This search focused on case reports written in English, Spanish, or Portuguese and published between 1990 and 2010.

The analysis identified a total of 28 cases of retinal detachment. Of these, 15 cases were associated with severe pre-eclampsia, where 3 of these cases likely involved hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. Nine cases were distinctively associated with HELLP syndrome, 2 solely with eclampsia, and another 2 with both HELLP syndrome and eclampsia. A significant 60% of the cases involved nulliparous women, and 4 cases experienced abruptio placentae. Moreover, cesarean delivery was performed in 76% of the incidences. Notably, retinal detachment was bilateral in 89% of the cases, occurring alongside the delivery of the fetus in 96% of incidents. Postpartum, 69% of these retinal detachments were diagnosed. Remarkably, within 2–12 weeks postpartum, with clinical management, all patients achieved complete recovery of vision.

The study concludes that retinal detachment in pre-eclampsia or eclampsia could be linked to HELLP syndrome, suggesting a potential role of microangiopathic hemolysis in the pathophysiology of retinal detachment. Furthermore, this condition may not be directly correlated with the severity of pre-eclampsia. This is due to pre-eclampsia being a complex syndrome, characterized by persistent vasospasms, hemolysis, and hypoalbuminemia, rather than being a condition solely defined by hypertension.

### Parsplana vitrectomy alone versus parsplana vitrectomy combined with phacoemulsification for the treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: a randomized study [^111STpYs]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is a sight-threatening disease initiated by the formation of a retinal break. Surgical management is required once the neurosensory retina separates from the retinal pigment epithelium. The incidence of RRD is reported between 6.3 and 17.9 per 100,000 population. While RRD is more common in adults with myopia or pseudophakic eyes, it can also affect younger patients, especially those with risk factors such as ocular trauma or hereditary ocular abnormalities. Although scleral buckling surgery traditionally plays a role in managing certain types of RRD, there has been a recent trend toward parsplana vitrectomy (PPV) as the primary procedure, potentially due to young surgeons' familiarity with this technique. For phakic RRD, PPV can be performed with or without lens removal, and previous studies have reported advantages and drawbacks for both approaches.

- **Phacovitrectomy (PCV)**: Phacoemulsification combined with PPV is associated with: a) enhanced retinal visualization during posterior segment surgery; b) better access to the vitreous base allowing for more extensive vitrectomy and endolaser treatment, ensuring more extensive gas filling and better tamponade of retinal breaks; and c) reduction of the risk associated with the need for a second surgery, which can be technically challenging due to the lack of vitreous support. However, there are also disadvantages to PCV, such as a) the risk of postoperative refractive errors, particularly in macula-off cases.

### The outcome of surgical management for giant retinal tear more than 180° [^114ZLt57]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Giant retinal tear (GRT) is a full-thickness retinal break extending circumferentially for ≥ 90° (≥ 3 clock hours) of the retina. It is a major and challenging ophthalmological problem with a wide variety of surgical techniques for unfolding and sealing the retinal tear.

Despite improvement in surgical maneuvers and tamponade agents, recurrence of the detachment still occurs due to several factors, such as reopening of the tear, formation of a new tear, or extension of the existing tear due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Furthermore, the surgical procedure is more challenging to reattach the retina when the GRT circumference is more than 180°, as there is a high risk of failure and retinal slippage.

There is a debate about the role of the scleral buckle procedure combined with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) in the surgical management of GRT. While some surgeons consider it a beneficial procedure to help attachment of the retina because it minimizes vitreoretinal tractional forces, others consider it a real cause of posterior retinal slippage due to its role in changing ocular contour and scleral shortening relative to the retina. Alternatively, some surgeons consider it only in recurrent cases.

In the study herein, the author studied the safety and efficacy of combined PPV, encircling scleral buckle, 360° laser retinopexy, and postoperative silicone oil tamponade in the management of GRT more than 180°.

### Anatomic and visual outcomes of scleral buckle in primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the era of pars plana vitrectomy [^112J8sFv]. Journal of Vitreoretinal Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

To determine the presenting clinical characteristics of patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) who underwent scleral buckling and the impact on final visual outcomes, as well as to determine the postoperative primary attachment rate, complications, and subsequent management:

- **Methods**: This retrospective observational study comprised patients with RRD who had scleral buckling surgery from January 2016 to December 2021, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months.

- **Results**: The study comprised 307 eyes of 290 patients; 97% of eyes were phakic. Primary anatomic attachment was achieved in 93% of eyes. Macula-on detachment had a significant relationship with visual gain, while age, refractive status, number of breaks, configuration of the detachment, traumatic etiology, and lens status did not. Eyes with redetachment did not have a significant visual gain after subsequent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Most eyes that underwent scleral buckling were phakic, and macular status played a significant role in the visual prognosis. The primary anatomic attachment rate after scleral buckling surgery is comparable to that after PPV. Thus, scleral buckling is far from being a procedure of the past. Multiple breaks, inferior detachments, and traumatic etiology do not appear to adversely affect the visual outcomes. Multiple vitreoretinal surgeries may not result in visual gain in cases of redetachment.

### Long-term outcomes of total exudative retinal detachments in stage 3B Coats disease [^113gEHUQ]. Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of treating total exudative retinal detachments (ERDs) secondary to Coats disease (stage 3B) and to assess the role of vitrectomy in management.

This research was designed as a retrospective, observational case series, involving a total of 16 eyes in 16 patients who underwent treatment for total ERDs secondary to Coats disease, with at least 5 years of follow-up.

- **Methods**: We reviewed the records of patients diagnosed with stage 3B Coats disease. The study recorded interventions, including the timing of vitrectomy if it was employed, along with the clinical course of each patient.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome measures included visual acuity at the most recent appointment, progression to neovascular glaucoma (NVG) or phthisis bulbi, and the need for enucleation.

- **Results**: All patients underwent ablative treatment, either photocoagulation or cryotherapy. Of these, 8 patients had scleral buckling (SB) and 6 had external drainage of subretinal fluid (XD). Among the 12 patients who had pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), 8 underwent early vitrectomy (EV) within the first year post-presentation, and 4 out of 8 in the expectant management group received late vitrectomy — on average 4.3 years after presentation — for significant traction retinal detachment (TRD). The remaining 4 patients in the expectant management group did not require vitrectomy. The mean follow-up duration was 9.5 years. At the last follow-up, 50% of patients had no light perception or only light perception vision, which was consistent across subgroups that underwent early vitrectomy (4/8), late vitrectomy (2/4), or no PPV (2/4). A total of 4 out of 16 patients experienced progression to NVG.

### Ocriplasmin for pharmacologic vitreolysis [^116tLdHX]. Retina (2012). Low credibility.

The vitreous may play an important role in the pathogenesis of various retinal disorders. Pharmacologic vitreolysis uses intravitreal pharmacologic agents to provide liquefaction of the vitreous and complete vitreoretinal separation. Ocriplasmin, a genetically engineered version of plasmin, has been shown in clinical trials to safely release vitreomacular adhesion and close Stage 2 macular holes in a significant number of patients.

Advancements in the development of this safe and effective method of vitreolysis have provided an alternative, nonsurgical treatment option to physicians who manage these patients. A roundtable of clinical investigators convened to discuss and summarize recent progress in pharmacologic vitreolysis. Preclinical studies, along with efficacy and safety data from controlled clinical trials of ocriplasmin, were presented and discussed. Case studies were then presented, providing an opportunity for experts to reveal their specific thoughts regarding ocriplasmin for the treatment of vitreomacular adhesion and resulting vitreomacular traction and macular holes, based on their own interpretation of clinical data and experience.

### Proliferative vitreoretinopathy: A revised concept of retinal injury and response [^111XcmN9]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Low credibility.

Previous concepts for the pathogenesis of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) have focused solely on the central role of retinal pigment epithelium cells, potentially contributing to the lack of clinical advances. More recent studies have demonstrated the essential role of retinal glial cells in the PVR healing response but have failed to identify a consistent triggering mechanism. We propose a revised concept for the pathogenesis of PVR based on retinal injury and response.

A posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is invariably present in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and PVR. There is evidence to suggest that the shearing forces of acute PVD can cause mechanical injury to the inner retina and trigger a subsequent intraretinal glial healing response. This response is characterized by subclinical glial cell activation and proliferation, which may then be amplified into full-blown PVR by coexisting pathology such as retinal breaks and detachment.

- **Factors influencing interface pathology**: Whether a PVD causes interface pathology depends on the plane of separation of the posterior vitreous and areas of increased vitreoretinal adhesions. If the vitreous separates in a plane or location that damages the inner retina, glial cell activation and proliferation are likely to develop. The severity of the subclinical inner retinal damage may represent one of the missing links in our understanding of the pathogenesis of PVR and could explain many of the findings encountered in clinical practice.

Controlling the process of acute PVD and the subsequent intraretinal response may be essential in the prevention and management of PVR.

### Intraocular foreign bodies extracted by pars plana vitrectomy: Clinical characteristics, management, outcomes and prognostic factors [^114xn6Aa]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

We identified two factors that were significantly associated with a worse outcome in our series: retinal detachment upon presentation and large intraocular foreign bodies (IOFB). The extensive retinal and choroidal lesions produced by large IOFBs induced the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), eventually leading to loss of vision. Given the poor outcomes associated especially with IOFBs larger than 3 mm, eye protection should play a major role in preventing this disability affecting young people.

### A paradigm shift in the management approaches of proliferative diabetic retinopathy: Role of anti-VEGF therapy [^1155fydR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is considered one of the leading causes of vision loss globally. It principally causes upregulation of pro-angiogenic, pro-inflammatory, and vascular permeability factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), leading to neovascularisation. The advanced stage of DR, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), is of more concern as it leads to vitreous hemorrhage and traction retinal detachment. Various risk factors associated with PDR include hyperglycemia, hypertension, neuropathy, dyslipidemia, anemia, nephropathy, and retinal complications from drugs used for diabetes. Management approaches for PDR have been stratified and involve pan-retinal photocoagulation, vitrectomy, and anti-VEGF agents. Given the emerging role of anti-VEGF agents as a favorable adjunct or alternative therapy, they have a critical role in the management of PDR. The review emphasizes management approaches for PDR, focusing on anti-VEGF therapy. It also highlights the risk/benefit evaluation of the various approaches employed for PDR management in various clinical scenarios.

### Subretinal injection of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and gas tamponade to displace acute submacular haemorrhages secondary to age-related macular degeneration [^1153CHBx]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

This study included 25 eyes of 25 consecutive patients referred to our unit due to SMH secondary to neovascular AMD. In 13 eyes (52%), SMH was the first clinical manifestation of age-related maculopathy (with diagnostic confirmation after primary vitrectomy), while in 12 eyes (48%), it occurred during the standard course of treatment with anti-VEGF. Only two (8%) eyes showed mild vitreous haemorrhage at presentation that did not preclude the scheduled preoperative exams for proper assessment of the SMH characteristics; for these reasons, all patients were offered PPV with subretinal injection of rtPA.

The mean time from symptoms to surgery was 9.24 ± 3.37 days, ranging from three to 14 days (95% CI = 7.85–10.63). Antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy was suspended or replaced in time, according to the cardiologist's indications in five (20%) and six (24%) patients, respectively, before proceeding with the scheduled surgery. Combined phacoemulsification with the PPV was performed in 17 eyes (68%). Surgery was accomplished without intraoperative complications in all cases.

- **Primary outcome**: The mean ± SD preoperative SMH area at presentation was 68.34 ± 42.42 mm² and ranged from 10.49 to 170 mm² (95% CI = 51.24–85.43). Successful displacement of the SMH was obtained in 25 out of 25 eyes (100%) one month after surgery. A complete and partial displacement was obtained in 15 (60%) and 10 (40%) cases, respectively.

### Subretinal tissue plasminogen activator in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy-related submacular haemorrhage and exudative retinal detachment [^113guEwT]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

This report highlights the successful management of a large submacular haemorrhage associated with idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy in a woman in her late 50s who presented with sudden vision loss in her left eye. Multilayered haemorrhages involving the macula were confirmed through funduscopy and swept-source optical coherence tomography. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal recombinant tissue plasminogen activator injection, fluid-gas exchange with sulphur hexafluoride, and intravitreal ranibizumab, followed by prone positioning postoperatively. At 1 week, significant resolution of subretinal haemorrhage and improvement in exudative retinal detachment were observed. By 3 months, best-corrected visual acuity improved to 20/60, with consolidation of the haemorrhage and shrinkage of the pigment epithelial detachment.

### The prognostic influence of chronicity of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment on anatomic success after reattachment surgery [^11527jFk]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate anatomic success after surgery for chronic retinal detachment.

- **Design**: Retrospective, case series review.

- **Methods**: The surgical outcomes of reattachment surgery for 36 eyes of 35 patients with chronic retinal detachments are reported and compared with the outcomes for 129 fresh retinal detachments.

- **Results**: After exclusion of retinal detachments secondary to retinal dialysis and of cases with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), success following a single procedure was observed in eight of 14 (57.1%) chronic retinal detachments compared to 92 of 107 (86.0%) fresh retinal detachments (P = 0.0161).

- **Conclusions**: Chronicity of retinal detachment at presentation is an important and poor prognostic indicator for reattachment surgery.

### Optimal management of idiopathic macular holes [^113giG4Q]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Paradoxically, the incidence of retinal breaks and detachments was lower in the OCP group than in the placebo group (1.9% versus 4.3%, respectively) in the Phase III trials. In both groups, the majority of retinal tears and detachments were noted during or shortly after vitrectomy.

Since the launch, a further 17 cases (0.4%) of retinal tears and/or breaks have been reported separately from vitrectomy surgery, as might be expected with the creation of vitreous separation. The mean time to onset of these cases has been reported as 20 days (range 8–68 days).

OCP is a new treatment option for small- and medium-sized idiopathic macular holes (IMH) with vitreomacular adhesion (VMA), although its exact clinical role is evolving. Its cost is greater than vitrectomy surgery in some health care systems. It is important to counsel patients realistically regarding the rates of success with intravitreal OCP, which are much lower than with vitrectomy surgery, particularly in medium-sized holes. It should not be used in large holes. Further factors predicting success in individual cases are needed to refine its optimal use.

The incidence and characteristics of adverse events (AEs) have been generally similar between the pre-marketing and post-marketing periods, although more experience will be needed to assess the long-term morbidity in some patients, particularly those with photoreceptor dysfunction and visual loss. In patients treated with OCP, careful monitoring and immediate evaluation of any symptomatic patient are paramount. Surgical treatment should not be delayed if closure does not occur by 4 weeks post-OCP.

### Incidence of retinal detachment associated with atopic dermatitis in Japan: Review of cases from 1992 to 2011 [^114Egq87]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Annual changes in the number of surgically treated retinal detachments with AD**: The number of retinal detachments with atopic dermatitis (AD) and the total number of retinal detachments are described in Figure 1. No apparent change was observed in the annual number of the total retinal detachments for these 20 years. In contrast, the number of retinal detachments with AD rapidly increased from 1992 to 1995 and continued until 2001. After 2001, it decreased gradually. Especially, no retinal detachment with AD was treated in 2010. Because of no apparent change in total retinal detachments, the rate of retinal detachment with AD in the total retinal detachment also increased from 1992, and it tapered in the 2000s.

- **First visit AD patients**: The number of new AD outpatients in our dermatology clinic linearly decreased during these 19 years, from 153 cases in 1993 to 65 cases in 2011. Their average age gradually increased during the study period, with a mean age of 19.41 years old in 1993 and 24.94 years old in 2011.

### Retinal vein thrombosis: The internist's role in the etiologic and therapeutic management [^111QfE8K]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Retinal vein occlusion is a common and important cause of vision loss. In general, knowledge about this condition is scant within an internist's practice; however, the condition is relevant because of its association with other chronic ailments. A diagnosis of retinal vein occlusion should prompt the investigation of conditions needing chronic management in these patients. In this review, we summarize the clinical presentation of retinal vein occlusion, its classification, associated risk factors, and treatment focused on the internist's scope of practice.

### Retinal detachment associated with AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis: Risk factors in a resource-limited setting [^112Emx6N]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study is to determine the risk factors predictive of retinal detachment in patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in a setting with limited access to ophthalmic care.

This case-control study involved sixty-four patients with CMV retinitis and retinal detachment, identified from the Ocular Infectious Diseases and Retina Clinics at Chiang Mai University. Three control patients with CMV retinitis but no retinal detachment were selected for each case, matched by calendar date. Medical records were reviewed to record patient-level and eye-level features for clinic visits used to match cases and controls, as well as for the initial clinic visit at which CMV retinitis was diagnosed. Risk factors for retinal detachment were assessed separately for each of these time points using multivariate conditional logistic regression models that included one eye from each patient.

The results showed that patients with retinal detachment were more likely than controls to have low visual acuity (odds ratio [OR] 1.24 per line of worse vision on the logMAR scale; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.33) and bilateral disease (OR 2.12; 95% CI 0.92–4.90). Features present at the time of the initial diagnosis of CMV retinitis that predicted subsequent retinal detachment included bilateral disease (OR 2.68; 95% CI 1.18–6.08) and lesion size (OR 2.64 per 10% increase in lesion size; 95% CI 1.41–4.94).

In conclusion, bilateral CMV retinitis and larger lesion sizes, each of which is a marker of advanced disease, were associated with subsequent retinal detachment.

### Effect of prophylactic 360° laser treatment for prevention of retinal detachment after phacovitrectomy: Prophylactic 360° laser treatment for prevention of retinal detachment [^113rWAyw]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment is one of the most severe complications following vitrectomy. The incidence of retinal detachment after vitrectomy is 6–8% in epi-retinal membrane (ERM) cases, 6% in branch retinal vein occlusion cases, and varies between 0–11% in macular hole (MH) cases. Retinal detachment may be attributable to the surgical technique and can be affected by how much of the peripheral vitreous remained in MH cases. The presence of a gas bubble in an incompletely vitrectomized eye can induce traction on the peripheral retina, leading to the formation of peripheral breaks and retinal detachment.

Due to the vision-threatening nature of this complication, many attempts have been made to prevent retinal detachment. These include careful peripheral retinal examination with scleral depression, properly treating retinal breaks at the end of the vitrectomy, and even prophylactic scleral buckling or cryopexy. Combined vitrectomy and phacoemulsification (phacovitrectomy) surgery has several advantages that can prevent retinal re-detachment. Phacoemulsification surgery results in a more complete vitrectomy, the possibility of a more efficient scleral depression, and an entry site that is more anterior, thus reducing the risk of entry site complications.

However, in our experience, even with the many advantages of the combined phacovitrectomy surgery, retinal detachment following surgery could not be completely prevented. Therefore, it would be beneficial if an alternative, less invasive management strategy was feasible. The incidence of retinal re-detachment was reduced by 50%.

### Incidence, mechanism and outcomes of schisis retinal detachments revealed through a prospective population-based study [^116pEdQj]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, presentation, and outcomes of progressive sight-threatening retinal detachment (RD) complicating degenerative retinoschisis.

- **Methods**: We conducted the first prospective population-based epidemiological study of progressive schisis detachment over a 1-year period (2014–2015) in the UK. Case ascertainment was via monthly British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit reporting cards sent to all ophthalmologists in the UK. For each reported case, data were collected using incident and 6-month follow-up questionnaires to gather information, including demographic details, presenting symptoms, retinal findings, primary management, primary outcome, secondary management, and secondary outcome.

- **Results**: Fifty-five cases of progressive schisis RD were identified, with a similar age distribution to conventional rhegmatogenous RD (mean age 64.0 years, range 20–88), and a male-to-female ratio of 2.3:1. The locations of schisis detachments were predominantly supratemporal (46.7%) and infratemporal (35.6%). At least 70% of schisis RD were associated with posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) at presentation, and 21% with grade B-C proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Primary management consisted of pars plana vitrectomy (82%), scleral buckle (9%), observation (4%), laser (2%), and combined vitrectomy-buckle (2%). The primary reattachment rate was 70%. The final reattachment rate was 87% with a mean best-corrected visual acuity of 0.49 Decimal (SD 0.34) for fovea-on and 0.42 Decimal (SD 0.29) for fovea-off schisis detachments at a mean follow-up of 8.7 months (SE 1.0).

- **Conclusions**: The estimated incidence, mechanisms, and outcomes of schisis retinal detachments unveiled important insights into effective management strategies.

This comprehensive study provides valuable data on the disease's manifestations and therapeutic approaches.

### Effect of prophylactic 360° laser treatment for prevention of retinal detachment after phacovitrectomy: (Prophylactic 360° laser treatment for prevention of retinal detachment) [^1111zqXS]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

The incidence of retinal detachment was analyzed in this study. The 360° laser group showed a significant reduction, with 0% (0/77 eyes) of retinal re-detachment after vitrectomy at 12 months following surgery for the MH cases compared to the control group, which had an incidence rate of 5.7% (2/35 eyes). One eye in the control group developed a new retinal break corresponding to the sclerotomy site, and another developed a new break in the inferonasal quadrant, unrelated to the sclerotomy.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated a significantly higher rate of retinal detachment in the control group compared to the 360° laser group (p = 0.035). Postoperative retinal detachment occurred in 5.9% of the control group; three eyes developed new breaks unrelated to the sclerotomy, and 13 eyes had retinal detachment due to the re-opening of causative breaks because of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. In the 360° laser group, the incidence was 1.9%, with two cases of retinal detachment due to re-opening caused by proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Importantly, the retina's areas treated with 360° laser retinopexy did not re-detach, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.092).

Notably, no patients experienced retinal re-detachment beyond 2 months post-surgery in either group. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated no significant differences in RRD cases between the two groups (p > 0.05).

### Incidence of retinal detachment associated with atopic dermatitis in Japan: Review of cases from 1992 to 2011 [^115uDbv3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment is a serious eye disease that impairs the quality of life of patients, and a significant increase in cases of retinal detachment in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) was reported in the 1990s. With advances in the understanding of AD pathogenesis and improvements in therapies, the prognosis for severely affected AD patients has improved. To understand the recent changes in the prevalence of retinal detachment, both with and without AD, we investigated surgically treated patients with retinal detachment over the past 20 years at our hospital.

Reported retinal detachment cases associated with AD are often characterized by common bilateral involvement and a younger age of onset compared to cases without AD. The causative break is frequently located in the peripheral ocular fundus, with the ciliary epithelium found to be detached in many instances. These characteristics were also observed in the present study. Furthermore, the present results demonstrated that postoperative visual functions in AD patients were better than those in non-AD patients. These findings may result from the younger age and higher ratio of preoperative macular attachment in the affected eyes of AD patients compared to non-AD patients. Despite the higher ratio of preoperative macular attachment in the AD group, there was no significant difference in preoperative best-corrected visual acuity between the AD and non-AD groups. This discrepancy might be due to the higher ratio of preoperative cataracts in AD patients.

### Progress in the management of retinal detachment associated with morning glory syndrome [^111DM1Qi]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Low credibility.

Morning glory syndrome (MGS) is a rare congenital optic disc malformation characterized by a distinctive funnel-shaped optic disc resembling a blooming morning glory flower, typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and primarily presenting unilaterally, although bilateral cases have been reported. The anomaly features an enlarged optic disc, radiating blood vessels, and surrounding excavation, leading to visual impairment that can range from mild to profound. The etiology of MGS is not fully understood but has been associated with genetic factors, particularly mutations in the PAX6 and PAX2 genes, which play critical roles in eye development. MGS is often linked with other ocular and systemic anomalies, including retinal detachment, a significant complication that may be exudative, tractional, or rhegmatogenous.

Surgical interventions are generally employed to manage complications, especially retinal detachments, with procedures such as vitrectomy, paraoptic disc laser photocoagulation, and the use of silicone oil or gas tamponade, though success rates can vary widely. Long-term outcomes for patients with MGS largely depend on the severity of associated complications and the timing of interventions. While some individuals may attain reasonable visual function post-treatment, others may continue to experience challenges due to the underlying malformation and its consequences. Thus, MGS remains a complex condition requiring a multidisciplinary approach for effective management and enhanced patient outcomes, emphasizing the need for continued research into its genetic underpinnings and innovative treatment solutions.

### Peripheral sea-fan retinal neovascularization as a manifestation of chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and surgical management [^116Mr3Pc]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is a rare form of retinal detachment, with estimated prevalence ranging between 4.5% and 29%. This variation between studies is attributed to the different criteria selected in each study. Young age, myopic refraction, inferior position of detachment, and the presence of small atrophic holes are considered the main risk factors for the appearance of chronic, asymptomatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. In rare cases, they are combined with the presence of retinal microcysts and retinal neovascularization.

Sea fan neovascularization is the hallmark of sickle cell retinopathy, but it is also reported in medical conditions such as thrombocytosis, sarcoidosis, and retinitis pigmentosa. In the literature, this pattern of neovascularization has been very rarely associated with chronic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Thus, it should be differentiated from a non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with secondary neovascularization (such as Coats disease, peripheral retinoschisis, retinopathy of prematurity, familial exudative vitreoretinopathy) or a tractional retinal detachment associated with diseases secondary to Eales disease or diabetic retinopathy. Bonet, in 1987, presented nine eyes with peripheral neovascularization attributed to chronic retinal detachment. In all described cases, the "neovascular formations were located just posterior to the retinal holes and in the close vicinity of the retinal holes", in contrast to our case where the neovascularization was located in the inferior detached retina.

### Management of subretinal macular haemorrhage by direct administration of tissue plasminogen activator [^117XCNWt]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent studies on the treatment of acute subretinal macular haemorrhage have demonstrated that both the volume of the clot and the time to evacuation are strong prognostic factors for visual outcomes. A novel surgical technique for the evacuation of these lesions involves the direct injection of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) into the haematoma using pars plana vitrectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of this recently described procedure.

Seventeen consecutive patients with subretinal macular haemorrhages caused by age-related macular degeneration were enrolled. Patient demographics, acuities, and fluorescein angiograms were obtained for all evaluations. All patients underwent a complete three-port pars plana vitrectomy to enable direct cannulation of the subretinal space and injection of 48 µg of t-PA, followed by partial fluid-air exchange. Postoperatively, patients were positioned face-up and supine for one hour, followed by upright positioning overnight.

The results indicated that 88% of patients experienced stabilization or improvement of visual acuity. Nine patients had total clearing of the macular haemorrhage, while eight showed subtotal clearing. Two patients experienced a recurrence of the haemorrhage after the procedure, and one patient required repair for retinal detachment. Occult lesions demonstrated outcomes similar to classic or predominately classic lesions. Nine patients did not require additional therapy for subfoveal neovascularization after the study.

This study represents one of the largest case series at the time of writing, showing that direct injection of subretinal t-PA with pars plana vitrectomy can be an effective treatment for subretinal macular haemorrhage.

### Dramatic recovery of vision in patient with acute central retinal artery occlusion treated with local intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator [^1142ecxJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a devastating disease resulting in severe visual loss in most cases. It has no proven treatment, and a variety of management options used clinically all have a dismal rate of success. We report the outcome of treatment with local intra-arterial thrombolysis administered 2.75 hours after devastating visual loss from incomplete CRAO.

### Vabysmo [^115VSCY1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments**: Intravitreal injections, including Vabysmo, have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering Vabysmo. Patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay to permit prompt and appropriate management [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

- **Increase in intraocular pressure**: Transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been observed within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection, including with Vabysmo [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. IOP and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

- **Thromboembolic events**: Although there was a low rate of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) observed in the Vabysmo clinical trials, there is a potential risk of ATEs following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors. ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or vascular death (including deaths of unknown cause). The incidence of reported ATEs in the nAMD studies during the first year was 1% (7 out of 664) in patients treated with Vabysmo compared with 1% (6 out of 662) in patients treated with aflibercept [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The incidence of reported ATEs in the DME studies from baseline to week 100 was 5% (64 out of 1,262) in patients treated with Vabysmo compared with 5% (32 out of 625).

### The effects of a treatment combination of anti-VEGF injections, laser coagulation and cryotherapy on patients with type 3 Coat's disease [^116Yd1eC]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

In this study, we chose the retinal detachment height of the macula as an important parameter of drug efficacy because the macular center is easy to locate and observe by OCT. The retinal detachment of all patients was significantly lower after IVR (p = 0.000). Although most Coats' disease cases show peripheral retinal vascular lesions, we observed cases with peripheral retinal shallow detachment in this study after IVR and laser treatment. However, retinal cryotherapy can easily be performed in these cases because of the reduction in retinal detachment.

The results of this study showed that 7 (41.18%) patients had improved visual acuity after IVR treatment because ranibizumab treatment could help the exudation under the macular area to absorb rapidly and decreased the macular thickness, and the patient's visual function can be effectively preserved using this approach. However, the visual acuity of patients without exudation of cholesterol crystals under the macular area could be improved after IVR, while the visual acuity in patients with cholesterol crystals deposited in the macular area was not significantly improved.

Although VEGF expression was detected in the vitreous and subretinal fluid in patients with severe retinal detachment, there have been few reports of neovascularization, and evidence of neovascularization was not observed with retinal angiography.

In our study, two patients with total retinal detachment showed complete improvement after IVR alone (Fig 3). Moreover, we found that the more severe the retinal detachment, the better the improvement after treatment; however, details of the outcomes for extremely severe cases were not fully captured in the study.

### Evaluation and management of suspected retinal detachment [^1113cD7j]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Retinal detachment often is a preventable cause of vision loss. There are three types of retinal detachments: exudative, tractional, and rhegmatogenous. The most common type is rhegmatogenous, which results from retinal breaks caused by vitreoretinal traction. Risk factors for retinal detachment include advancing age, previous cataract surgery, myopia, and trauma. Patients typically present with symptoms such as light flashes, floaters, peripheral visual field loss, and blurred vision. Early intervention facilitates prevention of retinal detachment after the formation of retinal breaks and improves visual outcomes of retinal detachment surgery. Patients with an acute onset of flashes or floaters should be referred to an ophthalmologist.

### Pneumatic retinopexy for retinal detachment associated with severe choroidal detachment [^116kZmtG]. Retina (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of pneumatic retinopexy as an initial management strategy for retinal detachment associated with hypotony, severe choroidal detachment, and vitritis.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective, interventional, non-comparative case series. We included nine eyes from nine patients (six women and three men) with retinal detachment associated with hypotony, severe choroidal detachment, and vitritis. These patients were managed with pneumatic retinopexy (either SF6 or C3F8) as their initial management between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2007.

- **Results**: Hypotony and choroidal detachment improved rapidly and significantly 1 to 3 days after pneumatic retinopexy in all patients. The extent of retinal detachment decreased in five patients. After vitreoretinal surgery, these five patients had attached retinas. A complete reattachment of the retina was noted in four patients after pneumatic retinopexy. Two of these patients did not require further surgery because the entire retina remained attached at 6 months and 16 months postoperatively.

- **Conclusion**: Pneumatic retinopexy is a useful initial procedure in managing retinal detachment associated with hypotony, severe choroidal detachment, and vitritis. By rapidly resolving hypotony and choroidal detachments, it facilitates subsequent surgical repair of this complicated retinal detachment. Additionally, complete retinal reattachment after pneumatic retinopexy alone was initially achieved in 33% of eyes.

### Izervay [^1158ahUq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:

	- **Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments (5.1)**: Intravitreal injections may be associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Proper aseptic injection techniques must always be used when administering Izervay to minimize the risk of endophthalmitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay to permit prompt and appropriate management [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

	- **Neovascular AMD (5.2)**: In the GATHER1 and GATHER2 clinical trials, the use of Izervay was associated with increased rates of neovascular (wet) AMD or choroidal neovascularization (7% when administered monthly and 4% in the sham group) by month 12. Over 24 months, the rate of neovascular (wet) AMD or choroidal neovascularization in the GATHER2 trial was 12% in the Izervay group and 9% in the sham group. Patients receiving Izervay should be monitored for signs of neovascular AMD.

	- **Increase in intraocular pressure (5.3)**: Transient increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) have been observed after an intravitreal injection, including with Izervay [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored following the injection and managed as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Ocular ultrasonography focused on the posterior eye segment: What radiologists should know [^113oLjnF]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

- **Retinal pathology**: Retinal detachment refers to the separation of the inner sensory layer of the retina from the outer pigmented layer. Retinal detachments are classified into three types, depending on the underlying mechanism:

- **Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment**: Results from a retinal tear.
- **Tractional retinal detachment**: Results from vitreoretinal traction due to contracting membranes.
- **Exudative retinal detachment**: Results from blood, exudative fluid, or a lesion in the subretinal space.

Detachment is classified as total, partial, or focal, depending on its extension. On ultrasound, a total retinal detachment appears as a "V" shape in the vitreous cavity, because the retina remains firmly attached to the ora serrata anteriorly and to the optic nerve head posteriorly. In partial detachment, a linear echogenic membrane can be seen, usually extending to the optic nerve head but not across it. The point of fixation at the optic nerve head is a useful feature for differentiating between retinal detachment and vitreous membrane. Retinal detachment is sometimes associated with subretinal haemorrhage. In the acute setting, the retinal leaves look thin and mobile on dynamic scanning, whereas chronic detachments display thicker, echogenic leaves that are not mobile on dynamic examination. Chronic detachment is often seen as a rigid "triangle sign". Eventually, cysts may form within the retinal leaves in long-standing retinal detachment.

### Tamponade in the surgical management of retinal detachment [^111pq9Ui]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Intraocular tamponade for retinal detachment: Intraocular tamponade is essential in the surgical management of retinal detachment (RD). "Tamponade" refers to a plug or tent inserted tightly into a wound or orifice to arrest hemorrhage. In RD surgeries, tamponade agents apply surface tension across retinal breaks to prevent fluid flow into the subretinal space until retinopexy (photocoagulation or cryopexy) seals it permanently. Although surgeons may colloquially describe this process as "pushing the retina back into position", this is generally incorrect. The most commonly used tamponade agents are gases and silicone oils.

- **History of tamponade in retinal detachment surgery**: The concept of using tamponade agents in RD treatment originated in 1911 with Ohm, who successfully treated two patients using intravitreal injection of sterile air. Though he did not use the term "tamponade", his work laid the foundation for later developments. Gonin recognized the importance of retinal breaks in RD pathogenesis, and in 1938, Rosengren reported using air successfully with the term "tamponade". In 1962, Cibis et al. introduced "liquid silicone" for RD management without referring to "tamponade" by name.

Use of inert expansile gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆) began in managing pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumothorax due to its longevity compared to air. By the early 1970s, its applicability as a vitreous substitute was reported by Norton.

### Analysis of posterior vitreous detachment and development of complications using a large database of retina specialists [^116WafqJ]. Ophthalmology Retina (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the incidence of complications after posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) through an extended follow-up period and to identify patient-specific factors associated with a greater incidence of complications.

- **Design**: Multicenter, retrospective observational study.

- **Participants**: Eyes with acute PVDs between 2015 and 2019 were identified through the Vestrum Health database.

- **Methods**: Complications, including vitreous hemorrhage, retinal break, and retinal detachment, were evaluated after acute PVD at presentation and throughout the 6-month follow-up period.

- **Main outcome measures**: Rate of complications throughout the 6-month follow-up period after PVD and odds of complications by patient-specific factors.

- **Results**: A total of 9635 eyes were included. The rate of any complication was 25.0%, isolated vitreous hemorrhage was 13.1%, retinal breaks without detachment were 16.0%, and retinal detachment was 4.2%. The majority of each complication was noted at presentation; however, 8.0% of isolated vitreous hemorrhages, 19.2% of retinal breaks without detachment, and 25.8% of retinal detachments were first noted within the 6-month follow-up period. Men experienced a significantly higher rate of any complication than women (30.0% versus 21.7%, P < 0.001), as well as retinal breaks and retinal detachments at both presentation and within the 6-month follow-up. Patients with pseudophakia experienced significantly higher rates of delayed retinal detachment than those with phakic eyes (odds ratio, 1.85 [1.13, 3.04], P = 0.01). Among eyes with lattice/peripheral retinal degeneration, 44.2% experienced complications.
