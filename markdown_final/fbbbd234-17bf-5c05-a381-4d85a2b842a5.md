## Question

13. (15 points) The supermarket purchases 500 kg of tangerine peels, with a purchase price of 4.80 yuan per kilogram, and the expected weight loss is 10%. If the supermarket hopes to make a profit of 20% on selling this batch of tangerine peels, what should be the retail price per kilogram of the tangerine peels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to calculate the retail price per kilogram of tangerine peels that achieves a 20% profit after accounting for a 10% weight loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total purchase cost. Then, I should verify the expected sellable weight after the 10% loss. Next, I will calculate the target total revenue that includes a 20% profit margin. After that, I need to divide the target revenue by the sellable weight to get the per-kilogram retail price. Finally, I will double-check the math and ensure the profit margin is indeed 20% on cost, not on selling price, and round appropriately for currency.

> Let me first confirm the total purchase cost. The supermarket buys 500 kg at 4.80 yuan per kilogram, so the total cost is 500 kg × 4.80 yuan/kg = 2,400 yuan. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 500 × 4.80 equals 2,400, so the total cost is correct.

> Next, I should review the sellable weight after the expected 10% weight loss. A 10% loss on 500 kg means 500 × 0.10 = 50 kg is lost, so the sellable quantity is 500 − 50 = 450 kg. Hold on, I should verify that subtraction: 500 − 50 is indeed 450 kg, so the sellable weight is correct.

> Now, I need to determine the target total revenue that includes a 20% profit on cost. Profit here is 20% of the total cost, so profit = 0.20 × 2,400 yuan = 480 yuan. Therefore, target total revenue = total cost + profit = 2,400 + 480 = 2,880 yuan. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to apply the 20% to the selling price, but that would be markup on price rather than profit on cost; the question asks for profit on the purchase, so adding 20% of cost to cost is the right approach.

> I will now examine the per-kilogram retail price. Dividing the target total revenue by the sellable weight gives 2,880 yuan ÷ 450 kg = 6.40 yuan/kg. Let me double-check the division: 2,880 ÷ 450 equals 6.4, so the retail price per kilogram is 6.40 yuan.

> But wait, what if the profit margin were interpreted as markup on selling price rather than on cost? If I mistakenly took 20% of the selling price, the algebra would be different: selling price = cost ÷ (1 − 0.20) = 2,400 ÷ 0.80 = 3,000 yuan total revenue, which would imply 3,000 ÷ 450 ≈ 6.67 yuan/kg. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the phrasing "profit of 20% on selling this batch" typically means 20% profit on cost in retail contexts, so 6.40 yuan/kg is the correct interpretation here, not 6.67 yuan/kg.

> Final answer: The retail price should be 6.40 yuan per kilogram of tangerine peels to achieve a 20% profit on cost after accounting for 10% weight loss.

---

The retail price should be **6.40 yuan per kilogram** to achieve a 20% profit after a 10% weight loss. Here's the calculation: total cost is 500 kg × 4.80 yuan/kg = 2,400 yuan; sellable weight after 10% loss is 500 kg × 0.9 = 450 kg; target revenue for 20% profit is 2,400 yuan × 1.2 = 2,880 yuan; thus, the retail price per kilogram is 2,880 yuan ÷ 450 kg = 6.40 yuan/kg.

---

## Step-by-step calculation

| **Step** | **Description** | **Calculation** | **Result** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Total purchase cost | 500 kg × 4.80 yuan/kg | 2,400 yuan |
| 2 | Sellable weight after 10% loss | 500 kg × (1–0.10) | 450 kg |
| 3 | Target revenue for 20% profit | 2,400 yuan × 1.20 | 2,880 yuan |
| 4 | Retail price per kilogram | 2,880 yuan ÷ 450 kg | 6.40 yuan/kg |

---

Therefore, the supermarket should set the retail price at **6.40 yuan per kilogram** to achieve a 20% profit margin after accounting for the 10% weight loss.

### Price discounts significantly enhance fruit and vegetable purchases when combined with nutrition education: a randomized controlled supermarket trial [^38d5db2d]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing fruit and vegetable (F&V) prices is a frequently considered policy to improve dietary habits in the context of health promotion. However, evidence on the effectiveness of this intervention is limited.

Objective

The objective was to examine the effects of a 50% price discount on F&Vs or nutrition education or a combination of both on supermarket purchases.

Design

A 6-mo randomized controlled trial within Dutch supermarkets was conducted. Regular supermarket shoppers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: 50% price discounts on F&Vs, nutrition education, 50% price discounts plus nutrition education, or no intervention. A total of 199 participants provided baseline data; 151 (76%) were included in the final analysis. F&V purchases were measured by using supermarket register receipts at baseline, at 1 mo after the start of the intervention, at 3 mo, at 6 mo (end of the intervention period), and 3 mo after the intervention ended (9 mo).

Results

Adjusted multilevel models showed significantly higher F&V purchases (per household/2 wk) as a result of the price discount (+3.9 kg; 95% CI: 1.5, 6.3 kg) and the discount plus education intervention (+5.6 kg; 95% CI: 3.2, 7.9 kg) at 6 mo compared with control. Moreover, the percentage of participants who consumed recommended amounts of F&Vs (≥ 400 g/d) increased from 42.5% at baseline to 61.3% at 6 mo in both discount groups (P = 0.03). Education alone had no significant effect.

Conclusions

Discounting F&Vs is a promising intervention strategy because it resulted in substantially higher F&V purchases, and no adverse effects were observed. Therefore, pricing strategies form an important focus for future interventions or policy. However, the long-term effects and the ultimate health outcomes require further investigation. This trial was registered at the ISRCTN Trial Register as number ISRCTN56596945 and at the Dutch Trial Register (http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/index.asp) as number NL22568.029.08.

### Effects of price discounts and tailored nutrition education on supermarket purchases: a randomized controlled trial [^6e31646a]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Traditional methods to improve population diets have largely relied on individual responsibility, but there is growing interest in structural interventions such as pricing policies.

Objective

The aim was to evaluate the effect of price discounts and tailored nutrition education on supermarket food and nutrient purchases.

Design

A 2 x 2 factorial randomized controlled trial was conducted in 8 New Zealand supermarkets. A total of 1104 shoppers were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 4 interventions that were delivered over 6 mo: price discounts (12.5%) on healthier foods, tailored nutrition education, discounts plus education, or control (no intervention). The primary outcome was change in saturated fat purchased at 6 mo. Secondary outcomes were changes in other nutrients and foods purchased at 6 and 12 mo. Outcomes were assessed by using electronic scanner sales data.

Results

At 6 mo, the difference in saturated fat purchased for price discounts on healthier foods compared with that purchased for no discount on healthier foods was -0.02% (95% CI: -0.40%, 0.36%; P = 0.91). The corresponding difference for tailored nutrition education compared with that for no education was -0.09% (95% CI: -0.47%, 0.30%; P = 0.66). However, those subjects who were randomly assigned to receive price discounts bought significantly more predefined healthier foods at 6 mo (11% more; mean difference: 0.79 kg/wk; 95% CI: 0.43, 1.16; P < 0.001) and 12 mo (5% more; mean difference: 0.38 kg/wk; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.76; P = 0.045). Education had no effect on food purchases.

Conclusions

Neither price discounts nor tailored nutrition education had a significant effect on nutrients purchased. However, the significant and sustained effect of discounts on food purchases suggests that pricing strategies hold promise as a means to improve population diets.

### The dynamics of fresh fruit and vegetable pricing in the supermarket channel [^6ae26800]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This paper explains the major factors that contribute to the complicated price formation process, as several levels, of fresh fruit and vegetables in the US. Several factors are explored: marketing channels, market structure changes, pricing techniques and promotional impacts, retail responses to supply changes, and price versus value. The paper illustrates with recent examples and research findings that the fresh produce system is dynamic and that simplistic solutions to complex problems are not likely. The paper finishes by suggesting some areas for needed additional research.

### Influence of price discounts and skill-building strategies on purchase and consumption of healthy food and beverages: outcomes of the supermarket healthy eating for life randomized controlled trial [^8e85ce9f]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Fiscal strategies are increasingly considered upstream nutrition promotion measures. However, few trials have investigated the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of pricing manipulations on diet in real-world settings.

Objective

We assessed the effects on fruit, vegetable, and beverage purchasing and consumption of a 20% price-reduction intervention, a tailored skills-based behavior-change intervention, and a combined intervention compared with a control condition.

Design

The Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life trial was a randomized controlled trial conducted over 3 mo [baseline (time 1) to postintervention (time 2) with a 6-mo follow-up (time 3)]. Female primary household shoppers in Melbourne, Australia, were randomly assigned to a 1) skill-building (n = 160), 2) price-reduction (n = 161), 3) combined skill-building and price-reduction (n = 160), or 4) control (n = 161) group. Supermarket transaction data and surveys were used to measure the following study outcomes: fruit, vegetable, and beverage purchases and self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption at each time point.

Results

At 3 mo (time 2), price reduction-alone participants purchased more total vegetables and frozen vegetables than did controls. Price reduction-alone and price reduction-plus-skill-building participants purchased more fruit than did controls. Relative to controls, in the price-reduction group, total vegetable consumption increased by 233 g/wk (3.1 servings or 15% more than at baseline), and fruit purchases increased by 364 g/wk (2.4 servings; 35% more than at baseline). Increases were not maintained 6 mo postintervention (time 3). Price reduction-alone participants showed a tendency for a slight increase in fruit consumption at time 2 (P = 0.09) that was maintained at time 3 (P = 0.014). No intervention improved purchases of bottled water or low-calorie beverages.

Conclusions

A 20% price reduction in fruit and vegetables resulted in increased purchasing per household of 35% for fruit and 15% for vegetables over the price-reduction period. These findings show that price modifications can directly increase produce purchases. The Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life trial was registered at Current Controlled Trials Registration as ISRCTN39432901.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^a5dd53ff]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

5.5 Recommendation

We suggest that clinicians advocate that policymakers provide incentives to ensure that retailers can offer affordable, high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables to all (2 ⊕○○○).

5.5 Evidence

For the poor, food expense represents an important item in a family's budget (Ref. pp 193–221). At least one study showed that a diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein costs more than a diet based on refined grains, added sugars, and fats. But a diet richer in fruits and vegetables can reduce caloric intake and lead to weight control. There are fewer conveniently located supermarkets in poorer neighborhoods but many "convenience stores" selling calorie-dense foods. Urban stores tend to stock fewer of the healthier foods and have less of a variety of foods. Even if supermarket availability were to improve, prices are still lower in the poorer neighborhoods for the higher fat, calorie-dense foods. Some policies (including the federal government farm subsidy program) have encouraged production of high-fructose corn syrup and other commodities used extensively in processed foods. Even when restaurants advertise and make healthy food items available, consumer habits may continue to prefer burgers, fries, and other high-calorie, high-fat items.

### Supermarket discounts of low-energy density foods: effects on purchasing, food intake, and body weight [^6e8494ac]. Obesity (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of a 50% discount on low-energy density (ED) fruits and vegetables (F&V), bottled water, and diet sodas on shoppers' purchasing, food intake, and body weight.

Design and Methods

A randomized, controlled trial was conducted at two Manhattan supermarkets, in which a 4-week baseline period (no discounts) preceded an 8-week intervention period (50% discount), and a 4-week follow-up period (no discounts). Twenty-four hour dietary recall, as well as body weight and body composition measures were obtained every 4 weeks. Participants (n = 47, 33f; 14m) were overweight and obese (BMI ≥ 25) shoppers.

Results

Purchasing of F&V during intervention was greater in the discount group than in the control group (P < 0.0001). Purchasing of these items by the discount group relative to the control group during follow-up was reduced from intervention (P = 0.002), but still remained higher than during baseline (P = 0.01), indicating a partially sustained effect. Intake of F&V increased from baseline to intervention in the discount group relative to the control group (P = 0.037) and was sustained during follow-up. Body weight change did not differ significantly between groups, although post hoc analysis indicated a change within the discount group (-1.1 kg, P = 0.006) but not within the control group.

Conclusions

Discounts of low-ED F&V led to increased purchasing and intake of those foods.

### Supermarket choice, shopping behavior, socioeconomic status, and food purchases [^9a4ac70f]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Sample

Data were obtained from the Kantar WorldPanel (KWP) UK household survey from 2010, which comprised purchase records of 26,922 households over 52 weeks (as this involved analyzing de-identified existing data, ethical approval was not required). Households were recruited by KWP via postal mail and e-mail, using quotas determined by the UK Office of National Statistics census and the UK Broadcasters' Audience Research Board Establishment survey to ensure national representativeness in terms of UK region of residence, age group, and household size. Households received vouchers for high street retailers or leisure activities (approximately equivalent to £100/year) as an incentive toward participation.

Participating households were asked to record all food and beverage purchases brought home. Purchases were recorded using barcode scanners (using showcards with barcodes for non-barcoded products like fruit). Panelists also uploaded digital images of cash register receipts, which were used to verify the accuracy of households' data. Data included volume purchased, nutritional content, and the retail chain from which products were purchased.

To be included in the data set, households had to meet quality control criteria. These included meeting minimum volume and spending for purchases based on household size, every 4 weeks. In addition, households were included only if they reported at least 12 weeks' data and at least 13 trips over 52 weeks (equivalent to one trip/4-week period). This gave a final sample of 24,879 households.

### Supermarket choice, shopping behavior, socioeconomic status, and food purchases [^e4d40db3]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The extent of use of different types of supermarkets was characterized in terms of the percentage of trips that took place at each supermarket price tier.

Four characteristics of shopping behavior were examined:
1 the number of trips recorded by each household each month;
2 the percentage of small trips (defined as those where ten items or fewer were purchased; see sensitivity analyses section);
3 the mean number of different store chains used per month; and
4 whether or not households used the same primary store chain (i.e. the store chain where they purchase the largest number of items) every month.

We used two outcome variables assessing healthfulness of food and beverage purchases, comprising less-healthy and healthier indices:
1 percentage of energy from less-healthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages, as classified by UK Food Standards Agency Nutrient Profilescores for individual products (scores are calculated from the energy, saturated fat, sugar, sodium, fiber, protein, and fruit, vegetable, and nut content per 100 g; foods scoring ≥ 4, and beverages ≥ 1, are categorized as less healthy); and
2 percentage of energy from fruit and vegetables — this included fresh, canned, frozen, and dried fruit, vegetables, and legumes but excluded juice, potatoes, and fruit and vegetables present in processed products.

### Introducing taxes, subsidies or both: the effects of various food pricing strategies in a web-based supermarket randomized trial [^8ed2506e]. Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Fiscal policies may form a solution in improving dietary intake. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of varying taxing and subsiding schemes to stimulate healthier food purchases.

Methods

A randomized controlled trial with three levels of price reduction on healthy foods (no; 25%; 50%)×three levels of price increase on unhealthy foods (5%; 10%; 25%) factorial design was used. 150 participants were randomized into one of nine conditions and were asked to purchase groceries at a web-based supermarket. Data were collected in the Netherlands in January-February 2010 and analyzed using analysis of covariance.

Results

Subjects receiving 50% discount purchased significantly more healthy foods than subjects receiving no (mean difference = 6.62 items, p < 0.01) or 25% discount (mean difference = 4.87 items, p < 0.05). Moreover, these subjects purchased more vegetables (mean difference = 821 g; p < 0.05 compared to no discount). However, participants with the highest discount also purchased significantly more calories. No significant effects of the price increases on unhealthy foods were found.

Conclusion

Price decreases are effective in stimulating healthy food purchases, but the proportion of healthy foods remains unaffected. Price increases up to 25% on unhealthier products do not significantly affect food purchases. Future studies are important to validate these results in real supermarkets and across different countries.

### The effect of food price changes on consumer purchases: a randomised experiment [^6ce16099]. The Lancet: Public Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Most evidence on health-related food taxes and subsidies relies on observational data and effects on single nutrients or foods instead of total diet. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of randomly assigned food price variations on consumer purchasing, where sets of prices emulated commonly discussed food tax and subsidy policies, including a subsidy on fruit and vegetables, a sweetened beverage tax, and taxes on foods according to sugar, sodium, and saturated fat content.

Methods

In this study, adult participants (≥ 18 years) in New Zealand completed up to five weekly shops in a virtual supermarket. Each shopping occasion was randomly allocated to control (no change in prices) or one or more pricing options simulating the following: a fruit and vegetable subsidy (20%), a sweetened beverage tax (20% or 40%), a saturated fat tax (NZ$2 per 100 g or $4 per 100 g saturated fat), a salt tax ($0.02 per 100 mg or $0.04 per 100 mg sodium), or sugar tax ($0.40 per 100 g or $0.80 per 100 g sugar). The primary outcome was the healthiness of the total shopping basket for each weekly shop (% of total unit food items defined as healthy). Low and high price change options were combined in analyses (eg, results for a saturated fat tax are an average of $2 per 100 g or $4 per 100 g).

Findings

Between Feb 1, and Dec 1, 2016, we randomly assigned 1132 shoppers, of whom 1038 (91.7%) completed at least one shop and 743 (71.6%) completed all five shops. Overall, data from 4258 shops were included in the analysis, including 645 control shops, 2545 shops where one policy was activated, and 1068 shops with two (or more) policies activated. In the control condition, 67.90% (SD 13.01) of food purchases were classified as healthy. Three of the five policies increased this proportion by a small, but significant amount (saturated fat tax mean absolute difference 1.77%, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.52, p < 0.0001; sugar tax 1.09%, 0.26 to 1.91, p = 0.0099; and salt tax 1.31%, 0.50 to 2.13, p = 0.0016). The sweetened beverage tax and fruit and vegetable subsidy resulted in non-significant increases of 0.18% (95% CI -0.49 to 0.85, p = 0.60) and 0.41% (-0.26 to 1.07, p = 0.23), respectively. Both the saturated fat tax and salt tax resulted in the following important substitution effects: an increase in fruit and vegetable purchases as a percentage by weight of all food purchases (saturated fat tax 4.0%, 0.9 to 7.1; salt tax 4.3%, 0.9 to 7.7); but also an increase in sugar as a percentage of total energy (saturated fat tax 5.0%, 2.1 to 7.9; salt tax 3.2%, 0.0 to 6.5). Interaction terms for combined policies were mostly non-significant, consistent with additive effects of policy combinations.

Interpretation

Price changes representing saturated fat, sugar, and salt taxes increased total healthy food purchases. As we observed important substitution effects, a combination of different tax and subsidy policies might be the most effective way to improve diets and decrease diet-related chronic diseases.

### Effects of discounting fruits, vegetables, and noncaloric beverages in New York city supermarkets on purchasing, intake, and weight [^ae24b951]. Obesity (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess purchasing, intake, and weight after discounting fruits and vegetables (F&V) and noncaloric beverages in New York City supermarkets.

Methods

A 16-week randomized controlled trial was conducted with a 4-week baseline, an 8-week intervention with 50% discounts on F&V and noncaloric beverages, and a 4-week follow-up. Purchasing was tracked via loyalty cards, and intake was tracked via 24-h dietary recalls. Weights were measured at five in-person visits.

Results

Data from 67 participants were analyzed (38 in the experimental group; 29 in the control group). F&V and noncaloric beverage weekly purchasing was greater in the experimental than the control group (mean difference [SD], $4.64 [$1.44], p < 0.0001; $0.53 [$0.39], p = 0.008) during intervention, with F&V purchasing remaining greater in the experimental versus control group during follow-up (p = 0.005). F&V intake was greater for the experimental than the control group during intervention (142 [105] g/day; p = 0.009) and follow-up (p = 0.001). Although no difference in noncaloric beverage consumption was observed between groups, there was lower alcohol intake in the experimental than the control group during follow-up (-85.8 [60.2] g/day; p = 0.004). The experimental group lost weight compared with the control group (-1.33 [0.92] kg; p = 0.006 intervention and p = 0.106 follow-up). No differences in nutrient composition or high energy-dense product consumption were found.

Conclusions

A 50% discount on F&V and noncaloric beverages promoted increased purchasing and intake of F&V and induced weight loss.

### Supermarket choice, shopping behavior, socioeconomic status, and food purchases [^0a656560]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

For the high-cost supermarket group, there was no association between percentage of trips at high-cost supermarkets and percentage of calories for less-healthy foods/beverages. The effects of extent of use of high-cost supermarkets were again similar for the all-types supermarket group. A greater percentage of trips at high-cost supermarkets was associated with a greater percentage of calories being obtained from fruit and vegetables, but suggested a small effect: For the high-cost supermarket group, for a 10 percentage point increase in the percentage of trips at high-cost supermarkets, the percentage of calories from fruit and vegetables increased by 2%. The social patterning in purchasing was reduced within the high-cost supermarket group.

### Impact of a financial incentive scheme on purchase of fruits and vegetables from unorganised retailers in rural India: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^a090bb48]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Background

Inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables is prevalent in rural areas of India, where around 65% of the population reside. Financial incentives have been shown to increase the purchase of fruits and vegetables in urban supermarkets, but their feasibility and effectiveness with unorganised retailers in rural India is unclear.

Methods

A cluster-randomised controlled trial of a financial incentive scheme involving ∼20% cashback on purchase of fruits and vegetables from local retailers was conducted in six villages (3535 households). All households in three intervention villages were invited to participate in the scheme which ran for three months (February-April 2021), while no intervention was offered in control villages. Self-reported (pre-intervention and post-intervention) data on purchase of fruits and vegetables were collected from a random sub-sample of households in control and intervention villages.

Findings

A total of 1109 households (88% of those invited) provided data. After the intervention, the weekly quantity of self-reported fruits and vegetables purchased were (i) 18.6 kg (intervention) and 14.2 kg (control), baseline-adjusted mean difference 4 kg (95% CI: -6.4 to 14.4) from any retailer (primary outcome); and (ii) 13.1 kg (intervention) and 7.1 kg (control), baseline-adjusted mean difference 7.4 kg (95% CI: 3.8–10.9) from local retailers participating in the scheme (secondary outcome). There was no evidence of differential effects of the intervention by household food security or by socioeconomic position, and no unintended adverse consequences were noted.

Interpretation

Financial incentive schemes are feasible in unorganised food retail environments. Effectiveness in improving diet quality of the household likely hinges on the percentage of retailers willing to participate in such a scheme.

Funding

This research has been funded by the Drivers of Food Choice (DFC) Competitive Grants Program, which is funded by the UK Government's Department for International Development and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and managed by the University of South Carolina, Arnold School of Public Health, USA; however, the views expressed do not necessarily reflect the UK Government's official policies.

### Supermarket choice, shopping behavior, socioeconomic status, and food purchases [^12b084ea]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our analyses of a large UK data set indicate that supermarket choice might have implications for diet quality and health. Compared with households that ever used lower-cost supermarkets, households that ever used high-cost supermarkets purchased 9% higher percentages of energy from fruits and vegetables and 0.8 percentage points less energy from less-healthy foods/beverages. At the population level and over time, such differences in fruit and vegetable purchasing may be clinically significant. These results are consistent with previous studies, which found that consumers who patronized low-cost supermarkets consumed less nutritious diets and fewer vegetables and fruit.

Comparing the "ever use" analyses to the "extent of use" analyses — showing smaller (sometimes counterintuitive) or non-significant effects of supermarket use — suggested the latter had limited effects on purchasing. The lack of a dose–response relationship here suggests that differences in supermarket environments (e.g. the range of fruit and vegetables available, use of in-store marketing) may not be contributing greatly to differences in purchasing by supermarket price tier. Although we did not directly examine individual or cultural factors beyond SES, this may suggest that such factors (that may prompt individuals to choose a particular type of supermarket) may be more-influential drivers of disparities in the healthfulness of purchases by supermarket price tier. Differences largely were not affected by socioeconomic adjustment, however, suggesting that supermarket choice and SES have independent effects on purchasing behavior, consistent with previous U.S. results.

### Price promotions on healthier compared with less healthy foods: a hierarchical regression analysis of the impact on sales and social patterning of responses to promotions in great britain [^20270ccc]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

METHODS

Data

We used a secondary data source, the Kantar WorldPanel survey, which includes purchase records of 26,986 households in the United Kingdom throughout 2010. Households were recruited by a data company (Kantar WorldPanel), and the authors were not involved in the data collection. Data-collection procedure was as follows: the United Kingdom Office of National Statistics census information and the United Kingdom Broadcasters' Audience Research Board Establishment survey were used to determine quotas for recruitment. The data company purchased potential participant lists from another company and recruited participants by sending postal mails and e-mails. Recruited participants received vouchers for high-street retailers and/or vouchers for leisure activities [in total for an average monetary equivalent of £100 (∼$160) per household per year]. Recruited households were nationally representative in terms of region, age group, and household size.

The survey includes purchase records of all foods and beverages that were taken home from supermarkets and similar stores in 2010. Sampled households were asked by the data company to record all purchases using barcode scanners and to send digital images of cash-register receipts to the company. The data contain rich information on purchases, including the price at which they were bought, whether they were bought on promotion, the number of packets purchased, and the retail chain from which the product (Stock Keeping Unit) was purchased. The data also include detailed information on product characteristics, including information on the brand, manufacturing company, and nutritional content.

We constructed a cross-sectional data set of 11,323 individual products in 135 food and drink categories, which were purchased by panel households in leading United Kingdom supermarket chains [i.e. the "main parties" as defined by the United Kingdom Competition Commission]. The food and drink categories reflected those used in the retailing sector (Kantar WorldPanel; see Supplemental Table 1 for more information). With the use of transaction records in the data, we calculated the total number of units of each product sold to panel households across the country over 52 wk. In keeping with common practice in the related literature (,–), we restricted the set of products to the more-popular items; in particular, we included only products that were purchased at least once in each of the 52 wk by any of the panel households, irrespective of whether the products were on promotion or not.

### Potential impact on prevalence of obesity in the UK of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks: modelling study [^60ed4655]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To estimate the potential impact on body mass index (BMI) and prevalence of obesity of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks.

Design

Modelling study.

Setting

General adult population of the United Kingdom.

Participants

36 324 households with data on product level household expenditure from UK Kantar FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) panel for January 2012 to December 2013. Data were used to estimate changes in energy (kcal, 1 kcal = 4.18 kJ = 0.00418 MJ) purchase associated with a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks. Data for 2544 adults from waves 5 to 8 of the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2012–16) were used to estimate resulting changes in BMI and prevalence of obesity.

Main outcome measures

The effect on per person take home energy purchases of a 20% price increase for three categories of high sugar snacks: confectionery (including chocolate), biscuits, and cakes. Health outcomes resulting from the price increase were measured as changes in weight, BMI (not overweight (BMI < 25), overweight (BMI ≥ 25 and < 30), and obese (BMI ≥ 30)), and prevalence of obesity. Results were stratified by household income and BMI.

Results

For income groups combined, the average reduction in energy consumption for a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks was estimated to be 8.9×10³ kcal (95% confidence interval −13.1×10³ to −4.2×10³ kcal). Using a static weight loss model, BMI was estimated to decrease by 0.53 (95% confidence interval −1.01 to −0.06) on average across all categories and income groups. This change could reduce the UK prevalence of obesity by 2.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval −3.7 to −1.7 percentage points) after one year. The impact of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks on energy purchase was largest in low income households classified as obese and smallest in high income households classified as not overweight.

Conclusions

Increasing the price of high sugar snacks by 20% could reduce energy intake, BMI, and prevalence of obesity. This finding was in a UK context and was double that modelled for a similar price increase in sugar sweetened beverages.

### Environmental interventions to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and their effects on health [^062a562e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

In Ni Mhurchu 2010, a price discount of 12.5% was applied to bottled water and diet beverages when participants used their supermarket loyalty cards to make purchases at the participating supermarkets. Price discounts were not visible at point‐of‐purchase, but participants received a list of discounted items. Effects on average energy density of beverages purchased were assessed based on electronic sales data collected through the participants' loyalty cards at baseline, during a six‐month intervention phase and during an additional six‐month post‐intervention phase, during which no price discounts were applied. Data from 1028 adult customers of one supermarket chain in the Lower North Island region of New Zealand were included in the analyses reported in this review. Most participants were women, 23% were Māori and 9% Pacific Islanders, and approximately equal numbers of participants were from low‐ and high‐income households. The study also evaluated the effects of an education skill‐building intervention, which we did not include in this review.

SSB consumption and purchases (three RCTs, low‐certainty evidence)

Ball 2015 reports that SSB purchases increased by 55 ml/day (95% CI −7 to 117) and self‐reported SSB intake increased by 10 ml/day (95% CI 0 to 20) at three months. Ni Mhurchu 2010 reports that energy density of beverages purchased decreased by −0.1 MJ/kg (95% CI −0.4 to 0.2) at six months. Franckle 2018 reports that the number of red‐labelled beverages purchased each month decreased by −0.14 beverage items/month (95% CI −0.8 to 0.6). These data were provided to us by the study authors. Franckle 2018 reports that the share of participants who purchased any red‐labelled beverage decreased by −9 percentage points a month (P = 0.002), and the share of participants reporting consuming any red‐labelled beverage each week decreased significantly (−23% in the intervention group versus −2% in the control group, P = 0.01) during the five‐month intervention period.

Main Outcome Measures

The effect on per person take home energy purchases of a 20% price increase for three categories of high sugar snacks: confectionery (including chocolate), biscuits, and cakes. Health outcomes resulting from the price increase were measured as changes in weight, BMI (not overweight (BMI < 25), overweight (BMI ≥ 25 and < 30), and obese (BMI ≥ 30)), and prevalence of obesity. Results were stratified by household income and BMI.

Results

For income groups combined, the average reduction in energy consumption for a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks was estimated to be 8.9×10³ kcal (95% confidence interval -13.1×10³ to -4.2×10³ kcal).

This change could reduce the UK prevalence of obesity by 2.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval -3.7 to -1.7 percentage points) after one year. The impact of a 20% price increase in high sugar snacks on energy purchase was largest in low income households classified as obese and smallest in high income households classified as not overweight.

Conclusions

Increasing the price of high sugar snacks by 20% could reduce energy intake, BMI, and prevalence of obesity. This finding was in a UK context and was double that modelled for a similar price increase in sugar sweetened beverages.

### Measuring diet cost at the individual level: a comparison of three methods [^12fdb17e]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Method 1: diet diaries and food expenditures

All foods and beverages reported in each participant's coded 4-day diet diary were linked to corresponding items in the participant's receipts, collected during weeks 1–4 of the study. To compute the expenditure for each food portion of food or beverage consumed, the gram weight consumed was multiplied by the ratio of the purchase price over total grams purchased, correcting for edible portion (EP):

For example, the expenditure associated with a 1 cup portion (109 g) of fresh apple that was purchased for $1.49/pound (454 g) was 109 g × $1.99/(454 g × 0.90) = $0.531. Overall, approximately 80% of all foods and beverages consumed were accounted for in the participants' receipts. For missing receipt data, expenditures were imputed using food prices collected by study staff. The posted price was recorded for the product and matched for details provided by the participant. The key details were product brand, type, package size and the retail outlet from which it was purchased. When product or retail outlet information was not available, the closest match was identified from among three major supermarket chains (described below) and the lowest price was recorded. Expenditures were calculated for each day and were averaged over the 4 days.

Method 2: diet diaries and supermarket prices

Each item in the coded 4-day diet diary was matched with one of the foods in the database of supermarket prices for 384 foods and beverages in 152 categories. The database has been described before and contains lowest, non-sale prices collected from three major supermarket chains in the region as described previously. In brief, prices were collected from May to July 2006 from Safeway, Albertson's and Quality Food Centers (a subsidiary of Kroger), which were selected because of their large market share in the region. Prices were obtained during in-store visits and from supermarket home shopping websites (Safeway and Albertson's), which reported to list the same prices as those available to in-store customers. When no exact match from the 384 products was available, the closest match from among the broader food categories was used. As in Method 1, daily totals were computed and 4-day means were derived.

### Impact of a financial incentive scheme on purchase of fruits and vegetables from unorganised retailers in rural India: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^7d7c982f]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Description of the intervention

The financial incentive scheme consisted of a coupon system that could be used to claim a cashback reward of 50 Indian Rupees (INR 50, equivalent to ∼0.67 US$ at the time of implementation), on weekly purchase of INR 250 (∼3.36 US$) of fruits and vegetables from local retailers. To contextualise these amounts, most households in the study area earn between INR 5000–15,000 per month, meaning the reward corresponds to between 1.5 and 4% of weekly household income, and fruit and vegetable purchase threshold corresponds to 7–20% of weekly household income. All households in the intervention villages were invited to take part in the scheme and provided with a booklet containing enough coupons to last for the duration of the study. Each coupon had space for 25 stamps, each of value INR 10 (∼0.13 US$) (Fig. 1). After completing any purchase of fruits and vegetables from the local vendors worth at least INR 10, participants could get one or more stamps (depending on the amount purchased in multiples of INR 10) on their coupon from the study staff stationed at the village markets during operating hours after showing their purchases (most produce in the area is sold in standard size bundles of similar weight). At the end of the week, participants could submit their completed coupon with 25 stamps and claim the cash reward. Each coupon was dated and valid only for that week to prevent accumulation of stamps over a prolonged period. The intervention ran for three complete calendar months (February–April 2021).

### Supermarket choice, shopping behavior, socioeconomic status, and food purchases [^09d4cfae]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Both SES and supermarket choice have been associated with diet quality. This study aimed to assess the contributions of supermarket choice and shopping behaviors to the healthfulness of purchases and social patterning in purchases.

Methods

Observational panel data on purchases of fruit and vegetables and less-healthy foods/beverages from 2010 were obtained for 24,879 households, stratified by occupational social class (analyzed in 2014). Households' supermarket choice was determined by whether they ever visited market-defined high- or low-price supermarkets. Analyses also explored extent of use within supermarket choice groups. Shopping behaviors included trip frequency, trip size, and number of store chains visited.

Results

Households using low-price (and not high-price) supermarkets purchased significantly lower percentages of energy from fruit and vegetables and higher percentages of energy from less-healthy foods/beverages than households using high-price (and not low-price) supermarkets. When controlling for SES and shopping behaviors, the effect of supermarket choice was reduced but remained significant for both fruit and vegetables and less-healthy foods/beverages. The extent of use of low- or high-price supermarkets had limited effects on outcomes. More-frequent trips and fewer small trips were associated with healthier purchasing for both outcomes; visiting more store chains was associated with higher percentages of energy from fruit and vegetables.

Conclusions

Although both supermarket choice and shopping behaviors are associated with healthfulness of purchases, neither appears to contribute to socioeconomic differences. Moreover, differences between supermarket environments may not be primary drivers of the relationship between supermarket choice and healthfulness of purchases.

### Prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline based on expert opinion [^584a94a1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity — community design and food access recommendations emphasize environmental supports for activity and healthier diets. We suggest that clinicians advocate that community master planners design, redesign, and organize communities to maximize opportunities for safe walking or cycling to school, recreational activity and athletic events, and neighborhood shopping as means to encourage greater physical activity (2⊕⊕○○). Today, only 25% of children walk or bike to school as compared with 48% in 1969. We suggest that clinicians advocate that policymakers provide incentives to ensure that retailers can offer affordable, high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables to all (2⊕⊕○○). For the poor, food expense represents an important item in a family's budget, and at least one study showed that a diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein costs more than a diet based on refined grains, added sugars, and fats; there are fewer conveniently located supermarkets in poorer neighborhoods but many "convenience stores" selling calorie-dense foods, and urban stores tend to stock fewer of the healthier foods and have less of a variety of foods.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^4e104775]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug pricing fosters and directs innovation

The process of developing a new drug, from preclinical research to market, is time-consuming, risky, and costly, often taking more than a decade and costing billions of dollars. The risk is best reflected in the very low probability of a potential drug making it through all stages of clinical trials and securing regulatory approval. Estimates suggest this probability is, on average, less than 10%; however, recent data for oncology show a lower estimate at about 3.5% (Fig. 2). The high "failure rate" depends on the starting point: for example, probably < 0.1% of all molecules tested in preclinical studies end up being FDA-approved. For those that embark on this journey, the odds of reaching the finish are long, and there is no guarantee that costs incurred for failed products will be recovered in any form. Even if a product is successful in clinical trials and secures regulatory approval, it may not generate enough revenue to recoup the multiple investment attempts that went into its development. Thus, pharmaceutical R&D only starts to make sense at the portfolio level, where the cost of planting many seeds and nurturing a whole garden of projects can only be justified by robust financial returns from selling the few prized fruits.

### Supermarket choice, shopping behavior, socioeconomic status, and food purchases [^d2a903ca]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Table 3 shows the results for the percentage of energy obtained from fruit and vegetables. As this outcome was logged to address a skewed distribution, Table 3 presents the percentage change per unit change in predictors (calculated from back-transformed [exponentiated] b coefficients). The high-cost supermarket group purchased 9% higher percentages of energy from fruit and vegetables on average compared with the low-cost supermarket group, when controlling for shopping behaviors and SES. The coefficients for supermarket choice, shopping behavior, and SES were largely similar when controlling for one another.

In terms of shopping behavior, results suggest a 3% increase in the percentage of calories from fruit and vegetables for households at the 75th compared with the 25th percentile for trips per month, whereas for a 10 percentage point increase in the percentage of small trips per month, the percentage of calories from fruit and vegetables decreased by 6%. For each additional store chain visited per month, results suggest the percentage of calories households obtain from fruit and vegetables increased by 6%.

The above analyses examined the effect of ever shopping at supermarkets in different price tiers (meaning there was considerable variability in the extent of use of each supermarket price tier within groups). Table 4 shows the results of analyses addressing the extent of use of low- and high-cost supermarkets within the low-cost, high-cost, and all-types supermarket choice groups. These suggest that for the low-cost supermarket group, using low-cost supermarkets for a greater percentage of trips was not associated with the percentage of calories obtained for fruit and vegetables, but it was associated with a small reduction in the percentage of calories purchased from less-healthy foods/beverages (0.25 percentage point decrease for a 10 percentage point increase in percentage of trips at low-cost supermarkets). The effects of extent of use of low-cost supermarkets were similar for the all-types supermarket group.

### Supermarket choice, shopping behavior, socioeconomic status, and food purchases [^d640dd3c]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Results

The descriptive data presented in Table 1 indicated social patterning associated with supermarket choice. Among the low-cost supermarket users, 15% were from the highest occupational social class group and 31% were from the lowest group. By contrast, 36% of the higher versus 12% in the lower occupational social class group shopped in high-cost supermarkets. Similar patterning was seen across income groups.

Table 1 also suggests that supermarket choice may be associated with healthfulness of purchases, with 1.2–1.5 percentage point differences for the mean energy from less-healthy foods/beverages and from fruit and vegetables between the low- and high-cost supermarket groups.

However, the supermarket choice groups may also show somewhat different patterns of shopping behavior: the low-cost supermarket group had on average a slightly higher number of trips per month and visited more different store chains than the high-cost supermarket group (although there are more low-cost [n = 4] than high-cost [n = 3] store chains).

Table 2 shows results for the percentage of energy households obtained from less-healthy foods/beverages. Although analyses only including supermarket choice suggested the low-cost supermarket group purchased significantly higher percentages of energy from less-healthy foods/beverages than the high-cost supermarket group (by 1.3 percentage points), these differences were reduced (to 0.77 percentage points) when controlling for SES. Additionally controlling for shopping behavior had little impact on the difference between the high- and low-cost supermarket groups (–0.77 to –0.72).

Shopping behaviors were significantly associated with healthfulness of purchases, with a 0.9 percentage point decrease in calories from less-healthy foods/beverages for a household at the 75th percentile for trips per month (9.2 trips/month) compared with one at the 25th percentile (3.9 trips/month), whereas a 10 percentage point increase in the percentage of small trips per month was associated with a 0.4 percentage point increase in the percentage of calories obtained from less-healthy foods/beverages. Including shopping behaviors had little effect on the coefficients for SES.

### Changes in use of types of tobacco products by pack sizes and price segments, prices paid and consumption following the introduction of plain packaging in Australia [^d19cb96c]. Tobacco Control (2015). Low credibility.

As in most countries, cigarettes in Australia have been categorised into three price segments — premium, mainstream and value. The recommended retail price per typical pack of 25s in early-2014 was over $20 for premium brands and under $17.70 for value brands. While value brands have traditionally been sold in Australia in packs of 35, 40 and 50 cigarettesmany value brands have recently become available in packs of 20 which retail well under the $15 mark, and some commentators have pointed to the emergence of a super-value segment. A full list of products available for sale in Australia between 2012 and 2014 can be viewed here (see onlineS1).

Prices charged at the retail level in small mixed businesses and petrol stations are generally in line with recommended retail prices regularly published by Australia's association of retail tobacconists, however, larger retailers such as supermarkets and large tobacconists often negotiate lower wholesale prices for greater volumes and sell tobacco products at prices discounted well below the recommended levels. A recent check of prices in supermarkets (May 2014) revealed prices approximately 2–7% cheaper for premium brands, 5–15% cheaper for mainstream brands and 3–16% cheaper for value brands. Thus, the price paid by a consumer for a pack of cigarettes may vary considerably not just based on price segment of the brand they choose (value, mainstream or premium), but also depending on whether they purchase it from a convenience or a discount outlet, as a single pack, a multipack (two or three packs bundled together) or carton, and what pack size they purchase.

### Are energy-dense foods really cheaper? Reexamining the relation between food price and energy density [^05439e43]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The inverse relation between energy density (kcal/g) and energy cost (price/kcal) has been interpreted to suggest that produce (fruit, vegetables) is more expensive than snacks (cookies, chips).

Objective

The objective of this study was to show the methodologic weakness of comparing energy density with energy cost.

Design

The relation between energy density and energy cost was replicated in a random-number data set. Additionally, observational data were collected for produce and snacks from an online supermarket. Variables included total energy (kcal), total weight (g), total number of servings, serving size (g/serving), and energy density (kcal/g). Price measures included energy cost ($/kcal), total price ($), unit price ($/g), and serving price ($/serving). Two-tailed t tests were used to compare price measures by food category. Relations between energy density and price measures within food categories were examined with the use of Spearman rank correlation analysis.

Results

The relation between energy density and energy cost was shown to be driven by the algebraic properties of these variables. Food category was strongly correlated with both energy density and food price measures. Energy cost was higher for produce than for snacks. However, total price and unit price were lower for produce. Serving price and serving size were greater for produce than for snacks. Within food categories, energy density was uncorrelated with most measures of food price, except for a weak positive correlation with serving price within the produce category.

Conclusion

The findings suggest the relation between energy density and food price is confounded by food category and depends on which measure of price is used.

### Latest chemical peel innovations [^cb1e7920]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

For decades, chemical peels have remained a trusted option for treatment of aging facial skin. However, emerging technologies are being adopted by many practitioners who may not have had sufficient opportunity to learn the art of chemical peeling. Properly performed peels can improve the condition of the skin, are less expensive than light-based machines, and exfoliate the skin without the thermal damage associated with light-based machines. This article presents a new variation of a trusted method, using a series of low-strength trichloroacetic acid peels and proper skin preparation that is cost-effective and produces excellent results in selected patients.

### Association of a sweetened beverage tax with purchases of beverages and high-sugar foods at independent stores in Philadelphia [^5ee60037]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, our data do not include evening and weekend purchases, which may limit generalizability. Second, this study captured purchases at independent stores, and we do not know whether independent store customers switched to purchasing taxed beverages at stores where less of the tax is passed through to prices, such as supermarkets. Third, we were unable to objectively assess potential cross-border shopping at independent stores and were therefore unable to incorporate that into our elasticity calculation. Fourth, customer purchase results are based on repeated cross-sections and unobservable factors may have changed differentially between sites over time, although sociodemographic characteristics of Philadelphia and Baltimore were similar over time and adjusted models did not affect the overall results. Fifth, we assumed the previously documented parallel trends for large chain retailers in Philadelphia and Baltimorewere similar to the trends in our sample, but we could not test it directly. Sixth, we often relied on storeowner and clerk reports of store prices when prices were not posted, although we do not expect this to differ between cities. Seventh, although our response rate in Baltimore (59%) was comparable with other studies, our response rate in Philadelphia was lower (23%). Eighth, our data do not allow us to adjust for the volume of customers shopping at each store. Ninth, we had to estimate the nutrition values for 13% of items using the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, and our substitution analyses only examined calories from sweetened foods (not all foods). Tenth, a small number of artificially sweetened beverage purchases were made, making it difficult to draw conclusions on the tax's influence on those drinks. Finally, we were unable to assess the influence of the tax on independent store revenue, although other research suggests sweetened beverage taxes are not associated with job losses.

### Supermarket purchases over the supplemental nutrition assistance program benefit month: a comparison between participants and nonparticipants [^7d2e67eb]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides financial assistance for food and beverage purchases to approximately 1 in 7 Americans, with benefits distributed once monthly. Most Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits are spent early in the month, leading to decreased caloric intake later in the month. The effects of this early benefit depletion on the types of foods and beverages purchased over the course of the month is unclear.

Methods

Using individually tracked sales data from 950 participants enrolled in 2 supermarket-based RCTs in Maine (October 2015-April 2016 and October 2016-June 2017), purchases of selected food categories by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants (n = 248) versus nonparticipants (n = 702) in the first 2 weeks compared with the last 2 weeks of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit month were examined. Analyses were completed in 2019.

Results

For Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants, adjusted mean food spending decreased 37% from the first 2 weeks to the last 2 weeks of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit month (p < 0.0001) compared with a 3% decrease (p = 0.02) for nonparticipants. The decline in spending by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants occurred in all examined categories: vegetables (-25%), fruits (-27%), sugar-sweetened beverages (-30%), red meat (-37%), convenience foods (-40%), and poultry (-48%). Difference-in-difference estimators comparing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants with nonparticipants were statistically significant (p < 0.05) for all examined categories.

Conclusions

In the second half of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefit month, individuals reduced purchases of all examined categories. More research is needed to understand the impact of these fluctuations in spending patterns on the dietary quality of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program participants.

### Pricing of tobacco products during, and after, the introduction of standardized packaging: an observational study of retail price data from independent and convenience (small) retailers in the United Kingdom [^a3e6bf86]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using monthly data from small retailers, we found that the price of leading tobacco products increased during the introduction of standardized packaging in the United Kingdom. Price increases occurred for both RRPs and sales prices for both FMCs and RYO, and for value, mid‐price and premium FMCs. For the 6 months after the legislation became mandatory, there was a small decline in prices. However, based on the new minimum pack sizes, throughout the 18‐month study period the average sales price was estimated to have increased £0.38 for 20 FMCs and £0.91 for 30 g RYO.

Consistent with other UK research, the price‐per‐cigarette and price‐per‐gram increases exceed those expected if only moving in line with tobacco duty escalation 42. For RYO, the March 2017 escalator increased the duty payable per‐gram by approximately £0.012 (from £198.10 per‐kilogram to £209.77) 31. We found that the RRP and sales price‐per‐gram increased above this. For FMCs, the March 2017 escalator increased the duty payable per‐cigarette by approximately £0.012 (from £196.42 to £207.99 per‐1000 FMC) 31. Our results suggest that the RRP and sales price‐per‐cigarette increased above this, particularly for value and premium FMCs. Although the MET was introduced alongside standardized packaging, setting an initial floor price of £6.44 for 20 FMCs (minimum £5.37 of duty plus 20% VAT at sale; equivalent to £0.32‐per‐cigarette) 32, none of the cigarette products monitored had an average sales price‐per‐cigarette below this and were not directly affected. Although increases above duty escalation are not directly attributable to standardized packaging, there is evidence to suggest that the price rises may be an indirect effect of the legislative changes. For example, studies of retail data, interviews with retailers and information in the retail trade press have reported that small retailers used the removal of price‐marking, changes to brand variant name and the new minimum pack sizes as an opportunity to increase sales prices above RRP and increase profit margins 37, 43.

### Supercritical mechano-exfoliation process [^ef676018]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Hence, we conceptualized the production scale reaching an annual capacity of 4.8 metric tonnes of SGNs at the PS- SCME scale and thoroughly assessed its economic competitiveness against other processes (Supplementary Tables 10, 11). Among the three main process modules (exfoliation, separation, and purification), the exfoliation and purification stage incurred the highest equipment, energy, and material costs (Fig. 3a), with manufacturing and loading costs amounting to US $620k. Conversely, the separation and stage costs were minimal due to the complete elimination of organic liquid phases (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Note 1. 4). Assuming a 10-year operational period with a 10% discount rate, the net present value (NPV) of SCME was US $4.04 million at the selling price of US $500/kg for regular graphene and US $1000/kg for purified graphene, yielding a high internal rate of return (IRR) of 28.45%. Furthermore, a 10% or 30% increase in the selling price raised the NPV to US $4.62 million and US $5.79 million, respectively, with IRR of 33.12% and 46.20% at the break-even point (Fig. 3c). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the annual sales volume and sales price of graphene were critical for sustained profitability (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Table 12–13). These findings suggested that reducing operating costs through optimization of the exfoliation process and increasing the proportion of purified SGNs in total production were essential. Additionally, aggressive marketing measures were recommended to boost sales volume. To more intuitively demonstrate the investment prospects of the SCME process, we compared the cost, output, and quality with CVD (representing D-T synthesis) and MA-LPE process (representing T-D exfoliation) in detail based on reasonable assumptions (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Tables 14, 15). Notably, while the CVD approach entailed higher costs and superior quality, it yielded less, contrasting with the SCME and MA-LPE processes, which generally yielded more at comparatively lower costs and quality levels. Specifically, the production costs exhibited a clearer and more comparable distinction between SCME and MA-LPE processes, amounting to 69.49 and 220 USD/kg, respectively (Supplementary Table 16 and Supplementary Fig. 49). This substantial cost disparity predominantly arose from the utilization, separation, and harmless treatment of organic phases, underscoring the substantial competitiveness of the SCME process.

### Chemical peels: indications and special considerations for the male patient [^7a2b8a52]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chemical peels are a mainstay of aesthetic medicine and an increasingly popular cosmetic procedure performed in men.

Objective

To review the indications for chemical peels with an emphasis on performing this procedure in male patients.

Materials and Methods

Review of the English PubMed/MEDLINE literature and specialty texts in cosmetic dermatology, oculoplastic, and facial aesthetic surgery regarding sex-specific use of chemical peels in men.

Results

Conditions treated successfully with chemical peels in men include acne vulgaris, acne scarring, rosacea, keratosis pilaris, melasma, actinic keratosis, photodamage, resurfacing of surgical reconstruction scars, and periorbital rejuvenation. Chemical peels are commonly combined with other nonsurgical cosmetic procedures to optimize results. Male patients may require a greater number of treatments or higher concentration of peeling agent due to increased sebaceous quality of skin and hair follicle density.

Conclusion

Chemical peels are a cost-effective and reliable treatment for a variety of aesthetic and medical skin conditions. Given the increasing demand for noninvasive cosmetic procedures among men, dermatologists should have an understanding of chemical peel applications and techniques to address the concerns of male patients.

### Socioeconomic status, energy cost, and nutrient content of supermarket food purchases [^921a98ef]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The relative affordability of energy-dense versus nutrient-rich foods may promote socioeconomic disparities in dietary quality and obesity. Although supermarkets are the largest food source in the American diet, the associations between SES and the cost and nutrient content of freely chosen food purchases have not been described.

Purpose

To investigate relationships of SES with the energy cost ($/1000 kcal) and nutrient content of freely chosen supermarket purchases.

Methods

Supermarket shoppers (n = 69) were recruited at a Phoenix AZ supermarket in 2009. The energy cost and nutrient content of participants' purchases were calculated from photographs of food packaging and nutrition labels using dietary analysis software. Data were analyzed in 2010–2011.

Results

Two SES indicators, education and household income as a percentage of the federal poverty guideline (FPG), were associated with the energy cost of purchased foods. Adjusting for covariates, the amount spent on 1000 kcal of food was $0.26 greater for every multiple of the FPG, and those with a baccalaureate or postbaccalaureate degree spent an additional $1.05 for every 1000 kcal of food compared to those with no college education. Lower energy cost was associated with higher total fat and less protein, dietary fiber, and vegetables per 1000 kcal purchased.

Conclusions

Low-SES supermarket shoppers purchase calories in inexpensive forms that are higher in fat and less nutrient-rich.

### Excise taxes and pricing activities of e-liquid products sold in online vape shops [^75dc2c9e]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

In table 1, we present summary statistics of product price per pack (in $), volume per pack (in mL), and standardised price (in $/mL) for the whole sample (panel A) and by stores (panels B–F). We scraped in total 14 477 e-liquid products from the five stores, among which 9685 (66.90%) were in stock at the time of scraping. After dropping 77 products with missing price or volume information, we calculated standardised prices for 14 400 e-liquid products.

Table 1
Summary statistics

As shown in table 1, the number of e-liquid products sold in each store ranged from 1649 to 4568. Panel A summarises the average results across the five stores. The e-liquid price per pack had a range of $0.49–$131.89, with an average price of $15.81. The e-liquid volume per pack varied from 1.4 mL to 1000 mL, with an average of 83.03 mL. The standardised price ranged from $0.02 to $3.33, with an average of $0.25/mL.

### Recent trends in energy and nutrient content of take-home food and beverage purchases in great britain: an analysis of 225 million food and beverage purchases over 6 years [^a84cb3dc]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Study population

Data were obtained from the UK Kantar FMCG panel, a consumer panel of food and beverages purchased by households in Great Britain (GB) and brought into their home. Our dataset covers purchases during 2012–2017. The panel uses an open-panel design, comprising 31 000–34 000 households annually. Households are recruited via stratified sampling, with quotas set for region, household size, age of main shopper, number of children and occupation. Households record purchases continuously throughout the year and are offered incentives to remain in the panel in the form of vouchers with an average value of £100 per household per year. Panel retention is high — participating households in 2012 had mean follow-up time of 4.1 years. Approximately, 3000–4000 new households are enrolled each year to maintain national representativeness. Panellists provide sociodemographic data when joining the panel (including, age, sex, occupation, ethnicity, household composition, income and others) followed by annual updates. The dataset further includes gross-up weights to derive population-level estimates by accounting for the sampling design and non-response.

Food and beverage purchase data

Households record food and beverage purchases brought back into the home using hand-held barcode scanners. Places of purchase include supermarkets, convenience stores, newsagents and specialist stores such as butchers, greengrocers. Non-barcoded products, such as loose fruits and vegetables, are recorded using bespoke barcodes. Participants additionally provide price information from receipts. Kantar FMCG collects nutritional data on products purchased through direct measurement in outlets twice a year, or using product images provided by Brandbank, a third party supplier. Where Kantar is unable to gather direct information, nutritional values are either copied across from similar products or an average value for the category or product type is calculated and used instead (the proportion of imputed values was lowest for energy (11.0%) and highest for fibre (19.6%)). Data available for analyses included n = 225 036 065 item-level observations of food and beverage product purchases over six 52-week periods. Outcomes used in this study are: energy (kcal), fat (g), protein (g), carbohydrate (g), sugar (g), saturated fat (g), sodium (g) and non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) fibre (g).

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^dc67772c]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pricing as a reflection of value

Pricing based on the R&D costs of one approved molecule does not account for all the others that did not make it to the market. Additionally, while we tend to focus on the successful products in the existing R&D ecosystem, the literature has shown that both successful and failed R&D efforts have generated important scientific knowledge that has improved the efficiency of our R&D system. Put simply, it is impossible to innovate without failure, and it is important to recognize that failures are valuable, too, because what we learn — as an R&D ecosystem — from our failures helps us to eventually succeed.

If we agree that providing sufficient rewards is essential to incentivize biopharmaceutical R&D, what should society pay? Firstly, this may seem a strange question to those who operate in the actual market-based system, because the answer they often encounter is that payers try to pay as little as possible. If faced with enough choices, payers, specifically PBMs in the USA, can simply play companies off against one another and take the best offers. Understandably pre-occupied with their own priorities, none of these individual payers is directly concerned with rewarding innovation from the societal perspective. Innovators are constantly trying to invent something uniquely useful in the hope that they will not face too much competition and will therefore have pricing power. In other words, they want to be able to control the supply of a product that buyers want badly enough to pay the price that the innovator sets, and even where there are a few competitors, companies tend to be savvy enough not to trigger a ruinous price war, which is why it often takes loss of exclusivity and many generic competitors entering the market to drive a drug's price down steeply.

### Guidelines for chemical peeling in Japan (3rd edition) [^eb42ce15]. The Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Chemical peeling may be defined as the therapies, procedures and techniques used for the treatment of certain cutaneous diseases or conditions, and for aesthetic improvement. The procedures include the application of one or more chemical agents to the skin. Chemical peeling has been very popular in both medical and aesthetic fields. Because neither its scientific background is well understood nor a systematic approach established, medical and social problems have taken place. This prompted us to establish and distribute a standard guideline of care for chemical peeling. Previous guidelines such as the 2001 and 2004 versions included minimum standards of care such as indications, chemicals, applications, and any associated precautions, including post-peeling care. The principles in this updated version of chemical peeling are as follows: (i) chemical peeling should be performed under the strict technical control and responsibility of a physician; (ii) the physician should have sufficient knowledge of the structure and physiology of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and understand the mechanisms of wound-healing induced by chemical peeling; (iii) the physician should be board-certified in an appropriate specialty such as dermatology; and (iv) the ultimate judgment regarding the appropriateness of any specific chemical peeling procedure must be made by the physician while considering all standard therapeutic protocols, which should be presented to each individual patient. Keeping these concepts in mind, this new version of the guidelines includes a more scientific and detailed approach from the viewpoint of evidence-based medicine.

### In-store marketing and supermarket purchases: associations overall and by transaction SNAP status [^a2fb5a82]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In-store placement promotions are used widely in supermarkets, but their effects on customer purchases remain largely unknown. This study examined associations of supermarket placement promotions with customer purchases overall and by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit use.

Methods

Data on in-store promotions (e.g., endcaps, checkout displays) and transactions (n = 274,118,338) were obtained from a New England supermarket chain with 179 stores from 2016 to 2017. Product-level analyses examined multivariable-adjusted changes in products' sales when they were promoted (versus not) across all transactions and stratified by whether the transaction was paid for with SNAP benefits. Food group-level analyses examined the extent to which a 20% increase from the mean number of weekly promotions for a food group (e.g., increasing the number of candy promotions from 17.0 to 20.4) was associated with total food group sales. Analyses were conducted in 2022.

Results

Across stores, the mean (SD) number of promotions per week was highest for sweet/salty snacks (126.3 [22.6]), baked goods (67.5 [18.4]), and sugar-sweetened beverages (48.6 [13.8]) and lowest for beans (5.0 [2.6]) and fruits (6.6 [3.3]). Product sales were between 16% (low-calorie drinks) and 136% (candy) higher when promoted versus not promoted. In 14 of 15 food groups, associations were stronger among transactions made with SNAP benefits than among those not made with SNAP benefits. The number of in-store promotions was generally not associated with total food group sales.

Conclusions

In-store promotions, which were mostly for unhealthy foods, were associated with large product sales increases, particularly among SNAP purchasers. Policies limiting unhealthy in-store promotions and incentivizing healthy promotions should be explored.

### Assessment of calories purchased after calorie labeling of prepared foods in a large supermarket chain [^aa895035]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Calorie labels for prepared (ie, ready-to-eat) foods are required in large chain food establishments in the US. Large evaluations in restaurants suggest small declines in purchases of prepared foods after labeling, but to the authors' knowledge, no studies have examined how this policy influences supermarket purchases.

Objective

To estimate changes in calories purchased from prepared foods and potential packaged substitutes compared with control foods after calorie labeling of prepared foods in supermarkets.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This controlled interrupted time series compared sales 2 years before labeling implementation (April 2015-April 2017) with sales 7 months after labeling implementation (May 2017-December 2017). Data from 173 supermarkets from a supermarket chain with locations in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont were analyzed from March 2020 to May 2022.

Intervention

Implementation of calorie labeling of prepared foods in April 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Purchased items were classified as prepared foods, potential packaged substitutes for prepared foods, or all other (ie, control) foods. The primary outcome was mean weekly calories per transaction purchased from prepared foods, and the secondary outcome was mean weekly calories per transaction purchased from similar packaged items (for substitution analyses). Analyses of prepared and packaged foods were stratified by food category (bakery, entrées and sides, or deli meats and cheeses).

Results

Among the included 173 supermarkets, calorie labeling was associated with a mean 5.1% decrease (95% CI, -5.8% to -4.4%) in calories per transaction purchased from prepared bakery items and an 11.0% decrease (95% CI, -11.9% to -10.1%) from prepared deli items, adjusted for changes in control foods; no changes were observed for prepared entrées and sides (change = 0.3%; 95% CI, -2.5% to 3.0%). Labeling was also associated with decreased calories per transaction purchased from packaged bakery items (change = -3.9%; 95% CI, -4.3% to -3.6%), packaged entrées and sides (change = -1.2%; 95% CI, -1.4% to -0.9%), and packaged deli items (change = -2.1%; 95% CI, -2.4% to -1.7%).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this longitudinal study of supermarkets, calorie labeling of prepared foods was associated with small to moderate decreases in calories purchased from prepared bakery and deli items without evidence of substitution to similar packaged foods.

### Equitability of individual and population interventions to reduce obesity: a modeling study in Mexico [^a6539a17]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Modeling studies have estimated the potential impact and cost effectiveness of interventions to reduce obesity; few have focused on their equity across socioeconomic groups. This study aims to compare the equitability of individual- and population-level interventions to reduce obesity in Mexico.

Methods

Mathematical models were implemented to estimate the expected effect of 2 sugar-sweetened beverage tax scenarios (10% and 20%) and bariatric surgery, pharmacotherapy, and dietary advice as individual interventions to reduce body weight. Individual interventions were modeled using meta-analytical weight change, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the probability of access to healthcare services. For the tax, investigators obtained the baseline consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages from the National Health Survey 2012 and applied the reduction in sales observed in 2016 to estimate the caloric change and weight reduction. Implementation costs and cost per person, per kilogram, and equity were calculated for all interventions over a 1-year timeframe.

Results

The 20% tax produced the largest estimated increase (4.50%) in normal BMI prevalence, was the most cost effective, and had the largest and most equitable decrease in obesity across socioeconomic categories. Pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery produced sizable decreases in obesity prevalence (3.68% and 1.18%), particularly among the middle and high socioeconomic groups, whereas dietary advice had the lowest impact on normal and obese categories.

Conclusions

Individual interventions were effective in reducing obesity; yet, they were more expensive and less equitable than population interventions. Obesity in Mexico affects all socioeconomic groups; available interventions need to be carefully analyzed to tailor a national strategy that is both effective and equitable.

### The role of the pediatrician in primary prevention of obesity [^3a5e8afe]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric obesity prevention — managing the food and activity environment — after an assessment of the current food environment has been performed, the family should be encouraged to buy fewer of the foods that are associated with the development of obesity, such as sweetened beverages (including fruit-flavored drinks), high-caloric-density snacks, or sweets. If these items are present in the house for special occasions or other purposes, they should be purchased immediately before the event and removed immediately afterward to decrease the temptation to snack on these items. In contrast, healthy alternatives, such as water pitchers, fruits, vegetable snacks, and other low-calorie snacks should be readily available at all times and placed in plain sight; for example, in front of the refrigerator or in large bowls on the kitchen counter or table. Practically, the cookie jar should be replaced by a fruit bowl.

### Children's arithmetic skills do not transfer between applied and academic mathematics [^e8e2b67b]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Working children effectively perform arithmetic operations

In this study (study 1), we tested whether children working in markets are able to perform complex arithmetic calculations as part of their daily jobs. We surveyed 201 children in Kolkata, West Bengal, working in markets (see the section 'Study 1' of the Methods). Undercover enumerators purchased unusual quantities of two goods from each child working at the store and paid with a bill that was worth more than the required amount. For example, the enumerators might ask how much 800 g of potatoes that the child sells at 20 rupees per kilogram costs and then how much 1.4 kg of onions that the child sells at 15 rupees per kilogram costs. They would then ask for the total cost (37 rupees in this case), before handing the child a 200 rupee note and collecting the change. Each of these steps was designed to measure the children's applied arithmetic skills. Afterwards, the enumerators revealed their identity and asked the participants to complete a set of abstract maths exercises.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^5eeb57a8]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary debates about drug pricing feature several widely held misconceptions, including the relationship between incentives and innovation, the proportion of total healthcare spending on pharmaceuticals, and whether the economic evaluation of a medicine can be influenced by things other than clinical efficacy.

Main body

All citizens should have access to timely, equitable, and cost-effective care covered by public funds, private insurance, or a combination of both. Better managing the collective burden of diseases borne by today's and future generations depends in part on developing better technologies, including better medicines. As in any innovative industry, the expectation of adequate financial returns incentivizes innovators and their investors to develop new medicines. Estimating expected returns requires that they forecast revenues, based on the future price trajectory and volume of use over time. How market participants decide what price to set or accept can be complicated, and some observers and stakeholders want to confirm whether the net prices society pays for novel medicines, whether as a reward for past innovation or an incentive for future innovation, are commensurate with those medicines' incremental value. But we must also ask "value to whom?"; medicines not only bring immediate clinical benefits to patients treated today, but also can provide a broad spectrum of short- and long-term benefits to patients, their families, and society. Spending across all facets of healthcare has grown over the last 25 years, but both inpatient and outpatient spending has outpaced drug spending growth even as our drug armamentarium is constantly improving with safer and more effective medicines. In large part, this is because, unlike hospitals, drugs typically go generic, thus making room in our budgets for new and better ones, even as they often keep patients out of hospitals, driving further savings.

Conclusion

A thorough evaluation of drug spending and value can help to promote a better allocation of healthcare resources for both the healthy and the sick, both of whom must pay for healthcare. Taking a holistic approach to assessing drug value makes it clear that a branded drug's value to a patient is often only a small fraction of the drug's total value to society. Societal value merits consideration when determining whether and how to make a medicine affordable and accessible to patients: a drug that is worth its price to society should not be rendered inaccessible to ill patients by imposing high out-of-pocket costs or restricting coverage based on narrow health technology assessments (HTAs). Furthermore, recognizing the total societal cost of un- or undertreated conditions is crucial to gaining a thorough understanding of what guides the biomedical innovation ecosystem to create value for society. It would be unwise to discourage the development of new solutions without first appreciating the cost of leaving the problems unsolved.

Net primary productivity

We measured above-ground litterfall, pruned oil palm fronds, rubber latex harvest, oil palm fruit harvest, and stem increment from March 2013 to April 2014. For litter collection, 16 litter traps (75 × 75 cm), made from polyvinyl chloride tube frames and nylon mesh (mesh size of 3 mm) and mounted on 1 m-long wooden stakes, were placed on each of the plots except in oil palm plantations (n = 24) in randomly selected grids in each plot. Litter collection was done at monthly intervals and the collected litter was sorted into leaves, small woody material (diameter < 2 cm), propagules and inflorescences, which were subsequently oven-dried for 72 h at 60°C until constant mass was attained. In the oil palm plantations, all pruned oil palm fronds on each plots were counted. The average dry weight per frond, obtained from 16 harvested and dried fronds, was used for the calculation of litter production. Oil palm was harvested every two weeks, while rubber was harvested at frequencies depending on season and expected productivity. The yield of oil palm fruits and rubber latex (in Mg ha⁻¹) was recorded by weighing the harvested fresh material for all trees in each plot. The dry weight was then determined after oven-drying representative sub-samples of oil palm fruits (five multiple fruits) and rubber latex (five harvest bowls) at 70 °C to constant mass. From these data and the area of the plots we obtained the yield as dry weight per hectare. Annual above-ground tree woody biomass production (Mg ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹) was calculated from stem increment, measured with dendrometer (UMS, München, Germany), of 40 trees per plot (960 trees in total). The cumulative biomass increment of each tree was calculated as the mass difference of a tree between March 2013 and April 2014, based on the allometric equations used for biomass estimation as described above. For a plot-based estimation of above-ground tree biomass, we applied mean increment rates per plot and tree species for the remaining tree individuals. An in-growth core measurement was conducted to estimate fine-root productivity in all plots, using the method described by Powell and Day. Sixteen in-growth cores per plot were installed at random locations (at 30 cm distance from the litter traps) and re-sampling of the cores was done after 8–10 months. The extracted soil cores were processed in the same manner as done for the fine-root inventory. The fine-root growth in the cores was extrapolated to one year and expressed in g dry mass produced per m² surface area per year, representing the annual fine-root production. To determine carbon stocks and carbon sequestration, the C concentration of stem wood, fine roots, dead wood, and litter fractions was analysed with a CN Analyzer (Vario EL III, Hanau, Germany) at the University of Göttingen.

Increasing access to healthy, affordable foods — community food retail strategies detail partners and store-level actions. The food retail environment has a significant impact on the health of communities, and a healthy food retail environment is one in which it is easier to make healthy choices by encouraging the purchase of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and other nutritious items, rather than energy-dense foods and beverages of low nutritional value. Community partners, including public health agencies, retailers and vendors, business leaders, health care systems and providers, local farmers, food pantries and banks, community development organizations, community members, and other stakeholders, can collaborate in a variety of ways to develop and maintain a healthy retail environment. Both full-service and smaller grocery stores can market and promote healthier choices through leveraging shelf labeling systems to help consumers identify healthier choices and place these items at eye level, in-store promotions of healthy options and recipes, and healthy checkout aisles that limit foods and beverages of low nutritional value. A store can also apply to become an approved vendor for federal nutrition assistance programs funded and administered through the USDA, which provides financial incentives to participants in federal nutrition assistance programs for the purchase of healthier options. Smaller stores face unique challenges, including difficulty meeting distributors' minimum order requirements to receive reasonable prices on healthy options, and working collaboratively, smaller stores can establish group purchasing collectives to increase purchasing power to facilitate the provision of healthier food and beverage options.

### Follow the money: a closer look at US tobacco industry marketing expenditures [^867e88a6]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

We also compare price discounting expenditures to changes in tobacco product prices and taxes. For cigarettes, we obtained average yearly retail prices (including generics) and tax data from the Tax Burden on Tobacco, which applies uniform practices and are available for the full period of this study. For smokeless tobacco, taxes take multiple forms and are more difficult to calculate, but price measures were developed using data from the FTC Smokeless Tobacco Report by summing the per-unit prices (sales/units) for each category of smokeless tobacco (chew, pouches, etc) weighted by each category's sales. To correct for price inflation, prices and taxes were inflated to 2019 dollars using the consumer price index. To gauge the relative importance of the three categories of marketing expenditures as separate from the impact of expected sales, we compared prices and taxes to price discounting and promotional allowances as per cent of marketing expenditures.

### Super-emitters in natural gas infrastructure are caused by abnormal process conditions [^89309b12]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Second, all of the 10⁴ Monte Carlo component-based emission distributions underestimate cumulative emissions relative to the observed site-based distribution data (Fig. 2c). As a consequence, our component-based aggregation yields lower cumulative emissions — especially from high-emitting sites. Cumulative emissions from the site-based distribution (31,000 kg CH₄ per hour 95% CI: 22,000–43,000 kg CH₄ per hour) are 1.5 times larger than those from the component-based aggregation (20,000 kg CH₄ per hour 95% CI: 19,000–22,000 kg CH₄ per hour). The disparity is especially pronounced for high-emitting sites. The highest emitting 1% of sites in the observed site-based distribution have cumulative emissions nine times larger than the component-based aggregation would predict (14,000 kg CH₄ per hour versus 1,500 kg CH₄ per hour, 95% CI: 460–3,800 kg CH₄ per hour). The relationships between component and site-based emissions characteristics in Fig. 2 are further examined in the Supplementary Information using a metric of disproportionality, affirming the insufficient contribution from high-emitting sites in the component-based aggregation (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

The component-based aggregation produces reasonable agreement with the observed site-based emission distribution for the lowest emitting ∼90% of sites (Fig. 2a). The small overestimation of cumulative emissions in the component-based aggregation for these sites could be an artefact of activity factors derived from the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) being unrepresentative for less complex sites with lower gas production rates (that is, less equipment per site than modelled). As 80% of cumulative site-based emissions comes from the last 10% of the distribution (Fig. 2c), the effect of overestimating emissions from low-emitting sites has little impact on our overall conclusions.

Third, 30% of Barnett production sites have instantaneous emission rates that exceed 1% of the natural gas they produce and account for 70% of total emissions (21,000 kg CH₄ per hour). Previous work showed that many sites with high instantaneous loss rates (emissions equal to 2–50% of gas production) also had high absolute emissions (20–300 kg CH₄ per hour); such sites were classified as 'functional super-emitters'.
