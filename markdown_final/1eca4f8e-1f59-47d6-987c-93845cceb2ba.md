## Question

What is leukodystrophy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what leukodystrophy is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and scope. Then, I should verify the pathophysiologic substrate. Next, I will classify the disorders pragmatically and by mechanism. After that, I need to quantify epidemiology. Then, I should review clinical manifestations and their variability. Next, I will examine the diagnostic approach, including MRI patterns and genomics. Then, I must outline disease-modifying and supportive treatments with timing considerations. Finally, I should identify key challenges, disparities, and advances that reshape care pathways [^1132uXTj].

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't drift into acquired mimics. Leukodystrophies are heritable disorders that primarily affect central nervous system white matter and share abnormalities of glial cells or the myelin sheath, with neuropathology often centered on oligodendrocytes and astrocytes rather than neurons per se [^114Z1ATs]. In clinical shorthand, they are genetically determined disorders that affect the development or maintenance of CNS myelin, and should be distinguished from acquired demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and related entities [^1136Y6vX] [^114Z1ATs]. Hold on, I should also note that while myelin is the unifying theme, some leukodystrophies include broader cellular dysfunction beyond myelin, reinforcing the concept that white matter integrity depends on multiple CNS cell types and pathways [^112UADDw].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiologic basis and ensure I separate hypomyelination from demyelination. The core problem is disruption of myelin architecture and homeostasis, arising from glial cell or myelin sheath abnormalities, with disease processes engaging oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and at times axonal components, which can be secondary but clinically relevant [^114Z1ATs]. Clinically and radiologically, this can reflect either hypomyelination, meaning a primary failure to achieve normal myelin deposition, or demyelination, meaning destruction of previously formed myelin, and this dichotomy has practical MRI correlates and diagnostic implications [^116G5aL2] [^115aQBKe]. Wait, let me verify one more nuance: emerging mechanistic work underscores cross-talk between pathways, so defects outside canonical myelin genes can still produce white matter degeneration, which matters for therapeutic targeting [^112UADDw].

> Next, I should review classification because it shapes diagnostic algorithms. Practically, MRI-based categories distinguish hypomyelinating from demyelinating patterns and guide the workup in concert with age of onset and clinical syndromes, though overlaps occur and stage of disease can blur patterns [^116G5aL2] [^115aQBKe]. I should confirm scope: the Global Leukodystrophy Initiative framework enumerated more than 30 leukodystrophies and over 61 genetic leukoencephalopathies, reflecting expanding gene discovery and justifying the broader "genetic white matter disorder" umbrella when myelin is not the primary locus of pathology [^114Z1ATs]. But wait, what if onset is adult? Adult-onset forms are well recognized and often progress more slowly than pediatric forms, necessitating tailored prognostication and sometimes different treatment windows [^111YygGc] [^1136Y6vX].

> I will now examine epidemiology, but I should double-check competing estimates. Reported frequency varies with ascertainment: estimates include approximately 1 in 4,700 live births and about 1 in 7,500 individuals overall, underscoring methodologic differences and underdiagnosis historically [^1136Y6vX] [^114Z1ATs]. For specific entities, I recall X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy at roughly 1 in 17,000 births, but wait, I should verify against newer consensus; recent guidelines cite a birth prevalence of about 1 in 15,000 across sexes, so I should acknowledge both figures and the likely impact of newborn screening on apparent prevalence [^112PJ8oZ] [^1111rFYA]. For metachromatic leukodystrophy, European prevalence is about 1.47 per 100,000, and some Asian cohorts report around 3 per 100,000 live births for leukodystrophies collectively, again reflecting population differences and detection practices [^111268MV] [^115aQBKe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about phenotype uniformity; clinical manifestations are heterogeneous. Motor and cognitive difficulties are common anchors, with pyramidal signs that are often symmetric and predominate in the lower limbs leading to spasticity and limited ambulation, and extrapyramidal features such as dystonia in selected subtypes; seizures can be an early hallmark in some, like Alexander disease, or emerge later, and ataxia, bulbar symptoms, and neurobehavioral changes are variably present depending on the disorder and age at onset [^113p3vN5]. I need to ensure age modifies expectations: leukodystrophies can present from infancy through adulthood with different tempos; generally, earlier-onset forms progress faster, while adult-onset forms like adult MLD show slower deterioration and better long-term survival, impacting therapeutic timing and trial design [^1136Y6vX] [^111YygGc]. Let me reconsider seizures specifically; infantile-onset entities such as Krabbe and late-infantile MLD have higher seizure burdens and refractoriness, whereas in ALD seizures are rarely the first symptom, a nuance relevant for triage and counseling [^1145XYBN].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach methodically so we avoid misclassification. The foundation is a careful history and neurologic examination integrated with MRI pattern analysis and targeted laboratory studies, including metabolic assays and electrophysiology when relevant, alongside genetic testing to secure an etiologic diagnosis and exclude acquired mimics early in the process [^116G5aL2] [^111HZ1C4]. I should confirm that pediatric practice mirrors this: pediatric guidance also emphasizes that diagnosis rests on clinical features plus radiology and laboratory data, with genetic confirmation when possible, and the speed of diagnosis matters given therapeutic windows [^1136Y6vX]. But wait, what if the MRI is not definitive? A structured reporting approach keyed to developmental myelination patterns and established diagnostic frameworks can reduce misses and highlight non-leukodystrophy differentials that would alter management [^111voDSq].

> I will now examine MRI more closely because it is central to triage. Conventional sequences with axial and sagittal T1-weighted, axial T2-weighted, and FLAIR images enable pattern recognition that is often powerful enough, when combined with clinical context, to narrow to a short differential or strongly suggest a specific leukodystrophy; serial imaging at intervals, and post-contrast T1 in selected contexts, refine interpretation over time [^116G5aL2]. Let me verify the role of quantitative MRI; while advanced measures like myelin water imaging correlate with microstructural pathology and clinical measures and can help in atypical or unsolved cases, they currently add limited incremental diagnostic value compared to conventional MRI pattern analysis in most patients and are sensitive to disease stage and severity [^111xp9eh]. Historically, MR spectroscopy and other advanced techniques have provided metabolic insights and may supplement conventional MRI in select scenarios, but they are adjuncts rather than replacements in current algorithms [^1127Bb8M].

> Hold on, I should confirm the contribution of genomics, since yield dictates test selection. First-line genome sequencing outperforms standard-of-care testing in pediatric white matter disorders, delivering diagnostic efficacy of roughly 56–61% versus 0–22% with standard testing in a randomized time-delayed design, shortening time to diagnosis and achieving a combined diagnostic yield near 76.5% within four months when both approaches are integrated [^1174JDcv]. Whole exome sequencing resolves about 35–42% of unresolved white matter cohorts, and targeted or focused exome approaches in adults can achieve around a quarter definite diagnoses with room for reanalysis as new genes are discovered [^111fRCQt] [^1141Gu1v]. I should double-check pediatric targeted panels as well; expanded panels or exome-based approaches report yields around 60% in selected cohorts with MRI-defined leukodystrophy or genetic leukoencephalopathy, emphasizing early recourse to next-generation sequencing when biochemistry is non-diagnostic [^115yciK3].

> Next, I should outline disease-modifying options and their timing, being careful about indications. For cerebral ALD, early-stage inflammatory demyelination can be stabilized with timely allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, making HCT the treatment of choice when eligibility criteria are met, and adrenal insufficiency requires prompt hormone replacement irrespective of neurologic status [^1111rFYA] [^113GVkSQ]. Let me verify broader transplant indications; selected leukodystrophies such as MLD and Krabbe may benefit from hematopoietic cell transplantation if initiated presymptomatically or very early, although use outside established indications carries significant risk and cost, reinforcing the need for careful selection in specialized centers [^116yFofJ] [^117Y4xmD]. Gene therapy has moved from concept to clinical reality for early-onset MLD with autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy now authorized in multiple regions, and both transplant and gene therapy achieve the best outcomes when administered before overt disease or early in its course, which raises the stakes for fast diagnosis and surveillance of at-risk siblings [^115aEXuV] [^115zXVFp].

> I need to ensure supportive and preventive care are not overlooked, since most patients still rely on symptomatic management. Multidisciplinary care models improve quality of life and survival in progressive neurologic diseases and are considered the gold standard for leukodystrophies; consensus statements provide systems-based guidance on preventing complications and managing common issues such as spasticity, seizures, pain, nutrition, and respiratory care [^117EHwRx] [^113ihdLJ]. Hold on, I should emphasize timing of palliative care involvement; early integration of palliative principles facilitates goals-of-care discussions, caregiver support, and symptom control alongside disease-directed therapies in these complex, resource-intensive disorders [^117EHwRx].

> Let me now consider monitoring and public health levers that shape outcomes. In ALD, regular surveillance for primary adrenal insufficiency and MRI monitoring to detect conversion to cerebral disease are standard-of-care in male patients due to unpredictable penetrance and age of onset, and consensus guidelines codify these intervals while acknowledging remaining knowledge gaps [^113GVkSQ] [^1111rFYA]. Newborn screening has transformed case ascertainment: X-ALD is included in the majority of U.S. state programs and several countries, enabling presymptomatic detection and timely intervention but bringing challenges such as management of variants of uncertain significance and decisions about screening females [^111nadUt]. I should also double-check MLD newborn screening; early programs using sulfatides and ARSA activity are underway or launching, with the clinical imperative of identifying infants eligible for early gene therapy, though population-level detection experience remains limited so far [^1117otku].

> But wait, what about systemic challenges that derail ideal care pathways? Diagnostic delays have historically spanned years with low yields, although first-line genome sequencing trials now demonstrate that rapid, high-yield diagnosis is feasible and should inform algorithms and payer policy [^1174JDcv]. Access disparities by geography, sex, and health system resources affect diagnosis and treatment access, with higher diagnostic likelihood at centers of excellence and lower likelihood in health professional shortage areas, and with sex-based and regional disparities documented in MLD care and HSCT availability across Europe and beyond [^116JgjXT] [^114Zaxpb]. I should confirm the state of the science: advances in biomarker discovery, pathomechanistic understanding, and a pipeline of targeted therapies and clinical trials are reshaping prognosis, and international collaborations and care networks are critical to translate these gains into equitable outcomes [^1132uXTj] [^112UADDw] [^114x8Znb].

> Final synthesis: Let me step back and verify coherence. Leukodystrophies are genetically mediated white matter disorders unified by myelin and glial dysfunction but diversified by mechanisms, age of onset, and clinical course; diagnostic strategies hinge on expert MRI pattern recognition integrated with rapid genomic testing and selective biochemistry, while treatment increasingly includes time-critical disease-modifying options for specific subtypes alongside multidisciplinary supportive care and structured surveillance, especially in ALD, and the field is rapidly evolving through newborn screening, therapeutics, and collaborative networks, all of which demand early recognition and coordinated care to optimize outcomes [^1136Y6vX] [^1132uXTj].

Leukodystrophies are **genetic disorders of CNS white matter** [^114Z1ATs] with progressive neurodegeneration [^116KNCZi] and high morbidity and mortality [^1136Y6vX]. They present with motor and cognitive decline, spasticity, ataxia, seizures, and peripheral neuropathy [^113p3vN5], with onset ranging from infancy to adulthood [^11642UD9]. Diagnosis relies on **MRI pattern recognition and genetic testing** [^113p3vN5], with WES/WGS improving yield and speed [^116G5aL2] [^1174JDcv] [^111fRCQt]. Early **HSCT** [^113GVkSQ] or **gene therapy** [^115aEXuV] [^114Zaxpb] can alter outcomes in select leukodystrophies when given presymptomatically; otherwise, management is supportive and multidisciplinary [^113ihdLJ]. Prognosis varies by type and age at onset, with earlier onset linked to faster progression and higher mortality [^111YygGc].

---

## Classification and genetic basis

Leukodystrophies are classified by **myelin pathology** and underlying genetic defects:

- **Demyelinating leukodystrophies**: Loss of previously formed myelin [^1125TZVP] (e.g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy) [^113GVkSQ].
- **Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies**: Inadequate myelin formation [^116G5aL2] (e.g. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, POLR3-related leukodystrophy) [^113nRzML].
- **Astrocytopathies**: Astrocyte dysfunction [^114KYgP8] (e.g. Alexander disease) [^114KYgP8].

Genetically, leukodystrophies are typically **autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked**, and result from mutations in genes encoding myelin proteins, enzymes, or metabolic pathways [^114Z1ATs] [^116KNCZi].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Clinical features are **heterogeneous** [^11642UD9] and progressive, varying by type and age at onset:

- **Motor symptoms**: Spasticity, ataxia, dystonia, motor regression, gait abnormalities [^113p3vN5].
- **Cognitive symptoms**: Cognitive decline, developmental delay [^113p3vN5], behavioral changes [^11642UD9].
- **Seizures**: Common, often refractory in advanced disease [^1145XYBN] [^114Z1ATs].
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Frequent in demyelinating forms [^113p3vN5] [^1125TZVP].
- **Non-neurological symptoms**: Adrenal insufficiency (X-ALD) [^113GVkSQ], endocrine abnormalities (POLR3-related leukodystrophy) [^116WD4fo].

---

## Diagnostic approaches

Diagnosis requires a **multimodal approach** [^116G5aL2]:

- **Clinical evaluation**: Detailed history, neurological exam, and family history [^113p3vN5].
- **Neuroimaging**: MRI is central [^116G5aL2], with characteristic patterns aiding diagnosis [^111voDSq]; advanced techniques (DTI, MRS) provide additional insights [^114EM4bG].
- **Genetic testing**: Targeted panels, WES, or WGS [^1174JDcv] identify causative mutations and increase diagnostic yield [^111fRCQt] [^113p3vN5].
- **Biochemical testing**: Enzyme assays and metabolic profiles support diagnosis [^1125TZVP].

---

## Treatment and management

Most leukodystrophies have **no cures** [^117N3geh]; management is supportive and multidisciplinary. Supportive care includes symptom control for spasticity, seizures, and pain, along with rehabilitation [^113ihdLJ], nutritional support, and palliative care [^117EHwRx]. Disease-specific therapies such as HSCT or gene therapy [^114Zaxpb] can benefit select leukodystrophies (e.g. MLD, X-ALD) when initiated early [^115aEXuV] [^113GVkSQ]. Emerging approaches under investigation [^1132uXTj] include gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, and enzyme replacement [^114fHxca].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **type and age at onset**, with **early-onset forms** [^111YygGc] characterized by rapid progression, severe disability, and high mortality, whereas **adult-onset forms** tend to progress more slowly, with better survival and later disability [^111YygGc].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **early diagnosis** [^1132uXTj] and novel therapies. Genetic research seeks to identify new genes and refine genotype-phenotype correlations [^113p3vN5] [^1174JDcv]. Therapeutic development includes gene therapy [^115aEXuV], enzyme replacement, and small molecules [^114fHxca]. Clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of emerging treatments [^113p3vN5] [^1132uXTj].

---

Leukodystrophies are **genetic white matter disorders** with progressive neurodegeneration [^116KNCZi]. Early diagnosis and **multidisciplinary care** are essential, and emerging therapies offer hope for improved outcomes [^1132uXTj].

### Leukodystrophies in children: Diagnosis, care, and treatment [^1136Y6vX]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a group of genetically determined disorders that affect the development or maintenance of central nervous system myelin. They have an incidence of at least 1 in 4,700 live births and are associated with significant morbidity and an elevated risk of early death. This report includes a discussion of the various types of leukodystrophies, their prevalence, clinical presentation, symptoms, and diagnosis, as well as potential future treatments.

Leukodystrophies can present at any age from infancy to adulthood, showing variability in disease progression and clinical presentation, which can range from developmental delay to seizures and spasticity. Diagnosis is based on a combination of patient history, examination, and radiologic and laboratory findings, including genetic testing. Although there are few cures available, significant opportunities exist for improved patient care and well-being.

Rapid advances in imaging and diagnostics, alongside the emergence of and requirement for timely treatments, underscore the necessity for pediatricians and other care providers for children to understand leukodystrophies. Additionally, the inclusion of leukodystrophy screening in newborn screening programs highlights the critical importance of timely intervention.

### Practical approaches and knowledge gaps in the care for children with leukodystrophies [^114Z1ATs]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that affect the white matter of the central nervous system, with or without peripheral nervous system involvement. This does not include acquired central nervous system myelin disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and related acquired central nervous system demyelinating processes. In 2015, Vanderver et al. classified more than 30 diseases as leukodystrophies and more than 61 as genetic leukoencephalopathies. This operational definition was used:

Leukodystrophies are heritable disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system, with or without peripheral nervous system involvement. These disorders have in common glial cell or myelin sheath abnormalities. Where known, neuropathology is primarily characterized by the involvement of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and other non-neuronal cell types. In many disorders, the mechanism of disease remains unknown, although in other cases it is suspected to include significant axonal pathology.

Approximately 1 in 7,500 individuals are affected by leukodystrophies, many of which are neurodegenerative. While there are many differences between individual leukodystrophies, there are core commonalities in the neurologic care required for children affected by these diseases. Focusing on these neurologic symptoms may improve quality of life and guide future research for children and families living with a leukodystrophy.

A knowledgeable medical team can proactively anticipate potential complications, limit such complications when possible, and provide famili.

### Update on leukodystrophies and developing trials [^113p3vN5]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

The neurological signs and symptoms observed in leukodystrophies are diverse and provide valuable insights into the underlying conditions. Hypomyelinating forms are characterized by delayed motor milestone acquisition, while demyelinating forms tend to show motor regression.

The most common symptoms are motor and cognitive difficulties. Pyramidal symptoms tend to be symmetrical, starting in the lower extremities and leading to spasticity and limited ambulatory abilities. Extrapyramidal movement disorders, such as dystonia, are commonly found in leukodystrophies, such as hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-6 (HABC); seizures can either be early symptoms, as seen in Alexander disease (AxD) and vanishing white matter disease (VWM), or may occur in later stages. Gait abnormalities can present as an isolated slowly progressive ataxia, such as in metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), or more often are associated with peripheral sensory neuropathy, as in leukodystrophy with calcifications and cyst (LCC) and leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL). Peripheral neuropathy can be one of the first manifestations in some leukodystrophies, such as Krabbe disease, and is also usually present in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX), Pelizaeus–Merzbacher disease (PMD), and Pelizaeus–Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD). Bulbar symptoms can often occur along with other neurological findings in conditions such as MLD, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), Canavan disease, and AxD. Neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as irritability, are seen in Krabbe disease and Aicardi–Goutieres syndrome (AGS).

### Whole exome sequencing in patients with white matter abnormalities [^111fRCQt]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Here we report whole exome sequencing (WES) on a cohort of 71 patients with persistently unresolved white matter abnormalities with a suspected diagnosis of leukodystrophy or genetic leukoencephalopathy. WES analyses were performed on trio, or greater, family groups. Diagnostic pathogenic variants were identified in 35% (25 of 71 patients). Potentially pathogenic variants were identified in clinically relevant genes in a further 7% (5 of 71 cases), giving a total yield of clinical diagnoses in 42% of individuals. These findings provide evidence that WES can substantially decrease the number of unresolved white matter cases.

### Revised consensus statement on the preventive and symptomatic care of patients with leukodystrophies [^113ihdLJ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017).

Leukodystrophies are a broad class of genetic disorders that result in the disruption or destruction of central myelination. Although the mechanisms underlying these disorders are heterogeneous, many common symptoms affect patients irrespective of the genetic diagnosis. The comfort and quality of life of these children is a primary goal that can complement efforts directed at curative therapies. This report contains a systems-based approach to managing complications resulting from leukodystrophies.

We discuss the initial evaluation, identification of common medical issues, and management options to establish a comprehensive, standardized care approach. We also address clinical topics relevant to select leukodystrophies, such as gallbladder pathology and adrenal insufficiency. The recommendations within this review rely on existing studies and consensus opinions and underscore the need for future research on evidence-based outcomes to better treat the manifestations of this unique set of genetic disorders.

### Metachromatic leukodystrophy: New therapy advancements and emerging research directions [^114Zaxpb]. Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Disparities regarding diagnosis and treatment accessibility are evident. Underdiagnosis of rare diseases is more common among minority ethnic and racial groups, including leukodystrophies. Sex-based discrimination also affects the diagnosis of leukodystrophy, with male patients being 1.35 times more likely to receive a diagnosis compared with female patients. Limited access to diagnostic tools contributes to the issue of underdiagnosis. Basic diagnostic methods, such as MRI or biochemical/genetic testing, are difficult to access in many countries, creating additional barriers for early treatment.

Significant work is still needed to improve treatment accessibility, even in Europe. A web-based European Union (EU) survey showed that HSCT is only available in 23 of 30 countries in Europe for MLD, with 1–3 treatment centers per country. Consensus guidelines for treatment initiations are not universally followed, with symptomatic late-infantile patients receiving HSCT in some European centers. The availability of HSC-GT is limited to qualified treatment centers, which all accept international referrals. In the EU, regulation on cross-border patient care allows patients to travel to other EU countries for treatments with limited availability, fostering access to innovative treatments; still, those treatments and indications are not universally known. To improve access to expert advice independent from the country of residence, the MLD initiative and the European Reference Network "Rare Neurological Diseases" have established a European treatment eligibility board to discuss treatment indications.

### Natural history of adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy [^111YygGc]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

In terms of disease progression, we showed that adult-onset MLD had significantly better survival rates and delayed neurological deterioration compared to pediatric forms. In our cohort, the adult-onset forms had an overall survival rate of over 90% 10 years after symptom onset, compared to approximately 40% in late-infantile forms and 75% in early-juvenile forms. Furthermore, about 75% of the adult-onset patients in our cohort did not exhibit severe disability after 10 years, whereas in the late-infantile and early-juvenile forms, this proportion was less than 20%. However, the limitations of our study include its retrospective nature, the heterogeneity of data acquisition across different centers, and the use of gross milestones to measure clinical progression.

The slow progression in adult-onset MLD we demonstrated in this study must be taken into account when discussing specific treatment indications (HSCT or ex vivo gene therapy) that can take several months before showing a clinical response. Indeed, the time frame for therapeutic intervention may be larger than in the pediatric population. Our data may also be of interest to improve the design of future therapeutic trials in the specific adult-onset MLD population.

### Quantitative MRI distinguishes different leukodystrophies and correlates with clinical measures [^111xp9eh]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The imaging protocol used is quite lengthy. The omission of either MCR-DIMWI or METRICS would shorten the protocol by approximately 10 minutes. We chose to acquire both inherently different techniques, as comparable results would make our findings more robust. The sensitivity of both techniques for pathological changes is similar. The advantage of MCR-DIMWI is the stronger correlation with clinical measures, while the advantage of METRICS is that it facilitates visualization of the T2 distributions. More in-depth quantitative analyses on the peak location or full-width half maximum of myelin water could be performed in future studies.

Leukodystrophies share preferential white matter involvement, but each leukodystrophy is characterized by its individual underlying pathology details, which implies that quantitative measures could also be useful for diagnostic purposes. However, MRI pattern recognition using conventional sequences, combined with clinical information and genetic testing, is so powerful in rapidly establishing the correct diagnosis that the contribution of quantitative measures will likely remain limited, also because these measures are dependent on disease stage and severity. There are still low numbers of leukodystrophies without a specific diagnosis, and in those cases, quantitative MRI measures may be helpful in classifying them according to underlying pathology.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that MRI measures quantitatively reflect different microstructural components of the underlying pathology and correlate with clinical measures.

### Hereditary leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids: A spectrum of phenotypes from CNS vasculitis to parkinsonism in an adult onset leukodystrophy series [^1133jsh5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

There are at least 30 different leukodystrophies that can present in adulthood, many of which have similar or even indistinguishable presentations, making accurate diagnosis challenging. The presence of axonal spheroids, pigmented cells, and white matter degeneration in diagnostic brain biopsies is highly variable, subject to regional predilection for pathology, sampling bias, and disease stage. Diagnostic brain biopsies should ideally include the full thickness of the cortex and underlying white matter to reduce the sampling bias. In many cases, extensive and expensive testing is required to make a diagnosis.

Our study confirms previous findings that CSF1R mutations are a relatively common cause of adult onset leukodystrophy and that CSF1R mutations can lead to diverse phenotypes and can mimic many other neurological diseases, including CNS vasculitis. As the phenotype of CSF1R mutations continues to be refined, we recommend that patients who present with a possible CNS vasculitis or undiagnosed adult onset leukodystrophy be screened early for mutations in CSF1R, and this should not be limited to patients with typical neuropsychiatric or parkinsonian presentations. The early detection of a known pathogenic CSF1R mutation may negate the need for a brain biopsy and its associated risks. Early genetic diagnosis in affected individuals will help guide clinician discussions around prognostication, genetic risk in other family members, and reproductive counselling in families.

In addition, where a brain biopsy has been performed for a suspected CNS vasculitis and a diagnosis not achieved, genetic testing for CSF1R should be considered.

### Update on leukodystrophies and developing trials [^1132uXTj]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The field of leukodystrophies has made significant advances recently, including improved diagnostic approaches, more accurate prognostic predictions, and a myriad of novel therapeutic options. A better characterization of the underlying pathomechanisms, along with the identification of appropriate biomarkers, is crucial for the design of effective targeted treatments. It is essential for healthcare professionals and researchers to stay current on these advancements and incorporate them into clinical practice to enhance the diagnosis, management, and treatment of patients with leukodystrophies.

This review offers healthcare professionals an understanding of leukodystrophies, including clinical and genetic aspects. It also highlights ongoing clinical trials and emerging therapies with the potential to improve patient management and outcomes. Continued research and collaboration are vital for further progress in understanding and addressing the challenges associated with these complex diseases.

### Randomized clinical trial of first-line genome sequencing in pediatric white matter disorders [^1174JDcv]. Annals of Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied. A prospective time-delayed crossover design trial of GS assessed its efficacy as a first-line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders between December 1, 2015, and September 27, 2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for four months followed by GS.

Thirty-four individuals were assessed at interim review. The genetic origin of two patients' leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients were stratified to the immediate intervention group, and 23 patients to the delayed-GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the immediate (5/9 [56%] vs. 0/9 [0%]; Wild-Seber, p < 0.005) and delayed (control) arms (14/23 [61%] vs. 5/23 [22%]; Wild-Seber, p < 0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate-GS group (log-rank test, p = 0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5%, 95% confidence interval = 58.8–89.3%) in less than four months, greater than historical norms of less than 50% over five years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single-arm observational study.

In this study, first-line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders. We provide an evidence-based diagnostic testing algorithm to enable appropriate clinical GS utilization in this population.

### National variation in costs and mortality for leukodystrophy patients in US children's hospitals [^116d3sSq]. Pediatric neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Inherited leukodystrophies are progressive, debilitating neurological disorders with few treatment options and high mortality rates. Our objective was to determine national variation in the costs for leukodystrophy patients and to evaluate differences in their care.

Methods

We developed an algorithm to identify inherited leukodystrophy patients in deidentified data sets using a recursive tree model based on International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, diagnosis and procedure charge codes. Validation of the algorithm was performed independently at two institutions, and with data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) of 43 US children's hospitals, for a 7-year period between 2004 and 2010.

Results

A recursive algorithm was developed and validated, based on six International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, codes and one procedure code that had a sensitivity up to 90% (range 61–90%) and a specificity up to 99% (range 53–99%) for identifying inherited leukodystrophy patients. Inherited leukodystrophy patients comprise 0.4% of admissions to children's hospitals and 0.7% of costs. During 7 years, these patients required $411 million of hospital care, or $131,000/patient. Hospital costs for leukodystrophy patients varied at different institutions, ranging from two to 15 times more than the average pediatric patient. There was a statistically significant correlation between higher volume and increased cost efficiency. Increased mortality rates had an inverse relationship with increased patie

### International recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with adrenoleukodystrophy: A consensus-based approach [^111XyeZr]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

- **Search strategy and selection criteria**: We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews for relevant publications on the diagnosis, clinical surveillance, and treatment of patients with adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). No medical librarian was involved. The search was limited to full-text availability in English and a publication date from 1990 to 2019. The search terms used included "adrenoleukodystrophy", "x-linked adrenoleukodystrophy", and "X-ALD". For the syntax of the search, refer to page 9 of the literature review report provided as supplementary data (eMethods).

	- In addition, we conducted a gray literature search of internet-based sources and extended the search with snowballing. The gray literature search included GeneReviews, UpToDate, ClinicalKey, The International Leukodystrophy Association (or Global Leukodystrophy Initiative), ALD.info, and the Society for the Study of Inborn Errors of Metabolism. To provide updated data at the time of writing, published data not captured in full-text publications were also included from recent conference proceedings and summits, including the ALD Connect annual meeting, the European Pediatric Neurology Society meeting, the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy annual meeting, the United Leukodystrophy Foundation conference, and the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting. All articles on ALD involving human participants were included, and nonhuman (animal) studies were excluded. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the literature review report (eMethods).

### Newborn screening for adrenoleukodystrophy: International experiences and challenges [^111nadUt]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD) is the most common leukodystrophy, with an estimated incidence of around 1 in 17,000 and a variable phenotype. Following the passage of Aiden's Law, New York became the first state to implement a newborn screening for XALD in 2013. Since then, 38 American states, Taiwan, and the Netherlands have included XALD in their newborn screening (NBS) programs, and Japan and Italy have ongoing pilot studies.

Screening for XALD allows for early, potentially lifesaving treatment of adrenal insufficiency and cerebral demyelination but is a complex subject due to our limited understanding of the natural history and lack of prognostic biomarkers. Screening protocols and algorithms vary between countries and states. Results and experiences gained so far are important for the future implementation of XALD NBS in other countries.

In this review, we have examined the algorithms, methodologies, and outcomes used, as well as how common challenges are addressed in countries and states with experience in NBS for XALD. We identified 14 peer-reviewed reports on NBS for XALD. All studies presented methods for detecting XALD at birth by NBS using a combination of mass spectrometry and ABCD1 gene sequencing. This has allowed for early surveillance of presymptomatic XALD patients and the possibility for early detection and timely treatment of XALD manifestations.

Obstacles to NBS for XALD include how to deal with variants of unknown significance, whether to screen females, and the ethical concerns of an NBS for a disease where we have limited understanding of natural history.

### Etiologic spectrum of pediatric-onset leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies: The five-year experience of a tertiary care center in southern India [^111coqDe]. Pediatric neurology (2024). Low credibility.

White matter (WM) disorders with a genetic etiology are classified as leukodystrophies (LDs) and genetic leukoencephalopathies (GLEs). There are very few studies pertaining to the etiologic spectrum of these disorders in the Asian Indian population.

- **Methods**: This study was conducted over a period of five years from January 2016 to December 2020, in the medical genetics department of a tertiary care hospital in southern India. A total of 107 patients up to age 18 years, with a diagnosis of a genetic WM disorder confirmed by molecular genetic testing and/or metabolic testing, were included in the study and categorized into either the LD or GLE group as per the classification suggested by the Global Leukodystrophy Initiative consortium in 2015.

- **Results**: Forty-one patients were diagnosed to have LDs, and 66 patients had GLEs. The two most common LDs were metachromatic LD (16 patients) and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (seven patients). In the GLE group, lysosomal storage disorders were the most common (40 patients), followed by mitochondrial disorders (nine patients), with other metabolic disorders and miscellaneous conditions making up the rest. The clinical presentations, neuroimaging findings, and mutation spectrum of the patients in our cohort are discussed.

- **Conclusions**: This is one of the largest cohorts of genetic WM disorders reported to date from the Asian Indian population. The etiologies and clinical presentations identified in our study cohort are similar to those found in other Indian studies, as well as in studies based on other populations from different parts.

### International recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with adrenoleukodystrophy: A consensus-based approach [^113GVkSQ]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Pathogenic variants in the ABCD1 gene cause adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a progressive metabolic disorder characterized by three core clinical syndromes: a slowly progressive myeloneuropathy, a rapidly progressive inflammatory leukodystrophy (cerebral ALD), and primary adrenal insufficiency. These syndromes are not present in all individuals and are not related to genotype. Cerebral ALD and adrenal insufficiency require early detection and intervention and warrant clinical surveillance because of variable penetrance and age at onset. Newborn screening has increased the number of presymptomatic individuals under observation, but clinical surveillance protocols vary.

A consensus-based modified Delphi approach among 28 international ALD experts was used to develop best-practice recommendations for diagnosis, clinical surveillance, and treatment of patients with ALD. We identified 39 discrete areas of consensus. Regular monitoring to detect the onset of adrenal failure and conversion to cerebral ALD is recommended in all male patients. Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the treatment of choice for cerebral ALD. This guideline addresses a clinical need in the ALD community worldwide as the number of overall diagnoses and presymptomatic individuals is increasing because of newborn screening and greater availability of next-generation sequencing. The poor ability to predict the disease course informs monitoring intervals but remains subject to change as more data emerge. This knowledge gap should direct future research and illustrates once again that international collaboration is essential.

### Lysosomal leukodystrophies lysosomal storage diseases associated with white matter abnormalities [^1125TZVP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The leukodystrophies are a group of genetic metabolic diseases characterized by abnormal development or progressive degeneration of the myelin sheath. The myelin is a complex sheath composed of several macromolecules covering axons as an insulator. Each of the leukodystrophies is caused by mutations in genes encoding enzymes involved in myelin production and maintenance.

The lysosomal storage diseases are inborn disorders of compartmentalized cellular organelles, with broad clinical manifestations secondary to the progressive accumulation of undegraded macromolecules within lysosomes and related organelles. There are more than 60 different lysosomal storage diseases; however, collectively, the incidence of lysosomal storage diseases is just over 1 in 2500 live births.

The majority of lysosomal storage diseases are associated with neurologic manifestations including developmental delay, seizures, acroparesthesia, motor weakness, and extrapyramidal signs. These inborn organelle disorders show wide clinical variability affecting individuals from all age groups. In addition to several neurologic, also known as neuronopathic, lysosomal storage diseases are associated with some level of white matter disease, which often triggers the diagnostic investigation.

Most lysosomal storage diseases are autosomal recessively inherited, and a few are X-linked, with females being at risk of presenting with mild but clinically relevant neurologic manifestations. Biochemical assays are the basis of diagnosis and are usually confirmed by molecular genetic testing.

### Practical approaches and knowledge gaps in the care for children with leukodystrophies [^117EHwRx]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Children living with a leukodystrophy often have significant medical needs that require a multidisciplinary team. Multidisciplinary care is considered the gold standard model of care for many neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), particularly those that are progressive and profoundly debilitating. Studies have shown that the quality of life and survival rates are better for patients treated in multidisciplinary clinics than in isolated clinics.

Due to the rare nature of these diseases, children usually do not have a leukodystrophy expert nearby. Consequently, many children either lack a leukodystrophy expert on their medical team or must travel great distances to an academic medical center with specialty clinics, all in addition to their local medical providers. Children requiring daily nursing, therapies, and accommodations in school have additional needs, adding further layers of providers and caregivers.

In order to enhance patient quality of life for as long as possible, an early referral to a palliative care specialist is recommended. In cases where one is not readily accessible, we advocate for clinical practice informed by palliative care principles. Palliative care is not only helpful for end-of-life situations; it can also facilitate discussions about medical issues and goals of care, as well as support families. As parents and guardians are the principal sources of care, it is crucial to provide comprehensive support and guidance.

### Lmnb1-related autosomal-dominant leukodystrophy: Clinical and radiological course [^113ycfWV]. Annals of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were increased or simulated normal values in affected areas of the cerebral white matter (Figs 8 and 9), but the abnormal area could sometimes look smaller than in morphological T2-weighted images. Pathological areas in cerebellar peduncles did not show ADC changes in 5 of 10 subjects. Periventricular ADC values were initially lower than in more peripheral affected white matter (Fig 8C), but they increased during disease progression, resulting in a reverse ADC pattern (Fig 9C), at least partially, in 5 subjects. ADC values were never lower than in normal brain.

No pathological enhancement was noted after contrast medium administration. Starting in the fifth decade, there was a progressive loss of white matter leading to widening of ventricles and peripheral CSF spaces. Cortical thickness was relatively well preserved.

### Pediatric neurodegenerative white matter processes: Leukodystrophies and beyond [^115jFVMe]. Pediatric Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Pediatric neurodegenerative white matter processes are complex and numerous, resulting from a vast array of causes ranging from white matter injury or inflammation to congenital metabolic disorders. When faced with a neurodegenerative white matter process on neuroimaging, the first step for the radiologist is to determine whether the findings represent a congenital metabolic leukodystrophy or one of various other white matter processes.

This review first describes a general approach to neurodegenerative white matter disorders and briefly discusses a few white matter diseases that mimic metabolic leukodystrophies. In the second half of the review, an approach to distinguishing and classifying white matter leukodystrophies is discussed.

### Update on genetic disorders affecting white matter [^113EpnBU]. Pediatric Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The classification of diseases affecting white matter has changed dramatically with the use of magnetic resonance imaging. Classical leukodystrophies, such as metachromatic leukodystrophy and Krabbe's disease, account for only a small number of inherited diseases that affect white matter. Magnetic resonance imaging has clarified genetic disorders that result in white matter changes or leukoencephalopathies. The term leukoencephalopathy is used to reflect the broader number of diseases that may cause either primary or secondary changes in myelin development.

This review attempts to categorize white matter disorders into classes such as lipid, myelin protein, organic acids, and defects in energy metabolism, in addition to other causes.

### Practical approaches and knowledge gaps in the care for children with leukodystrophies [^1145XYBN]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Seizures tend to occur more frequently in the earlier-onset (infantile) leukodystrophies but can also be seen in juvenile- and adult-onset forms. Seizures can occur at any stage of the disease but tend to be more refractory in advanced stages, and they can start months to years after the initial onset of neurologic symptoms. Specifically, seizures are the first symptom in fewer than 5% of adrenoleukodystrophy patients, while for infantile Krabbe and late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, seizures can be more frequent and at times intractable. Interestingly, seizures are a common first presentation of Alexander disease. In many of the more recently characterized leukodystrophies, the occurrence of seizures has not yet been well-documented.

A challenge among the leukodystrophies is that white matter disease leads to frequent behavioral changes, staring spells, and myoclonus that are not necessarily epileptic. Seizure management is further challenged by behavioral issues themselves: these issues could be seizure manifestations or could instead have been exacerbated by recent seizures or by antiseizure medication side effects. For these reasons, we propose that seizure management in children with a leukodystrophy follow general guidelines for otherwise healthy children, while respecting the vulnerabilities of advanced disease and unique features of specific leukodystrophies.

### Magnetic resonance techniques in the assessment of myelin and myelination [^1127Bb8M]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophy is a common central nervous system manifestation of inborn errors of metabolism. Until magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) emerged as a clinical tool, the diagnosis of leukodystrophy was difficult and imprecise; however, MRI has allowed for new understandings and classifications of leukodystrophies that have greatly enhanced both our diagnostic ability and our understanding of these complex disorders. Optimal use of MRI in this setting requires a fundamental understanding of myelin structure, myelin development, and the changes seen on MRI with myelination and demyelination. The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with the necessary tools for the use of MRI to diagnose and follow patients with leukodystrophies.

### Current therapeutic approaches in leukodystrophies: A review [^114fHxca]. Journal of Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous class of genetic diseases affecting the white matter in the central nervous system, with a broad range of clinical manifestations and a frequently progressive course. Over the last several decades, an interest in precision medicine has emerged, and biomedical research in leukodystrophies has made exciting advances, particularly in therapeutic target discovery and novel disease model systems. This review discusses emerging therapeutic approaches in leukodystrophies, including gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotide therapy, CRISPR/CAS-based gene editing, and cell and stem cell-based therapies.

### Clinical and genetic characterization of leukoencephalopathies in adults [^1141Gu1v]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

The number of new genes implicated in genetic leukoencephalopathies is growing each year. This presents challenges for the use of targeted panels, which inevitably become obsolete when new genes are described. Using a focused exome approach offsets this, as the data can be reanalyzed intermittently in light of new genetic discoveries and compares favorably regarding coverage when compared to whole exome sequencing (WES).

In summary, focused exome sequencing performs as well as WES in diagnosing adult-onset leukodystrophies, providing a definite genetic diagnosis in 26% of cases, and revealing variants of uncertain significance in 3%. The 71 negative cases in our cohort continue to present a diagnostic challenge. Some of these may not have Mendelian monogenic disorders, being either acquired or due to the interaction of numerous genetic variants in a polygenic fashion. Some patients may carry pathogenic intronic variants in known genes or other mutations not readily detected by next-generation sequencing, including heterozygous copy number variants. Finally, some patients will carry pathogenic variants in genes not yet linked to leukodystrophies/genetic leukoencephalopathies. Further whole exome or genome sequencing, along with family segregation and functional studies, may resolve some, if not all, of these cases in the future.

### Natural history of adult-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy [^116Wcou7]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

We performed a literature review, selecting all articles published between 1990 and 2023, concerning all confirmed MLD patients who started their symptoms in adulthood (i.e. ≥ 15 years). We contacted the authors of each article, asking them to participate in our retrospective study by filling out the survey. In cases where the authors could not be reached, we retrieved these data based on the available information in the article.

This study was conducted according to French legislation and authorized by the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL no. 2211991). All other participating sites (Canada, Italy) received approval from their research ethics board for the retrospective use of clinical data.

Time-to-event curves were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method (considering interval-censored data for all events including death). All statistical analyses were performed using R 4.3.3.

Our survey identified 34 patients (18 females and 16 males) from 27 families, referred to as the "survey" cohort. These patients originated from multiple countries: 18 from France, 10 from Italy, one from Canada, and five from the papers whose authors accepted to fill out our survey. Additionally, our literature review covered data from 21 articles, reporting 28 additional cases of adult-onset MLD (15 females, 13 males), which we refer to as the "literature" cohort. Complete data for the two cohorts are available in supplemental Table 2.

In total, combining both the "survey" and the "literature" cohort, we studied 62 patients (33 females, 29 males), in what we named the "global" cohort.

### Practical approach to the diagnosis of adult-onset leukodystrophies: An updated guide in the genomic era [^111HZ1C4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Adult patients with extensive white matter hyperintensities on MRI present the neurologist with a complex diagnostic task. A wide variety of disorders can lead to these imaging appearances, including inflammatory, infective, and malignant causes, as well as extensive small vessel disease. However, the most challenging patients to diagnose are often those with presumed genetic conditions, including classical leukodystrophies, where the primary pathology is based in the myelin, or genetic leukoencephalopathies, where the pathology is mainly neuronal or systemic. Patients may present with a wide spectrum of clinical features such as cognitive and neuropsychiatric changes, movement disorders, spasticity, and seizures. The diversity of genetic etiologies, combined with overlapping clinical and radiological phenotypes, can make definitive diagnosis challenging.

In 2014, we proposed a practical approach to navigate through this diagnostic maze. However, even in the span of five years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of implicated genes. Improved phenotype-genotype correlation and increased access to advanced sequencing technologies have therefore changed our diagnostic approach.

This new review provides an opportunity to update and refine our practical approach for diagnosing genetic leukoencephalopathies in the era of whole genome sequencing. We strongly recommend it be read in conjunction with the previous paper to avoid repetition. As before, we emphasize the need to exclude, as far as possible, any acquired disorder.

### International recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with adrenoleukodystrophy: A consensus-based approach [^1111rFYA]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) has a variable and unpredictable clinical course. It is caused by pathogenic variants in ABCD1 causing deficient β-oxidation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). VLCFAs in plasma are a diagnostic marker. Patients are asymptomatic at birth but develop symptoms as the disease progresses.

- **Core clinical syndromes**: There are three core clinical syndromes: a slowly progressive myeloneuropathy (adrenomyeloneuropathy), a rapidly progressive leukodystrophy (cerebral ALD), and primary adrenal insufficiency. Women develop myeloneuropathy; men can develop all three syndromes. Currently, it is not possible to predict the individual disease course.

- **Treatment approaches**: Only supportive treatment is available for the myeloneuropathy, but early-stage cerebral ALD can be stabilized with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and adrenal insufficiency can be treated with hormone replacement therapy. Clinical surveillance is required to monitor the emergence of treatable aspects of the disease.

ALD has a birth prevalence of 1:15,000 (male patients and female patients). The number of diagnosed patients is increasing because of newborn screening and exome sequencing in clinical practice. Management of patients with ALD varies between centers because of a lack of prospective natural history studies and controlled clinical trials. Clinical practice recommendations are needed to optimize outcomes. We aimed to reach consensus among international ALD experts on best approaches to diagnosis, clinical surveillance, and treatment of patients with ALD using a modified Delphi procedure.

### Practical approach to the diagnosis of adult-onset leukodystrophies: an updated guide in the genomic era [^116xiUJw]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

The Queen Square Adult Leukodystrophy Group (QSALG) is a multidisciplinary special interest group with input from neuroinflammation, neurogenetics, inherited metabolic disease, cognitive neurology, and neuroradiology. Since its inception, the group has investigated 116 patients with a wide variety of white matter syndromes, referred from hospitals worldwide. In our experience, a diagnosis can be made in approximately half of the patients (54).

- **Common diagnoses**: The most common diagnosis reached is small vessel disease, followed by CSF1R mutations, mitochondrial diseases, ALD, and multiple sclerosis. The remainder of diagnoses were highly heterogeneous, with often only one or at most two cases for each disorder.

- **Rare diagnoses**: There were 15 diagnoses that affected only one patient each, including CADASIL and CARASIL, PLP1 mutations, Alexander disease, Fabry disease, VWM disease, and familial British dementia.

This review is representative of the diagnostic approach of the QSALG.

### Emerging treatments for pediatric leukodystrophies [^113SHKVB]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders with broad clinical manifestations and variable pathologic mechanisms. Improved diagnostic methods have allowed identification of the underlying cause of these diseases, facilitating identification of their pathologic mechanisms. Clinicians are now able to prioritize treatment strategies and advance research in therapies for specific disorders. Although only a few of these disorders have well-established treatments or therapies, a number are on the verge of clinical trials. As investigators are able to shift care from symptomatic management of disorders to targeted therapeutics, the unmet therapeutic needs could be reduced for these patients.

### Update on leukodystrophies and developing trials [^112UADDw]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

At the cellular level, due to the crucial role of the different CNS cells in generating and supporting the integrity of myelin, leukodystrophies are not only caused by defects in the myelin but also by dysfunction in other CNS structures. Similarly, at the molecular level, disruptions in one pathway can have far-reaching consequences on other pathways. An in-depth understanding of the pathomechanisms underlying leukodystrophies is crucial for the development of innovative therapies.

### Update on leukodystrophies and developing trials [^115aQBKe]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies comprise a heterogeneous group of rare genetic disorders that primarily affect the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS). In a broader context, leukoencephalopathy is a comprehensive term used to describe all white matter disorders, which can stem from a variety of causes, including genetic factors.

Previous studies conducted in the United States and Europe reported an incidence of leukodystrophies ranging from 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 6,000–7,700 live births, while Asian countries report an incidence of 3 per 100,000 live births. Metachromatic leukodystrophy and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy have been reported to be the most common leukodystrophies.

Leukodystrophies can be broadly classified into demyelinating and hypomyelinating types based on their appearance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Alternatively, categorizations are based on cellular pathophysiology and metabolic and molecular approaches. MRI and genetic testing are crucial for confirming the diagnosis of leukodystrophy. Molecular testing is pursued when a diagnosis is suspected. Thanks to the use of whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), the diagnostic yield has rapidly increased in recent years.

- **Inheritance patterns**: Leukodystrophies can be inherited in various manners including autosomal recessive (AR), autosomal dominant (AD), and X-linked patterns.

### Leukodystrophies and genetic leukoencephalopathies in children specified by exome sequencing in an expanded gene panel [^115yciK3]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The overlapping clinical and neuroimaging phenotypes of leukodystrophies present a diagnostic challenge for both clinicians and researchers. Studies exploring the application of exome sequencing in diagnosing leukodystrophies are emerging. We employed targeted gene panel sequencing of 6,440 genes to investigate the genetic etiology in a cohort of 50 children with neuroimaging diagnoses of leukodystrophy or genetic leukoencephalopathy of unknown etiology. These 50 patients, who did not have a definitive biochemical or genetic diagnosis, were selected from a cohort of 88 patients seen during a 2.5-year period (from January 2015 to June 2017). Patients diagnosed through biochemical or biopsy confirmation (n = 17) and those with incomplete data or lacking follow-up (n = 21) were excluded. Exome sequencing identified variants in 30 (60%) of the patients. Among these, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were found in 28 patients, while variants of unknown significance were identified in 2. Of the patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, 13 (26%) had classic leukodystrophies, and 15 (30%) had genetic leukoencephalopathies. The clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, along with the genetic features of the identified disorders, are discussed.

### International recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with adrenoleukodystrophy: A consensus-based approach [^1161Yufp]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

We provide recommendations on the diagnosis, clinical surveillance, and treatment of ALD. Our consensus-based approach among ALD experts across the world allowed us to formulate recommendations despite limited scientific evidence. Still, on some topics, consensus could not be reached, for instance, the exact timing of adrenal testing in the first year of life. Furthermore, this approach is at risk for bias because of panelist selection and repeat review. We aimed to include all relevant specialists with experience in the field of ALD, but this group is small, and the clinical experience of panelists varied from smaller regional to larger international cohorts with more than 100 patients.

Experts were instructed to withhold from voting on recommendations outside their field of expertise, but no additional correction was applied for differences in clinical experience. Moreover, consensus was defined as > 80% agreement; therefore, some panelists did not agree with specific recommendations, although consensus was reached. The screening protocol for cerebral ALD and lifestyle management are examples of topics that remain subjects of discussion.

Nonetheless, this guideline addresses a need in the ALD community because of the worldwide increase in diagnoses and the number of presymptomatic individuals due to newborn screening and improved diagnostic procedures. Moreover, we highlight knowledge gaps that can direct future research and illustrate that international collaboration among physicians, researchers, and patients is essential to improve care.

### Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy without early autonomic dysfunctions linked to lamin B1 duplication: A phenotypic variant [^114J94zN]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The early presentation of autonomic dysfunctions at the disease onset has been considered the mandatory clinical feature in adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy, which is a rarely recognized leukodystrophy caused by duplication of the lamin B1 gene. We report the first family with adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy and lamin B1 duplication, without the distinguishing early-appearing autonomic dysfunctions. Subjects from three consecutive generations of a multi-generational Serbian family affected by adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy underwent clinical, biochemical, neurophysiological, neuroradiological, and genetic studies. The patients atypically exhibited late autonomic dysfunctions commencing at the disease end-stages in some cases.

Genetic findings of lamin B1 duplication verified adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy, which was further supported by neuroimaging studies. Exclusively, proton magnetic spectroscopy of the brain revealed the possibility of neuro-axonal damage in the white matter lesions, while magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord excluded spinal myelin affection as a required finding in this leukodystrophy. The detection of lamin B1 duplication, even when autonomic dysfunctions do not precede the other symptoms of the disease, demonstrates for the first time that lamin B1-duplicated adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy may have a phenotypic variant with delayed autonomic dysfunctions. Prior to this report, such a phenotype had been speculated to represent an entity different from lamin B1-duplicated leukodystrophy.

### Expanded carrier screening for inherited genetic disease using exome and genome sequencing [^115zXVFp]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

This project was inspired by a child who was diagnosed with metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and her family's story. A 2-year-old child presented with signs of neurological decline over the previous 6 months. Based on her clinical examination and brain MRI findings, we suspected MLD, an incurable neurodegenerative disease caused by deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A. This diagnosis was confirmed by biochemical and genetic testing; she had two pathogenic variants in the ARSA gene. Subsequent testing of both parents confirmed that they were each heterozygous for a different pathogenic variant in the ARSA gene. An asymptomatic younger infant sibling also carried both variants, placing her at high risk for developing MLD. The younger sibling underwent ex vivo gene therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation in Milan, Italy.

The parents had pre-conception genetic screening several years earlier through a commercial lab before having their first child. Based on a 102-gene panel screening test, the couple was counseled that they were at very low reproductive risk for the tested recessive diseases, including MLD (1 in 720,000). In retrospect, this screening only targeted 5 specific variants in the ARSA gene, none of which were found in either parent.

We believe that, in this genomic era where exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) are first- or second-tier tests in children with undiagnosed disorders, we should be able to apply similar methods for improved expanded carrier screening. The objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of applying unbiased whole-genome sequencing.

### Practical approaches and knowledge gaps in the care for children with leukodystrophies [^111zWFyZ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Recognizing that disease burden extends beyond the stated neurologic domains, we collaborated with parent and family advocate groups to develop these guidelines. This collaboration provided a perspective on the daily needs of a child with a leukodystrophy. In addition to including their tips and recommendations throughout the guidelines, parents expressed several foundational viewpoints.

- **Foundational viewpoints**: They emphasized the importance of helping parents understand what resources are available to them: from organizations such as the Leukodystrophy Care Network, as well as talking to other parents with experience in leukodystrophies, and partner organizations that can assist with financial support, obtaining home medical equipment, and navigating transitions of care between hospital and home settings. Parents also stressed the many overlapping dynamics involved in the care of a child with a leukodystrophy. These include shared decision-making among family members, caregiver burden and burnout, and the role of social media support groups.

### Arsa variants associated with cognitive decline and long-term preservation of motor function in metachromatic leukodystrophy [^114XwuAz]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

Assessments are summarized at the time of diagnosis for patients with the c.256C > T, c.257G > A, or c.542T > G variant on one allele separately. Follow-up data for untreated and treated patients are also presented separately for each variant group. While the second variants are functionally distinct, grouping was performed to investigate how patients with one of the c.256C > T, c.257G > A, or c.542T > G variants present, irrespective of the second allele. Table S2 provides a detailed overview of all patients, including the variants in trans. Table S3 presents median disease duration at follow-up assessments for untreated patients across various outcomes, allowing for comparisons of disease duration differences between patients with distinct outcomes.

### Practical approaches and knowledge gaps in the care for children with leukodystrophies [^114x8Znb]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Hunters Hope is a patient advocacy group representing families of various leukodystrophies. In partnership with other organizations, they created the Leukodystrophy Care Network. Part of the organization's goals were to link Leukodystrophy Centers across the United States and encourage the development of care guidelines for these centers while also serving as a reference for other medical practitioners caring for patients with leukodystrophies. At the 2016, 2017, and 2018 Hunter's Hope Annual Meetings, a group consisting of 10–15 interdisciplinary care providers and 5 family advocates with personal experience in leukodystrophies met. The medical providers involved were all members of leukodystrophy-focused programs at major hospitals throughout the United States. The family advocates represented children with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), Krabbe disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy.

The group collaborated to focus on neurologic care and to create the guidelines presented here. Patient and family surveys established a list of clinical symptoms of concern. From this list, they identified four core neurologic symptoms of highest priority: sleep, pain, seizures/epilepsy, and language/cognition. They further defined stages of severity in leukodystrophies to guide appropriate recommendations at different levels of need and to find commonalities among a variety of genetic conditions.

### Disease specific therapies in leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies [^116yFofJ]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous, often progressive group of disorders manifesting a wide range of symptoms and complications. Most of these disorders have historically had no etiologic or disease-specific therapeutic approaches. Recently, a greater understanding of the pathologic mechanisms associated with leukodystrophies has allowed clinicians and researchers to prioritize treatment strategies and advance research in therapies for specific disorders, some of which are on the verge of pilot or Phase I/II clinical trials. This shifts the care of leukodystrophy patients from managing the complex array of symptoms and sequelae alone to targeted therapeutics. The unmet needs of leukodystrophy patients remain an overwhelming burden. While the overwhelming consensus is that these disorders collectively are symptomatically treatable, leukodystrophy patients are in need of advanced therapies and, if possible, a cure.

### Practical approach to the diagnosis of adult-onset leukodystrophies: An updated guide in the genomic era [^116vv92m]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Leukoencephalopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders with a wide range of genetic and acquired causes. These disorders are frequently difficult to diagnose, and patients typically undergo numerous expensive, time-consuming, and often invasive tests over a prolonged period. This presents a significant burden to patients who are usually deteriorating from a severe and progressive neurological syndrome. The aim of the treating neurologist should be to make a definitive diagnosis, as this allows for better prognostication, more definitive family counseling, and prevents further worry about the diagnosis. We hope that we have provided a useful, straightforward logical algorithm that others will find beneficial.

It is clear that careful clinical and radiological assessment, in combination with the early use of focused genetic testing, is necessary to maximize the probability of making these diagnoses. However, even with this approach, more than half of patients currently do not receive a definitive diagnosis. This may be because the disorders are so heterogeneous or because there are still more genes to be described. Advances in genetic technology, like whole genome sequencing, may solve some cases, but only in combination with a thorough phenotypic approach.

Ultimately, these diagnoses are important because the development of novel therapies for these disorders depends primarily on forming cohorts of patients for clinical trials. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from donors is a potential treatment for adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), and several other disorders. Recently, gene correction has also been explored as a potential treatment strategy.

### Metachromatic leukodystrophy: New therapy advancements and emerging research directions [^115aEXuV]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by disease-causing variants in the gene coding for arylsulfatase A, leading to deficient enzyme activity and subsequent accumulation of sulfatides. MLD is characterized by demyelination and neurodegeneration of the central and peripheral nervous system, manifesting as progressive motor and cognitive defects in affected individuals.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the significant progress made in MLD research in the past decade regarding natural history, disease and treatment mechanisms, and newborn screening (NBS). Traditionally, MLD has been classified according to age at onset (late-infantile, early-juvenile and late-juvenile, and adult MLD), with earlier forms leading to more rapid neurologic decline. New data show that the type of presenting symptoms further influences the dynamics of disease progression. Patients with a cognitive presentation have a much slower, or even no, motor decline than patients with a mixed motor and cognitive presentation.

Research advancements have enabled improved understanding of the effects of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the development of novel therapeutic approaches, including hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy. This therapy is now authorized in the EU, United Kingdom, and United States as treatment for selected patients with early-onset forms of MLD. Both hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy are most effective when administered before disease onset.

### Scope and burden of non-standard of care hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pediatric leukodystrophy patients [^117Y4xmD]. Journal of Child Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Inherited leukodystrophies are a group of diseases affecting central nervous system myelin that lead to death or significant health problems. Although for most leukodystrophies there are no curative treatments, for a handful of diseases hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT; bone marrow transplant) can stop disease progression and, if initiated in a timely fashion, prevent many or all neurologic and other systems involvement. However, HSCT is a complex procedure with significant morbidity and mortality risks. The study goal was to determine whether HSCT was being more widely used outside of those leukodystrophies for which HSCT is typically employed.

The authors conducted a two-year retrospective review of HSCT performed across the United States in 51 children's hospitals that are part of the Pediatric Health Information System. They screened for the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) codes for leukodystrophies in which HSCT is "nonstandard", including sphingolipidoses, Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, and Niemann-Pick disease. Patients who had ICD-10 codes for leukodystrophies that are HSCT candidates, specifically X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, and Hurler disease, were excluded.

The authors identified 91 patients (from a total cohort of 937) with one of the nonstandard leukodystrophies who had HSCT. HSCT was performed at 20 of the hospitals, with the majority performed at only 6 hospitals. Average costs ($786,846) per patient were more than 6 times higher than standard care.

### Geographic and specialty access disparities in US pediatric leukodystrophy diagnosis [^116JgjXT]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

To examine disparities in the diagnosis of leukodystrophies, including geographic factors and access to specialty centers, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. This study involved pediatric patients admitted to Pediatric Health Information System hospitals. Patients with leukodystrophy were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes for four leukodystrophies: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Hurler disease, Krabbe disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Hierarchical generalized logistic modeling with three levels was utilized to predict the diagnosis of leukodystrophy based on distance traveled to the hospital, neighborhood composition, urban/rural context, and access to a specialty center.

Results indicated the identification of 501 patients with leukodystrophy. Patients seen at a leukodystrophy center of excellence hospital were 1.73 times more likely to receive a diagnosis than patients at non-center of excellence hospitals. Additionally, patients who traveled longer distances were more likely to be diagnosed than those who traveled shorter distances. Patients residing in a Health Professionals Shortage Area (HPSA) zip code were 0.86 times less likely to be diagnosed compared to those in non-HPSA zip codes.

The study concludes that geographic factors significantly influence the diagnosis of leukodystrophies in pediatric patients, particularly concerning access to centers with expertise in leukodystrophies. The findings suggest a need for improving access to pediatric specialists and potentially deploying specialists or diagnostic testing more widely.

### Adulthood leukodystrophies [^11642UD9]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The leukodystrophies are a group of inherited white matter disorders characterized by a heterogeneous genetic background, considerable phenotypic variability, and disease onset at all ages. This review focuses on leukodystrophies with major prevalence or primary onset in adulthood. We summarize 20 leukodystrophies with adult presentations, providing information on the underlying genetic mutations and on biochemical assays that aid diagnosis, where available. Definitions, clinical characteristics, age of onset, MRI findings, and treatment options are all described, providing a comprehensive overview of the knowledge of the various adulthood leukodystrophies.

We highlight the distinction between adult-onset leukodystrophies and other inherited disorders with white matter involvement, proposing a diagnostic pathway for timely recognition of adulthood leukodystrophies in a routine clinical setting. In addition, we provide detailed clinical information on selected adult-onset leukodystrophies, including X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids, autosomal dominant adult-onset demyelinating leukodystrophy, adult polyglucosan body disease, and leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. Ultimately, this review aims to provide helpful suggestions to identify treatable adulthood leukodystrophies at an early stage in the disease course.

Parents expressed their great appreciation for being followed in a specialized leukodystrophy clinic. They saw numerous advantages in having access to this resource as it provided them with valuable additional expertise on their child's specific condition. This clinic rapidly became their primary reference for all health-related questions, helping them better understand their child's disease through more elaborate explanations. They reported better organization and coordination of their care through this clinic. Moreover, parents valued the different research opportunities offered, such as access to new clinical trials and increased accessibility to international experts when necessary. Participant QI5 remarked, "Being referred to a specialized clinic is absolutely priceless. It's comforting for families".

### Adrenoleukodystrophy: New approaches to a neurodegenerative disease [^112PJ8oZ]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), first described in 1923, was viewed until 1976 as a rare and inexorably fatal neurodegenerative disorder affecting boys. The genetic defect and biochemical abnormalities have now been defined. Ongoing research has resulted in new findings:

- **Phenotypic expression**: There is a wide range of phenotypic expression. At least half of patients with X-ALD are adults with somewhat milder manifestations, and women who are carriers may become symptomatic. X-ALD is often misdiagnosed as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in boys and as multiple sclerosis in men and women. It is not an uncommon cause of Addison disease.

- **Incidence**: The incidence of X-ALD is estimated to be 1:17,000 in all ethnic groups, approximating that of phenylketonuria.

- **Diagnosis and prevention**: Noninvasive and presymptomatic diagnoses, as well as prenatal diagnosis, are available. Family screening and genetic counseling are key to disease prevention.

- **Therapies and future directions**: New therapies, applied early, show promise. Neonatal screening is likely to become available, and a wider awareness of X-ALD and its various modes of presentation permits new proactive approaches to this distressing disorder.

### Update on leukodystrophies and developing trials [^116G5aL2]. Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

The diagnostic process for leukodystrophies begins with a thorough patient history and a comprehensive general and neurological examination. Because of the similarities in clinical findings among different types of leukodystrophies, it is crucial to combine these findings with specific brain MRI patterns. Additional diagnostic tools, including biochemical and metabolic tests, electrophysiological studies, ophthalmology consultation, neuroimaging, and genetic studies, can be used in parallel to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis in heritable white matter disorders. The integration of MRI, careful clinical evaluation, and next-generation genetic sequencing shows promise in reducing the number of unsolved cases. Newborn screening can also play a pivotal role in early diagnosis and treatment.

- **MRI significance**: MRI plays a central role in the diagnostic algorithms for leukodystrophies. Detailed analysis of MRI patterns can aid in identifying specific types of leukodystrophies.

- **Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies**: Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies exhibit mild white matter abnormalities on T2-weighted imaging with iso- or hyperintense T1 signals, while demyelinating forms show prominent T2-weighted abnormalities and significant T1 hypointensity. Adequate brain imaging protocols should be followed, including axial and sagittal T1-weighted, axial T2-weighted, and FLAIR sequences. Post-contrast T1-weighted images can provide additional information for certain conditions. Multiple MRI scans at intervals of at least 6 months may be necessary.

### Adult-onset leukodystrophies [^111jFrbt]. Journal of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are genetic metabolic diseases which generally occur in early childhood at the time of myelination. Surprisingly, these diseases can also occur during adulthood. Adult forms have various clinical presentations, which reflect degenerative diseases of the nervous system. The course may last for decades. This contribution describes the main features of adult leukodystrophies and indicates those for which a biochemical and molecular diagnosis is possible. Other articles deal with their differential diagnosis of leukoencephalopathies and with the diagnostic strategy.

### An approach to reporting paediatric leukoencephalopathy and leukodystrophies [^111voDSq]. Clinical Radiology (2023). High credibility.

The leukodystrophies (LD) and leukoencephalopathies (LE) are a diverse group of conditions involving the cerebral white and grey matter. There is heterogeneity in the clinical presentations, imaging features, and biochemical dysfunction. Given the number of conditions and varied imaging appearances, this topic can be difficult for non-specialist radiologists who do not routinely work in dedicated paediatric neuroradiology centres. This article aims to provide a simplified and step-wise approach to assessing suspected LD/LE, focusing on the more common diagnoses encountered in the UK. Additionally, it highlights important non-LD/LE differentials, which, if considered early, may significantly alter treatment and prognosis. By the end of this review, we hope the reader will develop an awareness of physiological paediatric brain development in terms of normal myelination; the ability to recognize and categorize the distribution of abnormal signal based on the established diagnostic framework outlined by Schiffmann & Van der Knapp; and awareness of potential non-LD/LE radiological mimics.

**Pearls**: Pathogenic AARS2 variants are a rare cause of leukodystrophy characterized by neurologic, behavioral, and endocrinological phenotypes. White matter changes in the form of confluent T2 hyperintensities involving the frontal or periventricular regions on MRI of the brain can differentiate leukodystrophies from other potential causes of progressive movement disorders.

### Diagnostic algorithm for the differentiation of leukodystrophies in early MS [^112foHqW]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are chronic, progressive, inherited white matter diseases frequently combined with an inborn error of metabolism. Some leukodystrophies clinically resemble chronic variants of multiple sclerosis (MS), while others exhibit multifocal MRI changes mimicking the white matter changes known from MS imaging studies. The risk of misdiagnosing leukodystrophy as MS is especially high in early disease stages, increasing the possibility of initiating an inadequate therapy.

Patients with clinical isolated syndromes should be carefully screened for positive family history, atypical clinical presentation or MRI pattern, symmetric involvement of long spinal tracts and peripheral nerves using evoked potentials and nerve conduction velocities, and lack of oligoclonal bands in CSF. All of these are "red flags" that may implicate consideration of leukodystrophy. Genetic or biochemical testing is widely available, providing a specific diagnosis in most patients.

### Diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of leukodystrophies [^116KNCZi]. The Lancet Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies comprise a large group of rare genetic disorders primarily affecting CNS white matter. Historically, the diagnostic process was slow, and patient prognosis was regarded as poor because curative treatment was only available for very few leukodystrophies in the early stages of the disease. Whole-exome sequencing has greatly increased the number of known leukodystrophies and improved diagnosis. Whether MRI retains its central place in diagnosis and what the role is of whole-exome sequencing are relevant questions for neurologists. Improved diagnosis has revealed the phenotypic variability of leukodystrophies, requiring adaptation of prognostication.

Technological advances in molecular techniques and improved insight into the pathophysiology of individual leukodystrophies have led to therapeutic developments, including drug design and gene therapy. Despite this progress, therapies are only beneficial early in the disease course, emphasizing the need for a speedy diagnosis and for research on regenerative approaches to repair the damage already present.

### Evidence regarding metachromatic leukodystrophy newborn screening [^1117otku]. Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal disorder affecting about 1 per 100,000 newborns. It is caused by biallelic variations in the arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene, leading to deficiency of ARSA enzyme activity and elevation of sulfatides. Most affected individuals have the late-infantile or early-juvenile phenotype, which is associated with significant and progressive neurologic degeneration and death. For these phenotypes, treatment with lentiviral gene therapy in infancy can improve survival and motor function. However, in the absence of screening or an affected older sibling, most cases are diagnosed much later.

A two-tiered newborn screen, based on the presence of elevated sulfatides in dried-blood spots followed by findings of low ARSA enzyme activity, can accurately identify newborns with the early-onset phenotypes of MLD for timely gene therapy. An MLD screening study with consent is ongoing in eight hospitals in New York City, and population-based newborn screening has been implemented in several regions in Europe. Although the false-positive rate is low, only one of these MLD newborn screening activities, in Hannover, Germany, has reported identifying cases. At least four newborn screening programs in the United States are in the process of implementing MLD screening.

### Adult-onset leukodystrophy: Review of 3 clinicopathologic phenotypes and a proposed classification [^1165sica]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Adult-onset leukodystrophies are clinically and pathologically heterogeneous diseases, and the overlapping morphologic features among these disorders can lead to confusion in pathologic classification. We report three recent autopsy cases that illustrate the clinicopathologic distinction between these entities. The first, autosomal dominant leukodystrophy, is characterized clinically by early autonomic dysfunction and genetically by LMNB1 (lamin B1 gene) duplication. Recently, another clinical subtype emerged without the early autonomic dysfunction but with a similar genetic abnormality documented in one family. We reviewed the reported autopsy cases and show that both clinical subtypes share distinctive pathologic features.

Other forms of adult-onset leukodystrophy can be classified based on the histologic evidence of the primary pathological processes. A case of axonopathy with secondary demyelination serves as a prototype for adult-onset leukoencephalopathy/leukodystrophy with axonal spheroids; the genetic mutation of CSF1R (colony stimulating factor 1R) was recently discovered in patients with this disorder. A case of a primary demyelinating disease with no other distinctive pathologic features is designated as orthochromatic leukodystrophy. Pigmented glia can be present in both of the latter two categories and should not be used as a differentiating diagnostic feature.

Based on the observations of our cases and literature review, we propose an algorithm for a practical diagnostic approach to adult-onset leukodystrophies.

### Consensus statement on preventive and symptomatic care of leukodystrophy patients [^117N3geh]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are inherited disorders characterized by abnormal deposition or progressive disruption of brain myelin. Despite the wide spectrum of genetic origins, leukodystrophy patients manifest many of the same symptoms and medical complications. Although no definitive cures exist, all of these conditions are treatable. This report provides the first expert consensus on the recognition and treatment of medical and psychosocial complications associated with leukodystrophies.

- **Medical complications**: We include a discussion of serious and potentially preventable complications and propose several preventive care strategies.
- **Research needs**: We outline the need for future research to prioritize clinical needs and subsequently develop, validate, and optimize specific care strategies.

### Stress and quality of life of parents of children with POLR3-related leukodystrophy: A cross-sectional pilot study [^113nRzML]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a group of rare, hereditary disorders affecting the cerebral white matter of the brain. They primarily affect the pediatric population, running a progressively debilitating course leading to premature mortality. Altogether, they have a prevalence of 1:4733 live births. Hypomyelinating leukodystrophies are a subset of leukodystrophies characterized by a lack of myelin production and deposition during development, and can be diagnosed based on brain MRI findings. RNA polymerase III-related leukodystrophy (POLR3-HLD; MIM: 607694, 614381, 616494) is an autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in genes encoding subunits of RNA Polymerase III (Pol III); POLR3A, POLR3B, POLR1C, POLR3D, and POLR3K. Pol III is an essential enzyme responsible for the synthesis of small noncoding RNAs, the majority of which are crucial for transcriptional control, RNA processing, ribosomal assembly, and protein translation.

POLR3-related leukodystrophy, also known colloquially as 4H leukodystrophy, is characterized by hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. It typically presents during childhood with delayed milestones and/or motor regression. Cerebellar features typically predominate, with progressive ataxia, dysmetria, and dysarthria, while pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs (e.g. dystonia) are usually less prominent. Cognitive involvement is common but varies in severity and may include learning and intellectual disabilities, behavioral abnormalities, and/or cognitive regression.

### Neuroimaging in leukodystrophies [^114EM4bG]. Journal of Child Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The application of techniques based on in vivo magnetic resonance to the study of leukodystrophies is evaluated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the most important neuroimaging modality for patients with leukodystrophies, has proven invaluable for the detection of the extent and etiology of white-matter involvement, diagnosis, and monitoring of disease progression. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which can detect several brain metabolites, including those related to axonal function and myelination, can provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information and, in some cases, allows a rare insight into the biochemical pathology of leukodystrophies. The potential of other advanced magnetic resonance techniques, including diffusion tensor imaging, magnetization transfer contrast, and molecular imaging, is also discussed. In the future, anatomic and physiologic magnetic resonance techniques are expected to be integrated into a single examination that will provide a detailed characterization of white-matter diseases in children.

### Leukodystrophies due to astrocytic dysfunction [^114KYgP8]. Brain Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are genetically determined disorders caused by defects in any structural components of the brain's white matter. This mini-symposium presents a selection of leukodystrophies due to astrocytic dysfunction, known as astrocytopathies. Examples are provided of astrocytopathies caused by defects in astrocyte-specific proteins, in which astrocytes play a major role in the pathophysiology. Knowledge of the disease mechanisms underlying these leukodystrophies also provides insight into how loss of physiological functions and gain of detrimental functions in astrocytes lead to the degeneration of white matter.

### Endocrine and growth abnormalities in 4H leukodystrophy caused by variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, and POLR1C [^116WD4fo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Leukodystrophies are a group of rare genetic diseases characterized by abnormal white matter in the central nervous system (CNS), which often result in progressive neurodegeneration and premature death. Based on whether the white matter abnormalities seen on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are caused by insufficient initial myelin deposition or altered myelin homeostasis, leukodystrophies can be classified as hypomyelinating or non-hypomyelinating, respectively.

4H leukodystrophy, also known as RNA polymerase III (POLR3)-related leukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive hypomyelinating leukodystrophy associated with several characteristic neurological and non-neurological clinical features, primarily including hypomyelination, hypodontia, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

Commonly presenting neurological signs include cerebellar manifestations, such as ataxia and dysmetria, as well as pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and cognitive features. Non-neurological manifestations can include myopia and endocrine features such as growth hormone (GH) deficiency and short stature.

4H leukodystrophy is also typically associated with a unique MRI phenotype, including cerebellar atrophy, progressive thinning of the corpus callosum, and diffuse hypomyelination with relative preservation of specific structures. These structures include the dentate nucleus, optic radiations, anterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, globus pallidus, and corticospinal tracts at the level of the posterior limb of the internal capsule.

4H leukodystrophy has been found to be caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in POLR3A, POLR3B, and POLR1C.
