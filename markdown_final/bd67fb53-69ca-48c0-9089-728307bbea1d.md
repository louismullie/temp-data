## Question

What is a tilt table test used to diagnose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a tilt table test is used to diagnose. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary indication, which I expect to be vasovagal or reflex syncope. Then, I should verify the roles in orthostatic hypotension, including delayed forms, and in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Next, I will consider psychogenic pseudosyncope and differentiation from epileptic events. After that, I need to check special considerations in older adults and unexplained falls. Finally, I should review standard protocols, diagnostic endpoints, and limitations so I can synthesize a clear answer.

> Let me first confirm the foundational use case. Tilt table testing is primarily used when vasovagal (reflex) syncope is suspected but the diagnosis remains uncertain after the initial evaluation, helping reproduce symptoms with characteristic hemodynamics and establish the diagnosis in a monitored setting [^113q4c52] [^112QTi3J].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance about its role. I initially think of it as the "gold standard", but hold on, the guidelines are careful: it is recommended for diagnosis when history is not definitive, and it should not be used to predict response to therapy in vasovagal syncope, which corrects the common overstatement about it being a universal gold standard [^115af6jD] [^112QTi3J].

> I will now examine orthostatic hypotension indications. Tilt testing can diagnose classical and delayed orthostatic hypotension by documenting a sustained fall in blood pressure with head-up tilt to 60–80 degrees, typically defined as a drop in systolic ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 minutes, and it is particularly useful when bedside standing tests are negative but suspicion remains high or the patient cannot safely stand [^113MytTA] [^11392brS] [^113612CJ].

> Hold on, I should verify delayed orthostatic hypotension. The ACC/AHA/HRS guideline specifically notes that tilt testing can be considered when delayed OH is suspected and initial assessment is inconclusive, which aligns with the practical observation that delayed forms can be missed by brief standing tests [^111atDea] [^113612CJ].

> Next, I should review POTS. POTS is defined by an orthostatic heart rate increase typically > 30 bpm in adults (or > 40 bpm in adolescents) within 10 minutes of standing without orthostatic hypotension and with symptom reproduction; however, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommends against routine tilt testing for POTS, favoring careful supine-to-standing vitals and clinical evaluation, whereas other guidelines list tilt as an option, so I need to emphasize this controversy [^114qBfEc] [^111Auwzj] [^116nQbu9] [^113q4c52].

> Let me consider psychogenic pseudosyncope and syncope–seizure differentiation. Tilt testing with simultaneous EEG and video is specifically recommended to diagnose psychogenic pseudosyncope by showing apparent loss of consciousness without hypotension, bradycardia, or EEG changes, and it can help distinguish convulsive syncope from epilepsy in selected patients, which is a key non-cardiac diagnostic application [^116HTBiU] [^115mxB6M] [^115APwqP].

> I need to ensure I cover older adults. In geriatric patients with unwitnessed events, amnesia, or unexplained falls, tilt testing takes a leading role because history is often unreliable and delayed orthostatic hypotension is more prevalent; systematic reviews and geriatric perspectives support tilt testing in this context when initial evaluation is non-diagnostic [^112h1wbc] [^111Rt677] [^113RvGzQ].

> Let me think about carotid sinus syndrome before I overstate it. Some authors discuss tilt testing alongside carotid sinus massage in evaluating reflex syncope, but hold on, I should verify: carotid sinus massage is the primary maneuver for carotid sinus syndrome, with tilt playing an adjunctive role rather than a stand-alone diagnostic for CSS, so I will frame this cautiously to avoid overclaiming [^115YkqGM].

> Next, I should review the test protocol so the diagnostic targets are clear. Standard tilt protocols use head-up tilt angles of about 60–80 degrees with continuous ECG and noninvasive beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring, with passive phases commonly 20–35 minutes and optional potentiation using sublingual nitroglycerin or isoproterenol to increase sensitivity for reflex syncope, and recent studies support shorter "fast" protocols with similar diagnostic performance [^113MytTA] [^115af6jD] [^113KyGJv].

> I will now examine diagnostic endpoints and patterns. Vasovagal syncope is diagnosed by reproduction of symptoms with a characteristic pattern of hypotension with or without bradycardia or asystole, often described as vasodepressor, cardioinhibitory, or mixed, orthostatic hypotension is diagnosed by the sustained BP drop meeting threshold criteria, POTS by the orthostatic HR increase without BP fall with symptom reproduction, and psychogenic pseudosyncope by apparent TLOC without hemodynamic changes and with a normal EEG during the event [^1126LDYX] [^11392brS] [^116nQbu9] [^116HTBiU].

> But wait, what about limitations and false results. There is an important critique that tilt testing may expose "hypotensive susceptibility" rather than always delivering a specific etiologic diagnosis, and both false positives and false negatives occur, which is why guidelines emphasize selective use after history, exam, orthostatic vitals, and ECG rather than first-line use when the diagnosis is already obvious [^113Bs5qW] [^112QTi3J] [^113q4c52].

> Hold on, I should double-check the educational role. Beyond diagnosis, ESC notes tilt testing can help educate patients to recognize prodromes and rehearse counter-pressure maneuvers, which can be clinically valuable even when the diagnosis is already suspected but unconfirmed [^1177KQVw].

> Let me reconsider POTS one more time to avoid mixed messages. The ESC documents list POTS among orthostatic syndromes assessable during tilt, yet the CCS explicitly advises against routine tilt for POTS and prioritizes active standing protocols with serial measurements, so I will be explicit that its role in POTS is controversial and center-dependent [^113q4c52] [^111Auwzj] [^114qBfEc].

> I should confirm pediatric considerations. For suspected vasovagal syncope in children and adolescents where uncertainty persists after initial assessment, tilt testing can be considered, whereas adolescent POTS criteria hinge on a higher HR increment threshold, reinforcing age-specific thresholds in orthostatic syndromes [^116JEbBM] [^116nQbu9].

> Now, I will synthesize. In clinical practice, tilt table testing is used to diagnose vasovagal/reflex syncope when history and initial workup are inconclusive, to identify orthostatic hypotension including delayed forms, to differentiate psychogenic pseudosyncope from true syncope with EEG/video, and to assist in the evaluation of unexplained falls in older adults, while its role in diagnosing POTS remains controversial and often supplanted by active standing assessments [^113q4c52] [^112QTi3J] [^111atDea] [^116HTBiU] [^111Rt677] [^111Auwzj].

The tilt table test diagnoses **vasovagal syncope** [^113q4c52], **orthostatic hypotension**, **postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)**, and **psychogenic pseudosyncope** [^116HTBiU] by reproducing symptoms with characteristic hemodynamic patterns during controlled upright tilt [^1126LDYX]. It is **indicated when the cause of syncope or orthostatic intolerance remains unclear after the initial evaluation** [^112QTi3J] and helps distinguish reflex syncope from cardiac or neurological causes [^115mxB6M]. Although **not routinely used for POTS diagnosis** [^111Auwzj], tilt testing may be considered in selected cases for diagnostic clarification [^113q4c52].

---

## Clinical indications for tilt table testing

- **Unexplained syncope**: Particularly when vasovagal syncope is suspected [^112QTi3J] but not confirmed by initial evaluation.

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Especially delayed orthostatic hypotension [^111atDea], when initial bedside tests are inconclusive [^113MytTA].

- **Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)**: Although not routinely recommended [^111Auwzj], it may be considered in selected cases for diagnostic clarification [^1176pEjD].

- **Psychogenic pseudosyncope**: To differentiate between true syncope and psychogenic episodes [^113QaSNk] [^116HTBiU].

---

## Physiological responses measured during tilt table testing

- **Blood pressure**: Continuous monitoring to detect hypotensive or hypertensive responses [^113q4c52].

- **Heart rate**: Continuous monitoring to identify tachycardia or bradycardia [^112QTi3J].

- **Symptom reproduction**: Monitoring for dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, or presyncope [^112r9ho8].

---

## Diagnostic criteria for specific conditions

| **Condition** | **Diagnostic criteria** |
|-|-|
| Vasovagal syncope | - Reproduction of symptoms <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Bradycardia during tilt [^113q4c52] |
| Orthostatic hypotension | - Sustained drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of tilt [^113612CJ] [^113MytTA] |
| Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) | - Increase in heart rate ≥ 30 bpm (≥ 40 bpm in adolescents) within 10 minutes of tilt without significant hypotension [^114d7mkK] [^116nQbu9] |
| Psychogenic pseudosyncope | - Apparent loss of consciousness without significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate [^111GUy9M] [^116HTBiU] |

## Limitations and contraindications

Tilt table testing has several **limitations** — including false positives/negatives, limited specificity, and inability to detect all syncope types [^113Bs5qW] — and **contraindications**, such as severe cardiac conditions, uncontrolled hypertension, and certain neurological disorders.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ESC guidelines recommend tilt testing [^113q4c52] for suspected reflex syncope, orthostatic hypotension, POTS, and psychogenic pseudosyncope, whereas **ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines** recommend it for unexplained syncope [^112QTi3J], delayed orthostatic hypotension [^111atDea], and psychogenic pseudosyncope [^111GUy9M].

---

Tilt table testing is a **valuable diagnostic tool** [^115af6jD] for evaluating unexplained syncope and orthostatic intolerance, helping identify vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, POTS, and psychogenic pseudosyncope. It is **indicated when initial evaluations are inconclusive** [^112QTi3J] and has limitations and contraindications that must be considered.

### Head-up tilt testing in older syncope patients: A systematic review [^113RvGzQ]. Age and Ageing (2025). Low credibility.

The primary outcomes were positivity rates, which represent the proportion of head-up tilt tests (HUTTs) ending in (pre)syncope, and the distribution of diagnoses established by HUTT in older patients with unexplained syncope. Differences in these outcomes compared to younger patients and healthy controls were also investigated. Secondary outcomes included time to syncope (TtS) and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs). We also considered other syncope diagnoses if reported.

In addition to variables related to test accuracy, diagnoses, and safety, we collected data on the study populations, including age distribution and setting, use of a control group, and the execution of the test (angle, duration, drug provocation).

- **Risk of bias assessment**: The risk of bias was independently assessed by two investigators using a tailored version of the QUADAS-2, focusing on three domains: patient selection, index test, and flow and timing. Items related to the use of a reference test were ignored since no reference test for HUTT exists. The following variables were evaluated to assess the risk of bias in the included studies:

- **Methods of patient selection**: Consecutive, random sample, case-control design.
- **Inappropriate exclusions**
- **Use of a standardized HUTT protocol**: Including preparation, tilt angle, duration, and drug provocation.
- **Use of pre-specified definitions for diagnoses**
- **Use of the same test protocol for all included patients**
- **Incomplete data and/or loss to follow-up**

The applicability of our review question was assessed regarding the selected patients and HUTT protocol. Disagreements were resolved collaboratively.

### Tilt testing evolves: faster and still accurate [^115af6jD]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Syncope is a very common cardiovascular presentation. It is a symptom with a wide range of causes, results in injury in 15%, and is associated with well-documented reductions in quality of life. The complexity and sequelae of syncope presentations mean that there is a pressing need for simple, efficient diagnostic approaches. The most common cause of syncope is vasovagal reflex, and if the history is not diagnostic, the most sensitive and specific investigation is tilt testing. The contribution of Russo and colleagues stands to make it simpler and more widely accessible.

A recent article in the journal has shown that tilt testing in patients with syncope remains a valuable asset despite a shift from diagnosis to exposure of a tendency to reflex syncope.

Tilt testing as a clinical tool emerged in 1986 with a small series of unexplained syncope patients being diagnosed with vasovagal reflex by prolonged passive head-up tilt, reported by Kenny and colleagues. This revelation sparked its worldwide implementation. However, the first tilt test protocol, although suitable for diagnosis in the highly symptomatic, was inadequate for widespread use. The tilt angle was too low at 40° and required too long an upright period (60 minutes). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many sought modifications which included higher tilt angles up to 60–80° and shorter tilt durations, all of which have been successively adopted. In addition, lower-body negative pressure and drug interventions (i.v. isoproterenol or sublingual nitroglycerin) were designed to potentiate the effect.

### Usefulness of the tilt table test: A "geriatric" point of view [^112h1wbc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

The tilt table test (TTT) is widely used for the investigation of syncope and pre-syncope. Nevertheless, in older patients, it may also lead to the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension (OH) and unexplained falls.

TTT in syncope: Syncope increases with aging, and its incidence rises sharply from age 70 onwards. Neurocardiogenic syncope (NMS) accounts for about 67% of all syncope cases in older patients. However, some differences have emerged in the diagnosis of NMS between adults and older individuals. In adults, the initial syncope evaluation — medical history, physical examination, ECG, and standing test — is usually sufficient to diagnose NMS without the need for further tests. Instead, in older patients, with or without dementia, clinical variables such as the presentation of syncope, cognitive comorbidity, and pre- and post-syncope amnesia can confound the medical history. The patient history, which plays a key role in the diagnosis of NMS in adults, is blurred in older patients who experience an unwitnessed event. Thus, TTT plays an important role in NMS detection in the elderly. A meticulous preliminary selection of patients to refer to TTT is indispensable in order to exclude those with likely cardiac syncope (e.g. malignant ventricular arrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, or potential obstructive causes). This will improve the accuracy of the TTT response and avoid possible side effects. Also, to reduce a false positive response in older patients with a suspected but unconfirmed episode of syncope, it is important to check beforehand with the patient if they have had any prior prodromal symptoms associated with hemodynamic changes.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for syncope, specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension-induced syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend suspecting postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome when there is an orthostatic heart rate increase (> 30 bpm or > 120 bpm within 10 minutes of active standing) in the absence of orthostatic hypotension, reproducing spontaneous symptoms.

### Vasovagal syncope in the older person: Differences in presentation between older and younger patients [^1166xEvs]. Age and Ageing (2010). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) has been diagnosed with increasing frequency in older people since the description of the head-up tilt table test (HUTT). However, there is a paucity of research describing the clinical features of VVS in this group. To address this issue, we investigated the age distribution and differences in clinical characteristics associated with age in patients diagnosed with VVS by HUTT at our tertiary referral centre.

- **Methods**: 1,060 consecutive patients with tilt-positive VVS were identified from a prospective database containing the demographic and clinical information of individuals assessed in our unit over a 10-year period. VVS was diagnosed with appropriate haemodynamic changes during HUTT and accompanying symptom reproduction.

- **Results**: We found a bimodal age distribution with a small peak at 20–29 years and a larger peak at 70–79 years. Patients aged ≥ 60 years were less likely to report total loss of consciousness [odds ratio (OR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.38–0.64], near loss of consciousness (OR 0.53, 95% CI = 0.40–0.70), or palpitations (OR 0.45, 95% CI = 0.28–0.72) and more likely to present with unexplained falls (OR 2.33, 95% CI = 1.36–4.32). The typical provoking factors of prolonged standing (OR 0.55, 95% CI = 0.40–0.72), posture change (OR 0.61, 95% CI = 0.46–0.82) and hot environments (OR 0.57, 95% CI = 0.42–0.78) were also less common in older patients.

- **Conclusion**: In our large study population, VVS was more common in older patients. The clinical presentation differed significantly between the two groups.

### Clinical significance of orthostatic dizziness in the diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and orthostatic intolerance [^116bsPbn]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic dizziness (OD) and positional dizziness (PD) are considerably common conditions in dizziness clinics, yet these two conditions are not clearly separated. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of simple OD and OD combined with PD for the diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and orthostatic intolerance (OI).

Patients presenting with OD (n = 102) were divided into two groups according to their symptoms: group PO, presenting with PD as well as OD; and group O, presenting with OD. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and vestibular function tests were performed to identify the etiology of the dizziness. Orthostatic vital sign measurement (OVSM) was used to diagnose OI.

The majority of patients were in group PO (87.3%). BPPV was the most common cause of OD for the entire patient group (36.3%) and group PO (37.1%), while OI was the most common etiology for group O (38.5%). A total of 17 (16.7%) OI patients were identified by the OVSM test. Orthostatic hypotension (n = 10) was most frequently found, followed by orthostatic hypertension (n = 5), and orthostatic tachycardia (n = 2). Group O showed a significantly higher percentage (38.5%) of OI than group PO (13.5%) (P = 0.039).

It is suggested that orthostatic testing, such as OVSM or a head-up tilt table test, should be performed as an initial workup for patients with simple OD. Positional tests for BPPV should be considered an essential diagnostic test for patients with OD, even if their dizziness is not associated with PD.

### Diffusion weighted imaging best discriminates PD from MSA-P: A comparison with tilt table testing and heart MIBG scintigraphy [^1133U4vR]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

Both diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) of the basal ganglia and meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy of the heart have been reported as useful in the differential diagnosis of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) versus the parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P). Their diagnostic value, however, has never been directly compared in patients with parkinsonism and autonomic dysfunction. We have studied nine patients with PD and nine patients with MSA-P, matched for age and disease severity.

Regional traces of the diffusion tensor values were determined in the putamina. Cardiac MIBG uptake was quantified by comparing regions of interest over the heart and mediastinum, determining the Heart/Mediastinum (H/M) ratio. Furthermore, all patients underwent tilt testing. PD patients showed significantly lower H/M ratios than normal controls; however, there was considerable overlap between the two patient groups. We did not detect any significant differences in blood pressure response to passive tilt between the two patient groups.

The sensitivity of MIBG scintigraphy versus DWI for the differentiation of MSA-P from PD was 55.6% versus 100%, specificity was 88.8% versus 100%, and the area under the curve was 0.802 versus 1.000. Our data suggest that DWI is superior to both tilt table testing and MIBG scintigraphy in the differential diagnosis of PD versus MSA-P.

### Diagnostic criteria for vasovagal syncope based on a quantitative history [^113zdwZq]. European Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to develop historical criteria for the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope. We administered a 118-item historical questionnaire to 418 patients with syncope and no apparent structural heart disease. The prevalence of each item was compared between patients with positive tilt tests and those with syncope of other, known causes.

- **Methods and results**: The contributions of symptoms to diagnoses were estimated using logistic regression. Point scores were developed and tested using receiver operator characteristic analysis, and accuracy was assessed with bootstrapping. Data sets were complete for all subjects. Syncope was known in 323 patients, including 235 with tilt-positive vasovagal syncope, and 88 with other diagnoses such as complete heart block and supraventricular tachycardias. The point score correctly classified 90% of patients, diagnosing vasovagal syncope with 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The decision rule suggested that 68% of an additional 95 patients with syncope of unknown cause and a negative tilt test have vasovagal syncope.

In conclusion, a simple point score of historical features distinguishes vasovagal syncope from syncope of other causes with very high sensitivity and specificity.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1156ADPY]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Syncope can have a variety of etiologies and may result in falls and associated injuries. It is defined as a sudden yet transient complete loss of consciousness in which the individual is unable to maintain postural tone, followed by rapid and spontaneous recovery. Standing for 2 to 3 minutes is usually sufficient to observe the fall in blood pressure (BP) associated with syncope; however, in the case presented here, BP was measured after 5 minutes of standing.

Determining the underlying cause of syncopal episodes is an important diagnostic step to appropriately guide management. A relatively common cause of syncope is orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is a drop in BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 10 mm Hg diastolic within a few minutes of standing.

- **Potential causes of syncope**: Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH; that is, OH resulting from autonomic dysfunction) can be differentiated from non-neurogenic causes of OH (e.g. hypovolemia) clinically by autonomic function tests and by an insufficient compensatory heart rate (HR) increase on standing. Common clinical signs and symptoms of nOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope, and falls. Neurogenic OH is frequently comorbid with other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction, including Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and type 2 diabetes. Neurogenic OH increases the risk of falls, which in turn interferes with activities of daily living and increases the burden of symptoms for patients and their caregivers.

### Symptom score: A new instrument to assess orthostatic intolerance in children and adolescents [^1126C155]. Journal of Child Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

To develop an orthostatic intolerance symptom scoring system, we aimed to assess orthostatic intolerance and compare the symptom score among different head-up tilt test responses.

- **Methods**: 272 subjects (ages 5–18) presenting with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance completed a questionnaire and underwent a head-up tilt test. According to the hemodynamic responses from the head-up tilt test, the subjects were divided into three groups: head-up tilt test negative, vasovagal syncope, and postural tachycardia syndrome groups.

- **Results**: We established a symptom score based on the frequency of dizziness, headache, blurred vision, palpitations, chest discomfort, gastrointestinal symptoms, profuse perspiration, and syncope. The median score was highest in subjects with postural tachycardia syndrome. A score of 2.5 was determined to predict vasovagal syncope with a sensitivity of 75.0% and specificity of 50.3%, while a score of 5.5 for predicting postural tachycardia syndrome yielded a sensitivity of 69.7% and a specificity of 72.0%. Furthermore, the median score in postural tachycardia syndrome subjects was significantly higher than in head-up tilt test negative subjects with a heart rate increment of 30–39 beats/min (P < .01).

- **Conclusions**: This indicates that the symptom score possesses predictive value in head-up tilt test results, serving as a preliminary assessment instrument.

### Tilt testing evolves: Faster and still accurate [^113KyGJv]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

This editorial refers to 'Short-duration head-up tilt test potentiated with sublingual nitroglycerin in suspected vasovagal syncope: the fast Italian protocol', by V. Russo et al. In this issue of the European Heart Journal, Russo and colleagues report the results of a randomized trial of a considerably shortened version of the widely used Italian tilt test protocol. They compared similar test structures, with the new version lasting only 20 minutes, to the currently recommended duration of 35 minutes. The two test protocols performed very similarly, which offers the possibility of saving precious clinical time.

The importance of this study is best understood in the context of assessment of syncope, considering the long evolution of tilt-table testing and the necessary diffusion of this simple and short diagnostic tool into many settings.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^1132ZTDm]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

The determination of the underlying mechanism of syncope is critical for choosing an appropriate treatment and management protocol. A proposed diagnostic algorithm should include a detailed patient history and physical examination, comprising supine and standing BP measurements and an ECG. If the determination of the mechanism of syncope is inconclusive after initial examinations, autonomic function testing is warranted.

- **Diagnostic algorithm and treatment options**: The underlying causes of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) can be varied, necessitating consideration of multiple factors in the management of nOH, especially in the presence of comorbid conditions. A case report identified amyloidosis as a potential cause in a patient who presented with autonomic nervous system impairment, orthostatic hypotension (OH), and systemic organ involvement, including gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction. In two other case reports, patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and cardiac conditions presented with dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue, and were subsequently diagnosed with nOH. In one of these cases, the patient was initially suspected to have bradycardia due to overlapping symptoms with nOH and was referred for a pacemaker before diagnostic testing for nOH was considered. Therefore, it is imperative for clinicians to screen for nOH when patients present with non-specific symptoms.

### Twenty-eight years of research permit reinterpretation of tilt-testing: Hypotensive susceptibility rather than diagnosis [^113Bs5qW]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

There is growing skepticism over the utility of tilt-testing for syncope diagnosis. It has been shown to be unable to distinguish between vasovagal syncope and other forms of syncope, especially cardiac types, despite its acceptable sensitivity and specificity in true positive and negative subjects. The new interpretation suggests that the test reveals a susceptibility to reflex hypotension, which may coexist with any cause of syncope. This implies an important change in patient management, particularly in selecting effective therapy and guiding pacemaker therapy in patients affected by reflex syncope.

### Tilt-induced vasovagal syncope and psychogenic pseudosyncope: Overlapping clinical entities [^117TE6fj]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

To describe the combination of tilt-induced vasovagal syncope (VVS) and psychogenic pseudosyncope (PPS) and aid its clinical recognition, we identified people with tilt-induced VVS/PPS from two tertiary syncope referral centers. For each case, three controls with tilt-induced VVS were selected at random from the same center. Clinical characteristics were compared between both groups, adjusting for multiple comparisons.

Of 1,164 tilt-table tests, 23 (2%) resulted in VVS/PPS; these 23 cases were compared with 69 VVS controls. VVS and PPS coincided more often than chance would predict: 2% vs. 0.6%, p 1 minute (+LR 2.86, 95% CI 1.98–4.13).

VVS/PPS presents with a complex phenotype. High attack frequency, delayed recovery of consciousness, apparent loss of consciousness > 1 minute, ictal eye closure, atypical triggers, and the absence of prodromes may serve as indicators that PPS coincides with VVS.

### Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in familial Mediterranean fever [^112EpR4Y]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2002).

The objective was to compare the hemodynamic responses to autonomic challenge evoked by upright tilt table testing in patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).

- **Methods**: Forty consecutive patients with FMF and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were evaluated using the head-up tilt test (HUTT). The main outcome measures were the values of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) recorded during recumbence and tilt. The endpoints of vasodepressor and cardioinhibitory reactions, orthostatic tachycardia, and postural tachycardia syndrome were recorded.

- **Results**: Patients with FMF exhibited significantly higher diastolic BP during supine and tilt measurements (p = 0.003 and 0.04, respectively). In response to tilt, patients showed significant increases in HR compared to healthy subjects (p = 0.02). Pathological endpoints on tilt were observed in the FMF group in 7 patients (17%) and in no controls. FMF severity, genotype, duration of illness, response to therapy, and associated amyloidosis did not correlate with pathological reactions on HUTT.

- **Conclusion**: FMF patients exhibit an abnormal cardiovascular reactivity, which is clinically occult, but can be detected on autonomic challenge. The abnormal autonomic activity in FMF is similar to dysautonomia described in a variety of rheumatic disorders.

### The semiology of tilt-induced psychogenic pseudosyncope [^113QaSNk]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to provide a detailed semiology to aid the clinical recognition of psychogenic pseudosyncope (PPS), which concerns episodes of apparent transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) that mimic syncope.

Methods: We analyzed all consecutive tilt-table tests from 2006 to 2012 showing proven PPS, where apparent TLOC occurred without EEG changes or a decrease in heart rate (HR) or blood pressure (BP). Baseline characteristics, video data, EEG, ECG, and continuous BP measurements were analyzed on a 1-second time scale and compared with those of 69 cases of tilt-induced vasovagal syncope (VVS).

Results: Of 800 tilt-table tests, 43 (5.4%) resulted in PPS, with the majority (74%) being women. The median duration of apparent TLOC was longer in PPS (44 seconds) than in VVS (20 seconds, p < 0.05). During the event, eye closure occurred in 97% of PPS cases compared to only 7% in VVS cases (p < 0.0001). A sudden head drop or moving down the tilt table was more common in PPS than in VVS (p < 0.01), while jerking movements occurred more frequently in VVS (p < 0.0001). In PPS, both HR and BP increased before and during apparent TLOC (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions: PPS is clinically distinct from VVS and can be diagnosed accurately with tilt-table testing and simultaneous EEG monitoring. Compared with VVS, eye closure during the event, long periods of apparent TLOC, and high HR and BP are highly specific for PPS. Improved understanding of the semiology of PPS as a clinical entity is vital to ensure accurate diagnosis.

### Tilt testing remains a valuable asset [^112r9ho8]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The head-up tilt test (TT) has been used for over 50 years to study heart rate and blood pressure adaptation to positional changes, model responses to hemorrhage, assess orthostatic hypotension, and evaluate hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses in congestive heart failure, autonomic dysfunction, and hypertension. During these studies, some subjects experienced syncope due to vasovagal reflex. As a result, tilt testing was incorporated into the clinical assessment of syncope when the origin was unknown.

Subsequently, clinical experience supports the diagnostic value of TT. This is highlighted in evidence-based professional practice guidelines, which provide advice for TT methodology and interpretation while concurrently identifying its limitations. Thus, TT remains a valuable clinical asset, one that has added importantly to the understanding of the pathophysiology of syncope or collapse and, thereby, has improved the care of syncopal patients.

### The sensitivity of the Bielschowsky head-tilt test in diagnosing acquired bilateral superior oblique paresis [^111f4Rj5]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity of the Bielschowsky head-tilt test and other commonly used criteria in identifying patients with true bilateral superior oblique paresis.

A retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients seen between 1978 and 2009 who were diagnosed with acquired bilateral superior oblique paresis. All patients had a confirmed history of head trauma or brain surgery with altered consciousness followed by symptomatic diplopia. Bilateral superior oblique paresis was defined and diagnosed by the aforementioned history, including the presence of greater extorsion in downgaze than upgaze on Lancaster red-green testing, a V-pattern strabismus, and bilateral fundus extorsion.

- **Methods**: We analyzed findings of the Bielschowsky head-tilt test, the Parks 3-step test, and reversal of the hypertropia from straight-ahead gaze to the other eight diagnostic positions of gaze to determine these tests' sensitivity in identifying true bilateral superior oblique paresis.

- **Results**: Twenty-five patients were identified with the diagnosis of true bilateral superior oblique paresis. The Bielschowsky head-tilt test had a 40% sensitivity, the Parks 3-step test had a sensitivity of 24%, and reversal of the hypertropia had a sensitivity of 60% in making the diagnosis of true bilateral superior oblique paresis.

- **Conclusions**: What previously has been described as masked bilateral superior oblique paresis simply may be a reflection of the inherently poor sensitivity of the Bielschowsky head-tilt test, the Parks 3-step test, and reversal of the hypertropia in diagnosing bilateral superior oblique paresis.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS): A critical assessment [^1142on9W]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Although diagnostic criteria have been developed characterizing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), no single set of criteria is universally accepted. Furthermore, there are gaps in the present criteria used to identify individuals with this condition. The reproducibility of the physiological findings, the relationship of symptoms to physiological findings, the presence of symptoms alone without any physiological findings, and the response to various interventions confuse rather than clarify this condition.

As many disease entities can be confused with POTS, it becomes critical to identify what this syndrome is. What appears to be POTS may be an underlying condition that requires specific therapy. POTS is not simply orthostatic intolerance and symptoms or intermittent orthostatic tachycardia; rather, the syndrome needs to be characterized over time and with reproducibility.

Here, we address critical issues regarding the pathophysiology and diagnosis of POTS in an attempt to arrive at a rational approach to categorize the syndrome. The hope is that this may help both to better identify individuals and to better understand approaches to therapy.

### Improving referrals for tilt table testing in patients with transient loss of consciousness [^1147Yf6o]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) is a common problem, and the diagnosis is often challenging. After careful history taking, physical examination, and basic tests, the diagnosis is clear in many patients. However, a significant proportion of patients with syncope require further investigations to characterize the cause of their TLOC. This quality improvement project aimed to improve the standard of referrals received from Castle Hill Hospital in Hull for tilt table testing in patients with TLOC.

Tilt table testing has been performed at Castle Hill Hospital since mid-2011. Currently, approximately five patients are referred for testing each month, with one to three tests being performed each week, excluding public holidays. Not all of these referrals derive from Castle Hill Hospital, as several hospitals in the region also refer their patients to the tertiary center for tilt table testing.

In a departmental audit of 217 consecutive patients undergoing tilt testing, only one patient had a cardioinhibitory response, 20 had a vasodepressor response, three had a mixed response, and 15 had postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Eighty-two percent had normal tests. In order to optimize the use of resources to improve the diagnostic yield, we aimed to find out whether patients are referred according to guidance from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).

While improving the appropriateness of referrals was our aim, our project also has the potential to improve patient care by avoiding unnecessary investigations, further enhancing the efficiency of the service.

### Syncope [^114CCpXx]. Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Syncope is a common clinical presentation. Although it is most commonly benign, it may herald a pathology with a poor prognosis. The work-up of syncope includes a careful history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, risk stratification, and appropriately directed testing. The key factor in the investigation of syncope is the presence or absence of structural heart disease or an abnormal electrocardiogram. The most useful investigation in unexplained syncope with a normal heart is the tilt table test for evaluating predisposition to neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope. In the setting of structural heart disease or an abnormal electrocardiogram, electrophysiologic studies play a more important role. The utility of noninvasive cardiac monitoring for symptom-rhythm correlation may be limited by infrequent symptoms. The availability of external and implantable loop recorders allows prolonged periods of monitoring to increase diagnostic yield. The management of patients with syncope may be complex. Early referral to a cardiac electrophysiologist is warranted in patients who are at high risk.

### Vasovagal syncope in the older patient [^1132UnSL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) has been diagnosed with increasing frequency in older patients since the head-up tilt-table test (HUT) was described over two decades ago. The incidence and prevalence of VVS in this age group remain unknown. Older individuals are more likely to display a dysautonomic hemodynamic pattern with a predominantly hypotensive response during HUT. The positivity rates to passive and isoproterenol-provoked HUT are reduced with age, but positivity rates for glyceryl-trinitrate-induced HUT are comparable with younger subjects. Few studies into treatment strategies have included older subjects. This is a review of the existing literature on the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnostic tools, and treatment strategies for VVS in older patients, highlighting important areas for future research.

### Usefulness of tilt testing and carotid sinus massage for evaluating reflex syncope [^115YkqGM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Thirty years ago, tilt testing (TT) was described as a tool in the diagnostic work-up of vasovagal syncope; after its initial success, some flaws have become evident. The concept of hypotensive susceptibility has provided the test a new relevance, shifting from diagnosis only to therapeutic management. Carotid sinus massage (CSM) was introduced at the beginning of the 20th century; the technique has evolved over the years, whereas the concept of carotid sinus syndrome (CSS) has remained unchanged and uncontested for more than half a century. Nowadays, CSS is a matter of debate, with new classifications and criteria coming on the scene. Recently, a common central etiological mechanism has been hypothesized for reflex syncope, manifesting as CSS, vasovagal syncope, or both. In this context, TT and CSM acquire an important role in clinical practice, being essential for a complete diagnosis and treatment. Recalling their historical background, the present paper illustrates an actual interpretation of TT and CSM.

### Orthostatic hypotension: A practical approach [^113612CJ]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more systolic or 10 mm Hg or more diastolic within three minutes of standing from the supine position or when assuming a head-up position of at least 60 degrees during tilt table testing. Symptoms arise due to inadequate physiological compensation and organ hypoperfusion, including headache, lightheadedness, shoulder and neck pain (coat hanger syndrome), visual disturbances, dyspnea, and chest pain. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in the community setting is 20% in older adults and 5% in middle-aged adults.

Risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, increase the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension across all age groups. This condition is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular risk and falls, and up to a 50% increase in relative risk of all-cause mortality. Diagnosis is confirmed by performing a bedside simplified Schellong test, which includes measuring blood pressure and heart rate after five minutes in the supine position and three minutes after moving to a standing position. If the patient cannot safely stand, or if clinical suspicion for orthostatic hypotension remains high despite normal findings on the bedside test, head-up tilt table testing is recommended.

Orthostatic hypotension is classified as neurogenic or non-neurogenic, depending on etiology and heart rate response. Treatment goals for orthostatic hypotension focus on reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Initial treatment targets the underlying cause and involves adjusting potentially causative medications.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^113pcNNH]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) is a prevalent disorder. Clinicians from a variety of specialties need to be well-informed about the diagnosis and management of nOH, as it carries a significant burden of morbidity and has also been associated with increased mortality. Clinicians should, therefore, familiarize themselves with this condition and evolving management options, which offer substantial symptomatic improvement. This communication will focus primarily on nOH, while recognizing that orthostatic symptoms are often multifactorial; patients with nOH may have their symptoms worsened by medications, hypovolemia, intrinsic cardiovascular disease, and other factors.

The literature on nOH is fraught with inconsistencies in the definition and methods of diagnosis, and suffers from a lack of evidence-based guidelines to direct clinicians towards 'best practice'. As nOH is a subset of orthostatic hypotension (OH), it should be noted that patients with nOH and OH may experience the same symptoms but for different reasons. The following consensus definition of OH was devised by the American Autonomic Society and the American Academy of Neurology, and endorsed by the European Federation of Autonomic Societies and the World Federation of Neurology: OH is "… a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg, or both, within 3 min of standing or head-up tilt to at least 60° on a tilt table". In addition to meeting the definition for OH, patients with nOH have impairment of the autonomic nervous system.

- **Renal function tests**: Creatinine, urea.
- **TSH**: Thyroid-stimulating hormone.
- **Morning cortisol levels**: To assess adrenal function.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: A hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogeneous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical, and delayed OH, as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks, either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and it is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms. Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods, and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Selective use of diagnostic tests inpatients with syncope of unknown cause [^1151DPrT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

We sought to prospectively assess the diagnostic yielding of a protocol in which electrophysiologic studies (EPS), tilt-table tests (TTTs), and loop recorder implantation are selectively used. The optimal strategy in the diagnosis of patients with syncope of unknown cause has not been defined.

A total of 184 consecutive patients with syncope of unknown cause were classified into two groups. Group A consisted of 72 patients fulfilling any of the following criteria:

- **Presence of structural heart disease or family history of sudden death**.

- **Abnormal electrocardiogram**.

- **Significant non-symptomatic arrhythmia on Holter monitoring**.

- **Paroxysmal palpitations immediately before or after syncope**. These patients initially underwent an EPS and, if this study was negative, TTT. In the remaining 112 patients (group B), TTT was performed.

The EPS was positive in 32 patients (44%) in group A. The TTT was positive in 80 patients (71%) in group B. An additional patient had carotid sinus hypersensitivity. In patients of group A with a negative EPS, the TTT was positive in 23 (57%). A loop recorder was implanted in 15 patients from group A with negative conventional testing, and diagnostic activation was obtained in seven patients. Overall, a positive diagnosis was achieved in 143 patients (78%).

In patients with syncope of unknown cause, selective use of EPS or TTT leads to a positive diagnosis in > 70% of the cases. An implantable loop recorder can be useful in non-diagnosed cases.

### Usefulness of the tilt table test: A "geriatric" point of view [^116X2bs2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

The tilt table test (TTT) is an important tool for diagnosing neurally mediated syncope (NMS) (Figure 1). The ESC guidelines for diagnosis and management of syncope recommend the TTT as an additional test when first-line diagnostic tests — such as medical history, standing test, and ECG — are inconclusive. The physician's experience in dealing with NMS and knowledge of the guidelines are important safeguards to ensure a high sensitivity and specificity of TTT.

This is because, in some circumstances, TTT-induced hemodynamic stress can evoke syncope even in individuals considered healthy, without a history of syncope. In other words, TTT can have high sensitivity but unacceptably low specificity in this scenario. Similarly, when the diagnosis of NMS is almost certain or highly likely, no further evaluation is necessary, and one can proceed with eventual treatment. Instead, TTT can be useful in patients with recurrent episodes of syncope, when autonomic disturbances are suspected, or when a single unwitnessed syncope occurs but the cause is not clear.

- **Figure 1**: Tilt table test

Recently, Sutton et al. highlighted the potential applications of TTT. In full agreement with their article, we would suggest an additional use of TTT in clinical conditions typically encountered in older people. For instance, TTT can be useful in cases of unexplained falls, or in patients with amnesia to check for prodromal symptoms, or to diagnose classical orthostatic hypotension (OH) when active standing is required.

### Use of Valsalva maneuver to detect late-onset delayed orthostatic hypotension [^115Q2U8s]. Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

Standard autonomic testing includes a 10-minute head-up tilt table test to detect orthostatic hypotension. Although this test can detect delayed orthostatic hypotension (dOH) between 3 and 10 minutes of standing, it cannot detect late-onset dOH after 10 minutes of standing.

- **Methods**: To determine whether Valsalva maneuver responses can identify patients who would require a prolonged head-up tilt table test to diagnose late-onset dOH, patients with immediate orthostatic hypotension (onset 10 minutes; n = 32) were retrospectively compared with controls (n = 114) with normal head-up tilt table test and composite autonomic scoring scale score of 0.

- **Results**: Changes in baseline systolic blood pressure at late phase 2 (∆SBP VM2), heart rate difference between baseline and phase 3 (∆HR VM3), and Valsalva ratio were lower, while pressure recovery time (PRT) at phase 4 was longer in late-onset dOH patients than in controls. Differences in PRT and ∆HR VM3 remained significant after correcting for age. A PRT ≥ 2.14 s and ∆HR VM3 ≤ 15 bpm distinguished late-onset dOH from age- and sex-matched controls. Patients with longer PRT (relative risk ratio, 2.189 [1.579–3.036]) and lower ∆HR VM3 (relative risk ratio, 0.897 [0.847–0.951]) were more likely to have late-onset dOH. Patients with longer PRT (relative risk ratio, 1.075 [1.012–1.133]) were more likely to have early-onset than late-onset dOH.

- **Conclusions**: Long PRT and short ∆HR VM3 can help to identify patients who require prolonged testing for dOH.

### Interesting presentation of a broad complex tachycardia during the head up tilt table test [^112jvhtu]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Broad complex tachycardia (BCT) during the head up tilt test (HUTT) is infrequent. The electrophysiology study (EPS) plays an important role in further differentiation of BCT. We present a case of BCT during HUTT in a patient presenting with presyncope, which later on EPS with 3D mapping was diagnosed as ventricular tachycardia. This case highlights the unusual occurrence of BCT during HUTT, the differential diagnosis of BCT, and the utility of EPS to reliably identify the type and origin of BCT.

### Vasovagal syncope [^114ixqkF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope is the most common type of syncope and is one of the most difficult types to manage. This article reviews the status of mechanisms, diagnosis, and management of vasovagal syncope.

- **Data sources**: A MEDLINE search was conducted for English-language and German-language articles on vasovagal syncope published up to June 1999.

- **Study selection**: The study included case reports and series, clinical trials, research investigations, and review articles from peer-reviewed journals.

- **Data extraction**: Findings were summarized and discussed individually. Summaries were created in table format. Statistical analysis of combined data was found inappropriate due to differences among studies concerning patient selection, testing, and follow-up.

- **Data synthesis**: The population of patients with vasovagal syncope is highly heterogeneous. Triggers of vasovagal syncope are likely to be diverse, with many potential central and peripheral triggers identified. However, the specific mechanisms involving decreased preload, sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation, vasodilation, and cardioinhibition remain unknown. Tilt-table testing is a widely used diagnostic tool and should be interpreted in the context of patients' clinical presentations, with an understanding of the test's sensitivity and specificity. Assessing therapeutic outcomes has been challenging due to patient heterogeneity, the large number of pharmacologic agents available, and the sporadic nature of the syndrome complex.

### Head-up tilt testing in older syncope patients: a systematic review [^115bnFv7]. Age and Ageing (2025). Low credibility.

The study examined the distribution of diagnoses through head-up tilt testing in older patients experiencing syncope. A median of 34.2% of cases were diagnosed with reflex syncope, showing significant variability across studies, ranging from 3.3% to 85.4%. Many studies revealed significant differences in the proportions of cardioinhibitory (VASIS 2) and vasodepressor (VASIS 3) syncope between older and younger patients. The vasodepressor form was more prevalent among older subjects, with a median of 33.3% (range 0%–71.8%) versus 56.9% (range 37.8%–70.4%); VASIS 2 had a median of 9.1% (range 0%–75.5%) versus 24.7% (range 1%–42.6%); and VASIS 3 had a median of 54.9% (range 18.2%–91.2%) versus 23.6% (range 2.4%–42.9%).

- **Other syncope diagnoses**: Both orthostatic hypotension (median 19.8%, range 0%–46.7%) and carotid sinus syndrome (median 11.4%, range 2.2%–63%) occurred more frequently in older patients, although some studies excluded these conditions beforehand and thus did not report on these outcomes. Most studies, excluding two, also omitted patients with a cardiac origin of syncope, and psychogenic pseudosyncope was reported in only five studies, with a median of 3.8% of cases (range 0.2%–10%), compared to 5.6% (range unspecified).

### Diagnostic efficacy of transcranial Doppler combined with upright tilt test in vasovagal syncope [^115jQ9Xx]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope (VVS) is the most common subtype of syncope, and it significantly impacts patients' quality of life while incurring substantial healthcare costs. Although the head-up tilt table test (HUTT) is the gold standard method for diagnosing VVS, its sensitivity and specificity are limited, which leads to diagnostic challenges. Combining HUTT with transcranial Doppler (TCD) can improve diagnostic accuracy by addressing limitations in monitoring cerebral blood flow during syncope evaluation. In this study, we aimed to analyze the diagnostic efficacy of combining the HUTT and TCD in patients with VVS.

- **Methods**: In this prospective study, we enrolled 102 patients with suspected VVS who underwent combined HUTT and TCD evaluation. The diagnostic performance of the combined approach was compared to that of the standalone HUTT, with a focus on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

- **Results**: The multimodal testing group showed a 25.61% increase in sensitivity for diagnosing VVS compared to the standalone HUTT group, albeit with a 10.00% reduction in specificity. The false-negative rate decreased by 25.61%, while the false-positive rate increased by 10.00%. Furthermore, the positive likelihood ratio increased by 0.151, and the negative likelihood ratio decreased by 0.3701. The overall accuracy increased by 7.8%. Notably, the areas under the curve for systolic and mean cerebral blood flow velocities were 0.717 and 0.744, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The combination of HUTT and TCD significantly enhanced the diagnostic efficacy in patients with VVS, improving the predictive power of the tests.

### Tilt testing evolves: Faster and still accurate [^1156Y9jL]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

The shortened protocol is sufficiently easy, safe, non-invasive, inexpensive, and well-tolerated that it could be implemented in most clinics, requiring less infrastructure than a stress test. Early use of this protocol might reduce the need for expensive implantable loop recorders. In countries with less established syncope units, this might significantly expand the number of treating physicians who would use it simply as another diagnostic test. This would change the paradigm completely, from highly specialized and few syncope specialists to numbers more able to meet the diagnostic demand. Syncope assessment could become generalized, moving out of large referral sites to the community — a pattern demonstrated repeatedly for successful and valuable medical procedures. Moreover, one standardized methodology would facilitate international collaboration and multicentre studies, so desperately needed for an effective reflex syncope treatment.

The shortening of the protocol by the Russo group rightly focuses on syncope diagnosis, of course, following a clinical history. Its wide acceptance may generate a need for different protocols: one for patients with a history of unexplained syncope and high likelihood of reflex mechanism, and another for orthostatic intolerance with underlying cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction but without a history of syncope. The latter includes common dysautonomic conditions such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and orthostatic hypotension, especially the delayed (slowly progressing) form, where an active standing test may be appropriate.

### Hypotension unawareness in profound orthostatic hypotension [^112zpMwa]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Clinicians depend on the history provided by patients when considering the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension.

- **Methods**: Patients with a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 60 mm Hg from baseline during a head-up tilt table test were included. They were classified according to their symptoms during the test, and the localization of the cause of orthostatic hypotension was sought in each of these groups.

- **Results**: Eighty-eight patients (43%) had typical symptoms, 49 (24%) had atypical symptoms, and 68 (33%) were asymptomatic. The average decrease in systolic blood pressure was 88 mm Hg, 87.5 mm Hg, and 89.8 mm Hg in the typical, atypical, and asymptomatic groups, respectively (P = 0.81). Patients reported severe dizziness with a similar frequency to lower extremity discomfort. Backache and headache were also common atypical complaints. Patients with a peripheral cause of dysautonomia were able to sustain the longest upright position during the head-up tilt table test (21 minutes, compared with central dysautonomia at 15 minutes) (P = 0.005). There was no correlation between the cause of dysautonomia and the occurrence of symptoms during the test (P = 0.58).

- **Conclusion**: A third of the patients with severe orthostatic hypotension are completely asymptomatic during the head-up tilt table test, and another quarter have atypical complaints that would not lead physicians toward the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. These findings suggest that they might not provide adequate information in diagnosing profound orthostatic hypotension.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of syncope, specifically concerning the diagnostic criteria for vasovagal syncope, the ESC 2018 guidelines recommend a high probability of suspecting vasovagal syncope in patients whose syncope is precipitated by pain, fear, or standing. This suspicion is further supported when these episodes are associated with the typical progressive prodrome, such as pallor, sweating, and/or nausea.

### Utility of autonomic testing for the efficient diagnosis and effective pharmacological management of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension [^114LYqVk]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Autonomic function testing was performed to determine whether the orthostatic hypotension (OH) was neurogenic in origin. Tilt table testing revealed a blood pressure (BP) drop from 112/68 mm Hg (heart rate, 74 bpm) after 6 minutes in the supine position to 76/60 mm Hg (83 bpm) within 2 minutes of tilt to the 80° head-up position; this BP drop was accompanied by dizziness and weakness at 2 minutes of tilt and presyncope at 4 minutes of tilt. Continuous recording with transcranial Doppler during tilt testing indicated no changes in mean cerebral blood flow.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings during the heart rate with deep breathing test (paced breathing at six breaths per minute) showed an expiration/inhalation ratio of 1.02, which is abnormal for the patient's age and sex, indicating depressed baseline autonomic tone and decreased vagal tone. Valsalva testing (measured at 40 mm Hg) revealed a Valsalva ratio of 1.15, which is also abnormal for the patient's age and sex. Taken together, the results of autonomic testing were consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) for this patient.

### Tilt testing remains a valuable asset [^113KuSZS]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The head-up tilt test (TT) has been used for more than half a century by physiologists and physicians to study heart rate and blood pressure adaptation to positional changes, model responses to hemorrhage, assess characteristics of orthostatic hypotension (OH), and evaluate hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses in congestive heart failure, autonomic dysfunction, and hypertension. During these studies, some subjects experienced total or near-total transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) due to hypotension induced by TT, often accompanied by bradycardia/asystole. Consequently, beginning in the late 1980s, TT was incorporated into the clinical assessment of syncope of unknown origin as a method of triggering the vasovagal reflex in susceptible individuals by exposing them to a controlled orthostatic challenge in a safe, monitored, clinical laboratory environment.

However, the clinical utility of TT has been criticized, most recently by Kulkarni et al, who promoted the less well-studied active stand test largely based on the presumption of lower expense and, perhaps, greater convenience. In this review, while acknowledging TT limitations, we aim to offer a counterpoint to the views of Kulkarni et al. by emphasizing both TT's well-documented clinical value and recommendations by multiple practice guidelines.

### Clinical laboratory testing: What is the role of tilt-table testing, active standing test, carotid massage, electrophysiological testing, and ATP test in the syncope evaluation [^115M81P7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected syncope begins with an "initial evaluation" consisting of careful history taking, physical examination, including orthostatic blood pressure measurement, and electrocardiogram. However, even in expert centers, the diagnostic yield of this "initial evaluation" is only approximately 50%. In the remaining cases where a satisfactory diagnosis is either unknown or uncertain after the initial assessment, additional clinical testing is needed.

This article reviews the role of some of the more commonly used additional diagnostic tests, including tilt-table testing, the active standing test, carotid sinus massage, electrophysiological testing, and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) test. The role of angiography, exercise testing, and imaging is noted briefly. Other clinical laboratory investigations, such as ambulatory ECG monitoring, are examined in other papers in this issue.

In brief, clinical laboratory tests, carefully interpreted, may be useful in evaluating the basis of suspected syncope. However, these tests should be selected carefully and performed based on the pre-test probability inferred from the initial examination, and the less invasive tests should be used first.

### Tilt testing evolves: faster and still accurate [^114oMrgR]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

The evolution of the tilt test protocol for reflex syncope and autonomic dysfunction from 1986 to 2023 demonstrates significant advancements. The left side of this study's graphical abstract illustrates the progression of the tilt test protocol for reflex syncope, leading to the development of the 'Fast Italian protocol'. It also indicates the years when changes were introduced. Notably, tilt angles have progressively increased, with a 70° angle now being the norm. Tilt durations have become shorter during the passive phase, with less alteration observed in the active (drug challenge) phase, which may need to reach a minimum for the drug to induce its effect and trigger reflex syncope.

The central figure depicts a tilt test being conducted, where it is noted that intravascular blood volume shifts into the legs with upright posture. The right side of the abstract summarizes applications of the tilt test for detecting cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, with tilt durations proposed by autonomic societies. Abbreviations used in this presentation include GTN for nitroglycerin, POTS for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and OH for orthostatic hypotension.

### Impedance cardiography: A role in vasovagal syncope diagnosis [^117GbQbt]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope across all age groups, with diagnosis typically based on patient history, clinical examination, and basic investigations that exclude alternative causes of syncope. When uncertainty remains, the head-up tilt (HUT) test is employed for diagnosis; however, it is time-consuming and lacks a gold standard for accurately assessing sensitivity and specificity. As such, alternative methods for diagnosing vasovagal syncope are valuable.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential for impedance cardiography (ICG)-derived hemodynamic measures to predict HUT test outcomes in cases of unexplained syncope.

- **Design**: The study was a prospective controlled study.

- **Subjects**: It involved eighty-six patients with unexplained syncope and 43 non-syncopal controls.

- **Methods**: All subjects underwent continuous heart rate, blood pressure, and ICG measurements during a 10-minute supine rest and throughout the HUT. Vasovagal syncope was diagnosed when patients experienced symptom reproduction accompanied by hemodynamic derangements.

- **Results**: During the resting period before HUT, the syncopal group exhibited a higher mean heart rate (P = 0.0008) and a lower baroreceptor effectiveness index (P < 0.0001) compared to the non-syncopal controls. When comparing patients who presented with unexplained syncope and subsequently had a positive HUT (thereby diagnosed with vasovagal syncope; 55 [64%]; mean age 47 years, range 17–85) to those with a negative tilt test (n = 31; mean age 47 years, range 17–88), no significant differences were found in cardiovascular or autonomic parameters prior to HUT. A predictive ROC curve model with an 85% threshold allowed the use of cardiographic parameters as potential predictors.

### Usefulness of the tilt table test: A "geriatric" point of view [^111Rt677]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Low credibility.

Use of the tilt table test (TTT) in the diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in older adults represents a crucial concern. The American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines note that TTT plays a role in OH and postural intolerance, but active standing may be a simpler, cheaper, and more specific test.

With respect to active standing, TTT reduces the effect of the muscle pump reflex in the lower limbs, thus increasing venous pooling. However, in older adults, the effort of standing up may cause an increase in transient ischemia and metabolites in the muscles, which reduces venous return and further increases venous pooling. In clinical practice, active standing is widely performed because it provides results that are reliable at a very low cost. Moreover, active standing can be performed anywhere, patients easily comply with it, and it does not require specific skills from the operator or physician.

However, especially in older people, besides classical OH, there can be a delayed form that occurs only after 3 minutes of standing. The test time of active standing is usually too brief to detect delayed OH, and a misdiagnosis could result in a high risk of falls or ischemic attacks in this age group. Therefore, in these patients, TTT plays a leading role in the diagnosis of OH, even compared to active standing.

In theory, by simply prolonging the duration of active standing, it could be possible to detect a delayed response to postural change. In practice, many older patients are affected by mobility problems or postural disturbances, such as Parkinson's disease. In these patients prone to the risk of falling, TTT is a safer test for diagnosis.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^112ZH7wi]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

To exclude other causes of orthostatic hypotension (OH) or neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH), if blood pressure and heart rate changes indicate OH/nOH, a complete history and physical examination should be conducted alongside electrocardiogram and laboratory testing, targeting the exclusion of non-neurogenic causes. This includes cardiogenic, vascular, or iatrogenic etiologies.

- **Recommended tests**: Cardiac disorders, such as those involving pacemakers, dysrhythmias, or ablation, can impact heart rate augmentation; hence, taking a cardiac history, performing an electrocardiogram, and reviewing medications are consistently recommended.

Due to the variability among patients regarding age, disease status, and medication usage, the lack of heart rate increase on standing may not always reliably indicate nOH in patients with OH. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the clinical scenario and specific presentation.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^117K1NdP]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of OH/nOH when compared to the normal population. For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when the symptoms occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals.

If a patient gives a positive response to one or more of the questions listed in the appropriate screening guidelines, they should be considered at risk for OH/nOH. A more complete evaluation, including orthostatic vital signs, needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH. From a practical standpoint, at the minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of the question, "Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 minutes of standing and get better when you sit or lay down?"

Because falls are of such consequence to aging patients, a specific question about the circumstances of falls is appropriate. Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing that they may lose their autonomy due to family member insistence on enhancing their safety.
