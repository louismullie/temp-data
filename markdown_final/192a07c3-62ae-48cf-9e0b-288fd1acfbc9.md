## Question

Cocksakie virus cold sore treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about whether coxsackievirus causes "cold sores" and what treatments are appropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiologic confusion between coxsackievirus and herpes simplex virus. Then, I should verify the clinical syndromes associated with each virus. Next, I will review evidence-based treatments for herpes labialis and confirm whether any antivirals work for coxsackievirus. After that, I need to check supportive care recommendations for coxsackievirus-related disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned plan and counseling points, making sure I flag any diagnostic pitfalls and special populations that might alter management.

> Let me first confirm the etiologic confusion. "Cold sores", also called herpes labialis, are caused by herpes simplex virus type 1, not coxsackievirus; coxsackieviruses are enteroviruses that cause hand-foot-and-mouth disease and related syndromes, which are distinct entities from HSV-1 cold sores, so conflating them would be incorrect and could lead to inappropriate therapy choices.

> Wait, let me verify the clinical syndromes to avoid mislabeling. Herpes labialis typically presents with a prodrome of tingling or burning, followed by grouped vesicles on the lip vermilion or perioral skin that crust and heal within about 7–10 days, often recurring at the same site; by contrast, coxsackievirus causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease with fever, sore throat, and vesicles on the hands, feet, and oral mucosa, and it is not associated with recurrent localized lip lesions like HSV-1 [^114Mj39t] [^114fKzQn].

> I should confirm the evidence-based treatments for herpes labialis. Oral valacyclovir 2 grams twice on day 1, initiated at the earliest prodromal symptom, shortens the episode by about 1 day; extending to a second day does not add benefit, and efficacy drops if started after vesicles appear, so timing is critical; topical acyclovir 5% cream applied five times daily for 4 days is FDA-approved and modestly effective, and the fixed-dose combination acyclovir 5% plus hydrocortisone 1% (Xerese) can reduce ulceration and speed healing when started early; penciclovir 1% cream is another topical option with modest benefit [^114k8FE1] [^117Ughp5] [^111KFFwU] [^113YWfsU] [^113bBVVd].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any antivirals work for coxsackievirus. There are no approved antivirals for coxsackievirus infections, including HFMD; management is supportive only, with acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain, hydration support, and avoidance of topical oral lidocaine due to aspiration risk; in severe or complicated cases, care is supportive and complications are managed symptomatically, not with antiviral therapy [^116aJhZF] [^117PAw5U].

> Let me consider supportive care details and potential pitfalls. For HFMD, emphasize hydration and age-appropriate analgesia; topical oral lidocaine is not recommended because of aspiration risk, especially in young children; most cases resolve in 7–10 days, but dehydration from painful oral lesions is the most common reason to seek care, and rare neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications warrant closer monitoring and supportive management as indicated [^116aJhZF] [^114fKzQn].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical and the diagnosis is uncertain. I should double-check for mimics and overlapping vesiculobullous diseases; eczema coxsackium can mimic eczema herpeticum, and PCR testing for HSV and enteroviruses can help distinguish entities when the clinical picture is unclear; in dermatology contexts, concurrent testing for HSV and enterovirus is reasonable when the eruption is extensive or hemorrhagic or when the patient has atopic dermatitis [^112t2ASV] [^116SrNsy].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. For immunocompromised patients with suspected HSV, systemic antivirals are appropriate; for immunocompromised patients with suspected coxsackievirus disease, supportive care remains the mainstay, with a lower threshold for hospitalization if complications arise; in pediatrics, valacyclovir is indicated for cold sores only in those aged 12 years and older, and efficacy is unproven if started after vesicles appear, reinforcing the need for early initiation [^113FudgF].

> Let me reconsider the original premise to avoid any residual ambiguity. The query about "coxsackie virus cold sore treatment" reflects a category error; coxsackievirus does not cause cold sores, so there is no coxsackievirus-specific treatment for cold sores, whereas cold sores due to HSV-1 respond to early valacyclovir or topical antivirals as outlined above; conversely, HFMD due to coxsackievirus requires only supportive care, not antiviral therapy [^117PAw5U] [^114k8FE1].

> Next, I should review prevention and counseling points. For HSV cold sores, early recognition of prodrome and prompt treatment reduce duration; for recurrent disease, suppressive oral antivirals can reduce frequency, though benefits are modest; for HFMD, hand hygiene and surface disinfection reduce transmission, and patients are generally contagious during the acute illness, so isolation from close contacts, especially young children, is prudent while symptomatic [^114ZNDVm] [^117PAw5U].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm the bottom line. Cold sores are HSV-1, not coxsackievirus; treat HSV early with valacyclovir 2 g twice on day 1 or with topical acyclovir or penciclovir, and consider acyclovir-hydrocortisone to reduce ulceration; coxsackievirus causes HFMD, which is managed supportively without antivirals; avoid oral lidocaine in children; and when the diagnosis is uncertain, use PCR to distinguish HSV from enterovirus in atypical or severe presentations [^114k8FE1] [^111KFFwU] [^113YWfsU] [^116aJhZF] [^112t2ASV].

Coxsackievirus does not cause cold sores; cold sores are due to HSV-1 [^114ZNDVm]. There is **no antiviral therapy** for Coxsackievirus infections, including hand-foot-and-mouth disease [^117PAw5U]; management is supportive only [^116aJhZF]. For HSV cold sores, use **acyclovir or valacyclovir** at first symptoms to shorten duration [^111KFFwU] [^114k8FE1]. Do not use antibiotics or corticosteroids for Coxsackievirus lesions, and avoid topical lidocaine in children due to toxicity risk [^116aJhZF] [^117PAw5U].

---

## Etiology and clinical presentation

Coxsackievirus is an enterovirus that causes HFMD, herpangina, and other self-limited illnesses; it does not cause cold sores. Cold sores are caused by HSV-1 and present as recurrent, localized, painful vesicles on the lips or perioral skin [^114zTHzb].

---

## Treatment of coxsackievirus infections

There is **no specific antiviral therapy** for coxsackievirus; treatment is supportive [^117PAw5U]:

- **Supportive care**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and pain; maintain hydration [^116aJhZF].
- **Topical analgesics**: Avoid oral lidocaine in children due to toxicity risk [^117PAw5U].
- **Hygiene**: Handwashing and surface disinfection reduce transmission [^117PAw5U].

## Treatment of herpes simplex virus cold sores

HSV cold sores have **effective antiviral options**:

| **Medication** | **Formulation** | **Dosage** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acyclovir | Topical cream | Apply 5 times daily for 4 days | Recurrent herpes labialis [^1137LYCz] |
| Valacyclovir | Oral tablets | 2 g twice daily for 1 day | Recurrent herpes labialis [^114k8FE1] |
| Penciclovir | Topical cream | Apply every 2 hours while awake for 4 days | Recurrent herpes labialis [^113bBVVd] |

---

Initiate therapy at the **earliest prodromal symptoms** for best effect [^1118JZTY].

---

## Misconceptions and inappropriate treatments

Avoid the following — they are ineffective or harmful:

- **Antibiotics**: Ineffective against viruses; risk of resistance [^115M96x7].
- **Corticosteroids**: Contraindicated; may worsen viral infections.
- **Topical lidocaine**: Avoid in children due to toxicity risk [^116aJhZF].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **hygiene and outbreak control**:

- **Hand hygiene**: Frequent handwashing reduces transmission [^117PAw5U].
- **Surface disinfection**: Clean contaminated surfaces regularly [^117PAw5U].
- **Isolation**: Avoid close contact during active infection [^notfound].

---

## Complications and when to seek medical attention

Complications are rare but can occur; **seek care** for:

- **Dehydration**: Inability to maintain fluids due to oral pain [^114fKzQn].
- **Neurologic symptoms**: Seizures, confusion, or severe headache [^notfound].
- **Persistent symptoms**: Fever > 3 days or symptoms > 10 days [^114fKzQn].

---

Coxsackievirus does not cause cold sores; there is **no antiviral therapy** for Coxsackievirus, and care is supportive [^117PAw5U]. For HSV cold sores, use acyclovir or valacyclovir early; avoid antibiotics and corticosteroids, and use hand hygiene to limit spread [^111KFFwU] [^114k8FE1] [^113N1bHJ].

### Coxsackievirus A21 synergizes with checkpoint inhibitors [^1132Zmnv]. Cancer Discovery (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment with a combination of a proprietary formulation of coxsackievirus and either an anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor yielded a higher response rate in phase I testing for melanoma than any of these drugs given on their own. Because the viral therapy adds little toxicity, it might prove an effective part of a dual regimen, according to interim trial data presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2017.

### Atypical presentations of hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6 – Minnesota, 2014 [^114ZSMMt]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

HFMD is a common, contagious childhood disease caused by members of the genus Enterovirus, usually the coxsackieviruses. HFMD is typically a mild, febrile illness, characterized by mouth sores and a red, sometimes blistery rash involving the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Nail loss occasionally occurs, often weeks after symptom onset. In the United States, HFMD is commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16. Cases of HFMD with atypical rashes, involving the arms, legs, trunk, perioral regions, buttocks, and genitalia have been recently reported in association with CVA6. Although HFMD is most common among children aged ≤ 5 years, adults can also be infected. However, clusters of HFMD in adults are unusual.

During 2011–2012, an outbreak of HFMD caused by CVA6 occurred in North America. Sixty-three cases were reported to CDC, including 15 among adults. Approximately 50% of the adult patients had reported exposure to children with HFMD. The college outbreak reported here might also have begun with an exposure to a symptomatic child. The spread of HFMD among adults in a college setting has not been previously described.

Most cases of HFMD are mild and treatment is supportive, although CVA6 has been associated with more severe disease. HFMD is transmitted person-to-person through contact with vesicle fluid, respiratory secretions, and feces. Hand washing and routine disinfection of surfaces help prevent spread. Awareness of unusual features of CVA6, including the occurrence of a varicella-like rash (,–) or a rash with an atypical distribution, can assist health care providers in diagnosing HFMD and recommending appropriate care.

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: rapid evidence review [^114Mj39t]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hand-foot-and-mouth disease:

- **Definition**: HFMD is a common viral illness caused by enteroviruses, primarily affecting infants and children, although it can occasionally occur in adults.
- **Pathophysiology**: HFMD is caused by enteroviruses, most commonly Coxsackievirus A16 and Enterovirus 71. It transmitted through direct contact with the saliva, nasal mucus, blister fluid, and feces of infected individuals.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of HFMD in China is estimated at 197 per 100,000 person-years. HFMD shows seasonal variation, with a peak in cases typically occurring in spring and early summer, and possesses the potential to escalate to epidemic levels.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for HFMD include young age, having close contact with infected individuals, being in group settings like schools or daycare centers, the summer and early fall seasons, and poor hygiene practices.
- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of HFMD typically include fever, sore throat, and a characteristic skin rash that presents as small, red, painful papules progressing to blisters on the hands, feet, and sometimes in the mouth, which can subsequently develop into ulcers.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The disease course is generally self-limiting, with symptoms resolving within a week without specific treatment. However, in rare cases, severe cardiac and neurologic complications can occur.

### Coxsackievirus B5 associated with hand-foot-mouth disease in a healthy adult [^112QCjcd]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Based on the history and physical examination, HFMD was diagnosed. The elevated CVB5 titer and pathology results were also strongly suggestive of this diagnosis. Other diagnoses to be considered were herpangina, aphthous ulcers, varicella, gingivostomatitis, erythema multiforme, and drug eruption. Symptomatic treatment was discussed, and the patient was given prescriptions for viscous and topical lidocaine for the painful oral and scalp lesions, respectively. In addition, as-needed analgesics, such as Tylenol and ibuprofen, and maintaining adequate oral fluid intake were discussed. At 1 week of follow-up, the patient stated his sore throat had decreased slightly, and the lesions on his scalp had already begun to resolve. At 1 month, the patient stated his fingernails had begun to shed from the nail base (onychomadesis). In addition, the skin and mucosal lesions almost completely resolved at this point. He reached his normal state of health with regrowth of new fingernails by 2 months postinfection.

### Combating coxsackievirus B infections [^115pThrq]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Coxsackieviruses B (CVB) are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the Enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. They are common worldwide and cause a wide variety of human diseases ranging from those having relatively mild symptoms to severe acute and chronic pathologies such as cardiomyopathy and type 1 diabetes. The development of safe and effective strategies to combat these viruses remains a challenge. The present review outlines current approaches to control CVB infections and associated diseases. Various drugs targeting viral or host proteins involved in viral replication as well as vaccines have been developed and shown potential to prevent or combat CVB infections in vitro and in vivo in animal models. Repurposed drugs and alternative strategies targeting miRNAs or based on plant extracts and probiotics and their derivatives have also shown antiviral effects against CVB. In addition, clinical trials with vaccines and drugs are underway and offer hope for the prevention or treatment of CVB-induced diseases.

### Hand-foot-and-mouth disease: rapid evidence review [^117PAw5U]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is caused by human enteroviruses and coxsackieviruses. Outbreaks can occur in the spring to fall and are common in North America, and most cases occur in patients younger than 10 years. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is transmitted by fecal-oral, oral-oral, and respiratory droplet contact. Patients present with a low-grade fever, a maculopapular or papulovesicular rash on the hands and soles of the feet, and painful oral ulcerations. Lesions usually resolve in seven to 10 days; however, in rare cases, patients may have neurologic or cardiopulmonary complications. The differential diagnosis for childhood rashes and oral enanthems is broad and includes erythema multiforme, herpes, measles, and varicella. Treatment is supportive and directed toward hydration and pain relief as needed with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Oral lidocaine is not recommended, and antiviral treatment is not available. The best methods to prevent the spread of hand-foot-and-mouth disease are handwashing and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces and fomites.

Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis plan was finalised before unblinding (see Appendix). Sample size calculations were based on the primary outcomes of incidence of severe and symptomatic COVID-19 in the BRACE trial. Participants were included under their randomised treatment group, as per the intention-to-treat principle. Our target estimate was the difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST, i.e. time free from first cold sore recurrence) over 12-months of follow-up and 95% confidence intervals (CI), estimated using a flexible parametric survival (Royston-Parmar) model on the log cumulative hazard scale, standardised for stratification factors used during randomisation (age group, presence of comorbidity, geographical location, and study stage). Assuming the proportional hazards assumption was found to be reasonable, we also presented hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95% CI. Participant data were censored at 12-months of follow-up; otherwise, data were censored at loss to follow-up or at the time of latest survey completion date without missing outcome data. Therefore, RMST can be interpreted as the average time before first cold sore recurrence restricted to 12 months follow-up (or to 12 months follow-up in those without recurrence). For clarity, this will be referred to as the 'time to first cold sore recurrence'.

Binary outcomes were summarised as between group model-fitted marginal risk differences (RD) and 95% CI estimated using binomial regression models adjusted for stratification factors. The frequency of cold sore episodes over 12 months was summarised as an incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% CI estimated using a negative binomial regression model adjusted for stratification factors.

Supplementary analyses were done in different subsets of participants: (i) in participants who ever had a cold sore (i.e. who reported having any number of previous cold sore episodes at baseline); (ii) in participants who reported 1 or more cold sore episodes in the preceding year; (iii) in participants who reported 2 or more cold sore episodes in the preceding year; and (iv) in participants who previously never had a cold sore. Sensitivity analyses were done: (i) limiting data to that ascertained through 3-month recall; (ii) in hypothetical scenarios in which suppressive therapy was not available (censoring data at initiation of suppressive therapy); and (iii) in the as-treated population, with participants analysed according to the intervention they received.

Executive summary — interpretation of recommendation strength and clinical-trial use policy states that, per Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, recommendations are labeled as "strong" or "conditional", and that "recommend" indicates strong recommendations while "suggest" indicates conditional recommendations. It also notes that when promising interventions were judged to have insufficient evidence of benefit with potential appreciable harms or costs, the expert panel recommended their use in the context of a clinical trial, acknowledging the current "knowledge gap" and aiming at avoiding premature favorable recommendations for potentially ineffective or harmful interventions.

14.1 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted in 1,856 healthy adults and adolescents (aged greater than or equal to 12 years) with a history of recurrent cold sores. Subjects self-initiated therapy at the earliest symptoms and prior to any signs of a cold sore. The majority of subjects initiated treatment within 2 hours of onset of symptoms. Subjects were randomized to valacyclovir 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by placebo on Day 2, valacyclovir 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by 1 gram twice daily on Day 2, or placebo on Days 1 and 2.

The mean duration of cold sore episodes was about 1 day shorter in treated subjects as compared with placebo. The 2-day regimen did not offer additional benefit over the 1-day regimen.

No significant difference was observed between subjects receiving valacyclovir or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions beyond the papular stage.

4 Coxsackieviruses as a viral vector system for gene therapy and vaccine development

A promising new class of anticancer immunotherapies known as oncolytic viruses (OVs) rely on particular viruses' innate capacity to infect and selectively lyse tumor cells while sparing non-neoplastic cells. Based on their intrinsic capacity to cause immunogenic cell death in cancer cells, OVs can be selected from native viral species; however, they can also be further promoted through pharmacological interventions or genetically modified to improve tumor selectivity, increase replication competence, reduce pathogenicity, and boost immunogenicity.

Coxsackieviruses vectors, particularly CVBs, have been regularly applied for gene therapy due to certain characteristics that make them attractive options for oncolytic virotherapy: i) They are RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm via a negative-sense RNA intermediary, avoiding genotoxicity from viral genome integration into host DNA; ii) CVs have a small RNA genome (∼7.5 kb), which makes them readily manipulable by reverse genetic methods presenting a good packing capacity; iii) CV can cause a persistent viral infection and induces lyses in many types of cancer cells, and their infection mostly based on the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways; iv) Adenovirus and coxsackievirus receptors (CAR) and heparan sulfate, which some CV types employ for cellular entry are extensively expressed on a variety of cancer types; v) CV infection is mainly controlled by type I interferon (IFN-I), whose cancers cells are more sensitive as compared to normal cells. Coxsackievirus-based virotherapy has been assessed both on its own and in conjunction with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Within this context, both CVB3 and CVA21 have proven useful for gene therapy and vaccine development. In particular, recombinant CVB3 expressing the human fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) demonstrated protection against ischemic necrosis after administration into mice with ischemic hindlimbs. Additionally, it has been shown that recombinant CVB3 expressing IFN- γ is an important approach for preventing CVB3-induced myocarditis and for providing long-term immune response. However, oncolytic virotherapy — which employs CVs that selectively target tumor cells — has become a viable new approach for treating a variety of human cancers. Indeed, numerous studies have described the oncolytic potential for different CVB3 strains. For instance, CVB3 has demonstrated a potent oncolytic activity against various cancer types, including colorectal cancer, lung cancer, endometrial cancer and breast cancer, even though the virus-induced toxicity in some studies and pathological modifications associated with pancreas and heart have been observed. CVA21 is another CV type that has been applied in oncolytic virotherapy. Studies have investigated the efficacy of CVA21 in melanoma, multiple myeloma, breast, bladder, lung, head and neck, and prostate cancer models with significant tumor regression, including in metastases. There is an oncolytic CVA21 manufactured commercially as CAVATAK™ by Viralytics Limited (Sydney, NSW, Australia) with significant anti-tumor activity. However, safety concerns were raised when CVA21-infected mice developed deadly myositis with paralysis. In addition to CVB3 and CVA21 being reported as potent oncolytic coxsackievirus, CVA11 has also been pointed out with high oncolytic activity. In fact, studies have suggested that CVA11 exerts robust oncolytic activity in human colon cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo, without inducing body weight loss or mortality in mice. It has also been shown that CVA11 has oncolytic effects on non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma. The oncolytic potential and molecular mechanisms, as well as the immunology evoked by coxsackieviruses during infection in cancer cells have been thoroughly reviewed.

### Children atopic dermatitis: diagnosis, mimics, overlaps, and therapeutic implication [^116SrNsy]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

4.2.3 Eczema herpeticum

Eczema herpeticum (EH) is a life‐threatening viral infection, which occurs acutely and is due to HSV in patients with a history of AD. Nearly a third of children who are hospitalized for AD infectious complications were related to EH. It can manifest with skin pruritus or pain and presence of vesicles, punched‐out erosions, or haemorrhagic crusts that can become more extensive. A local skin infection may progress to disseminated vesicles with skin breakdown. Systemic EH infection may present with fever, malaise, viremia, and complications including kerato‐conjunctivitis, encephalitis, and septic shock. Patients with AD who develop EH tend to have more severe AD, earlier‐onset AD, high total serum immunoglobulin E/peripheral eosinophils, and presence of other atopic diseases such as food allergies and asthma, as compared to their AD counterparts without EH.

It may be confused with impetigo, especially in patients with a history of severe AD (EH incognito) or in the early stages with AD itself. Bacterial positivity on skin culture does not exclude EH. The diagnosis can be confirmed by PCR or Tzank smear.

4.2.4 Eczema coxsackium

Coxsackium eczema (EC) is due to coxsackievirus A6 and frequently presents as EH‐like with a greater prevalence of haemorrhagic vesicles over dermatitis, thus casting diagnostic doubt with AD, which is often associated. Some patients with EC may also have symptoms of the hand‐foot‐mouth disease, such as oral sores and papules involving hands and feet. Other possible symptoms include fever, sore throat, and poor appetite.EC should be considered also as a differential diagnosis for EH because it can present with extensive vesicles and skin erosion. However, contrast to EH, EC is not life‐threatening and can be managed with standard AD treatments. The diagnosis is supported by PCR.

4.2.5 Viral exanthem

Viral exanthems (e.g. hand‐foot and mouth disease, unilateral laterothoracic exanthema, Gianotti‐Crosti syndrome) are a heterogeneous group of disorders with cutaneous manifestations that may occasionally resemble AD. However, the sudden, symmetrical mode of onset with small, well‐demarcated plaques allow them to be distinguished from AD, in addition to the presence of other systemic symptoms.

### Vaccines for the common cold [^113jmjXx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The common cold is a spontaneously remitting infection of the upper respiratory tract, characterised by a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, sore throat, and fever (usually < 37.8 ºC). Whilst the common cold is generally not harmful, it is a cause of economic burden due to school and work absenteeism. In the United States, economic loss due to the common cold is estimated at more than USD 40 billion per year, including an estimate of 70 million workdays missed by employees, 189 million school days missed by children, and 126 million workdays missed by parents caring for children with a cold. Additionally, data from Europe show that the total cost per episode may be up to EUR 1102. There is also a large expenditure due to inappropriate antimicrobial prescription. Vaccine development for the common cold has been difficult due to antigenic variability of the common cold viruses; even bacteria can act as infective agents. Uncertainty remains regarding the efficacy and safety of interventions for preventing the common cold in healthy people, thus we performed an update of this Cochrane Review, which was first published in 2011 and updated in 2013 and 2017.

Objectives

To assess the clinical effectiveness and safety of vaccines for preventing the common cold in healthy people.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (April 2022), MEDLINE (1948 to April 2022), Embase (1974 to April 2022), CINAHL (1981 to April 2022), and LILACS (1982 to April 2022). We also searched three trials registers for ongoing studies, and four websites for additional trials (April 2022). We did not impose any language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any virus vaccine compared with placebo to prevent the common cold in healthy people.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used Cochrane's Screen4Me workflow to assess the initial search results. Four review authors independently performed title and abstract screening to identify potentially relevant studies. We retrieved the full-text articles for those studies deemed potentially relevant, and the review authors independently screened the full-text reports for inclusion in the review, recording reasons for exclusion of the excluded studies. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author when needed. Two review authors independently collected data on a data extraction form, resolving any disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author. We double-checked data transferred into Review Manager 5 software. Three review authors independently assessed risk of bias using RoB 1 tool as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager 5. We did not conduct a meta-analysis, and we did not assess publication bias. We used GRADEpro GDT software to assess the certainty of the evidence and to create a summary of findings table. MAIN RESULTS: We did not identify any new RCTs for inclusion in this update. This review includes one RCT conducted in 1965 with an overall high risk of bias. The RCT included 2307 healthy young men in a military facility, all of whom were included in the analyses, and compared the effect of three adenovirus vaccines (live, inactivated type 4, and inactivated type 4 and 7) against a placebo (injection of physiological saline or gelatin capsule). There were 13 (1.14%) events in 1139 participants in the vaccine group, and 14 (1.19%) events in 1168 participants in the placebo group. Overall, we do not know if there is a difference between the adenovirus vaccine and placebo in reducing the incidence of the common cold (risk ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 2.02; very low-certainty evidence). Furthermore, no difference in adverse events when comparing live vaccine preparation with placebo was reported. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low due to unclear risk of bias, indirectness because the population of this study was only young men, and imprecision because confidence intervals were wide and the number of events was low. The included study did not assess vaccine-related or all-cause mortality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This Cochrane Review was based on one study with very low-certainty evidence, which showed that there may be no difference between the adenovirus vaccine and placebo in reducing the incidence of the common cold. We identified a need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs to investigate vaccines for the common cold in healthy people. Future trials on interventions for preventing the common cold should assess a variety of virus vaccines for this condition, and should measure such outcomes as common cold incidence, vaccine safety, and mortality (all-cause and related to the vaccine).

The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral respiratory illness. Symptoms include nasal congestion and mucus discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and general malaise. Given the frequency of colds, they are a public health burden and a significant cause of lost work productivity and school absenteeism. There are no established interventions to prevent colds or shorten their duration. However, zinc supplements are commonly recommended and taken for this purpose.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS to 22 May 2023, and searched Web of Science Core Collection and two trials registries to 14 June 2023. We also used reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults that tested any form of zinc against placebo to prevent or treat the common cold or upper respiratory infection (URTI). We excluded zinc interventions in which zinc was combined with other minerals, vitamins, or herbs (e.g. a multivitamin, or mineral supplement containing zinc).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We independently extracted data. When necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed zinc (type and route) with placebo in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants developing colds (for analyses of prevention trials only), duration of cold (measured in days from start to resolution of the cold), adverse events potentially due to zinc supplements (e.g. unpleasant taste, loss of smell, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhoea), and adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold (e.g. respiratory bacterial infections).

Main Results

We included 34 studies (15 prevention, 19 treatment) involving 8526 participants. Twenty-two studies were conducted on adults and 12 studies were conducted on children. Most trials were conducted in the United States (n = 18), followed by India, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey (two studies each), and Australia, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Tanzania, Thailand, and the UK (one study each). The 15 prevention studies identified the condition as either common cold (n = 8) or URTI (n = 7). However, almost all therapeutic studies (17/19) focused on the common cold. Most studies (17/34) evaluated the effectiveness of zinc administered as lozenges (3 prevention; 14 treatment) in acetate, gluconate, and orotate forms; gluconate lozenges were the most common (9/17). Zinc gluconate was given at doses between 45 and 276 mg/day for between 4.5 and 21 days. Five (5/17) lozenge studies gave acetate lozenges and two (2/17) gave both acetate and gluconate lozenges. One (1/17) lozenge study administered intranasal (gluconate) and lozenge (orotate) zinc in tandem for cold treatment. Of the 17/34 studies that did not use lozenges, 1/17 gave capsules, 3/17 administered dissolved powders, 5/17 gave tablets, 4/17 used syrups, and 4/17 used intranasal administration. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. There may be little or no reduction in the risk of developing a cold with zinc compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; I² = 20%; 9 studies, 1449 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no reduction in the mean number of colds that occur over five to 18 months of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% CI -1.93 to 0.12; I² = 96%; 2 studies, 1284 participants; low-certainty evidence). When colds occur, there is probably little or no difference in the duration of colds in days (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.04; I² = 77%; 3 studies, 740 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in global symptom severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.43; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 101 participants; low-certainty evidence). When zinc is used for cold treatment, there may be a reduction in the mean duration of the cold in days (MD -2.37, 95% CI -4.21 to -0.53; I² = 97%; 8 studies, 972 participants; low-certainty evidence), although it is uncertain whether there is a reduction in the risk of having an ongoing cold at the end of follow-up (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.27; I² = 65%; 5 studies, 357 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or global symptom severity (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.50; I² = 78%; 2 studies, 261 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in the risk of a change in global symptom severity (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23; 1 study, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-one studies reported non-serious adverse events (2422 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of adverse events with zinc used for cold prevention (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1517 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or an increase in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.57; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1563 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably an increase in the risk of non-serious adverse events when zinc is used for cold treatment (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55; I² = 44%; 2084 participants, 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); no treatment study provided information on serious adverse events. No study provided clear information about adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings suggest that zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the prevention of colds but may reduce the duration of ongoing colds, with an increase in non-serious adverse events. Overall, there was wide variation in interventions (including concomitant therapy) and outcomes across the studies, as well as incomplete reporting of several domains, which should be considered when making conclusions about the efficacy of zinc for the common cold.

### Hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus a6 [^113unBLY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) is a human enterovirus associated with herpangina in infants. In the winter of 2012, we evaluated a cluster of 8 patients, 4 months–3 years of age, who were brought for treatment at Boston Children's Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) with a variant of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) that has now been linked to CVA6 (Table). During this same period, the Boston Public Health Commission's syndromic surveillance system detected a 3.3-fold increase in emergency department discharge diagnoses of HFMD. In the United States, HFMD typically occurs in the summer and early autumn and is characterized by a febrile enanthem of oral ulcers and macular or vesicular lesions on the palms and soles; the etiologic agents are most often CVA16 and enterovirus 71.

### Global landscape of coxsackieviruses in human health [^1111ECkN]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Coxsackieviruses-induced infections, particularly in infants and young children, are one of the most important public health issues in low- and middle-income countries, where the surveillance system varies substantially, and these manifestations have been disregarded. They are widespread throughout the world and are responsible for a broad spectrum of human diseases, from mildly symptomatic conditions to severe acute and chronic disorders. Coxsackieviruses (CV) have been found to have 27 identified genotypes, with overlaps in clinical phenotypes between genotypes. In this review, we present a concise overview of the most recent studies and findings of coxsackieviruses-associated disorders, along with epidemiological data that provides comprehensive details on the distribution, variability, and clinical manifestations of different CV types. We also highlight the significant roles that CV infections play in the emergence of neurodegenerative illnesses and their effects on neurocognition. The current role of CVs in oncolytic virotherapy is also mentioned. This review provides readers with a better understanding of coxsackieviruses-associated disorders and pointing the impact that CV infections can have on different organs with variable pathogenicity. A deeper knowledge of these infections could have implications in designing current surveillance and prevention strategies related to severe CVs-caused infections, as well as encourage studies to identify the emergence of more pathogenic types and the etiology of the most common and most severe disorders associated with coxsackievirus infection.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness caused by enteroviruses that predominantly affects children aged < 5 years. In the United States, outbreaks of HFMD typically occur during summer and autumn months. The most common cause of HFMD in the United States has been enterovirus serotype coxsackievirus A16. Most infections are asymptomatic; persons with signs and symptoms typically have a mild febrile illness with rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and sores in the mouth. HFMD also has been associated, often weeks after initial symptom onset, with nail dystrophies (e.g. Beau's lines or nail shedding).

### Global landscape of coxsackieviruses in human health [^111MXBAV]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The current EV classification includes fifteen species: EV A-L and human rhinoviruses (HRV A-C). Seven species (EV A-D and HRV A-C) are able to cause human infection. Particularly, CVs present a high diversity within the Enterovirus genus and are categorized into three EV species: A (CVA2–8, CVA10, CVA12, CV14 and CVA16), B (CVA9, and CVB1–6) and C (CVA1, CVA11, CVA13, CVA17, CVA19–22, CVA24) being responsible for a wide variety of clinical diseases (Table 1). Even though CVs are typically thought of as a lytic virus, emerging evidence suggests that persistent CV infection can occur in some pathologies and individuals immunodeficient (;.;). Additionally, the illness process may potentially be influenced by latency and episodic reactivation.

### Coxsackievirus B5 associated with hand-foot-mouth disease in a healthy adult [^116BsQAE]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

HFMD is a highly contagious childhood exanthem caused by viruses that belong to the genus Enterovirus in the Picornaviridae family. It is classically characterized by a papulovesicular eruption on the hands and feet and within the oral cavity. Enteroviruses are spread by direct vesicular contact and fecal-oral and respiratory routes. Prodromal symptoms may consist of fever, malaise, abdominal pain, poor appetite, sore throat, and myalgias. After a 3- to 7-day incubation period, painful oral ulcers are usually the first clinical signs of the disease, with skin manifestations occurring concurrently or shortly after. Complete resolution of symptoms typically occurs by 7 to 10 days and treatment is mainly supportive.

After reviewing the literature, it is unclear whether there are significant differences in the disease course and outcome of HFMD depending on the pathogen responsible. The most common causes of HFMD are CVA16 followed by Enterovirus 71 (HEV71). Recent data show that CVA6, CVA10, and CVB5 are becoming common as well. In 2014, Hubiche et alset out to characterize the dermatologic spectrum of HFMD in 82 patients with confirmed and serotyped disease and found most patients were infected with CVA6 (51.2%) and CVA16 (34.1%). Patients infected with CVA6 exhibited more perioral lesions, but both strains caused similar rates of generalized skin findings and resulted in a benign disease course. These data can infer that differentiation between CVA6 and CVA16 does not have much clinical utility. In addition, all of the patients in the Hubiche et al sample did have involvement of at least 2 of the 3 classic sites (hand, feet, and/or mouth), highlighting that even an atypical presentation will adhere to the classic distribution. Onychomadesis is a minor complication of the nail beds that has been most commonly seen after infection with CVA6 and CVA10, although reports of nail shedding after CVA5, CVA16, CVB1, and CVB3 infection have been reported.

### Psoriasis coxsackium [^1133W9S1]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 32-year-old woman with a 25-year history of chronic plaque psoriasis presented with a vesiculopustular rash. Her psoriasis had been well-controlled with topical treatment and phototherapy. At her last clinic visit 2 months before presentation, psoriasis was limited to < 5% total body surface area, primarily involving the extensor surfaces of the extremities (including elbows and knees). Three days before presentation, she developed fever and a sore throat. The following day, she developed scattered vesicles on the extensor aspects of the extremities. The fever and sore throat resolved 2 days after onset; however, the rash continued to develop. She presented with mildly erythematous, minimally scaly papules and plaques on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs (Fig 1). Within these plaques, scattered 3- to 5-mm vesicles, few pustules, and crusted erosions were observed. A few erythematous papules were visualized on the palms and fingertips. No oral lesions were observed. She complained of early pruritus and subsequent burning pain. Sick contacts included her daughter, who developed fever on the same day as the patient, a rash 1 week later, and who was subsequently diagnosed with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD).

### A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial of topical 2% viscous lidocaine in improving oral intake in children with painful infectious mouth conditions [^117F981S]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Painful infectious mouth conditions are a common presentation to paediatric emergency departments. These are usually viral conditions such as gingivostomatitis (herpetic and non herpetic), ulcerative pharyngitis, herpangina and hand foot and mouth disease. Most of the paediatric literature concerns primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS) caused by infection with the herpes simplex virus. Although self limiting, there is considerable morbidity from decreased oral intake. Amir et al found that 89% of patients with PHGS drank less than normal. The oral lesions can persist for 7 to 18 days with the risk of dehydration. The presence of extra-oral lesions in addition to intra-oral lesions is highly indicative of PHGS, and may be used to differentiate PHGS from other ulcerative mouth conditions of children: mainly herpangina and hand foot and mouth disease (both caused by the coxsackie virus). In herpangina, lesions are typically seen on the posterior portion of the oral cavity and palate, with an absence of extra-oral lesions. Hand foot and mouth disease typically has both intra-oral and extra-oral lesions and the distribution of characteristic lesions on the hands and feet distinguishes it from PHGS. These findings are particularly valuable as the majority of PHGS cases are diagnosed on clinical findings alone. Treatment for such conditions is generally symptomatic and therefore a precise diagnosis is not critical as such.

### Cell pyroptosis in picornavirus and its potential for treating viral infection [^115AKHrK]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cell pyroptosis has received increased attention due to the associations between innate immunity and disease, and it has become a major focal point recently due to in-depth studies of cancer. With increased research on pyroptosis, scientists have discovered that it has an essential role in viral infections, especially in the occurrence and development of some picornavirus infections. Many picornaviruses, including Coxsackievirus, a71 enterovirus, human rhinovirus, encephalomyocarditis virus, and foot-and-mouth disease virus induce pyroptosis to varying degrees. This review summarized the mechanisms by which these viruses induce cell pyroptosis, which can be an effective defense against pathogen infection. However, excessive inflammasome activation or pyroptosis also can damage the host's health or aggravate disease progression. Careful approaches that acknowledge this dual effect will aid in the exploration of picornavirus infections and the mechanisms that produce the inflammatory response. This information will promote the development of drugs that can inhibit cell pyroptosis and provide new avenues for future clinical treatment.

14.1 Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Two double‑blind, placebo‑controlled clinical trials were conducted in 1,856 healthy adults and adolescents (aged greater than or equal to 12 years) with a history of recurrent cold sores. Subjects self‑initiated therapy at the earliest symptoms and prior to any signs of a cold sore. The majority of subjects initiated treatment within 2 hours of onset of symptoms. Subjects were randomized to VALTREX 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by placebo on Day 2, VALTREX 2 grams twice daily on Day 1 followed by 1 gram twice daily on Day 2, or placebo on Days 1 and 2.

The mean duration of cold sore episodes was about 1 day shorter in treated subjects as compared with placebo. The 2-day regimen did not offer additional benefit over the 1-day regimen.

No significant difference was observed between subjects receiving VALTREX or placebo in the prevention of progression of cold sore lesions beyond the papular stage.

14.2 Genital Herpes Infections

Initial Episode

Six hundred forty-three immunocompetent adults with first-episode genital herpes who presented within 72 hours of symptom onset were randomized in a double-blind trial to receive 10 days of VALTREX 1 gram twice daily (n = 323) or oral acyclovir 200 mg 5 times a day (n = 320). For both treatment groups the median time to lesion healing was 9 days, the median time to cessation of pain was 5 days, and the median time to cessation of viral shedding was 3 days.

Recurrent Episodes

Three double-blind trials (2 of them placebo-controlled) in immunocompetent adults with recurrent genital herpes were conducted. Subjects self-initiated therapy within 24 hours of the first sign or symptom of a recurrent genital herpes episode.

In 1 trial, subjects were randomized to receive 5 days of treatment with either VALTREX 500 mg twice daily (n = 360) or placebo (n = 259). The median time to lesion healing was 4 days in the group receiving VALTREX 500 mg versus 6 days in the placebo group, and the median time to cessation of viral shedding in subjects with at least 1 positive culture (42% of the overall trial population) was 2 days in the group receiving VALTREX 500 mg versus 4 days in the placebo group. The median time to cessation of pain was 3 days in the group receiving VALTREX 500 mg versus 4 days in the placebo group. Results supporting efficacy were replicated in a second trial.

### Interventions for prevention of herpes simplex labialis (cold sores on the lips) [^114ZNDVm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex labialis (HSL), also known as cold sores, is a common disease of the lips caused by the herpes simplex virus, which is found throughout the world. It presents as a painful vesicular eruption, forming unsightly crusts, which cause cosmetic disfigurement and psychosocial distress. There is no cure available, and it recurs periodically.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the prevention of HSL in people of all ages.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 19 May 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Oral Health Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Airiti Library, and 5 trial registers. To identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials, we scanned the bibliographies of included studies and published reviews, and we also contacted the original researchers of our included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for preventing HSL in immunocompetent people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third author was available for resolving differences of opinion.

Main Results

This review included 32 RCTs, with a total of 2640 immunocompetent participants, covering 19 treatments. The quality of the body of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, but was very low for a few outcomes. Our primary outcomes were 'Incidence of HSL' and 'Adverse effects during use of the preventative intervention'. The evidence for short-term (≤ 1 month) use of oral aciclovir in preventing recurrent HSL was inconsistent across the doses used in the studies: 2 RCTs showed low quality evidence for a reduced recurrence of HSL with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.51; n = 177), while 1 RCT testing aciclovir 800 mg twice daily and 2 RCTs testing 200 mg 5 times daily found no similar preventive effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.87; n = 237; moderate quality evidence and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.07; n = 66; low quality evidence, respectively). The direction of intervention effect was unrelated to the risk of bias. The evidence from 1 RCT for the effect of short-term use of valaciclovir in reducing recurrence of HSL by clinical evaluation was uncertain (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.28; n = 125; moderate quality evidence), as was the evidence from 1 RCT testing short-term use of famciclovir. Long-term (> 1 month) use of oral antiviral agents reduced the recurrence of HSL. There was low quality evidence from 1 RCT that long-term use of oral aciclovir reduced clinical recurrences (1.80 versus 0.85 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.009) and virological recurrence (1.40 versus 0.40 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.003). One RCT found long-term use of valaciclovir effective in reducing the incidence of HSL (with a decrease of 0.09 episodes per participant per month; n = 95). One RCT found that a long-term suppressive regimen of valaciclovir had a lower incidence of HSL than an episodic regimen of valciclovir (difference in means (MD) -0.10 episodes per participant per month, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.05; n = 120). These trials found no increase in adverse events associated with the use of oral antiviral agents (moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence to show that short-term use of topical antiviral agents prevented recurrent HSL. There was moderate quality evidence from 2 RCTs that topical aciclovir 5% cream probably has little effect on preventing recurrence of HSL (pooled RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.72; n = 271). There was moderate quality evidence from a single RCT that topical foscarnet 3% cream has little effect in preventing HSL (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.40; n = 295). The efficacy of long-term use of topical aciclovir cream was uncertain. One RCT found significantly fewer research-diagnosed recurrences of HSL when on aciclovir cream treatment than on placebo (P < 0.05), but found no significant differences in the mean number of participant-reported recurrences between the 2 groups (P ≥ 0.05). One RCT found no preventive effect of topical application of 1,5-pentanediol gel for 26 weeks (P > 0.05). Another RCT found that the group who used 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclo dextrin 20% gel for 6 months had significantly more recurrences than the placebo group (P = 0.003). These studies found no increase in adverse events related to the use of topical antiviral agents. Two RCTs found that the application of sunscreen significantly prevented recurrent HSL induced by experimental ultraviolet light (pooled RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.33; n = 111), but another RCT found that sunscreen did not prevent HSL induced by sunlight (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.06; n = 51). These RCTs did not report adverse events. There were very few data suggesting that thymopentin, low-level laser therapy, and hypnotherapy are effective in preventing recurrent HSL, with one to two RCTs for each intervention. We failed to find any evidence of efficacy for lysine, LongoVital® supplementation, gamma globulin, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I subunit vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine in preventing HSL. There were no consistent data supporting the efficacy of levamisole and interferon, which were also associated with an increased risk of adverse effects such as fever.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence demonstrates that long-term use of oral antiviral agents can prevent HSL, but the clinical benefit is small. We did not find evidence of an increased risk of adverse events. On the other hand, the evidence on topical antiviral agents and other interventions either showed no efficacy or could not confirm their efficacy in preventing HSL.

### Irreversible inhibitors of the 3C protease of coxsackie virus through templated assembly of protein-binding fragments [^1169Hv8p]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Small-molecule fragments binding to biomacromolecules can be starting points for the development of drugs, but are often difficult to detect due to low affinities. Here we present a strategy that identifies protein-binding fragments through their potential to induce the target-guided formation of covalently bound, irreversible enzyme inhibitors. A protein-binding nucleophile reacts reversibly with a bis-electrophilic warhead, thereby positioning the second electrophile in close proximity of the active site of a viral protease, resulting in the covalent de-activation of the enzyme. The concept is implemented for Coxsackie virus B3 3C protease, a pharmacological target against enteroviral infections. Using an aldehyde-epoxide as bis-electrophile, active fragment combinations are validated through measuring the protein inactivation rate and by detecting covalent protein modification in mass spectrometry. The structure of one enzyme–inhibitor complex is determined by X-ray crystallography. The presented warhead activation assay provides potent non-peptidic, broad-spectrum inhibitors of enteroviral proteases.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^114zTHzb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent herpes labialis ('cold sore') is a common condition caused by reactivation of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the orofacial region.HSV-1 is endemic worldwide, infecting up to 95% of individuals, of whom between 14 and 40% have frequent recurrent cold sores. Recurrences can be debilitating and significantly reduce quality of life. Long-term suppressive therapy with an oral antiviral is somewhat effective in reducing the burden of HSV recurrences, but is costly, and involves the risk of adverse events. There is still no vaccine available against HSV.

In addition to its intended effects, the anti-tuberculosis vaccine, bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), induces off-target ('non-specific') effects that confer additional benefits. Examples of these immunomodulatory effects include reduction in all-cause mortality in infants, prevention and treatment of certain cancers, protection against progression of autoimmune diseases, and protection against a variety of viral infections. Observational studies suggest this includes the prevention of HSV recurrences. In a systematic review of observational studies, BCG vaccination was found to be beneficial in 78% of individuals with recurrent herpes labialis or genitalis, with 37% being recurrence-free for an extended period, 41% experiencing less frequent or severe episodes, and only 22% reporting no change. Albeit promising, these results have never been confirmed in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The only RCT published to date, restricted to patients with herpes genitalis, had a number of limitations, in particular the use of a potentially beneficial intervention in the control group.

This study aimed to determine in a subgroup of adults with recurrent cold sores whether BCG vaccination compared with placebo reduces HSV recurrences in the BRACE RCT (BCG vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in healthcare workers). Secondary aims addressed a wider range of objectives, including the impact of BCG on the burden of recurrences and the risk of a first cold sore episode in sub-groups defined by differing frequencies of HSV recurrence.

### Vancomycin [^115M96x7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including vancomycin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When vancomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by vancomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Many viruses, including varicella zoster virus and HSV, have a predilection for localization to areas of inflamed or traumatized skin. This case underscores the point that atypical HFMD should be considered within the differential diagnosis not only for acute-onset febrile blistering diseases but also for new-onset vesicles/erosions within sites of skin injury/inflammation or dermatitis, including GVHD. Our case also further illustrates the possible histologic overlap between EM/SJS and atypical HFMD, highlighting the fact that coxsackievirus infection should be considered within the differential diagnosis for an EM-like interface reaction in the appropriate clinical scenario.

### In vitro discovery of a therapeutic lead for HFMD from a library screen of rocaglates / aglains [^116ECdRV]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious viral disease commonly affecting infants and children, which results from infection by viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family. Enterovirus A71 (EV‐A71), Coxsackievirus A16 (CV‐A16), and CV‐A6 are the primary etiological agents of HFMD, in addition to the less prevalent CV‐A4, CV‐A9, CV‐B1, and CV‐B5. Although HFMD has been typically self‐limiting with onsets of fever, ulcers, and rashes which generally resolve within a week, potentially fatal neurological and respiratory complications are major health concerns of the disease. Unlike vector‐borne diseases such as Dengue fever, HFMD outbreaks are not geographically restricted, and are easily transmitted via contaminated droplets, faeces, or surfaces of objects. HFMD outbreaks have been reported worldwide annually with seasonal peaks and intermittent sporadic cases, resulting in significant paediatric hospitalization and an associated healthcare burden. To date, clinically available EV‐A71 vaccines are solely approved for usage in China and provide restricted prophylactic coverage limited to the C4 genotype. This limitation, combined with the current lack of an approved antiviral agent for HFMD, underscore the crucial need for development of novel and effective therapeutic agents for this disease.

### Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113KEtAu]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) cause morbidity, hospital admissions, and mortality, and strongly influence health-related quality of life. Some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations, which are associated with considerable physiologic deterioration and increased airway inflammation. About half of COPD exacerbations are caused or triggered primarily by bacterial and viral infections (colds, especially from rhinovirus), but air pollution can contribute to the beginning of an exacerbation. Type 1 exacerbations involve increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence; Type 2 exacerbations involve any two of the latter symptoms, and Type 3 exacerbations involve one of those symptoms combined with cough, wheeze, or symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. Exacerbations are more common than previously believed (2.5–3 exacerbations per year); many exacerbations are treated in the community and not associated with hospital admission. We found that about half of exacerbations were unreported by the patients, despite considerable encouragement to do so, and, instead, were only diagnosed from patients' diary cards. COPD patients are accustomed to frequent symptom changes, and this may explain their tendency to underreport exacerbations. COPD patients tend to be anxious and depressed about the disease and some might not seek treatment. At the beginning of an exacerbation physiologic changes such as decreases in peak flow and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) are usually small and therefore are not useful in predicting exacerbations, but larger decreases in peak flow are associated with dyspnea and the presence of symptomatic upper-respiratory viral infection. More pronounced physiologic changes during exacerbation are related to longer exacerbation recovery time. Dyspnea, common colds, sore throat, and cough increase significantly during prodrome, indicating that respiratory viruses are important exacerbation triggers. However, the prodrome is relatively short and not useful in predicting onset. As colds are associated with longer and more severe exacerbations, a COPD patient who develops a cold should be considered for early therapy. Physiologic recovery after an exacerbation is often incomplete, which decreases health-related quality of life and resistance to future exacerbations, so it is important to identify COPD patients who suffer frequent exacerbations and to convince them to take precautions to minimize the risk of colds and other exacerbation triggers. Exacerbation frequency may vary with the severity of the COPD. Exacerbation frequency may or may not increase with the severity of the COPD. As the COPD progresses, exacerbations tend to have more symptoms and take longer to recover from. Twenty-five to fifty percent of COPD patients suffer lower airway bacteria colonization, which is related to the severity of COPD and cigarette smoking and which begins a cycle of epithelial cell damage, impaired mucociliary clearance, mucus hypersecretion, increased submucosal vascular leakage, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Elevated sputum interleukin-8 levels are associated with higher bacterial load and faster FEV₁ decline; the bacteria increase airway inflammation in the stable patient, which may accelerate disease progression. A 2-week course of oral corticosteroids is as beneficial as an 8-week course, with fewer adverse effects, and might extend the time until the next exacerbation. Antibiotics have some efficacy in treating exacerbations. Exacerbation frequency increases with progressive airflow obstruction; so patients with chronic respiratory failure are particularly susceptible to exacerbation.

### Hand, foot, and mouth disease outbreak by coxsackievirus A6 during COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, S ã o paulo, Brazil [^111gjG7a]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute febrile illness characterized by fever; sore throat; and vesicular eruptions on the hands, feet, and oral mucosa. Outbreaks of HFMD in children aged < 5 years have been reported worldwide and the major causative agents are Coxsackievirus (CV)A16, enterovirus (EV)-A71 and recently CVA6.

Aim and Methods

The aim of this study was to investigated a large outbreak of Hand, foot, and mouth disease during COVID-19 pandemic in 2021 from clinical samples of 315 suspected cases, in São Paulo State, Brazil. Diagnostic evaluation was performed by RT-qPCR, culture cell isolation and serological neutralization assay. EV-positive were genotyped by partial VP1 genome sequencing.

Results

One hundred and forty-nine cases analyzed were positive for enterovirus (47.3%; n = 149/315) by neutralizing test (n = 10 patients) and RT-qPCR (n = 139 patients), and identified as CVA6 sub-lineage D3 by analysis of VP1 partial sequences.

Conclusions

This finding indicated the reemergence of CVA6 in HFMD, soon after the gradual easing of non-pharmaceutical interventions during-pandemic COVID-19 and the relevance of continued surveillance of circulating enterovirus types in the post-COVID pandemic era.

### Respiratory illness caused by picornavirus infection: a review of clinical outcomes [^114EoaF8]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Respiratory infections result from invasion of the respiratory tract, mainly by viruses, and are the leading cause of acute morbidity in individuals of all ages worldwide. During peak season, picornaviruses cause 82% of all episodes of acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold), the most frequent manifestation of acute respiratory infection, and produce more restriction of activity and physician consultations annually than any other viral or bacterial source of respiratory illness.

Objective

This article reviews the clinical impact and outcomes of picornavirus-induced respiratory infections in specific populations at risk for complications. It also discusses the potential economic impact of the morbidity associated with picornavirus-induced respiratory infection.

Methods

Relevant literature was identified through searches of MEDLINE, OVID, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and Lexis-Nexis. The search terms used were picornavirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, viral respiratory infection, upper respiratory infection, disease burden, economic, cost, complications, asthma, COPD, immunocompromised, elderly otitis media, and sinusitis. Additional publications were identified from the reference lists of the retrieved articles.

Conclusions

Based on the clinical literature, picornavirus infections are associated with severe morbidity as well as considerable economic and societal costs. Future research should focus on identifying patterns of illness and the costs associated with management of these infections. New treatments should be assessed not only in terms of their ability to produce the desired clinical outcome, but also in terms of their ability to reduce the burden of disease, decrease health care costs, and improve productivity.

### Algorithms in allergy: diagnosis and treatment of atopic dermatitis complicated by eczema herpeticum [^112t2ASV]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

EH is primarily diagnosed clinically. Confirmatory diagnostics primarily include HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is the gold standard for HSV detection (Figure 1). Other diagnostic methods, such as histology and antigen detection via immunofluorescence, can be utilized if HSV PCR is unavailable. Clinical differential diagnoses include bacterial superinfection of eczema, impetigo, eczema coxsackium caused by coxsackie virus, and varicella zoster virus infections. While EH typically presents with monomorphic, non‐grouped vesicles on eczematous skin, eczema coxsackium often shows polymorphic vesiculobullous lesions, typically including acrofacial involvement optionally leading to acral desquamation. In unclear cases, PCR testing for both HSV and enteroviruses is recommended to distinguish between the two entities. Although impetigo may occasionally be associated with systemic symptoms, this is uncommon. Moreover, although initial skin lesions may include small superficial blisters, they typically lack the monomorphic vesicular eruption characteristic of EH. Varicella may also cause disseminated vesicular eruptions; however, the lesions are typically polymorphic, resembling Heubner's "celestial chart" and frequently involve the scalp and oral cavity, distinguishing it from the more monomorphic and localized presentation of eczema herpeticum.

### Treatment with a novel topical nanoemulsion (NB-001) speeds time to healing of recurrent cold sores [^116zpWRV]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Current topical therapies for cold sores are only marginally beneficial due to poor skin penetration. We assessed the safety and efficacy of a novel topical antiviral nanoemulsion (NB-001) with high tissue bioavailability.

Objectives

The primary endpoint was the time to lesion healing.

Methods

482 subjects with recurrent cold sores were randomized to self-initiate treatment with either vehicle or NB-001 (0.1%, 0.3% or 0.5%) at the first signs or symptoms of a cold sore episode. Lotion was applied 5 times per day, approximately 3 to 4 hours apart, for 4 days. Time to lesion healing was correlated with NB-001 bioavailability determined in human cadaver skin.

Results

Subjects treated with 0.3% NB-001 showed a 1.3-day improvement in the mean time to healing compared to vehicle (P = 0.006). This was consistent with human cadaver skin data indicating that the 0.3% nanoemulsion had the highest bioavailability, compared to 0.1% and 0.5% emulsions. No significant safety or dermal irritation concerns or systemic absorption were noted with any of the doses.

Conclusions

Topical NB-001 (0.3%) was well tolerated and highly efficacious in shortening the time to healing of cold sores. The improvement in time to healing was similar to that reported for oral nucleoside analogues, but without systemic exposure. Topical agents for recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores) reduce healing time by one half day, compared to oral therapies that speed healing by a day or more. A topical antiviral nanoemulsion was well tolerated and improved cold sore healing time by over a day compared to vehicle control. Nanoemulsion (NB-001) could represent a more efficacious topical treatment for recurrent cold sores.

### Acute pruritic eruption [^115rqsu6]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely clinical diagnosis?
A. Allergic contact dermatitis
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection
D. Coxsackie A infection
E. Herpes zoster infection

Answers:

A. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. This is less likely considering the patient's clinical history, rapid progression of her rash, and presence of scattered vesicles. In addition, she denied exposure to new personal care products.
B. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 infection – Incorrect. While HSV-1 is a consideration for vesicular eruptions, it tends to be more localized and presents more classically as herpes labialis or herpes gingivostomatitis rather than a generalized eruption.
C. Primary varicella-zoster virus (pVZV) infection – Correct. The clinical history and acute onset are most consistent with an infection. Despite the absence of overt viral cytopathic changes (multinucleation, nuclear margination, chromatin molding) on pathology, follicular necrosis was noted – a feature of herpes virus infection. Thus, the clinical picture was most consistent with pVZV infection. A swab of an unroofed vesicle for viral polymerase chain reaction and VZV stain on pathology confirmed this diagnosis.
D. Coxsackie A infection – Incorrect. While hand, foot, mouth disease can present with a similar eruption, this patient exhibited no oral, hand, foot, buttock, or scalp lesions, making this differential diagnosis less likely. Further, the exanthem of hand, foot, mouth disease is not pruritic.
E. Herpes zoster infection – Incorrect. While herpes zoster is a reactivation of the latent VZV, this typically presents with a dermatomal, unilateral vesicular eruption associated with pain, including sensations of burning and tingling.

### Coxsackievirus A6-induced hand-foot-mouth disease [^114MEvCb]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute, self-limited, highly contagious viral illness that commonly affects children younger than 5 years. It is most typically caused by enterovirus 71 or coxsackievirus A16 and results in asymptomatic infection or mild disease. Immunocompetent adults are rarely affected. Recently, there have been increasing reports of a more severe form of HFMD associated with fevers, joint pains, and widespread painful eruptions. Some of these patients required hospitalization for supportive care. These severe cases were most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A6.

Observations

We describe a 37-year-old white man with widespread, crusted, pruritic papules on the scalp, ears, and face and a purpuric and targetoid painful vesicular eruption on his hands and feet, with associated fevers, neurologic symptoms, and arthritis, who required hospitalization for supportive care. His infection with coxsackievirus A6 was confirmed based on polymerase chain reaction from his oral mucosa and cutaneous vesicle fluid.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dermatologists should be familiar with the severe variant of HFMD caused by coxsackievirus A6, include it in their differential diagnosis of acute febrile blistering diseases, and be aware that certain patients may require hospitalization.

### Diffuse skin-colored papules in a child [^113wCTh5]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What group of viruses is implicated in this skin disease?
A. Human papillomavirus
B. Coxsackievirus
C. Poxviridae
D. Herpes viruses
E. Polyomaviridae

Answers:

A. Human papillomavirus – Correct. Beta human papillomaviruses are a group of DNA viruses implicated in the production of various warts on the skin. Specifically, there have been more than 20 different strains of HPV implicated in EV. Some strains of HPV, namely HPV-5, -8, and -14, are associated with higher oncogenic potential of nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with EV. Skin lesions are thought to develop as a result of the cumulative cocarcinogenic effects of genetics, HPV, and ultraviolet radiation. Malignancy is usually observed approximately 20–30 years after the formation of benign lesions. The patient in this case was investigated for low-risk (6, 11, 40, 43, 44, 54, 69, 70, 71, E6/E7) and high-risk (16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 83, E6/E7) HPV strains using an in-situ hybridization assay. The results of these investigations were negative, and the patient was most likely infected with an alternative HPV strain that has been associated with EV.
B. Coxsackievirus – Incorrect. Coxsackieviruses are associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease. Typical cutaneous lesions include red vesicular macules, papules, and blisters on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the hands, and ulcerative oral lesions.
C. Poxviridae – Incorrect. Poxviridae are associated with molluscum contagiosum (ie, molluscum contagiosum virus). Typical cutaneous lesions include clusters of indurated, red, umbilicated papules that present in moist areas such as the intertriginous regions.
D. Herpes viruses – Incorrect. Herpes viruses are implicated in several diseases of the skin, including herpes zoster (shingles), and herpes simplex infection for example. Herpes zoster presents with typical vesicular cutaneous lesions confined to a dermatomal distribution. Non-genital herpes simplex infection typically presents with grouped vesicular and eroded cutaneous lesions around the mouth and face, as well as the anogenital region.
E. Polyomaviridae – Incorrect. Polyomaviridae have been associated with diseases of the skin, including Merkel cell carcinomas and trichodysplasia spinulosa. Merkel cell carcinoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging, red, solitary nodule, typically on the head and neck. Trichodysplasia spinulosa presents with skin-colored follicular papules with a central keratin spine, typically on the nose and forehead.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^112h74d7]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Recurrences of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the orofacial region (herpes labialis or cold sores) impact quality-of-life. We aimed to study whether the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine can attenuate cold sore recurrences through off-target immunomodulatory effects.

Methods

In this nested randomised controlled trial within the multicentre, phase 3 BRACE trial, 6828 healthcare workers were randomised in 36 sites in Australia, the Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom and Brazil, to receive BCG-Denmark or no BCG (1:1 ratio using a web-based procedure) and followed for 12 months with 3-monthly questionnaires. Exclusion criteria included contraindication to BCG vaccine or previous vaccination with BCG within the past year, any other live-attenuated vaccine within the last month, or any COVID-specific vaccine. The intervention group received one intradermal dose of 0.1 mL of BCG-Denmark corresponding to 2–8 × 10⁵ colony forming units of Mycobacterium bovis, Danish strain 1331. The primary outcome was the difference in restricted mean survival time (i.e. time to first cold-sore recurrence), in participants with frequent recurrent herpes labialis (≥ 4 recurrences/year), analysed by intention-to-treat. Secondary outcomes addressed additional questions, including analyses in other sub-populations. Adverse events were monitored closely during the first 3 months and were reported in all participants who received one dose of study drug according to intervention received. The BRACE trial is registered with.

Findings

Between March 30, 2020 and February 18, 2021, 84 individuals with frequent recurrent cold sores were randomly assigned to BCG (n = 38) or control (n = 46). The average time to first cold-sore recurrence was 1.55 months longer in the BCG group (95% CI 0.27–2.82, p = 0.02) than the control group (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.32–0.91; intention-to-treat). The beneficial effect of BCG was greater in the as-treated population (difference 1.91 months, 95% CI 0.69–3.12, p = 0.003; hazard ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.26–0.76). In prespecified subgroup analyses, only sex modified the treatment effect (interaction p = 0.007), with benefit restricted to males. Over 12 months, a greater proportion of participants in the BCG group compared with the control group reported a decrease in duration (61% vs 21%), severity (74% vs 21%), frequency (55% vs 21%), and impact on quality of life (42% vs 15%) of cold sore recurrences. In participants who had ever had a cold sore, there was also a decrease in self-reported burden of recurrences in the BCG group. In participants who had never had a cold sore, there was an increased risk of a first episode in the BCG group (risk difference 1.4%; 95% CI 0.3–2.6%, p = 0.02). There were no safety concerns.

Interpretation

BCG-Denmark vaccination had a beneficial effect on herpes labialis, particularly in males with frequent recurrences, but may increase the risk of a first cold sore.

### Emerging coxsackievirus A6 causing hand, foot and mouth disease, Vietnam [^111wMRE7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

Patients and Clinical Samples

We obtained the clinical samples used in this study from patients enrolled in an HFMD research program in which outpatients and inpatients with all severities of disease were recruited. During August 2011–June 2013, we carried out the research program at the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This PICU admitted only patients with severe HFMD (the clinical grading system is described in the Technical Appendix). In the subsequent phase (July 2013–December 2015), we expanded patient enrollment to outpatient clinics, infectious disease wards, and PICUs in 3 major referral hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City (Children's Hospital 1, Children's Hospital 2, and Hospital for Tropical Diseases). We selected for analysis CV-A6–positive throat and rectal swab specimens with sufficient viral load (samples with real-time PCR crossing point values of < 30) collected in viral transport medium from study participants. The real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) methods used are described in the Technical Appendix.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^116E1iPu]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory pericardial effusion

Infections

Viral pericardial effusions

Viruses are the leading causes of pericarditis cases, which have known etiologies, especially adenovirus and coxsackievirus, and about 60% of viral pericarditis can cause pericardial effusions. However, most of the time, effusions are small and can be treated conservatively or with colchicine plus NSAIDs. Corticosteroids and IL-1 blockers are other medical therapies. Hemorrhagic and large (hemodynamically significant) are uncommon viral causes of PE. However, they are generally classified as idiopathic since a viral diagnosis needs histologic, immunologic, and or serologic evaluation, which is not usually done unless HIV or HCV infection is suspected.

Coxsackievirus-induced pericardial effusion

Coxsackieviruses, including types A and B, can have a wide range of clinical presentations in children and adults. Although it can cause a spectrum of symptoms from simple fever, hand-foot-mouth syndrome, up to severe life-threatening encephalitis or pericarditis, in adults, it is primarily a controllable presentation with malaise or fever, which can be treated with supportive care and NSAIDs plus colchicine. In the winter and fall, these infections are more observed in men. Coxsackievirus B is cardiotropic and tends to involve the myocardium. This virus can involve myocardial cells chronically; it can cause severe myocarditis or even large pericardial effusions and tamponades because of myocarditis. Pericardial effusion due to the Coxsackie virus can also be seen in children, and there are case reports of hemorrhagic pleural effusion in them, like the adult group. Most of the time, myopericarditis, due to this virus, can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications and colchicine or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatments and steroids. However, colchicine efficacy and safety have not been approved yet in children. Massive PE and tamponade in these children are life-threatening. If needed, they should be treated aggressively with percutaneous or surgical drainage.

### An experimental model of rhinovirus induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations: a pilot study [^113vzgAa]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract symptoms

The scoring system and clinical criteria for a cold were derived from Jackson et al. The subjects recorded the following symptoms on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe) – sneezing, runny nose, blocked nose, sore throat or hoarse voice, headache or face pain, generally unwell, fever or shivery, cough. A cold was considered to be present if 2 of the following 3 criteria were present:

1. A cumulative symptom score of at least 14 over a 6-day period.

2. The subjective impression of a cold.

3. Rhinorrhoea present on at least 3 days.

Lower respiratory tract symptoms

The most commonly adopted definitions of COPD exacerbations rely on identifying a worsening of the previous stable state based on reporting of increased symptoms. We used a scoring system (adapted from Calverley et al) with which subjects quantified the severity of lower respiratory tract symptoms (Table 2). Based on clinical study scoring systems an exacerbation was defined as an increase over baseline of at least 2 points on 2 consecutive days. To correct for baseline symptoms, the mean score for each patient on days -6 to 0 was subtracted from post-inoculation scores for both upper and lower respiratory tract scores.

Table 2
Lower respiratory tract symptom scoring system.

Definition of a severe exacerbation

As the primary aim of the study was to evaluate the safety of experimental rhinovirus infection in COPD subjects, we used the following criteria for defining a severe exacerbation.

1. An increase in shortness of breath score by 2 points or more on 2 consecutive days.

2. An increase in wheeze score by 3 points or more on 2 consecutive days.

3. A fall in FEV₁ or PEF of 40% or more from baseline.

4. The subject developed a subjective feeling of severe exacerbation and wished to have treatment.

5. The study doctor decided that the subject had a severe exacerbation and required treatment.

If any subject fulfilled any 2 of these criteria he/she would be defined as having a severe exacerbation and would be withdrawn from the study and treatment instituted according to the clinical judgement of the investigators.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Importance of Adequate Hydration

Patients should be advised to maintain adequate hydration.

Missed Dose

Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of VALTREX, to take it as soon as they remember. Advise patients not to double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose.

Cold Sores (Herpes Labialis)

Patients should be advised to initiate treatment at the earliest symptom of a cold sore (e.g., tingling, itching, or burning). There are no data on the effectiveness of treatment initiated after the development of clinical signs of a cold sore (e.g., papule, vesicle, or ulcer). Patients should be instructed that treatment for cold sores should not exceed 1 day (2 doses) and that their doses should be taken about 12 hours apart. Patients should be informed that VALTREX is not a cure for cold sores.

Genital Herpes

Patients should be informed that VALTREX is not a cure for genital herpes. Because genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse when lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital herpes is frequently transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic viral shedding. Therefore, patients should be counseled to use safer sex practices in combination with suppressive therapy with VALTREX. Sex partners of infected persons should be advised that they might be infected even if they have no symptoms. Type‑specific serologic testing of asymptomatic partners of persons with genital herpes can determine whether risk for HSV‑2 acquisition exists.

### Immunohistochemical study of 2 cases of coxsackie A6-induced atypical hand-foot-and-mouth disease [^1125nJna]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2019). Medium credibility.

An atypical clinical variant of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) with more extensive lesions and affecting adults has emerged during the past years, usually associated to the Coxsackievirus serotype A6 (CV-A6). We present a 19-year-old woman with a 3-day evolution eruption of papulovesicular lesions, which first appeared around the mouth and frontal area and rapidly spread. In addition, we present a 61-year-old man with a 4-day evolution asymptomatic eruption of papulovesicular lesions in both the hands and feet after suffering a cold 1 week before. Skin biopsies of both patients showed intraepidermal vesicles with spongiosis and ballooning, leading to reticular degeneration, apoptotic keratinocytes, and epidermal necrosis of the upper layers with neutrophil sloughing. Immunohistochemical studies for Coxsackie, Enterovirus, herpes virus, adenovirus, and measles were all negative. Cultures of blister fluid, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of skin biopsies, blood tests and serologies for exanthematic virus, and serum viral arrays were also negative. Only reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of blister fluid confirmed Cocksakie A6. In conclusion, immunohistochemical studies with the commercially available viral antibodies do not seem to be useful in atypical HFMD cases. In these cases, to determine the typical histopathological features in HE is the fastest diagnostic aid.

### Accuracy of diagnostic methods and surveillance sensitivity for human enterovirus, south Korea, 1999–2011 [^112dNiZz]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The epidemiology of enteroviral infection in South Korea during 1999–2011 chronicles nationwide outbreaks and changing detection and subtyping methods used over the 13-year period. Of 14,657 patients whose samples were tested, 4,762 (32.5%) samples were positive for human enterovirus (human EV); as diagnostic methods improved, the rate of positive results increased. A seasonal trend of outbreaks was documented. Genotypes enterovirus 71, echovirus 30, coxsackievirus B5, enterovirus 6, and coxsackievirus B2 were the most common genotypes identified. Accurate test results correlated clinical syndromes to enterovirus genotypes: aseptic meningitis to echovirus 30, enterovirus 6, and coxsackievirus B5; hand, foot and mouth disease to coxsackievirus A16; and hand, foot and mouth disease with neurologic complications to enterovirus 71. There are currently no treatments specific to human EV infections; surveillance of enterovirus infections such as this study provides may assist with evaluating the need to research and develop treatments for infections caused by virulent human EV genotypes.

### Atypical presentations of hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by coxsackievirus A6 – Minnesota, 2014 [^117TQQiD]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

In June, 2014, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) was notified of a suspected varicella case in a child aged 2 years. The patient had a generalized rash with relative sparing of the trunk and was hospitalized overnight for treatment of dehydration. The child's mother, who was near the end of a pregnancy, also had a generalized rash, which included the perineal area. Identifying the cause of the rash was important to determine whether administration of varicella zoster immune globulin was indicated to prevent neonatal varicella. Enterovirus was detected in specimens from the woman and child by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing performed at MDH; partial genome sequencing by CDC showed that both patients were infected with coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), one of the members of the genus Enterovirus that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD).

In September 2014, MDH received reports of nine suspected HFMD cases at a college with approximately 1,000 students. Patients ranged in age from 19–47 years and included seven students, one faculty member, and one staff member. Upon arrival at the campus clinic, all had lesions in the mouth, on the palms of the hands, and on the soles of the feet. One patient, aged 20 years, reported having been exposed to a child with HFMD during the previous month; this patient reported the shedding of a thumbnail about 1 month after symptom onset. Throat swabs were obtained from five patients, and an open lesion was swabbed from a sixth. Testing by MDH using RT-PCR identified Enterovirus in four of five throat swab specimens and in the swab from the lesion; isolates were subsequently sequenced and identified by CDC as CVA6. There were no complications, and all patients recovered.

### Can we learn from viruses how to prevent type 1 diabetes? the role of viral infections in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes and the development of novel combination therapies [^111asdX2]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

To summarize what we have learned so far regarding the mechanism by which viral infections can inhibit a diabetogenic response, please see Fig. 2. TGF-β augmentation of Tregs is not solely responsible for virally mediated prevention of type 1 diabetes. It turns out that there are important general mechanisms that occur simultaneously, while the virus infection is ongoing. Based on our findings, these are associated with the viral induction of PD-1L and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Both molecules have been shown to downmodulate immune responses and are important for the attrition of the antiviral immune response, when the viral infection is being cleared (with the purpose to limit excess immunopathology). Indeed, what happens after a viral infection, and this mechanism holds true for Coxsackie B viruses and other systemic infections, is that not only are the antiviral T-cells being eliminated, but PD-1L and TNF-α are mediating the bystander death of autoaggressive T-cells. This aspect of the mechanism results in a delay in the progression to type 1 diabetes but not a reduction in the overall incidence. The invigoration/activation of Treg cells is ultimately responsible for the observed reduction in incidence of type 1 diabetes in our model systems. Combined, these cytokine effects result in reduced incidence and delay of type 1 diabetes. These findings also illustrate rather elegantly that there are two components needed to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes therapeutically: 1) elimination of autoaggressive T-cells and 2) augmentation of Tregs to achieve long-term tolerance.

### First use of investigational antiviral drug pocapavir (V-073) for treating neonatal enteroviral sepsis [^117QFy7W]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Neonatal enteroviral sepsis is a potentially fatal condition. Perinatally acquired infection and severe coagulopathy can be associated with a poor clinical outcome, and antiviral therapy is currently unavailable. Pocapavir (V-073) is an investigational drug candidate being developed for poliovirus indications, but also has variable antiviral activity against nonpolio enteroviruses. We describe the first use of pocapavir in treating a case of severe neonatal enteroviral sepsis due to Coxsackievirus B3.

### An outbreak of coxsackievirus A6-associated hand, foot, and mouth disease in a kindergarten in beijing in 2015 [^113Yi9od]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease characterized by clinical symptoms of vesicular rashes and stomatitis of the oral mucosa affecting patients' hands, feet and occasionally the buttocks. The most susceptible patient population of HFMD is children less than 5 years old. HFMD is caused by viruses belonging to the species Enterovirus A or B, genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae, among which, human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) were the most prevalent pathogens in previous publications. Only EV-A71 is almost exclusively associated with severe disease.

From 2012 onward, Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) has been reported as an emerging pathogen of the HFMD epidemic globally. In 2013, the etiological surveillance system in Beijing and other cities in China identified a sudden rise of CVA6 positive rate, which turned out to be one of the predominant pathogens of HFMD. Since then, CVA6 has spread across mainland China and drawn serious public health attention.

In 2015, there were in total six HFMD outbreaks occurred in the kindergartens in Beijing. The number of cases ranged from 11 to 14 among the five of them, and remaining one had 56 cases. This outbreak occurred in a kindergarten in Shijingshan district in Beijing. There were 357 children and 51 school staffs in this kindergarten. The children were divided and assigned to 11 classes (average class size was 32). Daily extra-curricular activities were held, in which children from different classes attended lessons together. We performed a further investigation on this large-scale HFMD outbreak in this kindergarten and found that it was caused by CVA6 infection.

In this study, we aimed to collect and summarize epidemiological and clinical evidence of CVA6 infected HFMD, and thus to support and guide the diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control of the disease.

### Onychomadesis as a late complication of hand-foot-mouth disease: a case series shedding light on nail shedding [^1147g4QJ]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is a viral illness frequently caused by enterovirus and coxsackievirus. Traditionally, this disease initially causes malaise, fever, and rash with vesicles in the mouth, as well as on the hands and feet. Occasionally, more severe presentations and late postinfectious sequelae occur, including onychomadesis, nail matrix arrest. We describe a series of 4 cases of onychomadesis and its evaluation following recent hand-foot-mouth disease during this current enteroviral season as a way to ensure appropriate clinician diagnosis and guidance.

### Berberine impairs coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis through the inhibition of virus replication and host pro-inflammatory response [^111mSviU]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 BBR improves survival in CVB3‐infected mice

To analyze the probable protective efficacy of BBR against CVB3 infection in mouse model, the mice that suffered from CVB3 infection were daily administrated with BBR by gavage. After BBR treatment for 7 days, the mice infected with CVB3 alone showed a 45.83% survival rate, whereas the mice treated with CVB3+BBR showed a 62.50% (BBR 50 mg/kg) and 79.17% (BBR 100 mg/kg) survival rate (Figure 1C). Even though the survival rate of CVB3+BBR (50 mg/kg)‐treated mice was not statistically different from the CVB3‐infected mice, the survival rate of the CVB3+BBR (100 mg/kg)‐treated mice was significantly higher than that of the CVB3‐infected mice (Figure 1C), suggesting that BBR may be used as a protective reagent against CVB3 infection in vivo.

### Neurotropic virus infections as the cause of immediate and delayed neuropathology [^1136L81L]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Picornaviridae

The family Picornaviridae is one of the largest virus families consisting of small, non-enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses. The family is classified into 29 genera including many human pathogens such as poliovirus (PV) and the non-polio enteroviruses (EVs) of the Enterovirus genus, human parechovirus (HPeV) and hepatitis A virus. Animal pathogens include foot-and-mouth disease virus and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. Clinical symptoms caused by picornaviruses in humans vary greatly, ranging from the common cold to life-threatening infections such as encephalitis and myocarditis. Hereafter, picornaviruses that can cause neurological disease in humans will be discussed. CNS infections are most often caused by EVs and are estimated to cause 10–15 million infections in the United States with at least 30,000–50,000 hospitalizations per year, that are mainly due to aseptic meningitis. Based on molecular and serological characteristics the EVs are classified into species EV-A, containing EV71 and several Coxsackie A viruses (CV-A), species EV-B including coxsackie B viruses (CVB) 1–6 and all echoviruses, EV-C with the polioviruses (PVs) 1–3 and several CVAs, and EV-D containing EV-68. Following EVs, the second most frequent viral cause of CNS disease is HPeV, which belongs to the Parechovirus genus. The HPeV species are only found in primates and now consists of 16 types. The disease spectrum is similar to that of EV infections, although HPeV infection is almost exclusively seen in children.

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

What is GOHIBIC?

GOHIBIC is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). GOHIBIC is investigational because it is still being studied. GOHIBIC is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Current perspectives on erythema multiforme [^116SS1Tf]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Recognition and timely adequate treatment of erythema multiforme remain a major challenge. In this review, current diagnostic guidelines, potential pitfalls, and modern/novel treatment options are summarized with the aim to help clinicians with diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. The diagnosis of erythema multiforme, that has an acute, self-limiting course, is based on its typical clinical picture of targetoid erythematous lesions with predominant acral localization as well as histological findings. Clinically, erythema multiforme can be differentiated into isolated cutaneous and combined mucocutaneous forms. Atypical erythema multiforme manifestations include lichenoid or granulomatous lesions as well as lesional infiltrates of T cell lymphoma and histiocytes. Herpes simplex virus infection being the most common cause, other infectious agents like-especially in children-Mycoplasma pneumoniae, hepatitis C virus, Coxsackie virus, and Epstein Barr virus may also trigger erythema multiforme. The second most frequently identified cause of erythema multiforme is drugs. In different studies, e.g., allopurinol, phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproic acid, antibacterial sulfonamides, penicillins, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, tetracyclines, chlormezanone, acetylsalicylic acid, statins, as well as different TNF-α inhibitors such as adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept were reported as possible implicated drugs. Recently, cases of erythema multiforme associated with vaccination, immunotherapy for melanoma, and even with topical drugs like imiquimod have been described. In patients with recurrent herpes simplex virus-associated erythema multiforme, the topical prophylactic treatment with acyclovir does not seem to prevent further episodes of erythema multiforme. In case of resistance to one virostatic drug, the switch to an alternative drug, and in patients non-responsive to virostatic agents, the use of dapsone as well as new treatment options, e.g. JAK-inhibitors or apremilast, might be considered.

### Development of potential antiviral strategy against coxsackievirus B4 [^1122rZD2]. Virus Research (2010). Low credibility.

Coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) can cause a broad range of diseases such as aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, gastroenteritis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pneumonia and sudden death in the neonates. CVB4 has also been implicated as a possible etiological agent for type 1 insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). In this study, the possibility of RNA interference (RNAi) as a potential therapeutic approach to treat CVB4 infection was explored. The results showed that the Rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells treated with 19-mer siRNAs displayed high specificity against CVB4 replication without displaying any sign of target effects. The siRNA targeting the 3C(pro) region of CVB4 genome was also established to be the most effective in inhibition of CVB4 replication in RD cell line in a dosage dependent manner, indicating its potential to be developed as an antiviral strategy against CVB4.

### Enterovirus infections: a review of clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment [^115s6C8u]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

The enteroviruses, RNA viruses of the Picornaviridae family, are ubiquitous pathogens which include more than 70 different serotypes that infect people of all ages and tend to occur seasonally in the summer and fall. Clinical manifestations may vary diversely with one serotype, while multiple serotypes can present with identical symptoms and may mimic bacterial infections. Most enterovirus infections cause benign, self-limiting disease; however, they can also produce severe and sometimes fatal illnesses such as meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, neonatal sepsis, and polio. Severe enterovirus infections are being diagnosed and treated earlier with better prognostic outcomes due to the advances of polymerase chain reaction technology in accurately detecting virus in patient fluids as well as the recent development of new antiviral therapies.

### Viral infections in critical care: a narrative review [^111QxtaK]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Viral infections form a significant proportion of the ICU workload, and commonly present with non‐specific syndromes that require viral testing for formal diagnosis. Diagnostic testing should be informed by the presenting syndrome and careful history taking, with due attention to recent sick contacts, animal contacts and travel history. Secondary complications of viral infections, including co‐infection and ICU‐acquired infection need to be distinguished from primary viral pathology as these will require specific therapy with appropriate antimicrobials. The range of antiviral therapies is limited, and their optimal use is well defined only in a narrow number of infections caused by the most prevalent viruses. Consultation with microbiology, virology or infectious diseases specialists can help when unusual or complicated infections are suspected and vital when viral haemorrhagic fevers are suspected. With the challenges of climate change, habitat invasion by humans and global interconnectedness, viral illness from both well established and emerging pathogens are likely to challenge intensivists for the foreseeable future.

### An old virus with atypical presentation-tomato flu? [^116rXd2r]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2022). High credibility.

Disease transmission and symptoms

The first evidence showed that TF, as the HFMD, is a very contagious disease transmitted by close contact making under-five children a particular group at risk. Infants can be infected mainly through nappies or if they touch unclean surfaces or put infected objects directly into the mouth.

The main symptoms of TF are described as high fever, intense arthralgias with sometimes joint swelling, and a rash localized in the mouth (tongue, gums, inside of the cheek), palms, and soles. Doctors now report some atypical localization of the lesions; they can also be found on the buttocks or even the shedding of nails. The lesions are described as red, painful, growing blisters.

Additional symptoms like many viral infections include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, fatigue, body aches, and influenza-like symptoms. The symptoms may have different presentations or intensity from one child to another, as illustrated by the two cases diagnosed in the United Kingdom a week after returning from a trip to Kerala. The two siblings, a five-year-old boy and a 13-month-old girl presented a vesicular rash without fever or other systemic symptoms. The girl's rash was more florid, and she gave two days after painful oral lesions while his brother was in a healing process. After six days, the boy's lesion completely healed without scarring, while his sister had to wait until 16 days for the same result. The Enterovirus PCR was positive for both children, and the EV typing by sequencing showed Coxsackie A-16, another finding in favor of the likeliness of the tomato flu as an atypical presentation of the HFMD.

### Interferons as therapeutic agents for infectious diseases [^112mnrxj]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

This article explains the rationale for development of interferons as therapeutic agents, and describes commercial products available today. It also provides a summary of studies that have been performed with interferons for use as exogenous biological response modifiers in viral infections. Overall, the best data exist for treatment of viral hepatitis B and C, for which interferons are a cornerstone of therapy. Although infections with human papillomavirus and common cold viruses sometimes respond favorably to interferons, their outcomes are far from ideal. Finally, the role of interferons as vaccine adjuvants is still being explored but could be promising.

### Coxsackievirus infection as an environmental factor in the etiology of type 1 diabetes [^114UF5BS]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D) is dictated by a complex interplay between genetic determinants and environmental influences. Accumulating evidence strongly supports viral infection as an important factor in the etiology of T1D. To this effect, several viruses have been associated with the capacity to induce or exacerbate T1D in both humans and mice. The most convincing evidence linking viral infection and autoimmunity comes from studies on enteroviruses, particularly coxsackievirus. In this review we will discuss the evidence associating coxsackievirus infection to T1D and present the current state of knowledge on the potential mechanism of coxsackievirus-mediated T1D.

### Coxsackievirus B5 associated with hand-foot-mouth disease in a healthy adult [^111AgPNN]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute and highly contagious viral exanthem that commonly affects children younger than 5 years. The infection can be symptomatic and the clinical manifestations include mild fever with a characteristic vesicular eruption on the hands, feet, and oral cavity. Historically, HFMD is known as a self-limited disease process. However, recurrent outbreaks over the last 2 decades in the Asian and Pacific populations have caused severe illness and debilitating complications, even death. In addition, North American outbreaks were recently documented and have affected unexpected numbers of healthy adults and children. The purpose of this case report is to present an atypical case of HFMD in a healthy adult caused by coxsackievirus B5 and to recognize the potential danger of HFMD epidemics.

### Effects of glycine 64 substitutions in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase on ribavirin sensitivity and pathogenicity of coxsackievirus A6 [^111hJMNy]. Virus Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Highlights

- The 64th amino acid of the naturally prevalent 3D polymerase of CVA6 is a glycine amino group (G), but the mutation to serine (S) and threonine (T) will reduce the viral pathogenicity and is an attenuated site.
- The mutation of glycine amino group (G) to serine (S) and threonine (T) at position 64 of 3D polymerase of CVA6 decreased ribavirin susceptibility.
- The 64th glycine amino group (G) of the 3D polymerase of CVA6 was mutated to serine (S) and threonine (T) to improve the replication fidelity of the strain.

### Pleconaril and ribavirin in new-onset type 1 diabetes: a phase 2 randomized trial [^111zr2Jm]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by progressive loss of pancreatic β cell function that leads to lifelong dependence on insulin therapy. Childhood-onset T1D is a severe disease not only because of disabling acute and late complications leading to shortened life expectancy, but also because of the heavy burden of a demanding therapy regimen on patients and their families.

The disease is the result of a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, the immune system and environmental factors. However, despite intensive biochemical, immunological, epidemiological and clinical research during the last 100 years, the etiology of T1D remains largely unknown. Some viruses can cause diabetes in animal models. Viral infections can also contribute to the development of islet autoimmunity in humans. Enteroviruses in particular have been implicated in the pathogenesis of T1D. Approximately 240 enterovirus types capable of infecting humans have been identified; enterovirus infections are common in childhood, ranging from an asymptomatic to a severe clinical presentation. Meta-analyses showed a clinically significant association between enterovirus infections and the appearance of autoantibodies (T1D stages 1 and 2) and the onset of clinical diabetes (T1D stage 3) (refs. –). Enterovirus capsid protein has also been detected in the β cells of patients with T1D.

In the Diabetes Virus Detection study (DiViD), pancreatic tissue was collected from six adult patients with newly diagnosed T1D. We demonstrated a low-grade enterovirus infection in the pancreatic islets in all patients and detected infection-competent enteroviruses in the pancreatic tissue from all cases –. Among known enteroviruses, only some may have diabetogenic properties. Coxsackie B enteroviruses have been associated with T1D in epidemiological studies. Enteroviruses display tropism to the pancreatic islets because β cells strongly express the receptor used by these viruses. The possible role of viral infection and the rationale for performing trials targeting enteroviruses were reviewed elsewhere.

Pleconaril, developed against enteroviruses, clears viruses in β cell models of persistent enterovirus infection –. Pleconaril significantly reduced mortality due to severe enteroviral sepsis in neonates. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analog with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a variety of viruses, including enteroviruses. An in vitro study showed that ribavirin may have an immunomodulatory effect, leading to enhanced interferon-γ (IFNγ) response and thus to a possible additive antiviral effect.

### Development of a new fusion-enhanced oncolytic immunotherapy platform based on herpes simplex virus type 1 [^1133cQFN]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The therapeutic potential of T-VEC can be further enhanced by combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In a small phase 1 trial in patients with melanoma, T-VEC in combination with pembrolizumab resulted in a 62% response rate and 33% complete response rate. Similarly promising response rates (> 50%) have also been seen in other small studies with either ipilimumab or pembrolizumab in combination with other oncolytic viruses, such as Cavatak (an oncolytic Coxsackievirus) or HF10 (another oncolytic HSV-1). Data have also been reported from a 200-patient randomized controlled phase 2 clinical trial with T-VEC combined with ipilimumab compared to ipilimumab alone, where more than a doubling of the response rate was seen in the combination arm. While these studies were all in melanoma, it is important to note that none reported significant additional toxicity compared to that expected with either agent alone. Based on the favorable therapeutic window for T-VEC and other oncolytic viruses, there has been considerable interest in optimizing the oncolytic immunotherapy strategy and using such agents as part of a rational combination regimen in patients with solid cancers.

It is now generally accepted that patients responding to immunotherapy need to have tumors that are immunologically 'hot', i.e. have a T cell-inflamed phenotype, although the specific mechanisms that regulate T cell recruitment into established tumors are incompletely understood. Additional factors that favor immune-mediated rejection include high mutation burden, presence of pre-existing immune responses to tumor antigens, particularly tumor neoantigens, and expression of a pro-inflammatory gene signature. While a number of approaches are in development aimed at correcting these deficiencies in non-responsive patients, oncolytic immunotherapies may have particular promise for this purpose as they kill tumors in a highly inflammatory context. This effect is highly immunogenic, including activation of both innate and adaptive immunity, with the potential to create a vaccine "in situ" within the patient against their own cancer. The local production of type 1 interferons induced by oncolytic viruses also results in increased expression of several immune regulatory proteins, including MHC class I and PD-L1.

### Acute unilateral maculopathy associated with adult onset of hand, foot and mouth disease: a case report [^111f5Zxu]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Viruses are frequent causes of infections involving the eye's posterior segment. Measles, influenza, Ebstein-Barr and Rift Vallery fever virus can cause retinitis and chorioiditis, which is typically preceded by an acute systemic viral disease. Similarly, Coxsackie viruses infections can be associated with chorioretinitis as reported in just a few cases in the literature. Diagnosing Coxsackie virus infection mainly relies on pathognomic clinical findings and can be supported by laboratory tests such as PCR. Although our patient underwent no anterior-chamber or vitreous-fluid aspiration to detect the Coxsackie virus via PCR or cell culture, our patient's clinical and funduscopic features are in line with previous case reports and make the diagnosis of an HMFD-associated maculopathy very likely.

Areas for future research

There are a range of unanswered questions regarding viral infections in the ICU. The most pressing relate to the extent to which therapeutics with proven benefit in COVID‐19 treatment can be applied to ARDS arising from other respiratory viral infections. The role of molecular diagnostics in detecting or excluding bacterial co‐infection and the impact on antimicrobial prescribing also requires urgent exploration. The third area of research interest is to define which patients with evidence of respiratory herpesviridae reactivation will benefit from antiviral therapy.

### HFMD symptoms and… [^114fKzQn]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease include fever, mouth sores, and a skin rash on the hands and feet.
- HFMD is common in infants and children younger than 5 years old.
- Most children have mild symptoms for 7 to 10 days. Signs and symptoms HFMD symptoms usually include fever, mouth sores, and skin rash. Fever and flu-like symptoms Children often get a fever and other flu-like symptoms 3 to 5 days after they catch the virus. These can include:

- Fever
- Eating or drinking less
- Sore throat
- Feeling unwell. Skin rash Your child can get a rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It can also show up on the buttocks, legs, and arms. The rash usually is not itchy and looks like flat or slightly raised red spots; sometimes with blisters that have an area of redness at their base. Fluid in the blister can contain the virus that causes HFMD. Keep blisters clean and avoid touching them.

Complications HFMD is usually not serious and complications from it are rare. Nearly all people get better in 7 to 10 days with minimal or no medical treatment. Dehydration Some people, especially young children, can get dehydrated. This can happen if they are not able to swallow enough liquids because of painful mouth sores. Parents can prevent dehydration by making sure their child drinks enough liquids. Viral meningitis Although very rare, a small number of people with HFMD get viral meningitis. This causes fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain. The infected person may require to be hospitalized for a few days. Keep Reading: About Viral Meningitis Encephalitis or paralysis While extremely rare, a small number of people. with HFMD get encephalitis or paralysis.

When to see a healthcare provider See a healthcare provider if your child:

- Cannot drink well and you are worried they are dehydrated.
- Has a fever that lasts longer than 3 days.
- Has a weakened immune system.
- Is having severe symptoms.
- Has symptoms that do not improve after 10 days.
- Is very young, especially younger than 6 months.
