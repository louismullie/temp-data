## Question

What can cause NMS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the primary pharmacologic mechanism and which drug classes are implicated. Then, I should verify specific high-risk agents and whether atypical antipsychotics also cause NMS. Next, I will examine non-antipsychotic dopamine blockers and dopamine withdrawal states. After that, I need to consider patient-specific risk factors and temporal patterns. Finally, I should review atypical or non-classic triggers and synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary with caveats about diagnosis and rechallenge risk.

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism. NMS is classically linked to dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the nigrostriatal and hypothalamic pathways, producing rigidity, hyperthermia, altered mental status, and autonomic instability; this mechanistic anchor explains why dopamine antagonists are the principal culprits and why dopamine agonist withdrawal can mimic the syndrome, so I should keep both blockade and withdrawal in mind as I proceed [^116xFwjP] [^117WKNeD].

> I will now examine the primary drug classes. Typical (first-generation) antipsychotics such as haloperidol, fluphenazine, and chlorpromazine are well-established causes, and haloperidol repeatedly appears as a frequent offender in case series and perioperative contexts; at first glance, I might say SGAs are "safe", but wait, let me verify that assumption because it is misleading [^111b8bRh] [^115V8K8s]. Atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics including risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, lurasidone, cariprazine, and asenapine have all been associated with NMS, sometimes with atypical presentations that lack prominent fever or rigidity, so I should not falsely reassure myself about SGA safety [^11219fVR] [^115V8K8s] [^112ST7PY] [^116uHAqA] [^111FcfiD] [^115xkscj] [^112ZGs5k] [^114sWikD] [^115TfTTt].

> Hold on, I should verify non-antipsychotic dopamine blockers too. Antiemetics with dopamine antagonism such as metoclopramide and prochlorperazine can precipitate NMS, and promethazine has also been implicated; these are easy to overlook in the differential, especially in perioperative or oncology settings where antiemetics are routine [^112wcbVn] [^116XrRVr] [^112oFJxG] [^111dSzkP] [^115B3Skn] [^115LEwdZ] [^115YgDwf] [^112jcuvR] [^115HVctd]. Let me also remember that abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (levodopa/carbidopa, dopamine agonists) can produce a neuroleptic malignant–like syndrome, reinforcing the centrality of dopamine pathway disruption rather than a single drug class effect [^113pBzu4] [^113fMosS] [^114PVWet].

> Next, I should review patient-specific risk factors and temporal patterns. Young adult males with treatment-resistant psychosis, high antipsychotic doses, rapid titration, parenteral administration, and antipsychotic polypharmacy or recent switches elevate risk; dehydration, intercurrent infection, and medical comorbidity further compound vulnerability, and most cases cluster in the first 1–2 weeks after initiation or dose change, though delayed presentations do occur [^117WKNeD] [^115V8K8s] [^112Bhgob] [^111BXGRg] [^1138F7Uo]. I need to ensure I ask about recent medication changes, hydration status, and concurrent illnesses when NMS is on the table [^111BXGRg] [^1138F7Uo].

> But wait, what if there is no antipsychotic exposure at all? I should double-check for non-classic triggers. NMS-like syndromes have been described after CNS insults such as shunt failure or neurosurgical procedures, and there are rare reports linking tetrabenazine and even SSRIs to NMS or NMS-like reactions, likely via downstream effects on dopamine transmission; these are exceptional but remind me to keep a broad differential when the classic exposure history is absent [^112uBjCd] [^11332BD6] [^111uQkiU] [^113wyS5a]. Let me reconsider the diagnostic threshold: NMS remains a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and atypical presentations without fever or marked rigidity can still represent NMS, especially with SGAs, so I should not anchor prematurely on "classic" features [^115V8K8s] [^1112SgKt].

> I should confirm the practical clinical implications. If NMS is suspected, the offending dopamine antagonist or precipitating agent should be stopped immediately, even before diagnostic certainty, and supportive care instituted; rechallenge with antipsychotics should be delayed for at least 2 weeks after full resolution and undertaken with a different agent, slow titration, and close monitoring given recurrence risk [^1123JQvd] [^111q3CFj] [^115V8K8s]. I need to ensure I counsel patients and families about early warning signs and the risk of recurrence, and I should document the index event clearly to guide future pharmacotherapy choices [^115hVBTZ].

> In summary, I need to ensure my causal framework remains precise: NMS is caused by dopamine blockade or withdrawal, with antipsychotics — both typical and atypical — as the predominant triggers, and antiemetic dopamine antagonists as important non-psychiatric culprits; additional contributors include dopaminergic withdrawal in Parkinson's disease, certain CNS insults, and possibly serotonergic-dopaminergic interactions, with risk modulated by dose, route, titration speed, polypharmacy, hydration, and comorbidities; recognizing atypical presentations and maintaining a high index of suspicion are essential to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment [^115V8K8s] [^111uQkiU] [^112wcbVn] [^113fMosS].

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is most often triggered by **dopamine antagonists** (antipsychotics) [^115V8K8s], especially high-potency typical agents like haloperidol [^111b8bRh] and fluphenazine [^112cbAUV], but also by atypicals such as risperidone [^116uHAqA], olanzapine [^112ST7PY], and quetiapine [^111FcfiD]. Other causes include **dopamine-depleting agents** (e.g. tetrabenazine) [^11332BD6], abrupt withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs in Parkinson's disease [^115V8K8s], and non-antipsychotic dopamine blockers like metoclopramide [^112wcbVn] and prochlorperazine [^115B3Skn]. Risk rises with high doses, rapid titration, parenteral administration, dehydration, heat exposure, and co-administration of lithium, anticholinergics, or SSRIs [^111BXGRg] [^111uQkiU]. NMS is a medical emergency requiring immediate drug cessation and supportive care [^112Ymz21].

## Medications associated with NMS

### Antipsychotic medications (dopamine antagonists)

- **Typical antipsychotics**: High-potency agents (e.g. haloperidol, fluphenazine) are classic triggers [^115V8K8s]; haloperidol is especially implicated [^111b8bRh].

- **Atypical antipsychotics**: Lower but real risk with risperidone [^116uHAqA], olanzapine [^112ST7PY], quetiapine [^111FcfiD], aripiprazole [^115xkscj], ziprasidone, and clozapine [^1172kLBu].

- **Long-acting injectables**: Both FGA and SGA LAIs carry NMS risk [^111BXGRg].

---

### Non-antipsychotic dopamine-blocking agents

- **Metoclopramide**: A dopamine antagonist antiemetic linked to NMS [^112wcbVn] [^112oFJxG].

- **Prochlorperazine**: An antiemetic with NMS reports [^115B3Skn] [^115vwPuT].

- **Promethazine**: Phenothiazine antiemetic with NMS risk [^115YgDwf].

---

### Dopamine-depleting agents

Tetrabenazine depletes dopamine and has been associated with NMS, particularly in Huntington's disease [^11332BD6].

---

### Withdrawal of dopaminergic medications

In Parkinson's disease, abrupt withdrawal of **levodopa/carbidopa** or dopamine agonists can precipitate an NMS-like syndrome [^113fMosS] [^113pBzu4].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

- **Age and sex**: Young adult males are at higher risk [^117WKNeD].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history of NMS or malignant hyperthermia may increase risk [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: CNS disorders, dehydration, and medical illness elevate risk [^11219fVR].

---

## Environmental and physiological factors

- **High ambient temperature**: Heat exposure increases risk [^notfound].

- **Dehydration**: Common and modifiable risk [^1138F7Uo].

- **Concurrent medications**: Lithium, anticholinergics, and SSRIs increase risk [^111BXGRg] [^111uQkiU].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop the offending agent promptly [^1123JQvd].

- **Supportive care**: Aggressive cooling, hydration, and ICU monitoring are essential [^112Ymz21].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Consider dantrolene, bromocriptine, or ECT in severe cases [^114xu2er].

- **Rechallenge**: Wait at least 2 weeks after resolution; use a different agent and monitor closely [^111q3CFj].

---

NMS is a **potentially fatal idiosyncratic reaction** to dopamine blockade or withdrawal, with risk modulated by drug, dose, patient factors, and environment. Rapid recognition and management are critical to outcomes [^115V8K8s].

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in patients with cancer: a systematic review [^111b8bRh]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2020). High credibility.

Background

Antipsychotics potentially cause a low incidence of the side effect called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which has a high mortality rate. However, few studies on NMS among patients with cancer exist.

Aims

We aimed to examine the characteristics of antipsychotic-induced NMS among patients with cancer.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of published reports on NMS described during the treatment of patients with any type of cancer. Articles were identified by a comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and reference lists from relevant articles published until 25 December 2019. Original articles or case reports on humans published in English were included. This review summarises the symptoms, characteristics, treatment course and prognosis of patients with cancer with NMS.

Results

Eleven patients with various cancer types from ten case reports published from 1988 to 2013 met the eligibility criteria. Mean age of the 11 patients was 52.5 (range, 32–83) years. NMS developed mostly during the postoperative period, and haloperidol and D2 receptor antagonists were determined as the common causative drugs. Ten patients survived following treatment that mostly involved discontinuing the causative drugs and administering dantrolene, if necessary.

Conclusion

Although NMS intrinsically has a low incidence and high mortality, only few reports were available, with most patients surviving after early detection and appropriate treatment. Healthcare providers should consider NMS development while prescribing antipsychotics to ensure prompt recognition of the condition and rapid treatment for preventing unnecessary deaths.

### Movement disorders in psychiatric patients [^117WKNeD]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is perhaps the most serious movement disorder encountered by psychiatrists. Schizophrenia is a strong risk factor; a typical case would be a younger male with relatively drug-resistant psychosis requiring multiple or high-dose antipsychotic drug treatment. In its fully developed form, fever, rigidity with rhabdomyolysis, autonomic instability and altered mental state have life-threatening potential. There are milder versions, with a continuum that extends from pronounced drug-induced parkinsonism. Dopaminergic D2 receptor blockade is likely to be the primary cause, and peripheral explanations around skeletal muscle fibre toxicity are less satisfactory. The breakdown in regulation of muscle energy expenditure in neuroleptic malignant syndrome underlines one important purpose of the basal ganglia — to optimise energy efficiency in motor control.

A neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome may also occur in patients with PD who have had sudden reductions in dopaminergic medications. It has also been described with drugs that do not interact directly with dopamine receptors.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in children and adolescents [^114Q6fHr]. Journal of Child Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal complication of treatment with antipsychotic medications. Prior to 1994, there was no accepted set of diagnostic criteria. This article presents four adolescents admitted at Cleveland Clinic Foundation from 1985 to 1998, illustrating the broad spectrum of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A review of the pediatric literature is discussed as to the current risk factors, pathogenesis, management, and outcome. Early recognition and supportive and specific treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome reduced the morbidity and mortality.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to management of drug side effects, BAP 2020 guidelines recommend to suspect neuroleptic malignant syndrome when any 2 of the 4 key clinical features (mental status change, muscle rigidity, fever, and autonomic dysfunction) develop during antipsychotic treatment. Withhold antipsychotic medication if neuroleptic malignant syndrome is suspected.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^116V9aUG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review evidence for the treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and to discuss how to rechallenge patients with neuroleptics when continued pharmacotherapy for chronic psychological illness is required.

Data Sources

A PubMed search was conducted through March 2016 using available medical subject heading (MeSH) terms and keywords that included neuroleptic malignant syndrome, treatment, dantrolene, and bromocriptine. A manual search of article reference sections followed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Case reports and case series in English that discussed NMS and atypical NMS treatment as well as neuroleptic rechallenge were included for review.

Data Synthesis

The reported incidence of NMS was 0.02% to 0.03%, with a mortality rate of 5.6%. Current literature on NMS is primarily retrospective and emphasizes diagnostic criteria, causative agents, and potential pharmacotherapy. Details regarding timing of administration, dose, and duration of pharmacotherapy are inconsistently reported. Reported dosing strategies and outcomes have been summarized. Instances of rechallenge were infrequently reported but demonstrate that recurrence may happen at any time after NMS resolution. Recommendations regarding safe rechallenge are provided.

Conclusion

NMS is a rare adverse drug reaction, with a complex pathophysiology and presentation. Timely diagnosis and discontinuation of antipsychotic therapy is the first-line treatment, followed by supportive care and pharmacotherapy. Antipsychotic rechallenge is often required and should be attempted only after a drug-free period and with a different agent, slowly titrated with close monitoring.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome following reintroduction of an antipsychotic after overdose [^1135Ez38]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially lethal adverse drug reaction that affects 0.2% to 3.2% of psychiatric inpatients. Despite being a well-recognised condition, the pathogenesis of NMS is not fully understood. Although many risk factors have been identified, predicting which patients will develop NMS and when, remains extremely difficult. We report a case of NMS and discuss possible aetiologies with reference to the existing literature.

Key messages

- It is wise to discontinue contributing medication even before the diagnosis of NMS is definite.

- No treatment regimen including dantrolene could be considered as evidence-based.

### What clinical analysis of antipsychotic-induced catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome tells us about the links between these two syndromes: a systematic review [^11219fVR]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Antipsychotic-induced catatonia (AIC) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) are life-threatening adverse reactions to antipsychotic medication. We conducted a systematic review of literature following the PRISMA statement guidelines to obtain a description of these syndromes (population, context of occurrence, antipsychotic agents implicated) and draw conclusions about their links.

Methods

We searched Medline and Web of science databases from January 1951 to May 2019 (further restricted from 2000 to 2019) using search terms including "catatonia", "neuroleptic malignant syndrome" and "antipsychotic agents" for case reports, case series and analytic studies. After screening 4082 records, 410 full-text articles (describing 555 events) were assessed for eligibility. We included events of AIC and/or NMS according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) criteria and extracted data about patients' characteristics, context of occurrence, antipsychotic agent(s) involved and treatment outcomes.

Results

We included 165 events (16 AIC, 129 NMS and 20 AIC + NMS) from 144 case reports and case series. The most reported diagnosis was schizophrenia. Comorbid pre-existing conditions such as central nervous system diseases and acute medical events were common. Most of the events (63.3%) occurred during antipsychotic monotherapy. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs, 63.8%) were overall more implicated than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs, 36.2%).

Discussion

Our findings highlight that any antipsychotic medication, even SGA monotherapy prescribed at recommended dose, is at risk for these side effects. FGAs and polypharmacy seem to represent risk factors for malignant catatonia in AIC. The clinical overlap observed between AIC and NMS events in our review suggests a clinical continuum between catatonia and NMS.

### An international consensus study of neuroleptic malignant syndrome diagnostic criteria using the Delphi method [^1113NkYf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The lack of generally accepted diagnostic criteria for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) impedes research and clinical management of patients receiving antipsychotic medications. The purpose of this study was to develop NMS diagnostic criteria reflecting a broad consensus among clinical knowledge experts, represented by an international multispecialty physician panel.

Participants

Eleven psychiatrists, 2 neurologists, 2 anesthesiologists, and 2 emergency medicine specialists participated in a formal Delphi consensus procedure.

Evidence

A core bibliography consisting of 12 prominent, current reviews of the NMS literature was identified by an objective, comprehensive electronic search strategy. Each panel member was given a copy of these references and asked to examine them before commencing the survey process.

Consensus Process

After reviewing the core bibliography, panel members were asked to list any clinical signs or symptoms or diagnostic studies that they believed, on the basis of their knowledge and clinical experience, were useful in making a diagnosis of NMS. In subsequent survey rounds, panel members assigned priority points to these items, and items that failed to receive a minimum priority score were eliminated from the next round. Information about individual panel member responses was fed back to the group anonymously in the form of the group median or mean and the number of members who had ranked or scored each survey item. The a priori consensus endpoint was defined operationally as a change of 10% or less in the mean priority score for any individual item, and an average absolute value change of 5% or less across all items, between consecutive rounds. The survey was conducted from January 2009 through September 2009.

Results

Consensus was reached on the fifth round regarding the following criteria: recent dopamine antagonist exposure, or dopamine agonist withdrawal; hyperthermia; rigidity; mental status alteration; creatine kinase elevation; sympathetic nervous system lability; tachycardia plus tachypnea; and a negative work-up for other causes. The panel also reached a consensus on the relative importance of these criteria and on the following critical values for quantitative criteria: hyperthermia, > 100.4°F or > 38.0°C on at least 2 occasions; creatine kinase elevation, at least 4 times the upper limit of normal; blood pressure elevation, ≥ 25% above baseline; blood pressure fluctuation, ≥ 20 mm Hg (diastolic) or ≥ 25 mm Hg (systolic) change within 24 hours; tachycardia, ≥ 25% above baseline; and tachypnea, ≥ 50% above baseline.

Conclusions

These diagnostic criteria significantly advance the field because they represent the consensus of an international multispecialty expert panel, include critical values, provide guidance regarding the relative importance of individual elements, and are less influenced by particular theoretical biases than most previously published criteria. They require validation before being applied in clinical settings.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^1132C6Gc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

In the United States, the incidence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in 2016 was 25 per 100,000 person-years.

### Meta-analytic evidence of systematic bias in estimates of neuroleptic malignant syndrome incidence [^114Fdoh9]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine published reports for sources of excessive variance in neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) incidence estimates.

Data Sources

An unrestricted computerized MEDLINE search was conducted with a comprehensive search logic and supplemented by secondary references and a manual search of an extensive personal library.

Study Selection

Studies were analyzed if they presented original data and provided at least 2 of the following: number of NMS cases, number of patients at risk, or ratio of cases to patients at risk. Twenty-six of the 28 candidate studies met these minimal criteria.

Data Extraction

Variables included incidence, year of study publication, mean year of NMS occurrence, patient population at risk, study design, diagnostic criteria, and country of origin.

Data Synthesis

Standard error, which reflects study size, accounted for 90.8% of the variance (beta = .953, P < .001) in this international series of 26 NMS incidence estimates. Incidence was significantly lower in 7 studies the time end points of which were set in advance of case identification (χ² = 71.08, P < .001). No other variable was significantly related to incidence.

Conclusions

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome incidence estimates to date are non-trivially biased such that larger study size (patients at risk) is strongly related to lower observed incidence. Future studies can minimize the contribution of this and other sources of experimental error by incorporating several very feasible recommendations.

### Risperidone (Risperdal) [^116uHAqA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue RISPERDAL and provide symptomatic treatment and monitoring.

5.4 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to predict which patients will develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after relatively brief treatment periods, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown.

Given these considerations, RISPERDAL should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: (1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on RISPERDAL, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with RISPERDAL despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: mechanisms, interactions, and causality [^112HE98i]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

This review focuses on new data from recent publications concerning how compounding interactions between different thermoregulatory pathways influence the development of hyperthermia and/or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), and the fundamental issue of the presumed causal role of antipsychotic drugs. The formal criteria for substantiating cause-effect relationships in medical science, established by Hill, are applied to NMS and, for comparison, also to malignant hyperthermia and serotonin toxicity. The risk of morbidities related to hyperthermia is reviewed from human and experimental data: temperatures in excess of 39.5°C cause physiological and cellular dysfunction and high mortality. The most temperature-sensitive elements of neural cells are mitochondrial and plasma membranes, in which irreversible changes occur around 40°C. Temperatures of up to 39°C are "normal" in mammals, so, the term hyperthermia should be reserved for temperatures of 39.5°C or greater. The implicitly accepted presumption that NMS is a hypermetabolic and hyperthermic syndrome is questionable and does not explain the extensive morbidity in the majority of cases, where the temperature is less than 39°C. The thermoregulatory effects of dopamine and acetylcholine are outlined, especially because they are probably the main pathways by which neuroleptic drugs might affect thermoregulation. It is notable that even potent antagonism of these mechanisms rarely causes temperature elevation and that multiple mechanisms, including the acute phase response, stress-induced hyperthermia, drugs effects, etc., involving compounding interactions, are required to precipitate hyperthermia. The application of the Hill criteria clearly supports causality for drugs inducing both MH and ST but do not support causality for NMS.

### Managing an effective treatment for neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^1111V5oa]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Independent of treatment options, it is still necessary to discontinue potentially contributing medication even before the diagnosis is definite. Dantrolene might not be the evidence-based treatment of choice in cases of NMS, but it might be useful if premedication consisted of a neuroleptic monotherapy.

### Chlorpromazine [^115HJKHW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome following reintroduction of an antipsychotic after overdose [^115Q5zW2]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially lethal adverse drug reaction. We report a case of NMS potentially induced by dehydration in a female patient suffering from schizoaffective disorder. We discuss possible aetiologies and triggering factors alongside the existing literature.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and atypical antipsychotic drugs [^1172kLBu]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The incidence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is not known, but the frequency of its occurrence with conventional antipsychotic agents has been reported to vary from 0.02% to 2.44%.

Data Sources

MEDLINE search conducted in January 2003 and review of references within the retrieved articles.

Data Synthesis

Our MEDLINE research yielded 68 cases (21 females and 47 males) of NMS associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs (clozapine, N = 21; risperidone, N = 23; olanzapine, N = 19; and quetiapine, N = 5). The fact that 21 cases of NMS with clozapine were found indicates that low occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and low EPS-inducing potential do not prevent the occurrence of NMS and D₂ dopamine receptor blocking potential does not have direct correlation with the occurrence of NMS. One of the cardinal features of NMS is an increasing manifestation of EPS, and the conventional antipsychotic drugs are known to produce EPS in 95% or more of NMS cases. With atypical antipsychotic drugs, the incidence of EPS during NMS is of a similar magnitude.

Conclusions

For NMS associated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, the mortality rate was lower than that with conventional antipsychotic drugs. However, the mortality rate may simply be a reflection of physicians' awareness and ensuing early treatment.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: a concealed diagnosis with multitreatment approach [^1112SgKt]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

While neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is typically characterised by delirium, motor rigidity, fever and dysautonomia, the syndrome is not pathognomonic, and NMS remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Here, we describe the case of a 44-year-old woman, with no relevant psychiatric history, admitted to a nephrology unit due to acute renal failure. After administration of antipsychotics, she presented with mental status alteration, generalised tremor, rigidity and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Fever and rhabdomyolysis, however, were not prominent, and NMS was not considered initially in the differential diagnosis. The resulting delay in diagnosis, with continued administration of antipsychotics, led to progressive clinical deterioration. Once NMS was considered, however, antipsychotics were withdrawn and the patient was treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), followed by administration of a dopamine receptor agonist, with close to full remission of all symptoms. Importantly, during outpatient follow-up, sustained mild and asymmetric tremor and rigidity was noted, leading to a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. While this raises questions regarding differential diagnosis between NMS in Parkinson's disease, versus worsening of Parkinson's disease due to antipsychotic treatment, the former is supported by the acute and rapidly progressive onset of exuberant autonomic dysfunction and clouded conscience, after administration of a neuroleptic. Ultimately, a definitive distinction between these two alternatives for diagnosis of the inaugural neurological presentation in this patient is not possible. Nevertheless, we believe this case illustrates that NMS can be easily missed, particularly in atypical cases, delaying appropriate treatment, and that a flexible multimodal treatment approach, involving ECT, should be considered for complex clinical cases. Furthermore, it also underlines the importance of post-NMS follow-up, to investigate underlying neurological or medical disorders, particularly in those patients who do not have a full recovery.

5.000000000000000e+00 4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue VRAYLAR and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring.

5.000000000000000e+00 5 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including VRAYLAR. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Given these considerations, VRAYLAR should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and 2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on VRAYLAR, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with VRAYLAR despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Prochlorperazine-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^115vwPuT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare yet severe condition typically associated with antipsychotic medications. Here, we present a case of NMS induced by prochlorperazine in a 76-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, aiming to delineate its clinical manifestation, diagnostic complexities, and treatment approaches. Our methodology involved a thorough documentation of the patient's medical history, initial symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, diagnostic processes, and subsequent therapeutic interventions. The patient exhibited classic NMS symptoms, including fever, altered mental status, autonomic dysregulation, and generalized rigidity, consistent with diagnostic criteria. Notably, laboratory investigations failed to reveal the typical abnormalities often seen in NMS cases, highlighting the diverse presentation of this syndrome. Management strategies primarily focused on benzodiazepines and amantadine, leading to a gradual improvement in symptoms and eventual resolution of NMS. This underscores the critical role of early recognition and appropriate pharmacotherapy in managing prochlorperazine-induced NMS, even at standard dosage levels. The absence of characteristic laboratory findings in NMS poses challenges in diagnosis, necessitating a comprehensive clinical assessment for accurate identification. Moreover, this case emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the pathophysiology of prochlorperazine-induced NMS and optimize treatment protocols. In conclusion, our case report sheds light on the complexities surrounding NMS induced by prochlorperazine, emphasizing the importance of vigilant monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies in mitigating its potentially life-threatening consequences.

### Managing an effective treatment for neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^115RnUAB]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, but sometimes fatal, adverse reaction to neuroleptics. It is characterized principally by fever and muscle rigidity. Furthermore, signs such as altered consciousness, autonomic instability, and laboratory findings such as elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), leukocytosis, raised liver enzymes, and low serum iron or potassium levels are also found (serum iron and potassium levels differ in the sets of diagnostic criteria according to several authors). NMS is observed mainly in patients treated with neuroleptics, especially with high-potency neuroleptics, atypical neuroleptics, low-potency D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide and tricyclic antidepressants, or after withdrawal of antiparkinsonians. Because clinical NMS studies have been conducted mainly in psychiatric units, it has been suggested that special attention to cancer patients undergoing psychopharmacologic treatment is necessary even in oncologic practice.

### Quetiapine [^111FcfiD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in trauma patient [^11793H1G]. Burns (2015). Low credibility.

In recent years, there has been an increased use of neuroleptic agents in the unit care in trauma patients. There is a lack of prospective data, and most of the information is obtained from related cases. It is needed to have a high index of suspicion with regard to excluding neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in patients taking neuroleptics and presenting with hyperthermia, because of the potentially fatal consequences. It is a rare syndrome in the burn patient with a lack of proven treatments, and high morbidity and mortality are related. In the actual literature there are few related cases of NMS in the polytrauma patient, particularly in association with psychiatric conditions. In burn NMS is a rare complication with difficult diagnosis, because of the similar symptoms that can occur either in patients in the Burn Unit Care with other fatal conditions that are present in the acute phase response. Actually, there is no marker for the NMS, which difficult the early diagnosis and prognosis. The treatment still is based on case reports, with lack of clinical trials, but remain as standard and universally accepted. Besides that, the neural signaling of the NMS indicates possibilities for better understanding of the pathophysiology treatment protocol.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to three atypical antipsychotics in a child [^114mgBCd]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a rare, potentially fatal and idiosyncratic drug reaction. It is characterized by a sudden loss of body temperature control, renal and respiratory failure, muscle rigidity, loss of consciousness and impairment of autonomic nervous system. Although NMS was previously associated with the use of classical high-potency neuroleptics, cases have started to emerge with atypical neuroleptics. This article discusses the first case of NMS in a child, induced by the use of risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine.

The conclusion that can be drawn from the data is that both ACS and NMS have been clearly underappreciated by genetic research. Both ACS and NMS are clinically rather rare conditions, so that finding candidate genes that are associated with these disorders will require large groups of patients. Given the clinical relevance of these syndromes, we strongly endorse population-based cohort studies that could decisively contribute to the specification of risk (or protective) factors (including relevant gene variants) and predictors for the occurrence of ACS and NMS. In line with this, we would appreciate hearing the authors' opinion on the relationship between candidate genes and ACS and NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

Loxapine, like other antipsychotics, may impair mental and/or physical abilities, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, ambulatory patients should be warned about activities requiring alertness (e.g., operating vehicles or machinery) and about concomitant use of alcohol and other CNS depressants.

Loxapine has not been evaluated for the management of behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation, and therefore, it cannot be recommended.

Falls

Loxapine may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

### Atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^112vr7k4]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 57-year-old man was admitted to a psychiatric ward in a confused state. He had a 30-year history of lately stable schizophrenia and antipsychotic medication had recently been reduced. The clinical picture was characterised by confusion, agitation, autonomic instability, muscle rigidity and elevated creatine kinase. Despite no other identifiable cause, physicians were reluctant to accept a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) due to the absence of fever. Despite acute renal failure, the patient was repeatedly transferred between medical and psychiatric wards; diagnosis and management were delayed, with potentially catastrophic consequences. NMS is a rare, life-threatening neurological disorder that can present atypically and requires emergency medical rather than psychiatric care. Clinicians must proactively distinguish between medical emergencies (including acute confusional states/delirium) and mental illness. Prompt, accurate diagnosis, management on the appropriate ward and effective teamwork between specialties are essential to improve patient outcomes in this potentially fatal condition.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^115V8K8s]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

NMS is a rare and potentially lethal idiosyncratic reaction to treatment with dopamine antagonists. Like malignant catatonia, NMS involves altered consciousness with catatonia, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction. Recent reports suggest a prevalence of 0.02–0.03%, much lower than the 1–3% reported in the 1980s. Mortality has declined over the years to an average of less than 10%. Virtually, all classes of drugs that induce dopamine receptor blockade have been implicated in causing NMS, with antipsychotics that have higher affinity for the D 2 receptor posing the greatest risk. However, SGAs have also been associated with NMS, although they may result in an 'atypical' presentation with less severe or absent rigidity or hyperthermia. NMS may also occur with dopamine-blocking drugs used as antiemetics, with dopamine depleting drugs, and during dopamine agonist withdrawal. About two-thirds of cases develop within the first 1–2 weeks after drug initiation. Laboratory abnormalities are nonspecific but commonly include elevated serum CK, leucocytosis and low serum iron resembling malignant catatonia.

### Investigation into neuroleptic malignant syndrome triggered by atypical antipsychotics: insights from FDA adverse event reporting system database [^112ZGs5k]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction associated with dopamine antagonists, particularly typical antipsychotics. Despite the relatively low incidence of NMS linked to atypical antipsychotics (AAPs), there is a notable lack of extensive real-world studies investigating this condition.

Methods

This study utilizes data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 2004 to 2024, employing disproportionality analysis to explore the association between fourteen commonly prescribed AAPs and NMS. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for mortality related to NMS.

Results

We analyzed 79,980 primary suspected adverse drug event (ADE) reports for NMS, revealing a slight male predominance and a median age of 48 years (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 31–64). Patients were primarily located in Europe and the United States. Ziprasidone exhibited the strongest pharmacovigilance signal (Reporting Odds Ratio [ROR] = 3.09; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.97–3.21), while lurasidone showed the lowest signal strength (ROR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.52–1.65). The median time to onset of NMS was 42 days (IQR: 9–328.25). Significant mortality risk factors included age ≥ 65 years (Odds Ratio [OR] = 4.45; 95% CI: 3.33–5.95), Parkinson's disease (OR = 32.69; 95% CI: 14.75–72.46), and malignant hyperthermia (OR = 25.23; 95% CI: 8.62–73.83), with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.877.

Conclusion

This study provides vital pharmacovigilance insights regarding NMS related to AAPs, enhancing the understanding of its clinical implications.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in Huntington disease [^114MMAvF]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

HD patients have increased risk of developing NMS due to progressive dysregulation of dopaminergic pathways and hypothalamic degeneration. The prevalence of NMS in this population is unknown, mostly due to underdiagnoses and underreporting of atypical presentations, and partly to the masking effects of HD symptoms. Systematic recording of adverse events and thorough investigation of unexplained fevers are essential to increase sensitivity to this condition. Finally, the data highlight the importance of careful review and management of medications throughout the disease course, avoiding abrupt changes, and addressing clinical risk factors such as dehydration and malnutrition to reduce the risk of NMS in HD patients. Regular monitoring and a multidisciplinary approach are essential for effective prevention and control of NMS.

### Managing an effective treatment for neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^116xFwjP]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Although the origin of NMS remains unknown, a reduction in dopaminergic activity in the brain, probably by dopamine D2-receptor blockade in the striatum and hypothalamus, is generally assumed as its cause. Nevertheless, other theories about its pathophysiology have been raised, including a disturbance of glutamate or serotonin receptors, central hyponatremia, overreaction of the sympathetic nerve system, as well as a kind of acute-phase reaction. However, these theories are able to explain neither the symptoms mentioned above nor the low incidence rate between less than 0.1% and 2.5% of all patients treated with neuroleptic medication.

Therefore, a therapeutic approach inevitably seems to be through trial rather than evidence-based. It is generally agreed that it is of highest importance to identify the syndrome, suddenly withdraw the offending agent, and entertain supportive therapy as rehydration and restoring electrolyte balance. Because anticholinergics anticipate diaphoresis, they should be avoided. In regard to special treatment, several therapeutic options have been established. In addition to bromocriptine and other dopamine D2-receptor agonists, dantrolene sodium has been recommended predominantly in the past. Dantrolene is a peripheral muscle relaxant, which inhibits the intracellular calcium release from the sarcoplasmatic reticulum. It was originally applied to treat cases of malignant hyperthermia. It was first mentioned in 1981 as a treatment of NMS and since then has been employed with more or less success. Nevertheless, dantrolene therapy is still considered the treatment of first choice in current pharmacologic and psychiatric textbooks as well as in recent publications. Some authors have suggested a positive central effect of dantrolene in cases of NMS. Since the mid-1980s, the benefit of specific treatment with dantrolene has been controversial. No significant benefit or even a shortened course of recovery from NMS through single dantrolene therapy, compared to supportive therapy alone, could be observed. In fact, failures of dantrolene therapy have been documented in several case reports. as well as in relatively large samples.

Taking into account the low incidence rate of NMS, a randomized, controlled, and double-blinded prospective study did not seem to be feasible. Therefore, the aim of this study was to prove the efficacy of dantrolene therapy by a review of published cases and a complete review of the literature.

### Association between selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, second-generation antipsychotics, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^111uQkiU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the published reports of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and second-generation antipsychotics.

Data Source

Information was selected from a MEDLINE search of English-language literature (1950-May 2008). Manual search of all published cases indexed in MEDLINE (English language only) of NMS associated with second-generation antipsychotics was also performed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Pertinent information from all reports obtained was included, with specific emphasis on patient age, sex, second-generation antipsychotic involved, SSRI or other antidepressant involved, time of onset of NMS symptoms in relation to medication changes, treatment administered, and outcome of the reaction.

Data Synthesis

NMS has been reported with every second-generation antipsychotic agent. It is unclear whether concomitant therapy with other agents may increase the risk of NMS development via pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms or both. The suggested pharmacodynamic mechanism for increased risk of NMS with concomitant use of SSRIs is the effect of serotonin on dopamine release. Serotonin further inhibits dopamine release and thereby may worsen a hypodopaminergic state induced by antipsychotics. Pharmacokinetic factors may also play a role in some NMS cases involving an SSRI by increasing antipsychotic concentrations. An examination of case reports seems to indicate that at least in some cases, a temporal relationship exists with the addition of an SSRI to existing antipsychotic therapy.

Conclusions

The use of SSRIs may be associated with an increased risk of NMS development in those receiving second-generation antipsychotics. Clinicians should closely monitor patients for the potential development of NMS.

What are the possible side effects of metoclopramide?

Metoclopramide can cause serious side effects, including:

Abnormal muscle movements. See the section " What is the most important information I should know about metoclopramide? "
Uncontrolled spasms of your face and neck muscles, or muscles of your body, arms, and legs (dystonia). These muscle spasms can cause abnormal movements and body positions. These spasms usually start within the first 2 days of treatment. These spasms happen more often in children and adults under age 30.
Depression, thoughts about suicide, and suicide. Some people who take metoclopramide become depressed. You may have thoughts about hurting or killing yourself. Some people who take metoclopramide have ended their own lives (suicide).
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). NMS is a very rare but very serious condition that can happen with metoclopramide. NMS can cause death and must be treated in a hospital. Symptoms of NMS include: high fever, stiff muscles, problems thinking, very fast or uneven heartbeat, and increased sweating.
Parkinsonism. Symptoms include slight shaking, body stiffness, trouble moving or keeping your balance. If you already have Parkinson's disease, your symptoms may become worse while you are receiving metoclopramide.

### Promethazine hydrochloride [^115YgDwf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with promethazine hydrochloride alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of promethazine hydrochloride, antipsychotic drugs, if any, and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

Since recurrences of NMS have been reported with phenothiazines, the reintroduction of promethazine hydrochloride should be carefully considered.

### Conceptualizing the relationship between synthetic cannabinoid use and neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^114gSogp]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DISCUSSION

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) is a well‐known side effect of potentially all antipsychotics, as antagonism of dopamine receptors lead to drops in neurotransmitter activity within dopaminergic pathways. It has a textbook triad of fever, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status (AMS), but in clinical practice, the majority of cases actually present heterogeneously. Similarly, synthetic cannabinoids (SC) possess a widely varying drug profile, due to the vast number of derivatives sold. In recent years, SC have become increasingly popular due to their lower cost, easy obtainability and non‐detectability on traditional drug screens. This is of increasing concern, due to their vastly more unpredictable, severe side‐effects compared to cannabis‐ zero fatalities have been seen with cannabis toxicity, while many have been reported due to SC. Psychiatrically, SC has been show to drastically exacerbate certain conditions including schizophrenia, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. For psychosis in particular, it has been shown that SC use serves as an agonist at cannabinoid type‐1 receptors in the brain, leading to acute increases in dopamine.

### Managing an effective treatment for neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^112Bhgob]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Due to the different severity grades of NMS at baseline, mortality alone, which was examined as a predictor of the benefit of various medical treatments, does not seem to be sufficient to draw conclusions about the efficacy of each treatment. Therefore, other important variables such as effectiveness within 24 hours and complete time of remission were also examined.

Based on the findings of our analysis, dantrolene does not seem to be the evidence-based treatment of choice in cases of NMS, which seems to be in accordance with some single-case reports. Nevertheless, there is also no evidence to explicitly deny a benefit of a dantrolene therapy. In some cases, dantrolene was very successfully used after some other vain treatment trials or after a period of time with only supportive treatment. The latter might also be contradictory to the argument that time by itself leads to improvement.

Further investigations are still needed to discover both the etiopathology of NMS and its causal treatment. A promising approach might be the further exploration of possible central effects of dantrolene, which is still known as a peripheral muscle relaxant.

However, due to the low incidence of NMS, large prospective studies will be difficult to conduct, so further investigations will likely have to rely on case reports again. The success of such analyses most likely will depend on the accuracy, uniformity, and completeness of these reports.

Pharmacological risk factors for the development of NMS include high neuroleptic dosage, high rate of dose increase, and parenteral administration. In regard to clinical risk factors, the available information is limited. It has been suggested that the recognition of an acute catatonic or disorganized syndrome is important in preventing NMS.

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride (Reglan) [^116XrRVr]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

Metoclopramide may cause a potentially fatal symptom complex called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS has been reported in association with metoclopramide overdosage and concomitant treatment with another drug associated with NMS. Avoid Reglan in patients receiving other drugs associated with NMS, including typical and atypical antipsychotics.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and manifestations of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac arrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Patients with such symptoms should be evaluated immediately.

In the diagnostic evaluation, consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever, serotonin syndrome, and primary central nervous system pathology.

Management of NMS includes:

Immediate discontinuation of Reglan and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring.
Treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available.

5.4 Depression

Depression has occurred in metoclopramide-treated patients with and without a history of depression. Symptoms have included suicidal ideation and suicide. Avoid Reglan use in patients with a history of depression.

5.5 Hypertension

Metoclopramide may elevate blood pressure. In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines; hence, avoid use in patients with hypertension or in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

There are also clinical reports of hypertensive crises in patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytoma. Reglan is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue Reglan in any patient with a rapid rise in blood pressure.

5.6 Fluid Retention

Because Reglan produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, patients with cirrhosis or congestive heart failure may be at risk of developing fluid retention and volume overload. Discontinue Reglan if any of these adverse reactions occur.

Regarding specific circumstances for catatonia, more specifically with respect to patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend to provide supportive care with assessment and appropriate management of airway, ventilation, temperature, and swallowing in patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Monitor fluid input/output and initiate aggressive fluid resuscitation when required. Assess patients for hyperkalemia, renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. Obtain careful monitoring for complications such as cardiorespiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, thromboembolism, and renal failure, alongside early consideration of high-dependency care.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

Falls

Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets may cause somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, complete fall risk assessments when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome following reintroduction of an antipsychotic after overdose [^1138F7Uo]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of NMS can be considered a complex cascade of dysregulation of multiple neurochemical and neuroendocrine systems, culminating in an end-stage hypermetabolic syndrome. A central dopaminergic blockade theory has been proposed to explain NMS involving striatal and hypothalamic dopamine receptors. There is also evidence to suggest that dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system may account for, at least some of, the features of NMS. Finally, more recently a neuroimmunological explanation of NMS has been proposed, implicating the role of proinflammatory cytokines. In our case report, the elevation of fibrinogen (an acute phase protein) is consistent with this later hypothesis, with the patient's dehydration potentially acting as an inflammatory stimulus.

This case report highlights the importance of recognising that patients may develop NMS several years after starting antipsychotic therapy. Furthermore, NMS may occur any time, but particularly in the presence of additional risk factors, such as dehydration. ARF in the presence NMS is associated with a mortality risk of approximately 50%, therefore, it is vital that clinicians are vigilant for evidence of dehydration in patients treated with antipsychotics.

Patient's perspective

The ECT allowed me to resume activities that I had not been doing for several years as dancing, seeing friends, playing cards and improved substantially my quality of life.

Learning points

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a serious and potentially lethal adverse drug reaction.
NMS is unpredictable but is related to the administration of dopamine antagonists.
NMS can be best described as a complex cascade of multiple dysregulated neurochemical and neuroendocrine systems, potentially culminating in an end-stage hypermetabolic syndrome.
Risk factors for NMS, such as dehydration as well as renal and hepatic impairment, should be considered prior to, and during treatment with antipsychotics.

### Amoxapine [^114X2uRJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to neuroleptic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on neuroleptics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Contemporary perspectives in critical care of neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^114HmMgd]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a psychiatric-neurologic emergency that may require intensive care management. There is a paucity of information about NMS as a critical illness. We reviewed the Mayo Clinic experience.

Methods

A comprehensive data extraction was completed within the Mayo Clinic system diagnosed with NMS using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9); ICD-9, Clinical Modification; ICD-10; ICD-10, Clinical Modification; and Health Insurance Claim (HIC) codes between the years of 1995 and 2023. Major criteria included fever, rigidity, tachycardia, and exposure to a neuroleptic agent. Minor criteria included rhabdomyolysis and dysautonomia. Criteria for exclusion were Parkinson's disease, abrupt discontinuation of baclofen or levodopa, concomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use or serotonin syndrome, malignant catatonia, or a classic dystonic reaction.

Results

A total of 332 patients had diagnostic codes of NMS, but only 20 patients fulfilled DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision), diagnostic criteria. The average age was 48.2 years (range 20–93 years). Four patients received antipsychotics following postoperative acute agitation or delirium (20%). Previous psychiatric diagnoses were schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in six patients (33%), major depressive disorder in five patients (20%), and bipolar disorder in two patients (10%). Haloperidol was the sole inciting neuroleptic in five patients (25%), but the remainder was associated with atypical or second-generation antipsychotics. A total of nine patients (45%) required mechanical ventilation. The majority of patients had rhabdomyolysis, which led to acute kidney failure in nearly half of them, but none required hemodialysis. Most patients recovered promptly, and no fatalities were directly attributable to NMS; however, four patients (20%) died within 1 month, and four patients died years from diagnosis and unrelated to NMS.

Conclusions

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome can become a critical illness, but there is often rapid recovery. Mortality proximate to NMS was uncommon, but late mortality remained substantial. The overwhelming majority of cases coded as NMS did not meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Stricter criteria should be applied when diagnosing NMS in critical care and emergency medicine settings.

### Serotonin syndrome versus neuroleptic malignant syndrome: a challenging clinical quandary [^111DkLh7]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome are two drug toxidromes that have often overlapping and confusing clinical pictures. We report a case of a young man who presented with alteration of mental status, autonomic instability and neuromuscular hyperexcitability following ingestion of multiple psychiatric and antiepileptic medications. The patient satisfied criteria for serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and based on the characteristic clinical features, laboratory findings and clinical course it was concluded that the patient had both toxidromes. The patient was managed with cyproheptadine and supportive measures, and recovered over the course of 3 weeks. A brief review of literature highlighting the diagnostic clues as well as the importance of recognising and distinguishing the often missed and confounding diagnoses follows.

### Risperidone (Risperdal CONSTA) [^116iGxrD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear.

RISPERDAL CONSTA (risperidone) is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning].

5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Cerebrovascular adverse events (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age 85 years; range 73–97) in trials of oral risperidone in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with oral risperidone compared to patients treated with placebo. RISPERDAL CONSTA is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis. [See also Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue RISPERDAL CONSTA and provide symptomatic treatment and monitoring.

5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) may occur with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Rare cases of NMS occurred during aripiprazole treatment in the worldwide clinical database. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia).

### Metoclopramide hydrochloride (Gimoti) [^1128ao7w]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

Metoclopramide may cause a potentially fatal symptom complex called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS has been reported in association with metoclopramide overdosage and concomitant treatment with another drug associated with NMS. Avoid GIMOTI in patients receiving other drugs associated with NMS, including typical and atypical antipsychotics.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and manifestations of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac arrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Patients with such symptoms should be evaluated immediately.

In the diagnostic evaluation, consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever, serotonin syndrome, and primary central nervous system pathology.

Management of NMS includes:

Immediate discontinuation of GIMOTI and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring.
Treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available.

5.4 Depression

Depression has occurred in metoclopramide-treated patients with and without a history of depression. Symptoms have included suicidal ideation and suicide. Avoid GIMOTI use in patients with a history of depression.

5.5 Hypertension

Metoclopramide may elevate blood pressure. In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines; hence, avoid GIMOTI use in patients with hypertension or in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

There are also clinical reports of hypertensive crises in patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytoma. GIMOTI is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue GIMOTI in any patient with a rapid rise in blood pressure.

5.6 Fluid Retention

Because metoclopramide produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, patients with cirrhosis or congestive heart failure may be at risk of developing fluid retention and volume overload. Discontinue GIMOTI if any of these adverse reactions occur.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome during a change from haloperidol to risperidone [^114xRHeT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in a patient whose therapy was being switched from haloperidol to risperidone.

Case Report

A 57-year-old African-American man, treated for schizophrenia with haloperidol for several years, developed NMS within 48 hours of the addition of low doses of risperidone and mirtazapine to his regimen. Symptoms, which included fever, generalized rigidity, and altered mental status, resolved after discontinuation of psychotropics, supportive management, and several weeks of treatment with bromocriptine and dantrolene. He was subsequently treated with olanzapine without adverse effects.

Discussion

Several cases of NMS have been reported with risperidone, but none under these circumstances. NMS most likely occurred in this patient as a result of the additive dopamine 2 receptor blocking of haloperidol and risperidone. Sympathetic hyperactivity secondary to mirtazapine may also have been a contributing factor. If NMS may be induced by the simultaneous use of older, high-potency antipsychotics and newer, atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, switching patients from older to newer antipsychotics may at times be difficult, since completely stopping one antipsychotic before starting the second may place patients at risk for psychotic relapse.

Conclusions

Clinicians should closely monitor patients receiving both haloperidol and risperidone or combinations of similar medications.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome from central nervous system insult: 4 cases and a novel treatment strategy. clinical article [^112uBjCd]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially life-threatening entity characterized by hyperthermia, autonomic deregulation, decreased mental status, increased muscle tone, and, frequently, by renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis. Classically, it follows administration of antipsychotic medication. The authors report on 4 patients (2 children and 2 adults) in whom NMS was diagnosed after a CNS insult. No patient was receiving antipsychotic medication. The patients' hospital and clinic charts, radiographic data, and follow-up telephone conversations were reviewed retrospectively. All 4 patients met diagnostic criteria for NMS. Three patients presented with shunt failure, and 1 patient had undergone a functional hemispherectomy 2 days earlier. One patient with shunt failure received the diagnosis retrospectively. An endoscopic third ventriculostomy alleviated his shunt failure and he remains free of NMS. The other 2 patients underwent treatment for shunt failure, but NMS remained. These 2 patients and the one who had undergone hemispherectomy underwent a trial of intrathecal baclofen, and the NMS resolved. Subsequently, an intrathecal baclofen infusion device was placed in all 3 patients, and the NMS resolved. The 2 patients in shunt failure had a lumbar intrathecal baclofen infusion device. The patient who had undergone hemispherectomy had an intracranial baclofen catheter. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare, life-threatening disorder that can occur without the administration of neuroleptic medications. Alleviation of any CNS insult is the first order of treatment. Some patients with persistent symptoms of NMS may benefit from intrathecal delivery of baclofen.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in Huntington disease [^11332BD6]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Huntington disease (HD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative chorea in adults, caused by an autosomal dominant inherited CAG trinucleotide expansion in the gene HTT (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man: 613004) that encodes for the huntingtin protein on chromosome 4. HD is characterized by striatal degeneration that leads to thalamocortical hyperactivation due to an imbalance in the dopaminergic striatal pathway. Additionally, in HD early hypothalamic degeneration occurs, as shown by postmortem studies and neuroimaging studies through brain magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed gray matter density loss in the hypothalamus occurring up to 1 decade before clinical diagnosis. Through positron emission tomography studies, using a D2–D3 receptor‐specific tracer and a marker of microglial activation, Politis et al. demonstrated the downregulation of D2 and/or D3 receptors in the hypothalamus. These findings partly explain the dysautonomic symptoms (e.g. thermoregulatory defect) along with dysregulation of wake–sleep cycle, increased thirst and hunger, progressive weight loss, and endocrine dysfunction.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is characterized by central hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic nervous system instability, and changes in mental status. The most used diagnostic criteria for NMS are outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DMS‐5; Table 1). Disrupted dopamine transmission is pivotal in the pathogenesis of NMS. Dopamine depletion in the tuberoinfundibular pathway causes body temperature dysregulation, and its effect on the nigrostriatal system results in rigidity; alterations in the mesocortical circuit impact mental status. The circuits are not always involved at the same degree, and NMS may have atypical presentations (more frequently caused by second‐generation antipsychotics) without hyperthermia or rigidity.

TABLE 1
Diagnostic criteria for neuroleptic malignant syndrome based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.

Dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) and tetrabenazine (TBZ) are commonly used in treating hyperkinetic movement disorders, including HD. NMS is a rare side effect of DRBAs, but other compounds affecting dopaminergic transmission such as TBZ have also been linked to this condition. It remains uncertain whether the risk of developing NMS in patients with HD is higher compared to the general population. The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of NMS in a large cohort of HD patients and describe its clinical characteristics and associated risk factors in cases reported in the literature and in our case report.

### A rating scale for neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^117Tkudt]. Psychiatry Research (2005). Low credibility.

The development of a rating scale for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is described. The clinical and laboratory features of NMS were categorised into six domains after a thorough literature review and examination of patients. The reliability of this scale was established on 25 NMS patients and 50 control subjects based on chart reviews. A factor analysis supported a six-factor solution. The validity of the scale was indicated by the relationship of the severity rating to duration of illness and outcome. The inter-rater reliability of the scale was established prospectively in 10 subjects. The scale offers a measure of severity of NMS in the clinical setting so as to support the clinical diagnosis, monitor patients and determine their progress. The scale may be applicable not only to NMS or suspected NMS but also to NMS-like syndromes such as lethal catatonia.

### Haloperidol decanoate (Haldol decanoate) [^115mBHPX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

Hyperpyrexia and heat stroke, not associated with the above symptom complex, have also been reported with HALDOL.

Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies

Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity with haloperidol treatment include severe extrapyramidal symptoms, confusion, sedation, and falls. In addition, haloperidol may impair the antiparkinson effects of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. HALDOL decanoate is contraindicated in patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions with haloperidol. These include anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, dermatitis exfoliative, hypersensitivity vasculitis, rash, urticaria, face edema, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Regarding specific circumstances for catatonia, more specifically with respect to patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, BAP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering bilateral electroconvulsive therapy thrice weekly in patients with persisting clinical features until neuroleptic malignant syndrome abates. Consider offering bilateral electroconvulsive therapy once daily or BID in severe cases. Continue electroconvulsive therapy thrice weekly until sustained improvement (a total of 5–20 treatments).

### Mortality of neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs: a propensity-matched analysis from the Japanese diagnosis procedure combination database [^111gZcxB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by atypical antipsychotics presents atypical clinical manifestations with fewer symptoms compared with neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by typical antipsychotics. However, any differences in prognosis between these 2 types of drug-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome remain unknown. We examined neuroleptic malignant syndrome-related mortality in patients treated with typical or atypical antipsychotics by using a national administrative claims database.

Method

Data of patients with a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome between July and December in each of the 5 years from 2004 to 2008 were extracted from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. Data included patient background, use of antipsychotics, and in-hospital mortality. Propensity score matching was performed to formulate a balanced 1:1 matched study and to compare in-hospital mortality between neuroleptic malignant syndrome patients taking typical antipsychotics and those taking atypical antipsychotics.

Results

We identified 423 neuroleptic malignant syndrome patients treated with typical antipsychotics and 215 neuroleptic malignant syndrome patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Matching based on propensity scores produced 210 patients in each drug group. In-hospital mortality was substantially lower in the atypical antipsychotic group compared with the typical antipsychotic group, but the difference was not significant (3.3% vs 7.6%; OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.17–1.11; p = 0.084).

Conclusions

The results show that neuroleptic malignant syndrome remains a life threatening disease among patients receiving antipsychotics. A tendency for lower mortality in the atypical antipsychotic group may reflect differences in the pathophysiology. However, to clarify whether there is a difference in neuroleptic malignant syndrome-related mortality with the 2 types of antipsychotics, further studies with larger samples are needed.

### Risk factors, incidence, and outcomes of neuroleptic malignant syndrome on long-acting injectable vs oral antipsychotics in a nationwide schizophrenia cohort [^111BXGRg]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are associated with multiple positive outcomes in psychosis, but it is unclear whether LAIs are associated with worse outcomes if neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a potentially lethal adverse effect, occurs.

Methods

We used nationwide and nationally representative databases of healthcare encounters in Finland to study the incidence and outcome predictors of NMS in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder between January 01, 1972 and December 31, 2017. Using a nested case-control design, we also explored differences by antipsychotic formulation (LAI vs oral antipsychotic [OAP]) and class (first-generation antipsychotic [FGA] vs second-generation antipsychotic [SGA]).

Results

One hundred seventy-two NMS cases and 1441 sex-, age-, and diagnosis-matched controls were included (age = 58.8 ± 13.1 years, males = 59.9%). Incidence of NMS was 1.99 (1.98–2.00) per 10000 person-years. The likelihood of developing NMS did not differ by antipsychotic formulation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.89, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 0.59–1.33, for LAIs vs OAPs) or class (FGA-OAP vs SGA-OAP [aOR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.66–1.76], FGA-LAI [aOR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.52–1.53], SGA-LAI [aOR: 1.35, 95% CI: 0.58–3.12]). NMS risk factors included antipsychotic treatment change: increased number (odds ratios [OR]: 5.00, 95% CI: 2.56–9.73); decreased number/switch (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.19–4.96); higher antipsychotic dose (> 2DDDs-OR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.61–6.18); co-treatment with anticholinergics (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.57–3.24), lithium (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.30–3.58), benzodiazepines (OR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.44–3.58); and comorbid cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.22–2.45). Within 30 days, 4.7% of cases with NMS died (15.1% within 1 year) without differences by antipsychotic formulation. NMS reoccurred in 5 of 119 subjects (4.2%), after a median = 795 (range = 77–839) days after rechallenge with antipsychotics.

Conclusion

NMS remains a potentially life-threatening risk, yet these results should further contribute to mitigate concerns about LAI safety regarding NMS onset or outcomes, including mortality.

### A case report of neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^116wNxRS]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old male patient with a history of treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenia developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) during changeover of his antipsychotic medication from zuclopenthixol depot to clozapine.

### Risperidone [^115hVBTZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe risperidone.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

Counsel patients about a potentially fatal adverse reaction, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), that has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Advise patients, family members, or caregivers to contact the healthcare provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs and symptoms of NMS, including hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Tardive Dyskinesia

Counsel patients on the signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia and to contact their healthcare provider if these abnormal movements occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Metabolic Changes

Educate patients about the risk of metabolic changes, how to recognize symptoms of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus, and the need for specific monitoring, including blood glucose, lipids, and weight [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Orthostatic Hypotension

Educate patients about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, particularly at the time of initiating treatment, re-initiating treatment, or increasing the dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome versus serotonin syndrome: the search for a diagnostic tool [^114kXooF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of urine dopamine and catecholamine concentrations as diagnostic aids in a patient with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in the emergency department setting.

Case Summary

A 61-year-old female on multiple medications, including several antipsychotics, rapidly deteriorated, with fever, lead-pipe rigidity, and decreased level of consciousness. The patient died 20 days after initial presentation to an emergency department. The Naranjo probability scale indicated probable causality for NMS due to quetiapine, haloperidol, and risperidone in this patient, whereas the Naranjo scale assigned only possible causality for serotonin syndrome developing with serotonergic agents. Laboratory investigations of blood and urine revealed elevations in dopamine, metanephrines, and epinephrines, as well as trazodone and risperidone. Serotonin metabolites were not elevated.

Discussion

NMS is a rare and potentially severe adverse effect associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. It is mainly characterized by hyperthermia, altered mental state, hemodynamic dysregulation, elevated serum creatine kinase, and rigors. It has been associated with multisystem organ failure potentially leading to rhabdomyolysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The prevalence of this syndrome is associated with the use of neuroleptics. Serotonin syndrome is another adverse drug reaction leading to NMS associated with elevated serotonin. It occurs when multiple serotonergic medications are ingested and is associated with rapid onset of altered mental status, myoclonus, and autonomic instability. Differentiating between NMS and serotonin syndrome can be challenging because of their similar clinical presentation. This case highlights the importance of a diagnostic aid being available to help distinguish between the 2 syndromes.

Conclusions

We propose that laboratory findings that include dopamine and serotonin metabolites can be used as adjuncts to clinical and prescription histories in the diagnosis of NMS. The use of urinary catecholamine as a diagnostic aid in NMS needs further evaluation.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with metoclopramide in a burn patient [^1133EwET]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2006). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon, potentially fatal syndrome that occurs with the use of neuroleptic medications. In view of the rarity of this syndrome and the overlap with the pathophysiologic manifestations of a burn, the burn surgeon may not readily recognize NMS on presentation. We describe the case of a 27-year-old man with 15% TBSA burns who developed NMS as a result of metoclopramide use. Recognition and treatment resulted in a prompt resolution of symptoms. Initial treatment should include immediate withdrawal of all neuroleptic agents, measures aimed at decreasing body temperature, supportive care, and restoration of dopamine balance. Various authors have advocated treatment with various medications, including benzodiazepines, dantrolene, and dopaminergic agents. It is important for burn unit personnel to be aware of this syndrome because the early institution of therapy can be life saving.

### Antipsychotics leading to neuroleptic malignant syndrome in pregnancy [^114qq7jV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is characterized by a tetrad of mental status changes, extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperpyrexia, and autonomic instability and can develop after the use of antipsychotics.

Case

A young, multiparous woman presented at 26 weeks of gestation with acute psychosis and was treated with haloperidol until she developed rigidity of her extremities and then was switched to risperidone. She subsequently developed mental status changes, rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability, leading to a diagnosis of NMS. Risperidone was discontinued and, owing to ongoing psychosis, olanzapine was initiated. Subsequently, her symptoms resolved.

Conclusion

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome may complicate the treatment of pregnant women using antipsychotics. Clinicians should take into account the risks of untreated psychosis when discontinuing the offending agent and consider initiating alternative pharmacotherapy.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in Huntington disease [^111wBYgW]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The loss of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors in the basal ganglia and in the hypothalamus may expose HD patients undergoing treatment with DRBA or/and TBZ to an increased risk of developing NMS. However, according to the available data, it is unclear whether the prevalence of this condition is higher in these individuals compared to the general population. In the Enroll‐HD dataset, only one of 5108 HD patients treated with DRBAs and/or TBZ was diagnosed with NMS, while undergoing treatment with clozapine. In this database, all psychiatric events that lead to hospitalization are systematically collected (suicide attempts, suicide, mental health events including depression, psychotic disorders, aggression). Despite the frequent use of antipsychotics and TBZ to treat both motor and psychotic symptoms, the adverse events associated with these therapies, including NMS, are not systematically reported. Furthermore, it is important to note that some patients, mostly those treated with second‐generation neuroleptic agents and/or TBZ, may present an atypical form of NMS (i.e. hyperthermia without rigidity), overlooked due to the incomplete manifestation of symptoms. For instance, five HD patients treated with DRBAs and/or TBZ reported unspecified fever, raising the possibility of an atypical form of NMS. Another potential reason for a missed diagnosis is that hyperkinetic movements such as chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, or a pre‐existing rigidity may mask tardive motor side effects. Therefore, systematically recording adverse events related to neuroleptic treatment would help avoid underestimation and underdiagnosis of this dangerous condition. Unexplained fevers should be thoroughly investigated and categorized to ensure they are not a result of the medications used. For instance, in the Enroll‐HD PDS5 dataset, we found the term "neuroleptic malignant syndrome" in the "comorbidity" section, reported as an episode that occurred before dataset registration and not in the "events" section, which included reasons for hospitalization. The main reported reasons for hospitalization include psychiatric causes, suicide, or suicide attempts but other events are not systematically described, including NMS, which is a rare but potential cause of hospitalization. This can partly explain the very low rate of NMS diagnosis in the dataset.

### Toxicology and overdose of atypical antipsychotics [^114iZ8La]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Second-generation antipsychotic medications, or "atypical antipsychotics", are now first-line therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, and are additionally being used in a wide array of other psychiatric and non-psychiatric conditions in both adults and children. Overdose is frequently reported to poison control centers.

Objectives

We review the toxicology and general management of poisonings involving the atypical antipsychotic medications.

Discussion

The most serious toxicity involves the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system. All typical and atypical antipsychotics cause sedation, which is pronounced in overdose. The most common cardiovascular effects that occur after atypical antipsychotic overdose are tachycardia, mild hypotension, and prolongation of the QTc interval. Other clinical syndromes in overdose include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and antimuscarinic delirium. Seizures may be observed. No antidotes exist for these poisonings, but they most often do well with supportive care.

Conclusion

Antipsychotic overdose produces a gamut of manifestations that affect multiple organ systems. Treatment is primarily supportive. Specific therapies for NMS, hypotension, and seizures are discussed.

### Neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome causing thrombocytopaenia: a rare association [^115emJcG]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal complication of sudden withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs. Clinical features are similar to that of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) like hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction, altered sensorium, muscle rigidity; but instead of history of neuroleptic use, there is history of withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs. Laboratory examination generally show elevated creatine phosphokinase levels and may show elevated total leucocyte count. Thrombocytopaenia has been very rarely reported with NMS but it has not been reported with NM-like syndrome. Here, we discuss a case of Parkinson's disease which presented with typical clinical features and risk factors of NM-like syndrome associated with thrombocytopaenia and type 1 respiratory failure. He was treated with bromocriptine and supportive care. Thrombocytopaenia and respiratory failure resolved with above treatment. The patient improved clinically and was successfully discharged on day 12 of admission.

### Promethazine hydrochloride and phenylephrine hydrochloride (promethazine VC) [^115HVctd]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome –

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with promethazine HCl alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of promethazine HCl, antipsychotic drugs, if any, and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

Since recurrences of NMS have been reported with phenothiazines, the reintroduction of promethazine HCl should be carefully considered.

### Haloperidol-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome complicated by hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [^1161JtdS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening neurologic emergency that may be caused by neuroleptic agents of any class. The association with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is rare and carries a grave prognosis. We describe the case of a 25-year-old male patient with haloperidol-induced NMS complicated by HHS that culminated in the patient's death despite all treatment efforts. Physicians caring for diabetic psychiatric patients who are treated with neuroleptic agents should be aware of this association that may be prevented by tight glycemic control.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in pregnancy [^111Ec9NS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome can be a serious neurologic complication of drug therapy during pregnancy.

Case

A young woman was admitted to the intensive care unit with worsening varicella pneumonia. After being given haldol for agitation, she developed fever, increasing agitation, rigidity, tachycardia, and tremors; she was diagnosed as having neuroleptic malignant syndrome. She was treated successfully with bromocriptine and dantrolene.

Conclusion

Despite the common use of antipsychotic medications, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is seen infrequently during pregnancy. The diagnosis can be difficult to make, but if suspected, it can be treated successfully.

### Risperidone (Rykindo) [^113ibxhw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients that was 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5% versus about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear.

RYKINDO is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age 85 years; range 73 to 97) in trials of oral risperidone in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with oral risperidone compared to patients treated with placebo. RYKINDO is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

NMS, a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue RYKINDO and provide symptomatic treatment and monitoring.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (parcopa) [^113pBzu4]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling NMS have been reported in association with dose reductions or withdrawal of therapy with carbidopa-levodopa. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of PARCOPA®is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.

NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia. Neurological findings, including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes; other disturbances, such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension; laboratory findings, such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin have been reported.

The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses

(e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene, are often used in the treatment of NMS, however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in Huntington disease [^116mHLTk]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Despite the wide use of dopamine receptor blocking agents (DRBAs) in Huntington disease (HD), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is rarely described in this population. The aim of this study was to assess NMS prevalence in a large cohort of HD patients and explore the main associated risk factors.

Methods

In 2023, an HD patient was admitted to our neurology department due to NMS. Starting from the case description, we performed a narrative review of the literature of NMS cases in HD, reviewed data from the fifth dataset of the Enroll-HD (a longitudinal, observational, global study of families with HD) study (PDS5) selecting HD patients treated with DRBAs and/or tetrabenazine (TBZ) who presented at least one of the core symptoms of NMS (rigidity and hyperthermia), and collected data to investigate prevalence of NMS and identify risk factors.

Results

In the Enroll-HD PDS5 dataset, we identified 5108 of 11,569 HD patients who were undergoing DRBA and/or TBZ treatment. Only one patient, a Caucasian man of 46years, undergoing clozapine and valproate treatment, had a registered diagnosis of NMS.

Conclusions

NMS in HD patients is seldom described. This could be due to an underestimation of this condition. There are no available objective NMS diagnostic criteria at present, and the existence of atypical forms of NMS further complicates diagnosis. Advanced disease stage, rigid-akinetic phenotype, abrupt therapy changes, polytherapy, and dehydration are key risk factors, most of which are preventable through awareness and caution in managing medications in the HD population.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with the use of prochlorperazine in a patient with a recent history of antipsychotic-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^114rThbf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with the use of prochlorperazine in a patient recently hospitalized for NMS secondary to olanzapine.

Case Summary

A 28-year-old African American male with a history of schizophrenia was hospitalized 22 days prior to the current admission for an episode of olanzapine-induced NMS. The patient was discharged from our hospital to an outside psychiatric facility. At this facility, the patient developed nausea and was given 2 doses (unknown amount and route) of prochlorperazine. Over the next 24 hours, the patient exhibited signs and symptoms of NMS including fever, agitation, and muscle rigidity. He was transported to the emergency department and became increasingly agitated. Upon admission, the patient was hyperthermic (rectal temperature 39 °C) and tachycardic (heart rate 138 beats/min), with an elevated white blood cell count of 13.5 × 10³/μL, creatine kinase 431 units/L, serum sodium 150 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.1 mg/dL. A diagnosis of NMS was speculated and infectious causes were excluded. The patient was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and rapid cooling measures, as well as bromocriptine and lorazepam. Cooling measures were used for 48 hours, during which time the creatine kinase, white blood cell count, sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine gradually normalized. The patient was discharged to a psychiatry facility with a treatment regimen of oxcarbazepine 600 mg twice daily, lorazepam 2 mg 3 times daily, and clozapine 25 mg at bedtime, which was titrated over 2 months to 200 mg twice daily. There have been no further occurrences of NMS.

Discussion

The patient had all of the major characteristics of NMS with no other likely causative factors that may have contributed to his illness. Use of the Naranjo probability scale suggested that NMS was probably related to prochlorperazine. This case highlights the potential increased risk with the use of prochlorperazine in a patient with a history of olanzapine-induced NMS.

Conclusions

NMS should be considered as a rare complication of therapy with antipsychotics and agents that alter dopamine activity, especially in patients with a history of the syndrome. Careful consideration should be given regarding the risks and benefits of using non-antipsychotic dopamine antagonists in patients with a history of antipsychotic-induced NMS.

### Haloperidol (haloperidol lactate) [^116Tu3Nd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

### Emergency management of agitation in schizophrenia [^117VofyE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a common psychiatric condition, affecting approximately 1% of the population. Acute emergent presentations often include hallucinations, delusions, thought, and speech disorders. Agitation is common among emergency patients with schizophrenia. Decisional capacity should be assessed in all patients. Reversible causes of agitation should be ruled out, including infection, metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, trauma, pain, noncompliance, toxicological disorders, and structural brain abnormalities. Agitation may be managed acutely using a combination of pharmacological agents and nonpharmacological interventions. Effective pharmacological agents include several classes of antipsychotic agents and benzodiazepines. Potential life-threatening complications of pharmacological therapy should be anticipated, which may include neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), prolonged QT syndrome, and respiratory depression. Nonpharmacological interventions may include a quiet environment, physical restraints, and behavioral interventions. Disposition decisions should be made based on the etiology of agitation, effective management, decisional capacity, and presence of suicidal or homicidal intentions. Many patients who have required nonpharmacological or pharmacological management of agitation require inpatient psychiatric treatment, either voluntarily or involuntarily.

### Asenapine [^115TfTTt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group.

Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Asenapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Events, Including Stroke, In Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

In placebo-controlled trials in elderly subjects with dementia, patients randomized to risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine had a higher incidence of stroke and transient ischemic attack, including fatal stroke. Asenapine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue asenapine and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring.

### Risperidone (Perseris) [^115gEktX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of 17 placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10-weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients between 1.6- to 1.7-times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear.

PERSERIS is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

5.2 Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions, Including Stroke, in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities, were reported in patients (mean age 85-years; range 73 to 97) in trials of oral risperidone in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse reactions in patients treated with oral risperidone compared to patients treated with placebo. PERSERIS is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

NMS, a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status including delirium, and autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue PERSERIS and provide symptomatic treatment and monitoring.

### Citalopram hydrobromide [^113wyS5a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like Reactions

The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)-like reactions have been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, including citalopram treatment, but particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including triptans) with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin (including MAOIs), or with antipsychotics or other dopamine antagonists. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Serotonin syndrome, in its most severe form can resemble neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which includes hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuation of vital signs, and mental status changes. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like signs and symptoms.

The concomitant use of citalopram with MAOIs intended to treat depression is contraindicated. If concomitant treatment of citalopram with a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist (triptan) is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.

The concomitant use of citalopram with serotonin precursors (such as tryptophan) is not recommended. Treatment with citalopram and any concomitant serotonergic or antidopaminergic agents, including antipsychotics, should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

### Epidemiology of tardive dyskinesia: is risk declining with modern antipsychotics? [^1153jNih]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

Second-generation antipsychotic drugs (APDs), including aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone dominate outpatient and inpatient clinical practice, having largely displaced the older neuroleptics. Modern APDs have relatively low risk for acute extrapyramidal syndromes characteristic of older neuroleptics, particularly acute dystonia and Parkinsonism, with variable risks of akathisia and the rare neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Anticipated reduction in risk of tardive dyskinesia (TD) is less well documented. Nearly 50 years after initial reports on TD, it is appropriate to reexamine the epidemiology of this potentially severe late adverse effect of long-term APD treatment in light of current research and practice. We compared recent estimates of incidence and prevalence of TD identified with some modern APDs to the epidemiology of TD in the earlier neuroleptic era. Such comparisons are confounded by complex modern APD regimens, uncommon exposure limited to a single modern APD, effects of previous exposure to typical neuroleptics, and neurological assessments that are rarely prospective or systematic. Available evidence suggests that the risk of TD may be declining, but longitudinal studies of patients never treated with traditional neuroleptics and exposed to only a single modern APD are required to quantify TD risks with specific drugs. Long-term use of APDs should continue to be based on research-supported indications, with regular specific examination for emerging TD.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome in Huntington disease [^1146xa8c]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

This paper encompasses a narrative review of the literature and the retrospective study of the data from the fifth dataset of the Enroll‐HD study (PDS5). We described the clinical presentation and potential risk factors of NMS in HD patients through a case report and through a narrative review of the literature (Table 2). For the publication of the clinical case, we received approval from the caregiver. Furthermore, we explored the prevalence of NMS in a large cohort of HD patients reported in the Enroll‐HD registry. The literature review was conducted by two authors (A.F. and B.R.), under supervision of a senior neurologist (M.P.). The search was performed on PubMed and Embase using the keywords "Huntington's disease", "neuroleptic malignant syndrome", "malignant hyperthermia/hyperpyrexia", and "tetrabenazine AND neuroleptic malignant syndrome". We included patients who satisfied the following criteria: (i) genetically confirmed diagnosis of HD; (ii) ongoing DRBA and/or TBZ treatment at the time of NMS onset; (iii) presented with hyperthermia and/or rigidity, which represent the cardinal features of NMS according to DMS‐5, thus including both typical and atypical forms. We reviewed six case reports and one case series, identifying 10 patients for whom we collected demographic and clinical data.

### Acute dystonia versus neuroleptic malignant syndrome without fever in an eight-year-old child [^113mVKM5]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but potentially fatal complication of the use of certain medications. It is being seen more often in the pediatric population because of the increasing use of both typical and atypical antipsychotics in children. Rapid recognition of NMS is important to emergency physicians because timely treatment can be life saving. Acute dystonia is also a well-known and more common adverse effect of certain types of antipsychotics, more commonly seen with the typical antipsychotics versus the atypical antipsychotics. We describe a case of a pediatric patient who developed an acute dystonic reaction versus NMS soon after starting aripiprazole. We compare this case with the other documented cases of acute dystonia and NMS after initiating aripiprazole in the pediatric population.

### Akinetic crisis and withdrawal syndromes: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^113fMosS]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The akinetic crisis represents a rare, acute, potentially life-threatening worsening of symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with fever, pronounced akinesia, rigidity, impaired consciousness, dysphagia, accompanying vegetative symptoms, possibly myoclonus or dystonia. The akinetic crisis is also often referred to "Parkinson's hyperpyrexia syndrome", "malignant syndrome", "acute akinesia" or "neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome", based on historically observed similarities with psychiatric patients on high-dose neuroleptic medication who experience fever and a severe Parkinsonian syndrome.

Historically, akinetic crisis in Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered a "withdrawal syndrome" of dopaminergic medication, in the sense of change in the regular dopaminergic medication intake, malabsorption of dopaminergic medication during diarrhea or accidental intake of anti-dopaminergic medication such as neuroleptics, although other mechanisms as dopamine-resistance during e.g. infections are also supposed to contribute. Recently, other "withdrawal syndromes" as the specific "dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome" or "deep brain stimulation withdrawal syndromes" have been described, which represent specific, own entities with slightly different symptomatology and therapeutical approaches. All acute "withdrawal syndromes" represent emergency situations in PD, which should be recognized early for immediate start of adequate therapy. Here, the evidence in terms of diagnostic criteria and treatment options of these three acute, severely disabling, specific syndromes will be reported along the current guidelines of the German Parkinson Guideline Group.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome… [^114LM7T8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE NEUROLEPTIC malignant syndrome is characterized by severe extrapyramidal dysfunction, hyperthermia, and autonomic disturbances following neuroleptic usage. 1, 2 This relatively uncommon, potentially lethal syndrome carries a mortality of 20%, yet it is largely unrecognized by physicians and most workers engaged in the neurosciences. Anticholinergic or benzodiazepine treatment, commonly used for neuroleptic neurological side effects, is usually of limited success in the treatment of NMS; a long hospital course with considerable physical disability often is a result in those patients who survive. 3 We present two patients with NMS: the first treated in the usual fashion in our medical intensive care unit, the second on our psychiatric ward, with the rapidly successful and first reported usage of bromocriptine mesylate. Report of Cases Case 1.

### Olanzapine-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome… [^112ST7PY]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a serious and potentially lethal complication that may infrequently occur in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. The main clinical features include rigidity and other extrapyramidal signs, autonomic disturbances such as hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension, altered level of consciousness, various signs of acute encephalopathy, and elevation of serum creatine kinase enzyme levels. 1 Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been associated with virtually all conventional neuroleptic agents, but is thought to be exceptional with the use of atypical neuroleptics, such as clozapine, that produce less extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia. Olanzapine is a novel, atypical neuroleptic that recently has become available worldwide and has the advantage over clozapine of inducing no agranulocytosis. Recent large studies2 have confirmed its atypical properties, and no NMS has been reported with its use.

We describe a patient with a previous episode of NMS caused by conventional neuroleptics, who developed a typical but moderately severe NMS following treatment with olanzapine.
