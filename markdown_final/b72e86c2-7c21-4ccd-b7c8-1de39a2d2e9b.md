## Question

Reactive arthritis

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about reactive arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and pathophysiology to anchor the diagnostic frame. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and genetic susceptibility, including HLA-B27 nuances. Next, I will review triggers and the latency window, and I need to check emerging associations like COVID-19. After that, I will examine the clinical phenotype and extra-articular features. Then, I should confirm the diagnostic approach, including the differential and imaging. Next, I will evaluate treatment strategies, including NSAIDs, DMARDs, biologics, and antibiotics, and I should double-check guideline positions. Finally, I will consider prognosis, special populations, and prevention, and I will synthesize a practical algorithm while noting uncertainties and controversies.

> Let me first confirm the core definition and pathophysiology so I don't misframe the problem. Reactive arthritis is a sterile inflammatory arthritis that follows an extra-articular infection, typically gastrointestinal or genitourinary, and is classified within the spondyloarthropathy spectrum; the synovium is inflamed but cultures are negative, reflecting an immune-mediated process rather than direct joint infection, with proposed mechanisms including molecular mimicry, arthritogenic peptides, and HLA-B27–restricted antigen presentation, although the exact mechanism remains incompletely defined [^111cen9S] [^111zphth] [^11729uMA].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and genetic susceptibility before I overgeneralize. Population-based data suggest reactive arthritis occurs in roughly 7–15% of individuals after relevant infections, with marked underdiagnosis in some series; HLA-B27 is present in about 50–80% of cases and confers both susceptibility and worse prognosis, yet many cases occur in HLA-B27–negative individuals, indicating additional genetic and environmental contributors, and the prevalence of HLA-B27 varies by ancestry, which affects observed associations [^1173EFJe] [^113gPfxm] [^111zphth].

> I need to check the classic infectious triggers and the latency window to avoid anchoring bias. The most common bacterial triggers are enteric pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Yersinia, and sexually acquired Chlamydia trachomatis; arthritis typically begins 1–6 weeks after the antecedent infection, and importantly, the triggering infection may be asymptomatic or already treated when arthritis appears, complicating attribution [^111cen9S] [^111YhHM6] [^114rajEQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about COVID-19. Multiple case series and reports describe new-onset inflammatory arthritis after SARS-CoV-2 infection, often labeled "COVID-19–associated arthritis". The clinical phenotype can mimic reactive arthritis with asymmetric oligoarthritis of lower limbs, but many patients are older and HLA-B27 negative, and there is no consensus on classification as true reactive arthritis versus viral arthritis, so I should be cautious and prefer the umbrella term "COVID-19–associated arthritis" until mechanistic clarity emerges [^111ua3Bb] [^1112iftd] [^115xAaCt] [^1123bEHC].

> Let me consider the clinical phenotype carefully and ensure I don't overstate the classic triad. The typical presentation is an asymmetric oligoarthritis of large lower-extremity joints such as knees, ankles, and feet, often with enthesitis and dactylitis; extra-articular features may include conjunctivitis or uveitis, urethritis or cervicitis, and mucocutaneous lesions like keratoderma blenorrhagicum and circinate balanitis, but the complete triad is uncommon, occurring in a minority of patients [^111cen9S] [^111LZg7V] [^113tMsEi].

> I should confirm the diagnostic approach and explicitly exclude mimics. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by a compatible temporal relationship to infection, sterile synovial fluid, and exclusion of septic arthritis, crystal arthropathy, and other inflammatory arthritides; synovial fluid analysis is essential to rule out infection and crystals, and baseline radiography can be complemented by ultrasound or MRI to detect synovitis, enthesitis, or early erosions; HLA-B27 testing is optional and not required for diagnosis but may inform prognosis [^111YhHM6] [^113hNNDq] [^112pPX98] [^111mZ4Fx].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy and make sure I align with guidelines. NSAIDs are the cornerstone for symptom control and should be taken regularly for maximal anti-inflammatory benefit, with attention to gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular risks; rest and physical therapy are reasonable adjuncts during acute flares, particularly for weight-bearing joints and entheses [^113Bvg1d] [^116X3m59] [^113PHd4e].

> I will now examine when to escalate to DMARDs and which agents to choose, and I should double-check dosing. For persistent peripheral arthritis beyond about 3 months, or for severe or erosive disease, methotrexate 7.5–15 mg weekly with folic acid supplementation is reasonable, with escalation to 25 mg if needed; sulfasalazine titrated to 2 g daily can reduce the severity and duration of peripheral synovitis, though it may not alter long-term outcomes; evidence for biologics is limited, but TNF inhibitors have case-based support in refractory cases, and guidelines note insufficient evidence for IL-17A or JAK inhibitors in reactive arthritis [^113Vo8gb] [^113mmcVF] [^113M7qgM] [^111ZbhNK].

> But wait, what about antibiotics — do they help once arthritis is established? I should verify this carefully. For sexually acquired reactive arthritis, treat the identified genital infection per standard guidelines, but prolonged or combination antibiotics do not clearly improve established arthritis; a meta-analysis found no significant benefit of antibiotics on remission, and BASHH advises against longer-term antimicrobial therapy for sexually acquired reactive arthritis once arthritis is manifest, although chlamydia-driven disease may be an exception where some advocate prolonged combination therapy despite limited high-quality evidence [^11459KzV] [^115xgwts] [^1151tjzg] [^111ppNc2].

> Let me think about prognosis and monitoring so I set expectations appropriately. Most cases are self-limited and resolve within 3–6 months, but up to 30% may become chronic or relapsing, with higher risk in HLA-B27–positive individuals. Extra-articular features such as uveitis warrant prompt ophthalmology referral and may require topical or systemic corticosteroids and mydriatics, with escalation for posterior disease [^111LZg7V] [^113gPfxm] [^114Jdb9k].

> I should review special populations and ensure I don't miss nuances. In HIV-associated reactive arthritis, disease may be more polyarticular, progressive, and erosive, with high rates of uveitis and keratoderma; management principles are similar, but clinicians must account for drug interactions and overlapping toxicities with antiretrovirals; in children, post-streptococcal reactive arthritis is a recognized entity with overlapping features to acute rheumatic fever, requiring careful cardiac surveillance and prophylaxis decisions [^117DpG6s] [^115ZvTKd] [^116ccDRN].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention and vaccination considerations, especially for patients who may need immunosuppression. There is no proven strategy to prevent reactive arthritis after infection, but prompt treatment of triggering infections is prudent; for patients who require DMARDs or biologics, follow EULAR guidance to screen for HBV, HCV, HIV, and latent TB, and apply ACR vaccination recommendations, including offering non-live vaccines during immunosuppression and deferring live-attenuated vaccines during significant immunosuppression, with individualized timing around therapy [^111TB35j] [^116gvQ62] [^112HUU5c] [^117VvUU7] [^117BnBPX].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Suspect reactive arthritis in a patient with asymmetric lower-limb oligoarthritis 1–6 weeks after GI or GU infection, confirm sterile synovial fluid and exclude infection and crystals, assess for extra-articular features including ocular disease, start NSAIDs with risk mitigation, consider HLA-B27 for prognostic context, escalate to methotrexate or sulfasalazine if symptoms persist beyond 3 months or are severe, reserve TNF inhibitors for refractory disease, treat any identified genital infection but avoid prolonged antibiotics for established arthritis, and arrange ophthalmology for eye symptoms. For post-COVID arthritis, use the same framework but acknowledge uncertainty and prefer "COVID-19–associated arthritis" nomenclature until classification criteria solidify [^113M7qgM] [^113Bvg1d] [^113Vo8gb] [^113mmcVF] [^1112iftd].

> Finally, I need to ensure I capture uncertainties and controversies transparently. The field lacks validated classification criteria, the role of antibiotics beyond treating the index infection remains unsettled, and the COVID-19–associated arthritis entity requires better epidemiologic and mechanistic data. Shared decision-making is essential, especially when considering biologics with limited reactive arthritis–specific evidence and when balancing risks and benefits in immunosuppressed patients [^112opeL7] [^1151tjzg] [^111ua3Bb].

Reactive arthritis is a sterile inflammatory arthritis that follows a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection, typically presenting 1–4 weeks later with **asymmetric oligoarthritis of the lower limbs**, enthesitis, and dactylitis [^111YhHM6]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by synovial fluid analysis and exclusion of infection or crystals, with HLA-B27 testing as supportive but not required [^111YhHM6] [^111mZ4Fx]. Management is stepwise: **NSAIDs** for all, intra-articular or systemic glucocorticoids for moderate disease, and sulfasalazine or methotrexate for persistent or severe cases; TNF inhibitors are reserved for refractory disease [^113Bvg1d] [^113Vo8gb] [^113mmcVF]. Antibiotics are indicated only for the triggering infection, not for arthritis itself [^11459KzV] [^115xgwts]. Most patients recover within 3–6 months, but **15–30% develop chronic arthritis**; HLA-B27 positivity and severe extra-articular disease predict poorer outcomes [^111LZg7V] [^113gPfxm].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

Reactive arthritis is triggered by specific bacterial infections, with gastrointestinal and genitourinary pathogens most commonly implicated:

- **Gastrointestinal pathogens**: Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and Clostridioides difficile [^113NutGh].
- **Genitourinary pathogens**: Chlamydia trachomatis is the most frequent urogenital trigger [^notfound].
- **Respiratory pathogens**: Rarely, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been implicated [^116RM74s].

The pathogenesis involves **molecular mimicry**, in which bacterial antigens cross-react with host tissues, triggering an autoimmune response [^11729uMA]. Genetic predisposition — particularly **HLA-B27** — significantly increases susceptibility and severity [^113gPfxm].

---

## Clinical presentation

Reactive arthritis typically presents with the following features:

- **Arthritis**: Asymmetric oligoarthritis of the lower limbs (knees, ankles, feet), often with enthesitis and dactylitis [^112opeL7].
- **Extra-articular manifestations**: Urethritis, conjunctivitis/uveitis, mucocutaneous lesions (keratoderma blenorrhagica, circinate balanitis) [^111LZg7V].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fatigue, malaise, low-grade fever [^notfound].

The classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis (**Reiter's syndrome**) is present in only a minority of cases [^113tMsEi].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by laboratory and imaging studies:

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Sterile inflammatory fluid, negative for crystals and infection [^111YhHM6].
- **HLA-B27 testing**: Supportive but not required; present in 50–80% of cases [^113gPfxm].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or MRI can detect synovitis, enthesitis, and early erosions [^112pPX98].

There are **no universally accepted diagnostic criteria**, but the ESSG and ASAS classification systems are commonly used [^113hh3jW].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Reactive arthritis must be differentiated from other inflammatory arthritides, including:

- **Septic arthritis**: Acute monoarthritis with systemic infection signs [^111YhHM6].
- **Crystal arthropathies**: Gout or pseudogout with crystal identification [^113utSvq].
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Symmetric polyarthritis with rheumatoid factor/ACPA positivity [^117DTkz4].
- **Psoriatic arthritis**: Psoriasis history, nail changes, dactylitis [^112RZTJP].
- **Lyme disease**: History of tick exposure, positive serology [^113gPfxm].

---

## Treatment strategies

Management focuses on symptom control, inflammation suppression, and preventing chronicity:

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | First-line for all patients | High [^113Bvg1d] |
| Intra-articular glucocorticoids | Mono/oligoarthritis | High [^notfound] |
| Systemic glucocorticoids | Severe polyarthritis or extra-articular disease | Moderate [^114Jdb9k] |
| Sulfasalazine | Persistent peripheral arthritis | High [^113mmcVF] |
| Methotrexate | Severe or refractory peripheral arthritis | High [^113Vo8gb] |
| TNF inhibitors | Refractory disease despite above | Moderate [^112rKyeQ] |
| Antibiotics | Only for identified triggering infection | High [^11459KzV] |

---

Antibiotics are **not indicated for arthritis itself**, except to treat the underlying infection [^115VAMd3] [^11459KzV].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Most patients experience **spontaneous remission within 3–6 months**, but 15–30% develop chronic arthritis. Poor prognostic factors include HLA-B27 positivity, severe extra-articular manifestations, and persistent inflammation [^115NQ2RW] [^113gPfxm].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on **prompt treatment of triggering infections** and patient education regarding symptoms and recurrence risk. No specific vaccines or prophylactic medications are recommended [^notfound].

---

Reactive arthritis is a post-infectious inflammatory arthritis with characteristic clinical features and a clear link to prior infection. Management is stepwise, and most patients recover fully, though a subset develops chronic disease.

### Role of bacteria and HLA-B27 in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis [^114hhYwM]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Strictly speaking, "reactive arthritis" is a conventional term with no study-verified definition. This review will focus on the type of arthritis that is induced by the following species: Chlamydia, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, and Campylobacter. The types of arthritis caused by these pathogens share a clinical pattern that is common in the spondyloarthropathies, especially undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy and Reiter's syndrome. All these diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis, must also share major pathogenetic pathways.

### Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis [^116ccDRN]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA) refers to a poststreptococcal arthritic condition that does not fulfill the Jones Criteria for diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever. Clinical features include additive rather than migratory arthritis that responds relatively poorly to salicylates and nonsteroidals; persistence for mean of 2 months; elevated acute phase reactants; and laboratory (usually serologic) evidence of recent group A streptococcal infection. PSRA is not associated with HLA-B27 but rather with HLA-DRB1*01. Because up to 6% of PSRA patients develop mitral valve disease, it is recommended that antistreptococcal prophylaxis be administered for 1 year and then discontinued if there is no evidence of cardiac involvement.

### Treatment strategies for spondyloarthritis: implementation of precision medicine-or "one size fits all" concept? [^112RZTJP]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a term to describe a group of chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases, which have common pathophysiological, genetic, and clinical features. Under the umbrella term SpA, two main groups are subsumed: axial SpA (radiographic axSpA and non-radiographic axSpA) and peripheral SpA (with the leading representative being psoriatic arthritis (PsA) but also arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), reactive arthritis, and undifferentiated pSpA). The key clinical symptom in axSpA is chronic back pain, typically with inflammatory characteristics, which starts in early adulthood, while the leading clinical manifestations of peripheral SpA (pSpA) are arthritis, enthesitis, and/or dactylitis. Furthermore, extra-musculoskeletal manifestations (EMMs) (acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis, and IBD) can accompany axial or peripheral symptoms. All these factors need to be taken into account when making treatment decisions in SpA patients. Despite the major advances in the treatment landscape over the past two decades with the introduction of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and most recently targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs), a relevant proportion of patients still does not achieve the desired state of remission (= absence of disease activity). With this implementation of new treatment modalities, clinicians now have more choices to make in the treatment algorithms. However, despite generalized treatment recommendations, all factors need to be carefully considered when deciding on the optimal treatment strategy for an individual patient in clinical practice, aiming at an important first step towards personalized treatment strategies in SpA. In this narrative review, we focus on the efficacy of approved and emerging treatment options in axSpA and PsA as the main representative of pSpA and discuss their selective effect on the different manifestations associated with SpA to provide guidance on drivers of treatment decisions in specific situations.

### Campylobacter-triggered reactive arthritis: a population-based study [^114rajEQ]. Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the incidence and clinical picture of Campylobacter-associated reactive arthritis (ReA) and other reactive musculoskeletal symptoms in the population.

Methods

A questionnaire on enteric and extraintestinal, including specifically musculoskeletal, symptoms was sent to 870 consecutive patients with Campylobacter-positive stool culture and 1440 matched controls. Analysis of self-reported musculoskeletal symptoms with clinical examination was performed.

Results

Forty-five of the patients (7%) had ReA and eight (1%) had reactive tendinitis, enthesopathy or bursitis. No child had ReA. The arthritis was oligo- or polyarticular, and, in most cases, mild. HLA-B27 was positive in 14% of ReA patients. Of the 45 ReA patients, 37 had C. jejuni and 8 had C. coli infection. No controls had ReA.

Conclusion

ReA is common following Campylobacter infection, with an annual incidence of 4.3 per 100000. At the population level, acute ReA is mild, more frequent in adults, and not associated with HLA-B27. Besides C. jejuni, C. coli can trigger ReA.

### COVID-19-associated arthritis: an emerging new entity? [^116oSEhP]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review, we gathered all published data on patients with COVID-19-associated arthritis. We summarised a total of 33 cases in two categories: onset up to 1 week after COVID-19 (7 cases), and onset > 1 week after COVID-19 (26 cases).

We propose a new classification for cases of arthritis possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: 'COVID-19-associated arthritis'. The distinction between reactive and viral arthritis in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection is artificial and there is no consensual definition for either of them, both in terms of clinical presentation as well as in terms of the required period of time between the onset of COVID-19 and the onset of arthritis. Some of the cases described are outside of the interval of time described as typical of reactive arthritis (1–4 weeks); these are reports in which the articular symptoms started before or at the same time as COVID-19 symptoms or in which the articular symptoms started at least 1 month after of the diagnosis of COVID-19.

Since important differential diagnoses of viral and reactive arthritis include crystal arthropathy, septic arthritis and other chronic inflammatory joint diseases, serological evaluation and synovial fluid analysis are critical investigations. Arthrocentesis results were reported in 10 cases, and no crystal and/or microorganisms were detected in the synovial fluid of these patients.

Our study has limitations. It is based on a small number of reports and these being descriptive and voluntary observations they are prone to ascertainment and publication bias, and findings may not be generalisable to other populations and settings. Moreover, some cases were better documented than others, and for example, important investigations such as autoantibody and serological testing and synovial fluid analysis were not systematically performed. Furthermore, the SLR did not find epidemiological data about the incidence or prevalence of cases of viral and/or reactive arthritis during specific periods of the pandemic, which could be compared with the incidence or prevalence of cases of COVID-19 infection during the same period of the pandemic, and with the incidence or prevalence of cases of viral and/or reactive arthritis before the pandemic, in the same geographical area — this type of data could allow to better infer regarding a potential causal association between COVID-19 and arthritis, as studied in Guillain-Barré syndrome.

### Human immunodeficiency virus related reactive arthritis in Zambia [^117DpG6s]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the clinical, radiological, and diagnostic features of reactive arthritis (ReA) in indigenous Black Zambians with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Methods

Consecutive patients attending an arthritis clinic over a 5-year period were studied prospectively. Those who satisfied diagnostic criteria for ReA were analyzed.

Results

In total, 170 patients satisfied the ESSG criteria for ReA; 71 (45 men, 26 women) had one or more extraarticular manifestations; 30% had enteroreactive and 14% uroreactive disease. Only 59% of patients had the diagnostic features of ReA at presentation. The initial diagnosis was undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy (uSpa) in 20%, other ReA in 14%, and "arthritis alone" in 7%. Of 65 (42 men, 23 women) patients tested, 94% were HIV-positive (91% men, 100% women). In those with HIV, the arthritis was predominantly polyarticular, lower limb-predominant, and progressive; 58% of 33 with persistent disease had erosions of foot and/or hand joints (average disease duration, 24.4 mo); 6 of 10 showed early radiological spine or sacroiliac joint changes (average duration 47.7 mo). Anterior uveitis occurred in 33% of patients, while keratoderma blenorrhagicum and stomatitis occurred in 14.3% and 9.5%, respectively, of patients with enteroreactive ReA. Uroreactive ReA was more common in women. There were no significant differences in the clinical, diagnostic, or radiographic features between men and women or between those with or without a known preceding trigger.

Conclusion

HIV associated ReA in Black Zambians frequently follows an accelerated course with a strong tendency to relapse, develop early erosions and joint deformity, and become chronic. The clinical, diagnostic, and radiographic features are indistinguishable from those described in the conventional (HLA-B27 related) disease, although our HIV-positive patients have a high overall frequency of uveitis, keratoderma, and onycholysis.

### Transient oligoarthritis of the lower extremity following influenza B virus infection: case report [^1147ntZV]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Post-viral arthritis can occur immediately after the infection or several weeks or months later and typically affects joints of the lower extremity, most commonly knees and ankles. Although it is impossible to prove causality in this single case, we would like to suggest that this patient's arthritis represents a rare case of post-infectious ("reactive") arthritis after influenza B virus infection. This notion is supported by the following observations: (1) influenza B virus was demonstrated by two different assays two weeks prior to onset of rheumatologic manifestations, (2) the clinical course was relatively benign and short, and (3) the affected joints are uncommonly involved in the oligoarticular form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, which would be an alternate likely diagnosis in this patient.

What might be the mechanism of this post-viral arthritis? Thus far, influenza-associated synovitis has only been described after influenza immunization, but some mechanistic insights may be gleaned from this observation. The systemic response to challenge with a new antigen often involves the synovium, as T cells reactive against the respective antigens have been detected in synovial membranes of adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis after immunization with tetanus or influenza vaccines. Normal synovium, too, contains low levels of T cells and macrophages and dendritic cells, and it is possible that the antigenic challenge of an acute viral infection leads to a further influx of inflammatory cells, which could potentially lead to synovitis in a previously healthy joint. Molecular mimicry (due to similarities between synovial and viral antigenic epitopes) and synthesis of virus-induced cytokines that trigger autoimmune-mediated tissue injury are other proposed mechanisms of post-viral arthritis. However, clinical flares of RA after influenza infection or immunization, or new synovitis after influenza immunization, occur rarely, indicating that host factors, and perhaps other environmental factors, play important roles.

### Detecting the earliest signs of rheumatoid arthritis: symptoms and examination [^114wA1YC]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Signs and symptoms often occur well in advance of a formal diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, these do not necessarily represent symptoms that are included in classification criteria. Their intensity, frequency, and persistence over time seem to be important in the spectrum from preclinical autoimmunity to classifiable RA. Prospective study of signs and symptoms in individuals at risk for RA will help to determine their onset and relationship with epitope spreading, cytokine evolution, sensitive imaging, and their usefulness in discriminating between individuals patients who will develop incident inflammatory arthritis versus normal controls.

### The peculiar features, diversity and impact of citrulline-reactive autoantibodies [^113m2Kpf]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Since entering the stage 25 years ago as a highly specific serological biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis, anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have been a topic of extensive research. This hallmark B cell response arises years before disease onset, displays interpatient autoantigen variability, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Technological and scientific advances have revealed broad clonal diversity and intriguing features including high levels of somatic hypermutation, variable-domain N-linked glycosylation, hapten-like peptide interactions, and clone-specific multireactivity to citrullinated, carbamylated and acetylated epitopes. ACPAs have been found in different isotypes and subclasses, in both circulation and tissue, and are secreted by both plasmablasts and long-lived plasma cells. Notably, although some disease-promoting features have been reported, results now demonstrate that certain monoclonal ACPAs therapeutically block arthritis and inflammation in mouse models. A wealth of functional studies using patient-derived polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have provided evidence for pathogenic and protective effects of ACPAs in the context of arthritis. To understand the roles of ACPAs, one needs to consider their immunological properties by incorporating different facets such as rheumatoid arthritis B cell biology, environmental triggers and chronic antigen exposure. The emerging picture points to a complex role of citrulline-reactive autoantibodies, in which the diversity and dynamics of antibody clones could determine clinical progression and manifestations.

### Reactive arthritis after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^117JznKe]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

However, there is no formal evidence of a causal relationship with COVID-19, as the arthritis in our patient may have been caused by a subclinical infection that was not detected during the comprehensive diagnostic workup. A limitation in this case is that although a comprehensive diagnostic workup was initiated, urinalysis was not performed for genitourinary tract infections, which are commonly associated with ReA. In at least 25% of patients with ReA, the previous infection is asymptomatic. It is also possible that the pathogen of a possible subclinical coinfection could no longer be detected at the time of serological diagnosis.

On the other hand, viral arthritides have been described after COVID-19. Viral arthritis is frequently described in association with acute infection with parvoviruses, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV and alphaviruses. In our patient, viral arthritis cannot be completely excluded. Nevertheless, the features of viral arthritis are typically different from the manifestation of ReA, as viral arthritis presents as acute polyarthritis in combination with other symptoms such as fever, rash or lymphadenopathy, mimicking rheumatoid arthritis, and is usually self-limiting. All of these features were not present in our patient. Therefore, testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the aspirated synovial fluid was not performed because a positive finding was considered highly unlikely.

The pathogenesis of ReA is only partially understood, and many proposed mechanisms are still under debate. In well-studied pathogens such as C. trachomatis, it is known that the vital organism is transported to the joint in infected monocytes/macrophages and settles in the synovial tissue, leading to infection of the synovium. Other pathogens do not reach the joint in a vital and intact state, but in parts — including so-called 'arthritogenic peptides'. A local inflammatory reaction is then triggered in the synovium. Common hypotheses suggest that the inflammation is caused either by direct cross-reactivity of HLA-B27 with these arthritogenic antigens or, at least in part, by molecular mimicry. Although molecular mimicry has been shown to trigger autoimmunity and has been discussed in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as in the postinfectious immunological phenomena reported to date, molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 and HLA-B27 has not yet been demonstrated or described.

### Classification vs diagnostic criteria: the challenge of diagnosing axial spondyloarthritis [^113hh3jW]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

(A) ASAS classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis; (B) ASAS classification criteria for peripheral spondyloarthritis. *Sacroiliitis on imaging refers to definite radiographic sacroiliitis according to the modified New York criteria or active sacroiliitis on MRI according to the ASAS definition. Peripheral arthritis: usually predominantly lower limbs and/or asymmetric arthritis; enthesitis: clinically assessed; dactylitis: clinically assessed. SpA: spondyloarthritis.

The ASAS classification criteria for peripheral SpA (Fig. 1B) are intended for patients with predominant peripheral manifestations (SpA-typical arthritis or enthesitis or dactylitis). Overall, the same parameters can be found in the axial and peripheral criteria sets except for preceding infection in the peripheral SpA set that should cover cases of reactive arthritis, usually manifesting with peripheral involvement. The criteria are met if one or two other SpA parameters are present in addition to arthritis and/or enthesitis and/or dactylitis. The criteria for peripheral SpA have a sensitivity of 77.8% and a specificity of 82.2%.

### British association of sexual health and HIV national guideline on the management of sexually acquired reactive arthritis 2021 [^115VAMd3]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for reactive arthritis, more specifically with respect to antimicrobial therapy, BASHH 2021 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence whether short-course antibiotic treatment for the acute genital infection influences the non-genital aspects of sexually acquired reactive arthritis. Recognize that antimicrobial treatment may reduce the risk of recurrent arthritis developing in patients with a history of reactive arthritis but is unlikely to affect arthritis once it manifests.

### Frequency of recent parvovirus infection in patients examined for acute reactive arthritis. A study with combinatorial parvovirus serodiagnostics [^113PBnoq]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the causative role of human parvovirus B19 as a preceding infection in patients examined for acute reactive arthritis (ReA).

Methods

Sixty adult patients with acute arthritis were screened for evidence of triggering infections. In all patients, cultures of stool specimens and of Chlamydia trachomatis in urethra/cervix, and/or bacterial serology were studied. The timing of primary infection of human parvovirus B19 was determined by measurement in serum of VP2-IgM, VP2-IgG, epitope-type specifity of VP2-IgG, and avidity of VP1-IgG.

Results

Median time from onset of joint symptoms to the rheumatological consultation was five weeks (range 1–62). Of the 60 patients, 35 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ReA; in the remaining, the diagnosis was unspecified arthritis (UA). Thirty-six patients had antibodies for the B19 virus. Occurrence of these antibodies did not differ significantly between ReA and UA groups (P = 0.61). Of these 36 patients, 34 had a pre-existing immunity to the B19 virus. Of the two other patients, one had rash and self-limiting polyarthritis with serological evidence of B19 primary infection, and the other had arthritis of the lower extremities with serological evidence of a convalescence period after the B19 primary infection. The latter patient also had antibodies to Yersinia, with a clinical picture typical for ReA.

Conclusion

In patients examined for acute ReA, the frequency of recent B19 virus infection was 3.3% (2 out of 60). The diagnostic utility of the presented methodology, by using a single serum sample, was evident.

### The evolving story of Chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis [^111ppNc2]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There have been tremendous recent insights into our understanding of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of Chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis (CiReA). Some of these advances embellish our previous understanding of CiReA, whereas others suggest that a change in the paradigm is required.

Recent Findings

Epidemiological data suggest that we are underdiagnosing CiReA and emerging data suggest that asymptomatic chlamydial infections might be a common cause. Although the clinical manifestations of CiReA are indistinct from the postenteric variety, there appear to be important differences in the pathophysiology of these clinically congruent entities. The hallmark difference pertains to synovial-based viable chlamydial organisms, although in an aberrant state, known as chlamydial persistence. Specific chlamydial serovars appear to be causative of CiReA. Emerging potential therapies include antitumor necrosis factor treatment and combination antibiotics. However, the data with the former are particularly scant and there are theoretical concerns with their use in this setting. Recent data regarding prolonged combination antibiotics are particularly encouraging.

Summary

A history of a chlamydial infection may prove to be a poor guide for the diagnosis of CiReA and prolonged combined antimicrobial therapy could be an effective treatment strategy.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19: cause for concern [^1163tU14]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the intrinsic nature of case reports, it is unclear how generalisable these findings are. High variability in patient characteristics, diagnosis, examinations, and treatment were evident. Established diagnostic or classification criteria for reactive arthritis are missing, and a deeper understanding of the immune mechanism related to COVID-19 may offer a useful opportunity to further investigate the immunopathogenetic mechanisms capable of promoting or contrasting the development of specific rheumatic diseases.

Concluding, low quality evidence suggests that COVID-19 can target the musculoskeletal system causing reactive arthritis at its post-infectious stage. Caution should be used while managing post-infectious COVID-19 patient with arthralgia. It is unclear whether this condition can be prevented, whether previous vaccinations exert a preventive effect, and what the long-term sequelae of COVID-19-related reactive arthritis are.

### Reactive arthritis after COVID-19 infection [^113utSvq]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

A limitation of our study is that viral arthritis is also a known entity and we are unable to completely exclude an acute viral arthritis, though this typically occurs during the acute fever episode, and the pattern described here was notably different. Additionally, bacterial coinfections are reported in severe COVID-19 patientsand ReA due to an occult bacterial respiratory coinfection is possible. However, sputum and blood cultures prior to initiation of empirical antibiotics failed to identify a competing bacterial cause, and the clinical course was not consistent with occult coinfection. Finally, our patient developed mild hyperuricemia, a known side effect of favipiravir, and raising the possibility of a crystal arthropathy as a cause of symptoms. Careful synovial fluid analysis did not identify MSU crystals, which ruled out gouty arthritis.

To conclude, we report the first case of 'ReA' after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings offer an opportunity to improve both early diagnosis and treatment of 'ReA' during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Table 3
Diagnostic criteria for reactive arthritis

A 'definite' diagnosis of ReA is based on the fulfilment of both major criteria and a relevant minor criterion, while a 'probable' diagnosis is characterised by both major criteria but no relevant minor criterion or one major criterion and one or more of the minor criteria. The identification of the trigger infection is also required.

### Management of postinfectious inflammatory arthritis [^111afA7o]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Postinfectious inflammatory arthritis can result from various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Prompt identification and treatment of acute infection is vital, but some cases progress to chronic arthritis despite successful treatment of infection. Postinfectious inflammatory arthritis varies from mild, self-limited arthralgia to severe, refractory arthritis, necessitating ongoing disease-modifying treatment. This review explores the spectrum of postinfectious inflammatory arthritis to provide insights into effective management.

Recent Findings

Research continues regarding the benefit of antimicrobial therapy, beyond treatment of the acute infection, to diminish the severity of postinfectious inflammatory arthritis. Following treatment of acute infection, most cases are self-limited so treatment is symptomatic. However, a difficult-to-predict fraction of cases develop chronic postinfectious inflammatory arthritis that can be challenging to manage. Recently, as more biologic, and targeted synthetic DMARDs have become available, treatment options have expanded.

Summary

In this article, we use the term 'postinfectious inflammatory arthritis' rather than 'reactive arthritis' because it describes a broader spectrum of diseases and emphasizes the common pathogenesis of a postinfectious inflammatory process. We summarize the conventional therapies and recent management developments for the most frequently encountered postinfectious inflammatory arthritides.

### Reactive arthritis after COVID-19 infection [^113F1tc2]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

SARS-CoV-2 is now known to cause a host of extrapulmonary complications, including cardiovascular, neurologic and dermatologic sequelae, many occurring or lasting for weeks after infection. We report the first case of 'ReA' after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

No diagnostic or classification criteria have been established for ReA, but the American College of Rheumatology has issued general guidelines, and in 1999, the 4th International Workshop on ReA discussed the term 'reactive arthritis', proposing its use only for a clinical picture and microbes associated with HLA-B27 and spondyloarthritis. Consequently, the definition of ReA is now based on a diagnostic criterion (table 3)that largely focuses on enteral or urethral infections. However, we previously reported a case of clinical ReA after HIV infection; a syndrome consistent with ReA has also been reported with dengue and chikungunya virus, parvovirus B19, rubella and measles vaccines. In our case, the arthritis occurred precisely 3 weeks after the infectious episode; without a competing source of identifiable extra-articular infection, and synovial fluid cultures negative for bacteria, we are strongly led to a diagnosis of clinical ReA.

ReA tends to occur most often in men between ages 20 and 50. A 30–50% of patients with ReA carry HLA-B27. Although patients without HLA-B27 can develop ReA, as is in our case, some degree of genetic susceptibility is considered necessary, since ReA occurs in only 7–15% of infected population-level subjects. The association of HLA-B27 and ReA is further illustrated by the fact that the prevalence of disease in HLA-B27-positive individuals is five times greater than in the general population. In HLA-B27-positive relatives of patients with ReA, the prevalence is an additional 10 times greater. Moreover, HLA-B27 positivity may be a poor prognostic factor, as a previous study has shown that the presence of HLA-B27 in ReA has been linked to more severe disease, higher frequencies of sacroiliitis and extra-articular manifestations, and an increased likelihood of persistent arthropathy.

### COVID-19-associated arthritis: an emerging new entity? [^1112iftd]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Moreover, we feel that the term 'COVID-19-associated arthritis' is more appropriate because it acknowledges the unknown mechanistic links, the lack of epidemiological data, the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and the lack of uniformity in the literature, with these cases 'randomly' being named as either reactive arthritis or viral arthritis. Homogenising the nomenclature will hopefully contribute to more consistent data collection and reporting, and further investigation of this new potential condition. As knowledge evolves, refinement of the nomenclature and/or establishment of robust classification/diagnostic criteria is expected to occur.

The definitions of viral and reactive arthritis (in general) are still evolving and the inconsistency in nomenclature found in this review suggests that the use of the term 'COVID-19-associated arthritis' is more appropriate and inclusive, when describing arthritis in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least until more mechanistic data regarding the potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and arthritis are available. Our review informs regarding the interpretation of future case reports of COVID-19-associated arthritis and the refinement of the definition and characteristics of this potential emerging new entity.

### Reactive arthritis: current treatment challenges and future perspectives [^115NQ2RW]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Reactive arthritis is a group of inflammatory joint diseases triggered by a previous infection, often associated with extra-articular features. The clinical course and consequently the treatment are complicated by the variability of the disease evolution in the single patient. In some patients, the disease assumes a chronic and destructing course, requiring the introduction of therapy. However, the role of antibiotic treatment of the triggering infection as well as the role of the currently available disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs is still unclear. The better understanding of the infectious agents-host interaction in reactive arthritis pathogenesis opens the possibility of new therapeutic strategies for the disease management. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the recent discoveries about the induction of joint inflammation by the infectious agents, the prognostic factors to better identify patients at risk of chronicity, the current available therapeutic strategies and lastly, the future possibilities of therapeutic approaches to reactive arthritis.

### Antibiotics for treatment of reactive arthritis: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^1151tjzg]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatments for reactive arthritis (ReA).

Methods

We did a systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials of antibiotics for treatment of ReA. We searched electronic databases and conference proceedings up to November 2011. Included trials reported on remission, joint counts, and pain or patient global scores in any language.

Results

Twelve trials were eligible for inclusion and 10 provided data for metaanalysis. The pooled relative risk of failure to achieve remission from a random effects model showed no significant benefit of antibiotic treatment on remission (7 trials, 375 participants, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.49–1.10); however, substantial heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 76.3%, p < 0.0001). The treatment effect did not differ significantly by the type of organism triggering the ReA (chlamydia, 4 trials, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63–1.03, vs other microorganisms, 5 trials, RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.29–1.79, metaregression p = 0.477) or use of combination antibiotics (monotherapy, 6 trials, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.39–1.26, vs combination therapy, 1 trial, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63–0.99, metaregression p = 0.466). When unblinded trials were excluded, the treatment effect was attenuated and heterogeneity decreased (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.70–1.10, I(2) = 32.8%, p = 0.19). No significant effects of antibiotic treatment were observed on joint counts, pain, or patient global scores; however, antibiotics were associated with a 97% increase in gastrointestinal adverse events.

Conclusion

Trials of antibiotic treatment for ReA have produced heterogeneous results that may be related to differences in study design. The efficacy of antibiotics is uncertain.

### Update on streptococcal-associated rheumatic disease [^117NTh6C]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review provides a comprehensive perspective on poststreptococcal rheumatic manifestations in pediatric patients by integrating recent updates and a literature review, with particular focus on poststreptococcal reactive arthritis and acute rheumatic fever.

Recent Findings

Poststreptococcal reactive arthritis presents with a unique clinical profile, distinguishing it from other poststreptococcal conditions in pediatric patients, especially acute rheumatic fever. Recent updates underscore the importance of diligent monitoring and management to mitigate potential cardiac complications, despite the relatively low incidence of carditis following poststreptococcal reactive arthritis.

Summary

The diagnosis of poststreptococcal reactive arthritis is often challenging due to significant overlap with other poststreptococcal syndromes, particularly acute rheumatic fever. Given the potential for cardiac complications in acute rheumatic fever, accurate differentiation between the two conditions is imperative. Ongoing research continues to refine diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches, emphasizing the need for clinicians to remain vigilant in recognizing and differentiating between the two syndromes.

### Reactive arthritis: newer developments [^112rKyeQ]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis (ReA) is characterized by an aseptic inflammatory articular involvement occurring in a genetically predisposed individual secondary to an infectious process localized outside the joint. ReA usually refers to an acute or insidious oligoarthritis process after enteric (enteroarthritis) or urogenital (uroarthritis) infection. Conventional antirheumatic therapeutic modalities based on nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, sulfasalazine, and steroids are effective in the majority of patients. In more refractory cases, the use of second-line agents including methotrexate and more recently biological agents such as etanercept and infliximab has been found highly effective. The role of antibiotics remains not well established, although they appear to be effective in acute ReA of urogenital origin.

### Microbial factors in spondyloarthropathies: insights from population studies [^1173EFJe]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Infections and genetics play a role in the development of reactive arthritis. The clinical manifestations and severity of the features depend on the triggering infections and the epidemiologic setting. Reports from hospital-based series show the lowest frequency of reactive arthritis, but often, patients have severe arthritis associated with a high frequency of HLA-B27. At the population level, reactive arthritis occur in 7 to 15% of the infected subjects. The disease is usually mild, affects small joints, can be polyarticular, often rapidly disappears, and has a low association with HLA-B27. There also seems to be a change in the spectrum of triggering infections. Reports of Yersinia arthritis are less common, whereas arthritis in association with Campylobacter or Salmonella infections seems to be increasing. The role of early antimicrobial chemotherapy for the prevention of reactive arthritis needs to be studied.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 [^112YdYto]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reactive arthritis (RA) is a rare disease that is characterized by a triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis, typically secondary to an extraarticular infection of the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract. There is often significant variation in clinical features, and patients may present with mucocutaneous findings, such as oral lesions, circinate balanitis, keratoderma blenorrhagicum, and nail dystrophy. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27 positivity is strongly associated with this condition. Herein, we present a case of RA favored to be triggered by the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, BNT162b2.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19: cause for concern [^115qsXmF]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 Infection (COVID-19) may trigger reactive arthritis at its post-infectious stage through immuno-mediated sequelae, including vasculitis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, myositis, and lupus. COVID-19 could promote temporary immunosuppression, activating the immuno-mediated innate response. Though reactive arthritis is commonly triggered by sexually transmitted or gastrointestinal infections, syndromes consistent with reactive arthritis have been observed following Middle East respiratory syndrome, HIV, Dengue, Chickungunya, and Parvovirus B19.

Recently, several case reports originating from India, Pakistan, Italy and the United Kingdom have been published on reactive arthritis following COVID-19. The patients, mostly women aged from 30 to 50 years, developed symptoms of reactive arthritis one to four weeks after the infection (mean 22 days), similar to other forms of reactive arthritis. There was no evidence of an association between COVID-19 severity and the onset of reactive arthritis. Most patients recovered within a few days with no additional care or hospitalisation after a diagnosis by exclusion in all patients. Few patients experienced previous severe COVID-19, and only a few required intensive care units (ICU) and mechanical ventilation. Most patients had no history of autoimmunity, inflammatory bowel disease or travel history, and had not been prescribed any new medication. The clinical presentation was variable in terms of imaging, laboratory tests and physical examination. The location and progression of the reactive arthritis were variable. Knees, hands, and ankles were most commonly affected, with the lower back, feet, wrists, and hips less frequently. Most patients developed asymmetrical oligoarthritis, though some presented with mono-articular reactive arthritis. Similar to other forms of reactive arthritis, tumor, rubor, calor, and dolor were present in most patients and, in most cases, no associated extra-articular manifestation was documented, with inconstant nausea, cough, dysgeusia, diarrhoea, and fever. At plain radiography, no bony involvement was evidenced in most patients. Effusion, swelling and oedema were evidenced at magnetic resonance imaging and sonography. Tendinopathy, dactylitis, and enthesitis of the Achilles tendon were common. At aspiration, a mild inflammatory hypercellularity with no evidence of crystal deposition was reported at polarized light microscopy. Serological examination was also variable. Most patients presented higher values of C-reactive protein. Similar to other reactive arthritides, antibodies of rheumatological disorders were occasionally documented: anti-carbamylated protein antibody (ACPA) 1], rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and HLA-B27. Management was heterogeneous in terms of the type of pharmacotherapy, dosages and length of treatment. Most authors, following the recommendation for the management of peripheral arthritis, administered non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including celecoxib, naproxen, indomethacin, etoricoxib, and ibuprofen. Ten to 80 mg of prednisolone and 4 to 8 mg of methylprednisolone were the most commonly administered steroids. Opioids were also administered orally in two patients. Other less common compounds were sulfasalazine, dilaudid, neurontin, TNF α inhibitor, certolizumab, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate.

### Windows for intervention in the prearthritis phase of rheumatoid arthritis? A narrative review of key triggering events and potential preventive strategies [^113CCNBH]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals without clinical signs of arthritis, but for different reasons are facing an increased risk for RA (eg, by testing positive for RA-related autoantibodies, presenting with small joint arthralgia, or being a first-degree relative (FDR) to a person with RA), are denoted at-risk subjects. This contrasts with the term pre-RA, which is only to be used for cases where clinical RA is known to have occurred. The risk of progression from at-risk to clinical RA is substantially different depending on the (combination of) factors underlying the at-risk classification, ranging from 0.2% to 57% over a year (table 1), highlighting the significant heterogeneity contained within the term at-risk. Stratifying the risk of progression among at-risk subjects is an important, but challenging, task to achieve personalised management of at-risk patients both in rheumatology and primary care settings. Importantly, risk stratification criteria were recently developed by the American College of Rheumatology and the European Alliance for Rheumatology Associations, which can be used for defining more homogenous risk groups in clinical trials. It is likely that the characterisation of events that determine the transition from risk phase to overt disease would not only identify potential therapeutic targets but also likely improve individualisation of patient care.

### Reactive arthritis [^111cen9S]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis is classified as a spondyloarthropathy. Current concepts of disease suggest an infectious trigger, followed by inflammatory arthritis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the interaction of host susceptibility and microorganism. Diagnosis relies on a compatible clinical syndrome and microbiologic confirmation of the pathogen. Antibiotic therapy seems useful in Chlamydia-triggered arthritis. The role of antibiotics in arthritis triggered by enteric pathogens is less clear. The role of tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors in therapy is evolving. Many patients have a course limited to a few months, but others experience extraarticular disease and more prolonged courses.

### A case of reactive arthritis: a great masquerader [^112BgeCh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis is an inflammatory condition with multiorgan system disease potential. Because the standard constellation of symptoms in Reiter syndrome (arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis) is not typically present in all patients, the disease can be easily overlooked if clinical suspicion is not high upon presentation. To highlight the importance of recognizing the potential of this disease in patients with a history of either gastrointestinal or genitourinary illnesses, we present the case of a young healthy male presented on multiple occasions later diagnosed with Reiter syndrome in the setting of a recent diagnosis of prostatitis. He was noted to have classical symptoms including conjunctivitis and arthritis. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during a brief hospital stay and did well. Although reactive arthritis is an easily managed disease, it is easily missed particularly in young otherwise healthy patients who may not present with classic symptoms. Vigilance with regard to patients with vague seemingly unrelated complaints particularly with a history of gastrointestinal- or genitourinary-related illnesses deserves consideration for this disease process.

### Reactive arthritis: clinical aspects and medical management [^113tMsEi]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis (ReA) is an inflammatory arthritis that arises after certain gastrointestinal or genitourinary infections, representing a classic interplay between host and environment. It belongs to the group of arthritidies known as the spondyloarthropathies. The classic syndrome is a triad of symptoms, including the urethra, conjunctiva, and synovium; however, the majority of patients do not present with this triad. Diagnostic criteria for ReA exist, but data suggest new criteria are needed. Epidemiologic and prospective studies have been difficult to perform because of over-reliance on the complete classic triad of symptoms and the different terms and eponyms used. Studies assessing various treatment strategies are ongoing.

### TNF involvement and anti-TNF therapy of reactive and unclassified arthritis [^111oTYp5]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

A growing body of evidence shows that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is also involved in the pathogenesis of reactive and unclassified arthritis. Elevated levels of TNF-alpha and other pro-inflammatory cytokines are seen in these inflammatory arthropathies. The clinical effect on a potential underlying infection is not known, but several studies have suggested at least short-term effectiveness and safety of anti-TNF-alpha therapy in reactive and unclassified arthritis.

### Reactive arthritis: defined etiologies, emerging pathophysiology, and unresolved treatment [^117GNr3g]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

ReA is unique in that it is one of the few disease states of which there is a known trigger. This insight into disease initiation has led to great advances in the pathophysiology. Despite this detailed knowledge, the proper treatment remains elusive. In the years to come it is possible that the specific treatment will be dictated by the triggering microbe.

### Seronegative reactive spondyloarthritis and the skin [^111LZg7V]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Spondyloarthritidies represent a group of conditions affecting the axial and peripheral muscoloskeletal apparatus and are often associated with psoriasis, infections, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Other diseases included in this category are psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and enteropathic arthritis. Reactive arthritis is an elusive spondyloarthritis, commonly occurring 1 to 3 weeks after a digestive or a genitourinary tract infection, in which microorganisms do not infect the joint directly. Reactive arthritis is classically characterized by large-joint arthritis, urethritis in men and cervicitis in women, and eye inflammation (usually conjunctivitis or uveitis) but encompasses numerous other symptoms and signs, including manifestations of dermatologic interest such as keratoderma blenorrhagicum and circinate balanitis. The diagnosis of reactive arthritis is clinical, and the infectious agent cannot always be identified due to disease latency after the infection. Most cases are self-limiting, but reactive arthritis may become chronic in 30% of cases. Treatment options include anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and sulfasalazine; biologic agents, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) blockers, have been recently used, but there are only a few randomized clinical trials on the treatment of reactive arthritis. The effectiveness of antimicrobials needs further evaluation.

### Chlamydia-induced ReA: immune imbalances and persistent pathogens [^116U6B4V]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Reactive arthritis (ReA), an inflammatory arthritic condition that is commonly associated with Chlamydia infections, represents a significant health burden, yet is poorly understood. The enigma of this disease is reflected in its problematic name and in its ill-defined pathogenesis. The existence of persistent pathogens in the arthritic joint is acknowledged, but their relevance remains elusive. Progress is being made in understanding the underlying mechanisms of ReA, whereby an imbalance between type 1 and type 2 immune responses seems to be critical in determining susceptibility to disease. Such an imbalance occurs prior to the initiation of an adaptive immune response, suggesting that innate cellular and molecular mechanisms in ReA should be prioritized as fruitful areas for investigation.

### Reactive arthritis after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115hax1V]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COVID-19 is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 is associated with a range of symptoms including fever, loss of sense of smell and taste, gastrointestinal symptoms, thromboembolic complications, cardiomyopathy, pneumonia, and renal failure. Early on, musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia and myalgia were reported in association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has also been recognised as a precipitating cause of inflammatory arthritis in individuals known to have an inflammatory rheumatic disease, as well as in previously unaffected individuals. However, new-onset arthritis after COVID-19 is a heterogeneous phenomenon that complicates differential diagnosis. For example, acute arthritis with features of viral arthritisand crystal-induced arthritishave been reported after COVID-19. Arthritides mimicking reactive arthritis (ReA)have also been described, but the affected patients often do not conform to the typical ReA patient pattern: several reports describe cases of patients older than 45 years at onset, and the characteristic genetic feature of ReA, HLA-B27, has rarely been found. In addition, viral infections are much less likely to trigger ReA than bacterial infections, and respiratory tract infections are also much less likely to cause ReA than gastrointestinal and genitourinary mucosal infections. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause true ReA. Here, we present a typical case of ReA following a rather mild course of COVID-19.

### Bilateral interstitial keratitis with anterior stromal infiltrates associated with reactive arthritis [^1168X5vj]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A previously healthy 48-year-old man presented with a 1-week history of migrating polyarthropathy preceded by a viral illness, dysuria and bilateral red eyes. Ocular examination revealed anterior and interstitial stromal keratitis. He was systemically well but had raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein and was positive for human leucocyte antigen B27 on extensive infective, rheumatological and autoimmune investigations. Although the exact triggering pathogen was not identified, clinical findings were consistent with reactive arthritis. Bilateral interstitial keratitis is a rare manifestation of reactive arthritis which, along with the anterior stromal keratitis, responded well to topical prednisolone sodium phosphate 0.5%. Systemic joint symptoms improved on oral sulfasalazine, non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent and low-dose prednisolone.

Table 1
Coronaviruses known to infect humans

Organ dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 can be a consequence of cytotoxic damage (direct injury) and immunological insult (indirect damage) to host cells. Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the major complications of COVID-19. Other COVID-19 complications may include acute liver, cardiac and kidney injury, as well as secondary infection, immunothrombosis and hyperinflammatory response.

As with other respiratory tract infections, musculoskeletal symptoms can develop with coronavirus infections. Arthralgia is reported in 15% of patients with COVID-19, and myalgia is even more common (44%). However, musculoskeletal symptoms do not seem to be related to COVID-19 severity.

The current COVID-19 pandemic raises several intriguing questions, as well as clinical challenges in the context of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. Cases of 'SARS-CoV-2-associated arthritis' have been reported, and inconsistently described as cases of either viral arthritis or reactive arthritis. This distinction is sometimes difficult, and classically the term reactive arthritis has been used to describe an immune-mediated sterile arthritis (typically monoarticular or oligoarticular, often involving the lower extremities, and sometimes associated with dactylitis and enthesitis) occurring several days to weeks after bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract, in genetically predisposed individuals; while the term viral arthritis has been used to describe the (often symmetric and polyarticular) articular manifestations of viral infections, potentially triggered by a variety of mechanisms, including direct invasion of the joint cells or tissues, immune complex formation and direct or indirect immune dysregulation due to persistent/latent viral infection, sometimes in the context of an upper respiratory tract infection. Microorganisms that have been associated with reactive and viral arthritis are listed in table 2.

Table 2
Microorganisms associated with reactive arthritis and viral arthritis

To date, there is no agreement regarding viral or reactive arthritis diagnostic or classification criteria. The diagnosis is essentially clinical, based on a careful history and physical examination. In this article, we aimed to review all the reported cases of 'COVID-19-associated arthritis', which we propose, is a better term to define the entire spectrum of new-onset arthritis believed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### The immunopathogenesis of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis: from triggering to targeting [^117DTkz4]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Patients with rheumatoid arthritis can be divided into two major subsets characterized by the presence versus absence of antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPAs) and of rheumatoid factor (RF). The antibody-positive subset of disease, also known as seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, constitutes approximately two-thirds of all cases of rheumatoid arthritis and generally has a more severe disease course. ACPAs and RF are often present in the blood long before any signs of joint inflammation, which suggests that the triggering of autoimmunity may occur at sites other than the joints (for example, in the lung). This Review summarizes recent progress in our understanding of this gradual disease development in seropositive patients. We also emphasize the implications of this new understanding for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies. Similar temporal and spatial separation of immune triggering and clinical manifestations, with novel opportunities for early intervention, may also occur in other immune-mediated diseases.

Table 1
Approximations of 1-year risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in different contexts

The stages of RA development are summarised in figure 1. In the first phase, individuals lack clinical symptoms and signs of autoimmunity but carry risk genes and possible epigenetic alterations. In addition, environmental exposures (eg, mucosal irritants or microbes) facilitate a breach of immune tolerance, leading to the occurrence of autoantibodies in the circulationas a result of autoreactive B and T cells having encountered their cognate antigen(s). For most patients, this is followed by years without either symptoms or clinical or histological signs of joint inflammation, sometimes referred to as the 'non-articular' phase of RA development. Here, a maturation and broadening of the autoimmune response is believed to take place, illustrated for instance by ACPA which are suggested to increase in levels, expand the number of epitopes recognised and attain a more unfavourable glycosylation pattern. Eventually, the joints become involved with arthralgia and/or stiffness, which in a subset of subjects develops into clinically overt arthritis. The autoantibody-positive symptomatic period prior to arthritis onset is on average slightly shorter (1–3 years)than the asymptomatic autoimmune phase (3–5 years), but both are subject to considerable interindividual variation. Importantly, for each step in the at-risk phase, a significant proportion of individuals do not progress, but the more steps completed, the higher the risk of RA onset (table 1).

Figure 1
Summary of at-risk phases in the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Risk gene carriage at birth (A) is followed by environmental exposures such as mucosal irritants and/or microbes (B). Such exposures contribute to autoimmune responses from both the T cell and B cell compartment (C). Joint pain subsequently develops by yet unknown mechanisms, without evidence of inflammation within the joint (D). In a proportion of subjects, autoimmune responses become directed to the joint during the symptomatic phase and arthritis develops (D). A substantial proportion of subjects do not develop arthritis and symptoms resolve (D). The breadth of the autoimmune response and the carriage of risk genes in HLA-DRB1 are risk factors for arthritis development, but the exact mechanisms behind transition to the joints remain obscure.

### COVID-19-associated arthritis: an emerging new entity? [^111ua3Bb]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

The current COVID-19 pandemic raises several clinical challenges. Cases of COVID-19-associated arthritis have been reported, and inconsistently described as either COVID-19 viral arthritis or COVID-19 reactive arthritis. We aimed to review all the reported cases of 'COVID-19-associated arthritis', which we propose, is a better term to define the entire spectrum of new-onset arthritis believed to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We performed a systematic literature review using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to search for articles published up to 13 December 2021. We included cohort studies, case series and case reports describing patients diagnosed with COVID-19 reactive or viral arthritis by a physician, irrespective of fulfilment of classification criteria. To identify relevant studies, medical subject headings and keywords related to 'COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection' and 'reactive arthritis' were used. Our search retrieved 419 articles, of which 31 were included in the review. A total of 33 cases were reported in these 31 articles, the majority being adults (28/33 = 85%) with peripheral joint involvement (26/33 = 79%). Most of the patients responded well to treatment and the disease was self-limiting. These 33 case reports describe a possible causal relationship between exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the onset of arthritis. However, since these cases were reported during a pandemic, other aetiologies cannot be fully excluded. The exact mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 might trigger arthritis is not fully understood and robust epidemiological data to support a causal relationship are still lacking.

### Pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis [^11729uMA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The hallmark of ankylosing spondylitis is acute and chronic spinal inflammation initiating in the sacroiliac joints, often coupled with enthesitis, presenting as chronic inflammation at the sites of ligamentous and tendinous insertions into bone. Peripheral joint synovitis can be a prominent feature as well. Reactive arthritis is a sterile synovitis arising after an extra-articular infection of enteric or urogenital tracts. HLA-B27 has been known for about the past 30 years to be associated with ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis, but the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis is still not well defined. Although the clinical manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis may differ, this update discusses the two diseases together and focuses on recent evidence in both.

Recent Findings

With respect to HLA-B27 several recent studies address arthritogenic peptides, molecular mimicry, and aberrant forms of B27. Several candidate genes in addition to B27 have been implicated in recent genetic studies. With respect to bacterial infection, recent findings in bacterial antigenicity, host response through interactions of antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and cytokines are providing new understanding of host-pathogen interactions and the pathogenesis of arthritis. Endogenous host factors such as proteoglycans may play a role as autoantigens and contribute to chronic inflammation on that basis.

Summary

Recent advances provide additional new insights into distinct pathogenetic mechanisms in AS and ReA that arise from a complex interplay between genetic factors including HLA-B27 and environmental factors.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19 vaccination with BNT162b2 [^115GxJPG]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Adverse cutaneous reactions to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination have been well-documented in recent literature. Cutaneous morphologies purportedly vary, ranging from eczematous and psoriasiform rashes to vasculitic and bullous eruptions. Cases of acute, new-onset arthritis following the COVID-19 vaccine have also been reported, as have flares of rheumatoid arthritis in patients with previously well-controlled disease. Given the temporal onset of our patient's symptoms and the unrevealing infectious and autoimmune workup, RA triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine was most favored in this case.

RA has been described as a form of arthritis in which a type III immune complex-mediated reaction results from an antigenic stimulus. Typically, this syndrome occurs within 4 weeks of infection caused by species of Chlamydia, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, or Campylobacter. In the present case, the histologic findings of a psoriasiform tissue reaction accompanied by leukocytoclastic vasculitis were consistent with a diagnosis of keratoderma blenorrhagicum — the characteristic cutaneous manifestation of RA. The extensive complement deposition in the microvasculature also highlighted the role of complement pathway activation in the pathogenesis of this condition. Immune complex-mediated reactions have been described following infection with and vaccination against COVID-19, and this case further illustrates the role of complement in these circumstances.

The pathogenesis of hypersensitivity reactions following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination has not been well established. The BNT162b2 vaccine delivers mRNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encapsulated in a lipid particle. It is therefore possible that this spike glycoprotein, which is produced by myocytes upon vaccination, may act as an antigenic stimulus. In our case, spike glycoprotein was indeed identified in the deep cutaneous vessels (Fig 3). Another potential trigger is the polyethylene glycol vaccine additive, a polymer that is used to stabilize the lipid nanoparticle formulation. It has been suggested that this polymer, which is known to cause type I hypersensitivity reactions, may also cause delayed antibody-mediated responses. A third possibility is that the vaccine may unmask a hypersensitivity reaction to an unidentified trigger, such as an asymptomatic infection. Though we cannot conclusively determine whether there was a causal relationship between the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and the development of RA in our patient, further investigation of rare cases, such as this one, will ideally enhance our understanding of immune-mediated reactions to COVID-19 vaccination.

### Reactive arthritis after COVID-19 infection [^116RM74s]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Reactive arthritis (ReA) is a known entity, typically causing asymmetric monoarthritis or oligoarthritis involving lower limbs (ankles and knees), and usually occurring 1–3 weeks after sexually transmitted or gastrointestinal infection. Although less described in the literature, respiratory bacterial infections such as Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae or viral infections have been associated with some cases of ReA. Herein, we report the first case of ReA after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### From immunotherapy to autoimmunity: reactive arthritis following intravesical BCG [^116SW7Ho]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Reactive arthritis (ReA) is recognised as a sterile inflammatory arthritis triggered by infections or other antigens, including intravesical BCG used to treat non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Although BCG immunotherapy is highly effective, its side effects can extend beyond the genitourinary tract. We present a woman in her 60s with high-grade Ta urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) and carcinoma in situ (CIS) who developed ReA 1week following BCG instillation. She experienced fevers, blurred vision, mild conjunctivitis and oligoarthritis predominantly affecting her knees. Infection was ruled out by negative cultures, while elevated inflammatory markers pointed to an autoimmune aetiology. Prompt discontinuation of BCG and corticosteroid therapy led to significant clinical improvement. This case underscores the importance of recognising ReA as a potential post-BCG complication requiring multidisciplinary management. It highlights the need for intervention and follow-up.

### Spondyloarthritis: update on pathogenesis and management [^111yZgYj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

A great deal of progress has occurred in the past few years in elucidating the causes and designing new treatments for ankylosing spondylitis and other types of spondyloarthritis. In addition to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 and other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, chromosomal regions and genes elsewhere in the genome are being implicated both in disease susceptibility and severity. The various ways HLA-B27 may function in causing spondyloarthritis now are better understood to encompass not only antigen presentation but also other mechanisms, possibly all being operative in pathogenesis (misfolding of the HLA-B27 molecule, impaired intracellular killing of bacteria, and HLA-B27 itself serving as an autoantigen). Specific enteric and sexually acquired infections can trigger reactive arthritis, though no specific microbe has been identified in other forms of spondyloarthritis. Intestinal inflammation with impairment of the gut:blood barrier may be operative in driving ankylosing spondylitis and enteropathic arthritis. A number of treatments have been tried in spondyloarthritis, including older agents such as methotrexate and sulfasalazine but also newer drugs such as pamindronate. The recent introduction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers in the treatment of spondyloarthritis has offered the most hope in not only relieving symptoms and signs of both peripheral arthritis and enthesitis but also spinal disease, which often has been refractory to other agents. Their high cost and considerable side effect profile, however, have necessitated the establishment of guidelines for their use in these diseases in order to target the patient in whom they are likely to have the most benefit.

Clinical presentation and epidemiology

Recognizing rheumatologic and musculoskeletal irAEs in the oncology setting is challenging due to the broad range of potential presenting symptoms and the prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints in the general population. Although a paucity of epidemiological data limits our understanding of the true incidence of these irAEs, they are increasingly reported across care settings. Since delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to long-term disability, and disorders may become chronic and require ongoing immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy, it is important to understand typical symptom presentation and recommended management. Preserving quality of life and ability to perform ADL is a priority.

One of the most commonly reported rheumatologic irAEs is an inflammatory oligo or polyarthritis that can lead to rapid joint damage and may persist after discontinuation of immunotherapy. Arthralgia has been reported in approximately 15% of patients receiving ICIs, but the incidence of inflammatory arthritis, which is typically grade 2 or less, has not yet been systematically reported. Arthritis is rarely the sole irAE, with most patients having other organ systems involvement. In a small series, the median time to onset was five months after starting ICI therapy. Clinically, three phenotypes have been described: 1) predominantly large joint reactive arthritis that, on occasion, develops in association with conjunctivitis and uveitis; 2) polyarthritis resembling rheumatoid-like arthritis, affecting the small joints of the hand (metacarpophalangeal [MCP], proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joints or wrist), rarely associated with typical rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), but potentially erosive; and 3) seronegative, oligo and polyarthritis, typically starting in the medium/large joints, characterized by synovitis and involvement of tendons and entheses, with or without joint erosions. Combination anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 therapy is associated with a greater risk of arthritis than monotherapy, although incidence is unaffected by drug or type of malignancy. Management often requires moderate-dose corticosteroids, sometimes in conjunction with steroid-sparing immunomodulators and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine. Persistence of inflammatory arthritis up to two years after discontinuation of ICIs has been seen, with ongoing requirement for immunomodulatory therapy. Beyond arthritis, less commonly reported rheumatologic irAEs recognized in the context of ICI therapy include sicca, with severe eye and mouth dryness, and parotitis; inflammatory myositis, most commonly resembling polymyositis, occasionally resulting in rhabdomyolysis; vasculitides including giant cell arteritis (GCA) and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR); systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sarcoidosis.

### Update on spondyloarthropathies [^111zphth]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Spondyloarthropathies are a cluster of interrelated and overlapping chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases that primarily include ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, and the arthritis associated with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The primary pathologic sites are the entheses (the sites of bony insertion of ligaments and tendons); the axial skeleton, including the sacroiliac joints; the limb joints; and some nonarticular structures, such as the gut, skin, eye, and aortic valve. Although spondyloarthropathies are not associated with rheumatoid factor, they show a strong association with HLA-B27; however, this association varies markedly among various spondyloarthropathies and among ethnic groups. The most widely used classification criterion, from the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group, encompasses the currently recognized wider disease spectrum, with a sensitivity and specificity that generally exceed 85%. Spondyloarthropathies occur in genetically predisposed persons and are triggered by environmental factors, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of inflammation are not yet fully understood. Chlamydial and many enterobacterial infections can trigger reactive arthritis, but an infectious trigger for ankylosing spondylitis has not yet been established. HLA-B27 itself is involved in enhancing genetic susceptibility, but the underlying molecular basis is still unknown; additional genes include the putative susceptibility genes for Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriasis. A specific susceptibility gene for Crohn disease, NOD2, is located on chromosome 16q12, and one of the candidate genes for psoriasis, PSORS1, has been mapped to a 60-kb fragment on chromosome 6p, which is telomeric to the HLA-C locus. This paper reviews the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha therapy and other therapeutic advances.

### Diagnosis and classification of reactive arthritis [^111YhHM6]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Reactive arthritis is a form of seronegative spondyloarthritis clinically associated with inflammatory back pain, additive or migratory oligoarthritis, and extra-articular symptoms that typically follow a gastrointestinal or urogenital infection by a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 3–6 weeks. Once arthritis is observed, however, microbial tests and blood or synovial fluid cultures are negative, and only serum antibodies are detected. Reactive arthritis commonly affects young adults, most frequently white and carrying the HLA-B27 allele. The genetic susceptibility appears as necessary with only 1–15% of cases of infection developing reactive arthritis. Clinical symptoms are different from septic arthritis which manifests with fever, systemic signs of infection, and monoarthritis. The presence of large joint oligoarthritis, urogenital tract infection, and uveitis characterizes Reiter's syndrome as a clinical subtype. Ocular, skin, and heart involvement are not uncommon and may be largely variable in severity. Diagnostic criteria are based on the ACR guidelines and include rheumatological signs along with a proof of infection.

### The arthritis connection to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): why has it taken so long to understand it? [^1162Azac]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Ahvonen et al in 1969 studied various arthritis manifestations associated with Yersinia enterocolitica infection and wrote, 'transient non-purulent (reactive) arthritis with acute onset has been occasionally reported in association with bacterial infections such as those caused by Brucella, Shigella, and Salmonella typhimurium '. They introduced the term 'reactive arthritis' for the first time in rheumatology literature. A clear and convincing separation between RA and what appeared to be an infectious agent (either from the gut or the genitourinary tract) triggering an acute and then a chronic disease most assuredly required the widespread recognition of the clinical and research importance of what later tuned out to be rheumatoid factor. The discovery and characterisation of the antibody natureof rheumatoid factor (and its absence in the patients with IBD-arthritis) is likely to be a major reason for the subsequent rejuvenated and focused interest in IBD-arthritisas a separate and distinguishable entity.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^115NVXQH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory arthritis with immune checkpoint inhibitors — frequency, presentation, differential diagnosis, and management are summarized: musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgia and myalgia are common in patients receiving ICI therapy, as reported in up to 40% of those treated in clinical trials, and the most common musculoskeletal and rheumatic irAEs are arthritis, polymyalgia-like syndromes, and myositis, which seem to be more frequent with PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists and when agents are used in combination. Clinical presentations vary from involvement of large and/or small joints to oligoarthritis of large joints, features of reactive arthritis, or symmetrical polyarthritis with autoantibodies; differentials include degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis, soft tissue rheumatic disorders, crystal arthropathies, and septic arthritis, and inflammatory markers are usually very elevated. NSAIDs alone are usually not sufficient to control symptoms, and corticosteroids and synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs might be required, with intra-articular corticosteroid injections an option if only one or two joints are affected.

### Reactive arthritis after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113gPfxm]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The patient presented 7 days after resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection with typical, although mild, symptoms of COVID-19 with severe swelling and pain in the left ankle joint and forefoot. Based on the overall picture, ReA appears to be the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The most common differential diagnoses for oligoarthritis are ReA, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, sarcoidosis, Lyme arthritis, gouty arthritis and arthritis associated with IBD, as well as soft connective tissue disease or vasculitis. No symptoms suggestive of pathologies other than ReA — such as lymphadenopathy, back pain, skin lesions, a history of tick bites or Borrelia antibodies, IBD, psoriasis or symptoms consistent with soft connective tissue disease or vasculitis — were found on history, clinical presentation and comprehensive diagnostic examination.

ReA is a sterile joint inflammation complicating an extra-articular infection. There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria, and the diagnosis is based mainly on clinical aspects such as oligoarthritis of the lower limbs that develops within 1–6 weeks of the previous infection, especially in young, HLA-B27-positive individuals. The suspected diagnosis of ReA was supported by the typical case constellation: the patient was young, HLA-B27-positive, had asymmetric oligoarthritis involving the lower extremity, the synovial fluid was sterile and symptoms began several days after resolution of infection. Complete response to NSAIDs and glucocorticoids was also consistent with typical features for ReA. The HLA-B27 allele is the genetic hallmark of SpA, including ReA; the phenotype is found in 50%–80% of cases with ReA, however, in many of the reports describing arthritis following infection with SARS-CoV2 published to date, patients were HLA-B27 negative or were not tested for HLA-B27. The mechanism by which HLA-B27 contributes to ReA is not yet fully understood. However, HLA-B27 correlates with more severe and prolonged arthritis and sacroiliitis and a higher incidence of extra-articular manifestations. Screening our patient for underlying respiratory and gastrointestinal coinfections, common in ReA, was negative, leading us to assume an association with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Diagnosis and management of rheumatoid arthritis… [^115EYNYw]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

+ T cells. 4 Joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis begins with the proliferation of synovial macrophages and fibroblasts after a triggering incident, possibly autoimmune or infectious. Lymphocytes infiltrate perivascular regions, and endothelial cells proliferate. Neovascularization then occurs. Blood vessels in the affected joint become occluded with small clots or inflammatory cells. Over time, inflamed synovial tissue begins to grow irregularly, forming invasive pannus tissue. Pannus invades and destroys cartilage and bone. Multiple cytokines, interleukins, proteinases, and growth factors are released, causing further joint destruction and the development of systemic complications. 1, 4. Diagnosis TYPICAL PRESENTATION Rheumatoid arthritis primarily is a clinical diagnosis. Patients commonly present with pain and stiffness in multiple joints, although one third of patients initially experience symptoms at just one location or a few scattered sites.

In most patients, symptoms emerge over weeks to months, starting with one joint and often accompanied by prodromal symptoms of anorexia, weakness, or fatigue. In approximately 15 percent of patients, onset occurs more rapidly over days to weeks. In 8 to 15 percent of patients, symptoms begin within a few days of a specific inciting event, such as an infectious illness. 14 Therefore, it is imperative to diagnose the disease and initiate treatment as soon as possible. The ACRSRA recommends that patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis be referred within three months of presentation for confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. 2 Therapeutic goals include preservation of function and quality of life, minimization of pain and inflammation, joint protection, and control of systemic complications. 2, 5 Figure 1 2, 4 outlines an approach to the treatment of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis.

Patients with mild disease and normal radiographic findings can begin treatment with hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, or minocycline, although methotrexate also is an option. Patients with more severe disease or radiographic changes should begin treatment with methotrexate. If symptoms are not adequately controlled, leflunomide, azathioprine, or combination therapy may be considered. Individual drug categories are discussed below.

### Current view on the pathogenic role of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis [^113AjYxE]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Key messages

Patient-derived anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) could modulate cells in culture and trigger pain and bone loss in mice.
In murine models, ACPAs exacerbated arthritis development in the presence of other inflammatory signals.
ACPAs might modulate cellular functions by directly ligating key citrullinated cell surface antigens or as part of immune complexes.
Despite their highly poly-specific and cross-reactive nature, different ACPA clones might have unique cellular targets and pathological roles.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease affecting close to 1% of the total population and having a heterogeneous clinical picture consisting of at least two different subsets with distinct genetic and environmental determinants. The main subset, comprising a majority of all cases, is the antibody-positive (or seropositive) RA and is characterised by the presence of antibodies reactive with the Fc-part of IgG (rheumatoid factor (RF)) and antibodies reactive to antigens that have been subjected to different post-translational modifications, mainly by citrullination (anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs)) but also other modifications (then termed anti-modified protein antibodies (AMPAs)). Autoimmunity and specifically ACPAs are triggered before the onset of joint inflammation in susceptible individuals carrying certain genetic variants in MHC class II genes and exposed to different environmental challenges. It has been suggested that this autoimmunity might have direct pathogenic effects. The current review will address the potential pathogenic roles of ACPAs in human disease and experimental models.

### Reactive arthritis following COVID-19: cause for concern [^113zP8Mn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Low-quality evidence suggests that COVID-19 may trigger reactive arthritis one to four weeks after the infection. Post COVID-19 reactive arthritis resolves within a few days, and no additional treatment is required. Established diagnostic or classification criteria for reactive arthritis are missing, and a deeper understanding of the immune mechanism related to COVID-19 prompt us to further investigate the immunopathogenic mechanisms capable of promoting or contrasting the development of specific rheumatic diseases. Caution should be exerted when managing post-infectious COVID-19 patient with arthralgia.

### Reactive arthritis after SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115xAaCt]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 has been recognised as a potential trigger of inflammatory arthritis in individuals with inflammatory rheumatic diseases as well as in previously unaffected individuals. However, new-onset arthritis after COVID-19 is a heterogeneous phenomenon that complicates differential diagnosis. For example, acute arthritis with features of viral arthritis has been reported after COVID-19, as has crystal-induced arthritis. Arthritides mimicking reactive arthritis (ReA) have also been described, but these patients often do not fulfil the typical features of ReA: several reports describe cases of patients older than 45 years at the onset of arthritis, and the characteristic genetic feature of ReA, HLA-B27, is rarely found. Because viral infections are much less likely to cause ReA than bacterial infections, and respiratory infections are rarely the cause of ReA, it is currently unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 can cause true ReA. Here, we report the case of a 30-year-old patient who presented with acute pain, swelling and redness in the left metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint and ankle 7 days after resolution of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diagnostics revealed arthritis of the MTP2, synovitis of the upper ankle with significant joint effusion and peritendinitis of the flexor tendons. Based on the clinical manifestations and diagnostic test results, ReA appeared to be the most likely cause. A screening for typical ReA-associated infections was negative. The patient was treated with NSAIDs and intra-articular and systemic glucocorticoids. At a follow-up visit after discontinuation of glucocorticoids, the patient was symptom-free. Overall, we observed a ReA with typical clinical, genetic and patient characteristics after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we conclude that a direct association with COVID-19 is highly plausible.

### Clostridioides difficile-related reactive arthritis: a scoping review of the literature [^113NutGh]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Reactive arthritis (ReA) is an inflammatory arthritis triggered by preceding infection. While various bacterial pathogens are well-established as causative agents, the role of Clostridioides difficile remains less elucidated. Α scoping review was conducted to evaluate the existing literature on CDI-induced ReA to determine clinical features, management, and disease trajectory. Sixty-one CDI-related ReA cases were identified (61% male, mean age 38.8 years). HLA-B27 positivity was 64% (30/47 tested). Prior antibiotic use was reported in 89% of cases, with arthritis onset 8.5 days post-CDI. Oligoarthritis predominated (41%), involving a median of 3 joints (knee 67%, ankle 44%, hand 26%). Extra-articular manifestations were present in 20%. Only 10% required treatment escalation to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Remission was achieved in 87% within 21 days, with 9% relapse rate. HLA-B27 positive patients had fewer affected joints (2 vs 5, p = 0.03) and older age at onset (43.1 vs 29.1, p = 0.02). Pediatric patients were more likely to experience hip arthritis than adults (54% vs 10%, p = 0.003). This study confirms CDI as a cause of ReA, highlighting its typically benign course with high remission rates. Further research is warranted, particularly regarding refractory cases.
