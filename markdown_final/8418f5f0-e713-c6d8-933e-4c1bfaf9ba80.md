## Question

Use of midodrine in critically ill patients with persistent hypotension

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of midodrine in critically ill patients with persistent hypotension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether midodrine is being used as a vasopressor-sparing adjunct in the ICU. Then, I should verify the regulatory status and labeled indications. Next, I will appraise the highest-quality randomized trial and reconcile it with meta-analytic data. After that, I need to assess safety signals, including bradycardia and supine hypertension. I will then consider special populations and dosing pragmatics. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable recommendation with monitoring and shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. Persistent hypotension in the ICU often reflects vasodilatory shock where patients still require low-dose intravenous vasopressors despite adequate resuscitation; the question is whether adding oral midodrine can accelerate weaning, reduce IV vasopressor duration, and shorten ICU length of stay without compromising safety, which is the scenario most consistently studied in the ICU literature [^83beedd8] [^edac768f].

> I need to check the regulatory status before discussing off-label use. Midodrine is FDA-approved for symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, not for vasopressor-dependent shock or ICU vasopressor weaning; its use in critically ill patients is off-label, which should be explicitly acknowledged in counseling and documentation [^396381ff] [^2fa7874f].

> Next, I should review the pivotal randomized evidence. The MIDAS multicenter RCT enrolled 132 patients on a single low-dose IV vasopressor for at least 24 hours and found no significant difference in time to vasopressor discontinuation between midodrine 20 mg every 8 hours and placebo, with a median difference of only 1 hour and no differences in secondary outcomes; importantly, bradycardia occurred more often with midodrine, which I should keep in mind for safety [^83beedd8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should reconcile this with meta-analytic data. Multiple contemporary systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that midodrine may reduce ICU length of stay, duration of IV vasopressor support, and possibly mortality, but these effects are based on low to very low certainty evidence and small RCTs; trial sequential analyses indicate the required information size has not been met, so imprecision remains substantial and conclusions should be cautious [^edac768f] [^bf2f544f] [^356faaf1].

> I should double-check safety signals. Bradycardia is the most consistently reported adverse effect across RCTs and observational studies, with pooled estimates suggesting a higher risk versus control; supine hypertension is a known class effect and is why guidelines advise avoiding late-evening dosing and monitoring supine blood pressure, which is particularly relevant in ICU patients with autonomic dysfunction or polypharmacy [^1ada3c92] [^5165574f] [^8fb1967d].

> Let me consider special populations where midodrine has been studied outside orthostatic hypotension. In cirrhosis with HRS-AKI, midodrine plus octreotide is generally considered inferior to terlipressin or norepinephrine and is reserved when first-line agents are unavailable; in end-stage heart failure, case-based evidence suggests potential utility for vasopressor weaning, but this remains low-quality and should be individualized with close monitoring [^677de491] [^6b80bcb7] [^a16c2819].

> I should confirm dosing pragmatics and pharmacokinetics. Most ICU studies used 10–20 mg orally three times daily, with peak effect of the active metabolite around 1–2 hours and duration roughly 4–6 hours; fixed dosing without renal or hepatic adjustment is a limitation of existing trials, and in practice I would start at 10 mg TID and titrate cautiously while watching for bradycardia and supine hypertension, avoiding bedtime doses to mitigate nocturnal hypertension [^d86adbef] [^71681f4d] [^5165574f].

> But wait, what if the patient is on beta-blockers or has autonomic failure; could that blunt efficacy or worsen bradycardia? The physiologic rationale remains sound because midodrine acts at alpha-1 receptors, but concomitant negative chronotropy could amplify bradycardia; I should monitor heart rate closely and consider dose reduction or discontinuation if significant bradycardia emerges, balancing the weaning goal against arrhythmic risk [^83beedd8] [^bf2f544f].

> Next, I should review real-world utilization patterns to gauge external validity. Large retrospective series show increasing off-label ICU use of midodrine with signals of reduced vasopressor burden and improved MAP, but these data are confounded by selection and immortal time bias; nonetheless, they align with the biological plausibility that oral alpha-agonism can supplement tapering IV vasopressors in stable, recovering patients [^e8554c75] [^4f85cac5].

> I will now examine practical implementation details. Midodrine is best considered after hemodynamic stabilization, when the patient is on low, stable doses of a single IV vasopressor, without active ischemia or tachyarrhythmias; I should document the off-label rationale, set a clear weaning plan, and arrange close monitoring for bradycardia and supine hypertension, with a low threshold to stop if adverse effects occur or if there is no meaningful reduction in IV vasopressor requirements within 24–48 hours [^83beedd8] [^71681f4d].

> Let me reconsider the overall balance of benefits and harms. Potential benefits include modest reductions in IV vasopressor duration and ICU length of stay with uncertain mortality effects, whereas harms include bradycardia and supine hypertension; given the neutral primary outcome in the best RCT and the low certainty of meta-analytic benefits, routine use cannot be recommended, but selective, time-limited trials in appropriately chosen patients may be reasonable with shared decision-making and explicit monitoring plans [^83beedd8] [^edac768f] [^bf2f544f].

> Final synthesis: I should confirm that my recommendation aligns with the evidence hierarchy. The highest-quality RCT shows no significant benefit on the primary endpoint, while meta-analyses of smaller studies suggest possible improvements in process outcomes with very low certainty; therefore, midodrine may be considered case-by-case as a short-term adjunct to facilitate vasopressor weaning in stable ICU patients after addressing reversible causes of hypotension, with careful monitoring for bradycardia and supine hypertension, and it should not replace guideline-directed ICU care or delay definitive management of the underlying shock etiology [^83beedd8] [^edac768f] [^71681f4d].

---

Midodrine is **not recommended for routine use** in critically ill patients with persistent hypotension because high-quality evidence shows no significant reduction in vasopressor duration or ICU length of stay [^83beedd8], and it may increase bradycardia risk [^1ada3c92]. While some meta-analyses suggest possible benefits, the certainty is low and results are inconsistent [^edac768f] [^bf2f544f]. Midodrine may be considered only in **select, hemodynamically stable patients** on low-dose vasopressors after addressing reversible causes, with close monitoring for bradycardia and supine hypertension [^396381ff] [^71681f4d]. It is not a substitute for guideline-directed vasopressor therapy and should not delay definitive management.

---

## Pharmacological rationale and mechanism of action

Midodrine is a **prodrug converted to desglymidodrine**, an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that increases vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure (MAP) [^d86adbef]. This mechanism underpins its use as a vasopressor-sparing agent in the ICU, theoretically allowing earlier weaning from IV vasopressors and reducing ICU length of stay (LOS) [^edac768f].

---

## Clinical evidence in critically ill patients

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

The most robust RCT, the MIDAS trial, included 132 patients and found **no significant reduction in time to vasopressor discontinuation** with midodrine versus placebo (median 23.5 vs 22.5 hours; p = 0.62) [^83beedd8]. There were also no differences in ICU discharge readiness, ICU or hospital LOS, or ICU readmission rates. Bradycardia occurred more often with midodrine (7.6% vs 0%; p = 0.02) [^83beedd8].

---

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses

Meta-analyses report conflicting results: some suggest possible reductions in ICU LOS, vasopressor duration, and mortality, but these effects are based on **low-certainty evidence** from small, heterogeneous studies [^edac768f] [^bf2f544f]. Trial sequential analyses indicate that the required sample sizes have not been met, underscoring the need for larger, high-quality RCTs [^356faaf1].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Midodrine is **generally well tolerated**, but clinically significant adverse effects have been reported in critically ill patients:

- **Bradycardia**: The most common adverse effect, occurring in approximately 7–10% of patients [^1ada3c92] [^e8554c75].
- **Supine hypertension**: A known risk, particularly in patients with autonomic dysfunction or those receiving high doses [^5165574f].
- **Bowel ischemia**: Rare but serious cases have been reported, prompting caution in patients with mesenteric hypoperfusion [^e8554c75].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Currently, **no major society guidelines recommend routine midodrine use** in critically ill patients with persistent hypotension. Its use remains off-label, and decisions should be individualized based on patient-specific factors and institutional protocols [^396381ff].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Midodrine may be considered in **select scenarios**, including:

- **Low-dose vasopressor dependence**: Patients stabilized on low-dose vasopressors (e.g. norepinephrine ≤ 8 mcg/min) without ongoing instability [^83beedd8].
- **Vasopressor weaning**: Patients with persistent hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction or chronic vasodilation, where midodrine may facilitate weaning [^notfound].
- **Resource-limited settings**: Where ICU beds are scarce, midodrine may be used to expedite transfer to lower-acuity care, though evidence is limited [^c3edfdd8].

---

## Practical considerations and monitoring

If midodrine is used, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor for bradycardia**: Regularly assess heart rate, especially in patients with baseline bradycardia or on beta-blockers [^1ada3c92].
- **Monitor for supine hypertension**: Avoid late-evening doses and consider dose adjustments if supine hypertension occurs [^5165574f].
- **Taper vasopressors cautiously**: Gradually reduce IV vasopressors while monitoring hemodynamics closely [^6660c0a3].

---

## Comparison with other vasopressors and adjunctive therapies

Midodrine is **less potent than IV vasopressors** (e.g. norepinephrine, vasopressin) and is not suitable for acute stabilization or high-dose vasopressor requirements. It may be considered as an adjunct in low-dose, weaning scenarios, but should not replace guideline-directed vasopressor therapy [^notfound].

---

## Current research gaps and future directions

Key gaps include **lack of large, multicenter RCTs** to definitively establish efficacy and safety, unclear optimal dosing and timing, and limited data on patient-centered outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Future research should prioritize these areas to clarify midodrine's role in the ICU [^edac768f].

---

Midodrine is **not recommended for routine use** in critically ill patients with persistent hypotension due to insufficient evidence of benefit and potential risks. It may be considered in select, stable patients on low-dose vasopressors after addressing reversible causes, with close monitoring for adverse effects.

Purpose

ICU discharge is often delayed by a requirement for intravenous vasopressor medications to maintain normotension. We hypothesised that the administration of midodrine, an oral α 1 -adrenergic agonist, as adjunct to standard treatment shortens the duration of intravenous vasopressor requirement.

Methods

In this multicentre, randomised, controlled trial including three tertiary referral hospitals in the US and Australia, we enrolled adult patients with hypotension requiring a single-agent intravenous vasopressor for ≥ 24 h. Subjects received oral midodrine (20 mg) or placebo every 8 h in addition to standard care until cessation of intravenous vasopressors, ICU discharge, or occurrence of adverse events. The primary outcome was time to vasopressor discontinuation. Secondary outcomes included time to ICU discharge readiness, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and ICU readmission rates.

Results

Between October 2012 and June 2019, 136 participants were randomised, of whom 132 received the allocated intervention and were included in the analysis (modified intention-to-treat approach). Time to vasopressor discontinuation was not different between midodrine and placebo groups (median [IQR], 23.5 [10–54] vs 22.5 [10.4–40] h; difference, 1 h; 95% CI-10.4 to 12.3 h; p = 0.62). No differences in secondary endpoints were observed. Bradycardia occurred more often after midodrine administration (5 [7.6%] vs 0 [0%], p = 0.02).

Conclusion

Midodrine did not accelerate liberation from intravenous vasopressors and was not effective for the treatment of hypotension in critically ill patients.

Background

Patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) are often treated with intravenous (IV) vasopressors. Persistent hypotension and dependence on IV vasopressors in otherwise resuscitated patients lead to delay in discharge from ICU. Midodrine is an oral alpha-1 adrenergic agonist approved for treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. This trial aims to evaluate whether oral administration of midodrine is an effective adjunct to standard therapy to reduce the duration of IV vasopressor treatment, and allow earlier discharge from ICU and hospital.

Methods

The MIDAS trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial being conducted in the USA and Australia. We are targeting 120 patients. Adult patients admitted to the ICU who are resuscitated and otherwise stable on low dose IV vasopressors for at least 24 h will be considered for recruitment. Participants will be randomized to receive midodrine (20 mg) or placebo three times a day, in addition to standard care. The primary outcome is time (hours) from initiation of midodrine or placebo to discontinuation of IV vasopressors. Secondary outcomes include time (hours) from ICU admission to discharge readiness, ICU length of stay (LOS) (days), hospital LOS (days), rates of ICU readmission, and rates of adverse events related to midodrine administration.

Discussion

Midodrine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. In August 2010, FDA proposed to withdraw approval of midodrine because of lack of studies that verify the clinical benefit of the drug. We obtained Investigational New Drug (IND 113,330) approval to study its effects in critically ill patients who require IV vasopressors but are otherwise ready for discharge from the ICU. A pilot observational study in a cohort of surgical ICU patients showed that the rate of decline in vasopressor requirements increased after initiation of midodrine treatment. We hypothesize that midodrine administration is effective to wean IV vasopressors and shorten ICU and hospital LOS. This trial may have significant implications on lowering costs of hospital care and obtaining FDA approval for new indications for midodrine.

The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether addition of midodrine to standard care reduces the time to discontinuation of IV vasopressor use. We will also study whether hospital and ICU LOS are decreased, as well as rates of ICU or high dependency unit (HDU) readmission, and rates of adverse events related to the use of midodrine (such as bradycardia and other hemodynamically significant arrhythmias).

Statistical analysis

The sample size estimation is informed by the previous observational study by Levine et al. In this study, the rates of vasopressor administration decreased by 38% from −0.62 ± 1.40 mcg/min per hour to −2.20 ± 2.45 mcg/min per hour after addition of midodrine. Based on a median time of 17 h from midodrine initiation to discontinuation of IV vasopressors, the 38% reduction translates to an estimated 6 h difference. 6 h is also thought to be a meaningful time frame in terms of reduction in duration of vasopressor treatment. Accordingly, we expect that a sample size of 50 subjects per group will provide us with > 80% probability (power) to detect a difference of 6 h in the primary outcome. Allowing for drop-out, our target sample size is 120.

The study analysis will be by intention to treat. We will analyze our data by using a Student's t -test to determine whether time from initiation of midodrine until discontinuation of IV vasopressors, time from ICU/HDU admission to ICU/HDU discharge readiness, and ICU and hospital LOS differs between groups. Using a Chi-Square test, we will test whether rates of ICU/HDU readmission and incidence of adverse events is different between treatment groups. Time-dependent survival analysis will be employed to assess relationships between addition of midodrine/placebo and ICU/hospital LOS, with mortality considered as the time-dependent covariate. A P value of < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All analyses will be conducted by a statistician blinded to intervention group assignment.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^d86adbef]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment with vasopressors is one of the most common reasons for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Persistent hypotension in otherwise resuscitated patients can be a delay to discharging patients from the ICU. The addition of oral midodrine may be a solution to reduce the duration of time the patient remains on IV vasopressors and ICU length of stay (LOS).

Midodrine, an oral alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, has approval by the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatmentof symptomatic orthostatic hypotension. Midodrine is a prodrug that is metabolized to form desglymidodrine, with peak blood levels of midodrine reached within 30 min and the active metabolite peaking about 1 to 2 h after administration. It has a relatively safe side effect profile with minimal central nervous system side effects, and good oral bioavailability.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^8fb1967d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

One limitation of this study is the fixed drug dosing. This was selected to simplify the protocol and it was shown to be safe during the pilot study. However, an individualized dose titrated according to renal or hepatic function may allow midodrine to be used in a wider range of patients. A second limitation is we do not have a standardized protocol with regards to blood pressure targets for initiation, escalation, or weaning of IV vasopressors. The different blood pressure goals set by the primary care team may confound the individual duration of vasopressor treatment. A third limitation is that we are not studying the use of this drug on the ward environment, which is another useful indication of midodrine in preventing ICU admission.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^66c6a3dd]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Screening and Data Extraction

We included studies if they met the following eligibility criteria: 1) patients with vasopressor-dependent shock, 2) ICU setting, 3) evaluated oral midodrine therapy compared with placebo or usual care, and 4) evaluated an outcome of interest. We included both adult and pediatric studies, all dosing regimens, and etiologies of vasopressor-dependent hypotension. We included only observational studies that had an exposure and control cohort, as well as RCTs. We further reviewed previous systematic reviews, narrative reviews, and meta-analyses to ensure we captured all relevant studies.

We identified eligible studies using a two-staged screening process. First, two investigators (S.J.K. F.H.) independently and in duplicate reviewed the titles and abstracts of all citations. Disagreements were discussed and adjudicated by a third author (O.G.R.) as needed. Second, the same two reviewers screened full texts for eligibility independently and in duplicate. Reasons for exclusion were captured in the second phase, and we resolved any disagreements during this stage using discussion and third-party adjudication, as needed.

We extracted data independently in duplicate using standardized data abstraction forms, which included the following specific variables: patient characteristics, age, sex, type of ICU, etiology of shock, number of patients, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and geographical location. We also captured the type, dose, and duration of IV vasopressors, any cointervention used (i.e. steroids use) in either the intervention or comparator groups and outcome data.

Risk of Bias Assessment

We assessed risk of bias of the included studies using the modified Cochrane tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa tool for observational studies. We used the GRADE framework to evaluate certainty in pooled outcome data based on the following domains: risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias. We assessed certainty as very low, low, moderate, or high. We used narrative statements to formulate findings in keeping with GRADE guidance.

Intervention

A target blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) or MAP) is determined by the treating physician at enrollment of each patient. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive midodrine 20 mg daily or placebo three times daily, in addition to continuation of the IV vasopressor, until the primary outcome (cessation of IV vasopressors) or an adverse event occurs. The study drug and placebo will be delivered in the form of non-identifying capsules, containing either the active ingredient midodrine, or lactose powder. All patients will receive usual supportive care (intravenous fluids, antibiotics etc.) as per the treating physicians and standard practice. A flowchart of the study procedures is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2
Flowchart of study procedures

The study drug will be delivered in a double-blind manner until:
Primary outcome is reached – cessation of IV vasopressors; or
Patient is discharged from the ICU; or
Patient develops further hypotension – requiring noradrenaline > 8 mcg/min, phenylephrine > 100 mcg/min, or metaraminol > 60 mcg/min; or
Adverse event occurs – subject develops signs and symptoms of organ failure or hypoperfusion, adverse events related to midodrine including serious allergic reaction, or death.

Blinding and randomization

The principal investigator or research coordinator at each participating site will enroll patients. All study personnel will be blinded, except the investigational pharmacist, to the treatment group of the subjects. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either midodrine or placebo. Randomization will be performed with the use of a computer-generated randomization list and will be stratified by site. An independent statistician not responsible for analyzing the data will create the allocation sequence. This list will be provided by the independent statistician directly to the compounding pharmacy. Individual patient's drug bottles will be labeled with site-specific randomization numbers, which will become the patient's study number. Study sites will dispense the study drug bottles sequentially to patients in the order that they are included in the study.

Outcomes

The primary outcome is time (hours) from initiation of midodrine or placebo to discontinuation of IV vasopressors. Secondary outcomes include time (hours) from ICU admission to discharge readiness, ICU LOS (days), hospital LOS (days), rates of readmission to ICU or HDU, and rates of adverse events related to midodrine administration. A cost consequence analysis will also be performed by a medical economist based on the ICU and hospital LOS.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d63e89e7]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, duration of IV vasopressor therapy, and mortality in critically ill patients. Midodrine may also be associated with increased risk of bradycardia, although this finding is based on very low certainty evidence. Current literature appears to show that midodrine may be beneficial in terms of improving patient-centered outcomes, although use of the vasoactive agent in the ICU may be best undertaken when warranted in specific clinical scenarios and under the direction of shared decision-making and values-based care, as further large-scale studies will be needed to guide routine use of adjunctive midodrine in the ICU.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^edac768f]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

The objective of this study was to summarize the safety and efficacy of midodrine as an IV vasopressor weaning agent in the ICU from the totality of published literature while utilizing Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations and trial sequential analysis (TSA) to determine the certainty of the evidence.
Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU length of stay (LOS), IV vasopressor support duration, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. The TSA-informed required sample size was not met for ICU LOS or IV vasopressor duration.
Midodrine administration in the ICU may serve to benefit patient-centered outcomes, although additional, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the routine use of midodrine as an adjunctive IV vasopressor weaning agent in the ICU.

Hemodynamic support with IV vasopressors is a common indication for ICU admission. Use of vasopressors contributes to approximately one-fourth of ICU admissions and one-fifth of ICU days. They are associated with adverse effects including tissue necrosis, cardiac dysfunction, and bowel ischemia. The presence of central venous catheters can lead to associated bloodstream infections, venous thrombosis, and impaired mobility. As patients recover, IV vasopressors may be their only indication for ICU admission. This may prolong their length of stay (LOS) and contribute to ICU strain.

While guidelines exist for IV vasopressors, no current guidance exists regarding use of oral therapies for vasopressor-dependent shock. There is limited data examining their role as IV vasopressor-sparing therapy. An effective oral adjunctive therapy could shorten the duration of IV vasopressors and liberate these patients earlier from the ICU. Midodrine-hydrochloride is a commonly used oral vasopressors and the alpha-agonist has previously been used to attenuate symptoms of orthostatic and intradialytic hypotension.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^54fd2e8d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Midodrine has previously been evaluated in a series of prospective trials for orthostatic hypotension. Jankovic et al. found a dose of 10 mg three times daily (TDS) increased standing systolic blood pressure by 22 mmHg versus placebo. Wright et al. conducted a dose response study and found that midodrine (10 mg and 20 mg) increased standing blood pressure compared with placebo.

Midodrine has also been studied in the setting of dialysis-induced hypotension, and administration of 2.5–10 mg prior to dialysis improved the symptoms of intradialytic hypotension and increased post-dialysis systolic blood pressure.

In the critical care environment, the authors have obtained an Investigational New Drug (IND) approval from the United States FDA (IND 113,330; date of receipt: September 12, 2011) to study its effects in patients who require low dose IV vasopressors following resuscitation. We then conducted an observational study on the use of oral midodrine to hasten weaning of IV vasopressors in a cohort of surgical ICU patients. In this prospective observational study, 20 patients who met surgical ICU discharge criteria except for persistent requirement for IV vasopressors (phenylephrine < 150 mcg/min or noradrenaline < 8 mcg/min) received oral midodrine (modal dose 20 mg, range 5–20 mg) TDS. Requirements for IV vasopressors were assessed following each of the first four doses of midodrine. The rates of decline of vasopressor requirement in the 12 h preceding midodrine, and from initiation of midodrine until 4 h post the fourth dose were calculated. 6 of 20 study patients were able to be weaned from vasopressors following the first dose of midodrine, increasing to 14 of 20 following the fourth dose. The rate of decline in vasopressor requirements increased from 0.62 mcg/min per hour to 2.20 mcg/min per hour (p = 0.012), meaning less IV vasopressor was required. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and total body fluid balance were not significantly different pre and post midodrine administration, suggesting that changes in hemodynamic status or fluid resuscitation were not responsible for the change in the rate of decline in vasopressor requirements.

Discussion

This article presents the protocol and data analysis plan for the MIDAS trial; an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the addition of midodrine to IV vasopressor treatment in otherwise stable ICU patients.

Midodrine, an oral alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, was approved for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension under the United States FDA's accelerated approval regulations in 1996. In August 2010, the FDA proposed to withdraw approval because of the lack of post-approval studies that confirm the clinical benefit of the drug. It was the first time the agency had issued such a notice. Subsequent to support for its use from patients, doctors and professional organizations, the FDA reversed its decision to withdraw approval, but this decision was met with mixed response.

Over recent years, there has been increasing interest in using midodrine to help patients wean off or avoid IV vasopressors. The drug has a reasonable safety profile, its main side effects being pilomotor reaction, urinary retention, and supine hypertension. The use of an oral vasopressor such as midodrine in addition to IV vasopressors in otherwise resuscitated and stable ICU patients has several reasons for attractiveness. Firstly, it helps to avoid some of the potential complications of administering IV vasopressors, such as risks of central line insertion and catheter-related bloodstream infections. Secondly, they may help to shorten the duration of IV vasopressor treatment, and hence reduce ICU length of stay and ICU-acquired complications. This has significant cost implications for the patient and hospital.

We communicated directly with the United States FDA and obtained IND approval to study the use of midodrine in the ICU setting. In our pilot observational study, we detected that midodrine treatment was associated with an increase in the magnitude of decline of the IV vasopressor rate. This pilot study offered promising data, but was limited in its small sample size (20 patients) and lack of a control group. We designed the MIDAS trial as a pragmatic clinical trial to study its use in routine patient care conditions. We have designed the inclusion and exclusion criteria so they can be applied to a broad clinical setting across a wide range of patients. We hope to improve the generalizability of our results by carrying out the study in a multicentric design.

Adverse events

Adverse events will be recorded daily. Nursing charts and documentation, as well as physicians' notes will be reviewed daily to identify potential adverse events. Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases chronologically associated with midodrine or placebo administration. The relationship of any adverse event to the study drug will be assessed by the investigator and qualified by strength of association (not related, unlikely related, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related) and severity of the event (mild, moderate or severe). All adverse events will be summarized by the study staff and, where appropriate, reported to the local human research committee. Serious adverse events (SAE) are hypertension (increase in SBP 20% higher than the predefined goal set by the primary team, or > 160 mmHg), bradycardia (decrease in heart rate 20% lower than the predefined goal set by the primary team or < 40 beats per minute), hemodynamically significant tachyarrythmias (resulting in drop in SBP > 20 mmHg), or new organ failure (evidence of inadequate organ oxygenation, liver and renal failure as per definitions in exclusion criteria).

Data and safety monitoring board

Data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) has been created and comprises of physicians with relevant critical care experience. The members are not involved in the study and will be completely independent of any study-related patient recruitment and data collection.

Methods

Study design and setting

This study will be an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial. An outline of the study design is provided in Fig. 1. Study recruitment commenced in October 2012 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, United States of America. We started enrolling patients at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Western Australia in 2016. There is expectation of expansion to another academic medical center. The trial is expected to be completed by June 2017.

Fig. 1
Outline of study design

The IND application for midodrine (IND 113,330) was approved by the United States FDA on Sep 12, 2011. A notification to conduct the trial under the Clinical Trials Notification (CTN) Scheme (Application ID CT-2016-CTN-00226-1 v3) was acknowledged by the Australian Government Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Ethics approval has been sought and obtained from the ethics committees of participating hospitals (Partners IRB Protocol #2011P002049, and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital HREC Protocol #2015–098).

Study population

A local investigator will screen ICU patients daily. Adult patients admitted to the ICU or HDU who are hypotensive and requiring IV vasopressors will be considered for the study. A total of 120 patients will be recruited.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

All adult patients who are hypotensive (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) and require IV vasopressors for more than 24 h are eligible for study inclusion. They should be otherwise resuscitated and have stable blood pressure on single agent infusion of noradrenaline < 8 mcg/min, or phenylephrine < 100 mcg/min, or metaraminol < 60 mcg/min). Table 1 outlines the exclusion criteria.

### Midodrine as adjunctive support for treatment of refractory hypotension in the intensive care unit: a multicenter, randomized, placebo controlled trial (the MIDAS trial) [^7497e5ba]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Cardenas et al. reported on the use of midodrine to wean requirement of IV vasopressors in a medical ICU population. During a six month period, 50 patients who met discharge criteria except for the use of low to moderate dose of a single IV vasopressor were administered oral midodrine (average initial and maximal doses 30.5 mg and 66.6 mg per day). Midodrine was continued on the ward and reduced as tolerated by the admitting team. No adverse effects were observed. In this study, 27 (54%) of the patients were discharged from the hospital on midodrine (average dose 17.8 mg per day). Another recent retrospective study from a medical ICU included 275 patients over one year, with a diagnosis of septic shock and required at least 24 h of IV vasopressors, who were stable or on reducing doses of IV vasopressors. The authors compared patients on IV vasopressors only to those who received IV vasopressors plus adjunctive midodrine (with a starting dose of 10 mg TDS) and showed a reduction in the mean IV vasopressor duration (2.9 days versus 3.8 days, p < 0.001) and reduced ICU length of stay (7.5 versus 9.4 days, p = 0.017) in the IV vasopressor plus midodrine group.

There are also a case report and two case series of the use of midodrine to wean from or prevent the need for IV vasopressors. O'Donnell reported on the use of midodrine 10 mg TDS to wean a patient from noradrenaline infusion post C7 to T6 laminectomy for spinal cord compression secondary to a leukemic deposit. Sharma reported the use of oral midodrine 10 mg TDS to wean IV dopamine infusions in three patients with hypotension secondary to myocardial stunning post percutaneous coronary intervention. Sharma also reported on the use of oral midodrine for hypotension post carotid artery stenting. Four patients with persistent hypotension post carotid artery stenting were successfully treated with midodrine 10 mg TDS, avoiding the requirement for ICU admission (the preceding 11 cases required IV dopamine infusions in ICU).

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^22b55cdb]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

LIMITATIONS AND STRENGTHS

We recognize several limitations of this systematic review. First, the included studies contain significant heterogeneity. In observational studies, the midodrine dosing regimens are inconsistent and the studies did not follow a previously established protocol. For RCTs, bias is shown with long recruitment periods and small sample size. We incorporated these factors into our GRADE ratings. Second, clinical heterogeneity existed between studies in setting, patient population, and outcome assessment. Specifically, midodrine was studied in different phases of shock, contributing to clinical heterogeneity across included studies. Any future large-scale study should focus on a particular phase of shock. There may also exist additional subgroups to be considered (e.g. type of initial vasopressor, etiology of shock, etc.). Unfortunately, it was not possible to evaluate these in our study; however, these should be considered in future study. Finally, studies did not routinely report on AEs such as ICU readmissions, which could possibly influence the utility of midodrine in the ICU. We also had several strengths, including use of the GRADE framework to evaluate the certainty of findings, and TSA to determine if the optimal information size was met. Finally, our review is the largest and most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of midodrine in critically ill patients to date, effectively evaluating the totality of published evidence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We registered and published the protocol for this review on the PROSPERO (CRD42021260375; July 16, 2021). We followed the standards of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis statement.

Data Source and Search Methods

We developed the search strategy with a research librarian, which was independently peer-reviewed by a second librarian. We searched the following electronic databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library (via Wiley) from inception to September 14, 2023. We incorporated search terms related to shock, vasopressors, intensive care, and midodrine. We also searched for meeting abstracts from the past 2 years using Conference Proceedings Citation Index (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA) and by handsearching published proceedings from the following associations: Society of Critical Care Medicine, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, and International Symposium of Intensive and Emergency Medicine. We imported search results into Covidence software (Melbourne, Australia;).

Outcome Measures

We examined the following primary outcomes of interest: 1) ICU LOS, 2) hospital LOS, 3) duration of IV vasopressor therapy, 4) ICU mortality, and 5) hospital mortality. Our secondary outcome was clinically important adverse events (AEs) as defined by individual studies.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6d990b07]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies have evaluated the use of midodrine for vasopressor support in the ICU. Observational studies have used inconsistent administration protocols, demonstrating variable results; small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated no difference between placebo and midodrine in IV vasopressor duration or ICU LOS. The small sample sizes of previous studies have resulted in the need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. While other systematic reviews have been conducted, they did not use Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE), lacked subgroup analysis, and did not perform trial sequential analysis (TSA). Further, previous reviews have not included the latest studies, evaluated only RCTs, or only observational studies.

The primary objective of this study was to summarize the efficacy of midodrine as an adjunctive medication in the ICU from the totality of published literature. Our secondary objective was to report on the safety of midodrine.

Data collection

Baseline descriptive data collection will occur on day of enrolment and includes age, gender, ethnicity, APACHE II score, admission diagnosis, pre-existing co-morbidities (diabetes, coronary artery disease, asthma, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, psychiatric disease, musculoskeletal disease, and others) obtained from the subject, the subject's family, and the subject's medical chart. Baseline laboratory data will be recorded (hemoglobin, white cell count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), international normalized ratio (INR), bilirubin, urea, creatinine, troponin, lactate). While in the study, hourly blood pressure, heart rate, dose of intravenous vasopressor and daily SOFA score will be recorded. The main outcome measure, time in hours from initiation of midodrine until discontinuation of IV vasopressors, will be recorded. To assess for potential confounders, we will also record presence, and time of removal, of epidural anesthesia, and any blood transfusion. At the time of ICU discharge, the following variables will be collected: time of ICU discharge readiness and ICU LOS. After discharge, follow-up variables will be rates of ICU readmission and hospital LOS and any other complications. Data will be uploaded to a secure database (REDCap). Data stored on REDCap are coded without protected information. The center at Massachusetts General Hospital owns the REDCap database, and is responsible for all data entry and monitoring.

Safety

The patient will be kept in the ICU for observation for 24 h following cessation of study drug to reduce the likelihood of hypotension or other side effects on discharge. If the blood pressure goal is met for more than 24 h without IV vasopressors, the study drug will be discontinued prior to discharge to the ward. The accepting team will be informed on discharge that the patient had received a study drug. Instructions will be given to medical and nursing staff to contact a physician investigator if the subject becomes hypotensive in the 24 h after ICU discharge (defined as a SBP < 90 mmHg).

Regarding medical management for orthostatic hypotension, more specifically with respect to midodrine, EFNS 2006 guidelines recommend to administer midodrine (2.5 mg PO TID, increasing gradually up to 10 mg PO TID) as first-line treatment, either alone or combined with fludrocortisone.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3f80775f]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

An unexpected finding was the seeming decrease in mortality with midodrine, albeit based on low certainty evidence. This is an intriguing finding as previous studies evaluating the use of differing vasopressors have not revealed an effect on mortality. However, this was derived from only two RCTs involving 88 patients. While potentially an important finding, it remains exploratory in nature.

Regarding the safety of midodrine, the data for AEs provided a limited ability to interpret the impact of midodrine use compared with control. However, their appeared to be a higher occurrence of bradycardia with midodrine compared with placebo. Three of the included studies reported a significant higher occurrence of bradycardia with midodrine when compared with placebo. Any future use or study of midodrine should ensure appropriate consideration and monitoring for this potential adverse effect.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c3edfdd8]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Should adjuvant oral therapies improve patient outcomes like ICU LOS, these results could serve to inform practice guidelines pertaining to vasopressor-dependent shock. Decreasing ICU LOS would increase capacity and decrease ICU strain, it would also ensure that critically ill patients could receive care in the most appropriate setting. Previous studies have suggested that increasing turnover in the ICU is crucial, allowing earlier exposure to interventions in the ICU capable of influencing patient outcomes. Additionally, during times of decreased bed availability ICUs are forced to ration resources, however, those refused admission based on perceived need are then met with an increased risk of death while in hospital. An adjunctive therapy, such as midodrine for IV vasopressor-dependent shock, could potentially improve patient disposition, and ensure that ICU capacity is maintained for those that require this level of care.

DISCUSSION

This meta-analysis and systematic review evaluated the efficacy of midodrine as an oral adjuvant therapy for critically ill patients requiring IV vasopressor therapy. Pooled data from RCTs showed that adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, vasopressor support duration, as well as both ICU and hospital mortality. Conversely, midodrine had a very low certainty of effect on hospital LOS and AEs. While the decrease in ICU LOS is based on low certainty data, the mean duration of stay was less for the midodrine group by just over 1 day (MD, 1.01 d), which has been previously identified as a minimal clinically important difference for ICU LOS. Further studies will be necessary to increase the precision of these findings.

Despite pooled data from the RCTs showing a signal toward reduced LOS in the midodrine group, this signal was not apparent when considering the totality of evidence gathered. Pooled data from observational studies evaluating this outcome was inconsistent with that of the RCTs, however of lower certainty and therefore should not inform conclusions. These findings speak to the biological plausibility of midodrine. A decrease in vasopressor duration likely indicates a reduced need for support, possibly shortening the ongoing need for ICU admission. While these findings confirm the potential scientific rationale, there remain several possible reasons we have not found a significant association between midodrine and a shorter ICU LOS. First, as evident by our TSA, sample size may not be sufficient. Second, there may be other factors leading to the determination of discharge, including when the decision to discharge is made, how ICU LOS is being recorded, and what factors may affect actual ICU discharge (e.g. bed availability). Third, patients may have other indications to remain in the ICU such as ventilatory support or close monitoring.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bf2f544f]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

To summarize the efficacy of midodrine as an adjunctive therapy in critically ill patients. Safety of midodrine was assessed as a secondary outcome.

DATA SOURCES:

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using a peer-reviewed search strategy combining the themes of vasopressor-dependent shock, critical care, and midodrine and including MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane library databases until September 14, 2023.

STUDY SELECTION:

We included studies if they: 1) included patients with vasopressor-dependent shock, 2) were performed in the ICU, 3) evaluated oral midodrine therapy compared with placebo or usual care, and 4) evaluated one of the outcomes of interest.

DATA EXTRACTION:

We extracted data independently in duplicate using standardized data abstraction forms, which included the following specific variables: patient characteristics, age, sex, type of ICU, etiology of shock, number of patients, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and geographical location. We also captured the type, dose, and duration of IV vasopressors, any cointervention used, and outcome data.

DATA SYNTHESIS:

We identified seven randomized controlled trials (six included in the pooled analysis) and ten observational studies (four included in the pooled analysis) that met eligibility criteria. Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU length of stay (LOS) and there is low certainty of effect on hospital LOS. Midodrine may decrease IV vasopressor support duration, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. Pooled observational data was based on very low certainty data for all outcomes of interest. The trial sequential analysis-informed required sample size was not met for ICU LOS or IV vasopressor duration and this contributed to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessments of imprecision for both outcomes.

CONCLUSIONS:

Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, duration of IV vasopressor therapy, and mortality in critically ill patients. However, required sample sizes was not met to determine our outcomes of interest. Midodrine may increase risk of bradycardia. While midodrine may provide benefit for patient-centered outcomes, due to increased risk of adverse events, further large-scale studies are needed to inform and guide its routine use in the ICU.

RESULTS

Study Characteristics

Study details are summarized in Table 1. Of 982 citations identified in the search, we included 17 eligible studies (seven RCTs and ten observational studies) (Fig. 1). Studies only presented in abstract form were not included in the pooled analysis. Only adult patient studies were identified. Study outcomes are summarized in Table 2.

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis diagram illustrating the search and selection process applied for all studies included and excluded over the course of our systematic review. RCT = randomized controlled trial.

Study Quality

The risk of bias attributed to the RCTs was judged as moderate or high, whereas the observational studies were judged to have a high risk of bias (Supplementary File 1, Table S1). Regarding the RCTs, it was found that with a low certainty of assessment midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, duration of vasopressor support, and mortality (Supplementary File 2, Table S2 a). With a very low certainty of evidence midodrine may decrease hospital LOS and increase AEs. Observational studies showed very low certainty evidence for our selected outcomes (Supplementary File 2, Table S2 b).

Midodrine Dosing Protocol

In the included RCTs, oral midodrine dosing was most consistently administered at 10 mg three times per day (TID) (n = 5) with only one RCT dosing at 20 mg TID. Of the observational studies, only five followed a defined dosing protocol (n = 4 at 10 mg; n = 1 at 20 mg) (Table 1).

### Trends in use of midodrine in the ICU: a single-center retrospective case series [^e8554c75]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Midodrine is an oral alpha-agonist approved for orthostatic hypotension. The use of midodrine as a vasopressor sparing agent has steadily increased in the ICU despite limited evidence for its safety in that setting. We describe the trends in use and reported side effects and complications of midodrine in multidisciplinary ICUs of a tertiary care institution.

Design

Single-center retrospective case series.

Setting

Medical and surgical ICU patients from January 2011 to October 2016 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester.

Patients

Adult patients admitted to any ICU who received midodrine for hypotension were eligible.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We reviewed the mean arterial pressures and cumulative vasopressor dose before and after midodrine administration and assessed for reported complications. During the study period, a total of 1,119 patients were initiated on midodrine, 56% in surgical ICUs, 42% in medical ICUs, and 2% in a mixed medical and surgical neurology ICU. There was a significant decrease in the number of patients on vasopressors 24 hours after initiation of midodrine (663 to 344; p < 0.001); among the patients that remained on vasopressors, there was a significant decrease in the median cumulative vasopressor dose (p = 0.002). There was a significant increase in median mean arterial pressure 24 hours after initiation of midodrine among patients who were not on vasopressors (65–68; p < 0.01). Asymptomatic bradycardia (heart rate < 50 beats/min) was the most common side effect (n = 172 patients, median 39 beats/min). Two patients developed bowel ischemia after initiation of midodrine that prompted discontinuation of midodrine in one case. Evaluating trends of utilization, the off-label use of midodrine has increased steadily over the years across ICUs.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that midodrine is being increasingly used as an adjunct to increase mean arterial pressure and facilitate weaning of vasopressors in the ICU. Prospective trials are required to further establish the appropriate timing, efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of midodrine use in ICU patients.

### Midodrine for severe orthostatic hypotension [^ac0018ea]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2016). Low credibility.

Midodrine (Bramox-Brancaster Pharma Limited) was authorised in the UK by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in March 2015 for "the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension due to autonomic dysfunction in adults when corrective factors have been ruled out and other forms of treatment are inadequate".(1) Previously, midodrine had only been available in the UK as an unlicensed product used on a named-patient basis. It is the first drug to be licensed in the UK for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension. Here we consider the evidence for midodrine in the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension and how it fits with current management strategies.

### Midodrine in end-stage heart failure [^a16c2819]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2023). High credibility.

It is estimated that 5% of patients with heart failure (HF) will progress to end-stage disease refractory to medical therapy and might require prolonged hospitalisation with inotropic support. We present the case of a patient with end-stage HF who was admitted with cardiogenic shock. During his hospitalisation, he required prolonged intravenous vasopressor therapy due to refractory hypotension. He did not qualify for heart transplantation or left ventricular-assist device strategies. Midodrine was started as a last resort attempt to wean off vasopressors. After 5 days of therapy, the patient was weaned entirely off vasopressors and was discharged home for hospice care. By the time of discharge, he was tolerating low-dose carvedilol along with midodrine. We propose midodrine as a reasonable alternative for patients with end-stage HF with reduced ejection fraction and refractory hypotension, who are dependent on intravenous vasoactive drugs and are not candidates for advanced HF therapies.

ICU and Hospital Mortality

The use of midodrine may decrease in-hospital mortality (pooled RCT data RR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.45–0.94]; low certainty) (Supplementary File 3, Fig. S1 a,), although there was a very low certainty of effect from observational studies (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.33–3.00]; very low certainty) (Supplementary File 3, Fig. S1 b).

Adverse Events

Two RCTs reported on overall AEs, showing no significant difference between the midodrine and the control groups with very low certainty (Supplementary File 4, Fig. S2). Bradycardia was the most reported AE. It was reported in one RCT (n = 5, 7.6% vs. n = 0), and three observational studies (n = 26, 16.5% vs. n = 83, 17.5%; n = 4, 21.1% vs. n = 1, 2.4%; and n = 13, 29.5% vs. n = 52, 14.9% in midodrine vs. control, respectively). Details of the AEs are presented in Table 2.

Pooled analysis showed that midodrine had a very low certainty of effect on AEs based on data from RCTs (Supplementary File 2, Table 2S a). It was not possible to evaluate this effect in observational studies.

Subgroup and Sensitivity Analysis

Of those identified a priori (septic vs. nonseptic, surgical vs. nonsurgical, cirrhotic vs. noncirrhotic), we were only able to identify septic vs. nonseptic patients from the identified studies. We did not find evidence of subgroup effect based on septic vs. other etiologies of shock (Supplementary File 5, Fig. S3). A sensitivity analysis was completed (Supplementary File 6, Table S3,), although the results of this were unremarkable.

### Continuation of newly initiated midodrine therapy after intensive care and hospital discharge: a single-center retrospective study [^bcbb9032]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Midodrine is an α1-agonist approved for orthostatic hypotension. Recently, it has received attention as an oral vasopressor to facilitate ICU discharge. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of continuation of newly initiated midodrine upon ICU and hospital discharge and identify risk factors associated with its occurrence.

Design

Single-center retrospective study.

Setting

ICU patients from January 2011 to October 2016 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester.

Patients

Adult patients admitted to any ICU who received new midodrine for hypotension and survived to discharge.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

During the study period, 1,010 patients were newly started on midodrine and survived to ICU discharge. Midodrine was continued in 67% (672/1,010) of patients at ICU discharge. Admission to cardiovascular surgery ICU and mixed medical/surgical ICU was a risk factor for midodrine continuation at ICU discharge (odds ratio, 3.94 [2.50–6.21] and 2.03 [1.29–3.20], respectively). At hospital discharge, 34% (311/909) of patients were continued on midodrine therapy. History of congestive heart failure predicted midodrine continuation at hospital discharge (odds ratio, 1.49 [1.05–2.12]). Hypertension and use of mechanical ventilation were associated with a decreased odds of midodrine prescription at both ICU and hospital discharge. Of those discharged from the ICU or hospital on midodrine, 50% were concomitantly prescribed antihypertensives. Discharge from the ICU on midodrine was associated with a significantly shorter ICU length of stay (7.5 ± 8.9 vs 10.6 ± 13.4 d) and reduced risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.32–0.70]; p < 0.001), despite no difference in baseline severity of illness scores. In contrast, patients discharged from the hospital on midodrine had a higher risk of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.26–2.04]; p < 0.001).

Conclusions

This study established a high prevalence of midodrine continuation in transitions of care. The risks and benefits of this practice remain unclear. Future studies should explore the impact of this practice on patient outcomes and resource utilization. These insights could be used to model interventions for proper tapering, discontinuation, or follow-up of new start midodrine.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^396381ff]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

A recently published meta-analysis found that midodrine was not associated with a decrease in ICU LOS, hospital LOS, mortality, or ICU readmissions, although five of six studies included were retrospective cohort studies, thus limiting the ability to form conclusions given the increased risk of bias. Furthermore, the studies included were found to be low quality, having not employed defined dosing protocols, with considerable heterogeneity between the included patients and outcomes reported. This previous review did not evaluate the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE framework or use TSA. In our systematic review, the use of the TSA and GRADE framework for summarizing the evidence highlighted the limitations of previous research.

Further study of adjunctive midodrine for vasopressor weaning is necessary to provide clarity to an increasingly inconclusive practice. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides low certainty evidence supporting that midodrine may reduce ICO LOS and time on IV vasopressors. However, adequate sample size was not reached when pooling results from the included studies as per our TSA. Additionally, increased risk of AEs, specifically bradycardia, with midodrine was found. Off-label use of midodrine in the critical care setting is a relatively common practice, as evidenced by the studies consolidated for this systematic review. This off-label use remains inconsistent in the timing of midodrine administration, dosing regimens, and discontinuation practices. Current evidence shows that adjunctive midodrine may be beneficial in terms of patient-centered outcomes when used as an oral vasopressor weaning agent. To this end, and considering midodrine may be associated with increased risk of AEs such as bradycardia, further study will be required to guide routine use of midodrine in critically ill patients and to determine if there is clinical merit to its application in the ICU. Until a definitive recommendation can be made, use of midodrine in the ICU should be undertaken based on shared decision-making between the provider and patient in the context of their own specific values, or that of the family, and the understanding that the medication is being used off-label.

Orthostatic hypotension pharmacologic therapy — midodrine and fludrocortisone are described with dosing, effects, and supporting evidence: Midodrine is stated to be "a useful addition to the first-line treatment in patients with chronic ANF" and that "midodrine increases BP in both supine and upright posture and that it ameliorates the symptoms of OH"; "Midodrine (5–20 mg, three times daily) has been shown to be effective in three randomized placebo-controlled trials". Fludrocortisone is presented as "Fludrocortisone (0.1–0.3 mg once daily) is a mineralocorticoid that stimulates renal sodium retention and expands fluid volume", with evidence "from two small observational studies (in combination with head-up sleeping) and one double-blind trial in 60 patients", in which treated patients "were less symptomatic with higher blood pressures".

Data Analysis

We evaluated data from observational studies and RCTs separately in keeping with Cochrane guidance. We present continuous data using means and, and as relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, both with 95% CIs. For studies that did not report mean andfor continuous outcomes, we used methods for transformation as recommended by the Cochrane handbook for systematic review. We performed all meta-analyses using RevMan V.5.4 software (Copenhagen, Denmark: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, 2014) using the method of DerSimonian and Laird to pool effect sizes for each outcome using a random-effects model and inverse variance weighting. Studies published as abstract only were excluded from pooled analysis. We assessed for statistical heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic, the chi-square test for homogeneity (p < 0.1 for significance of substantial heterogeneity), and visual inspection of the forest plots. For the presentation of results, we have primarily focused on the pooled data with a higher certainty of evidence. We performed subgroup analysis comparing patients with septic shock to those with shock from an alternative etiology. Sensitivity analysis was performed for included studies specifically for their impact on heterogeneity.

Trial Sequential Analysis

We conducted TSA using a random-effects model for ICU LOS and duration of IV vasopressor therapy. For the TSA, we used a statistical significance level of 5%, a power of 80%, and an RR reduction of 10% to represent a clinically important difference. We used a model variance-based heterogeneity correction and performed analysis using TSA V.0.9.5.10 beta software (Copenhagen Trial Unit, Centre for Clinical Intervention Research, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark).

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^3b16ce8c]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Norepinephrine and other vasoconstrictors — comparative effectiveness and practical use: studies comparing norepinephrine with terlipressin for the treatment of HRS1 showed noninferiority of norepinephrine in reversing HRS1, and this was confirmed by meta-analysis. A recent non-ICU study used low-dose norepinephrine (starting dose: 5 μg/min, maximum dose: 10 μg/min) with cardiac monitoring to reach an MAP > 10 mm hg above baseline value and achieved a complete response in six out of 20 patients with a partial response in three additional patients. Another oral vasoconstrictor, midodrine (dosed 7.5–15 mg orally three times daily) combined with octreotide is inferior to a continuous infusion of terlipressin as a treatment for HRS1 but can be safely used in a monitored setting.

ICU Length of Stay

When compared with IV vasopressors alone, adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU LOS (mean difference [MD], 1.01 d less [95% CI, 2.23 d less to 0.22 d more]; low certainty) (Fig. 2 A), while the pooled data from observational studies was of very low certainty (MD, 0.22 d more [95% CI, 1.45 d less to 1.90 d more]; very low certainty) (Fig. 2 B). In TSA of ICU LOS, the optimal information size (n = 1124) has not been reached despite the trend toward favoring midodrine (Fig. 3 A).

### Midodrine hydrochloride (midodrine HCl) [^46779818]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Midodrine hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH). Because midodrine hydrochloride tablets can cause marked elevation of supine blood pressure (BP > 200 mmHg systolic), it should be used in patients whose lives are considerably impaired despite standard clinical care, including non-pharmacologic treatment (such as support stockings), fluid expansion and lifestyle alterations. The indication is based on midodrine hydrochloride tablet's effect on increases in 1-minute standing systolic blood pressure, a surrogate marker considered likely to correspond to a clinical benefit. At present, however, clinical benefits of midodrine hydrochloride tablets, principally improved ability to perform life activities, have not been established. Further clinical trials are underway to verify and describe the clinical benefits of midodrine hydrochloride tablets.

After initiation of treatment, midodrine hydrochloride tablets should be continued only for patients who report significant symptomatic improvement.

### Midodrine appears to be safe and effective for dialysis-induced hypotension: a systematic review [^1bec5c86]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Dialysis-induced hypotension is an important complication of haemodialysis. Midodrine is an oral alpha-1 agonist that has been used in several small studies to prevent intradialytic hypotension (IDH).

Methods

The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, ASN conference proceedings, and references of potentially relevant articles, and contacted industry (Shire Pharmaceuticals) for unpublished data. Observational studies, randomized controlled trials, crossover studies and pre- and post-intervention design studies with ≥ 5 haemodialysis patients were included. Study outcomes assessed were: hypotensive symptoms, changes in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure, dry weight and length of stay after treatment. Data were abstracted on: study design, patient characteristics, intradialytic changes in blood pressure, nadir blood pressure and symptom improvement with midodrine. Thirty-seven full text articles were retrieved and nine met the selection criteria, in addition to one unpublished study. Midodrine dosing regimens ranged from 2.5 to 10 mg of midodrine given 15–30 min before dialysis.

Results

Post-dialysis systolic blood pressure was higher by 12.4 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.5–17.7] and diastolic pressure was higher by 7.3 mmHg (95% CI 3.7–10.9) during midodrine treatment vs control. Likewise, the nadir systolic blood pressure was higher by 13.3 mmHg (95% CI 8.6–18.0), with a difference in nadir diastolic pressure of 5.9 mmHg (95% CI 2.7–9.1). Six of 10 studies report improvement in symptoms of IDH, and there were no reported serious adverse events ascribed to midodrine.

Conclusions

This systematic review would suggest that midodrine has a role in the therapy of haemodialysis patients experiencing IDH. This conclusion must be viewed with caution, however, given the quality and sample size of the studies included in this review.

### The impact of midodrine tapering versus nontapering regimens on the clinical outcomes of critically ill patients: a retrospective cohort study [^6660c0a3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Midodrine has been used in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting to reduce the time to vasopressor discontinuation. The limited data supporting midodrine use have led to variability in the pattern of initiation and discontinuation of midodrine.

Objectives

To compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 midodrine discontinuation regimens during weaning vasopressors in critically ill patients.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City. Included patients were adults admitted to ICU who received midodrine after being unable to be weaned from intravenous vasopressors for more than 24 hours. Patients were categorized into two subgroups depending on the pattern of midodrine discontinuation (tapered dosing regimen vs. nontapered regimen). The primary endpoint was the incidence of inotropes and vasopressors re-initiation after midodrine discontinuation.

Results

The incidence of inotropes or vasopressors' re-initiation after discontinuation of midodrine was lower in the tapering group (15.4%) compared with the non-tapering group (40.7%) in the crude analysis as well as regression analysis (odd ratio [OR] = 0.15; 95% CI = 0.03, 0.73, P = 0.02). The time required for the antihypertensive medication(s) initiation after midodrine discontinuation was longer in patients who had dose tapering (beta coefficient (95% CI): 3.11 (0.95, 5.28), P = 0.005). Moreover, inotrope or vasopressor requirement was lower 24 hours post midodrine initiation. In contrast, the two groups had no statistically significant differences in 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality, or ICU length of stay.

Conclusion and Relevance

These real-life data showed that tapering midodrine dosage before discontinuation in critically ill patients during weaning from vasopressor aids in reducing the frequency of inotrope or vasopressor re-initiation. Application of such a strategy might be a reasonable approach among ICU patients unless contraindicated.

### Droxidopa or atomoxetine for refractory hypotension in critically ill cardiothoracic surgery patients [^d20faf1b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects of droxidopa or atomoxetine on intravenous (IV) vasoactive agent discontinuation in cardiothoracic intensive care unit (ICU) patients with hypotension refractory to midodrine.

Design

Single-center, retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Tertiary- and quaternary-care university teaching hospital.

Participants

Included patients who received at least 4 consecutive doses of droxidopa or atomoxetine and remained on concurrent midodrine. Patients were excluded if they received study medication before admission, had clinical deterioration after study medication initiation requiring additional vasoactives/escalation of IV vasoactive dosage for at least 12 hours, had a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome, were prisoners, or were pregnant.

Interventions

Droxidopa, atomoxetine, or both.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary endpoint was time to discontinuation of IV vasoactive agents after initiation of study medication, analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier estimate with the Wilcoxon method, censoring death within 24 hours of the last dose of study medication. No adjustment for repetitive analyses was made, as the analysis was hypothesis-generating. Of the 72 charts reviewed, 45 patients met inclusion criteria (18 atomoxetine, 17 droxidopa, and 10 both). There were no differences in median time to discontinuation of IV vasoactive agents (21.9 days v 8.0 days v 13.9 days, respectively; p = 0.259) or ICU or hospital length of stay between groups. A higher percentage of patients who survived to hospital discharge received both study medications or droxidopa alone (90% v 76.5%) than atomoxetine alone (44.4%, p = 0.028).

Conclusions

Droxidopa and atomoxetine are oral vasoactive agents with potential mechanisms to facilitate IV vasopressor weaning for patients in the ICU with hypotension refractory to midodrine, but further prospective research is needed.

### Feasibility, utility, and safety of midodrine during recovery phase from septic shock [^4f85cac5]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Background

We describe the feasibility, utility, and safety of oral midodrine to replace IV vasopressors during recovery from septic shock.

Methods

This was a retrospective study performed in a medical ICU. All study subjects had a diagnosis of septic shock requiring at least 24 hours of IV vasopressors and demonstrated clinical stability with stable or decreasing doses of IV vasopressors. The two groups compared were those who received IV vasopressors only and those who received IV vasopressors with adjunctive midodrine.

Results

Of the 275 study patients, 140 received an IV vasopressor only and 135 received midodrine in addition to an IV vasopressor. There was no difference between the groups' demographics (age, sex, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 4 score). Mean IV vasopressor duration was 3.8 days in the IV vasopressor only group and 2.9 days in the IV vasopressor with midodrine group (P < .001). An IV vasopressor was reinstituted after discontinuation in 21 of 140 (15%) patients in the IV vasopressor only group and in 7 of 135 (5.2%) patients in the IV vasopressor with midodrine group (P = 0.007). ICU length of stay was 9.4 days in the IV vasopressor only group and 7.5 days in the IV vasopressor with midodrine group (P = 0.017). There were no complications associated with midodrine use except transient bradycardia in one patient, which resolved upon discontinuation of midodrine.

Conclusions

Midodrine may reduce the duration of IV vasopressors during recovery phase from septic shock and may be associated with a reduction in length of stay in the ICU.

### Midodrine exposure trends and outcomes reported to United States poison centers: 2000–2023 [^45511864]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Midodrine is an oral alpha-1 adrenergic agonist used to treat orthostatic hypotension. Its vasoconstrictive properties can lead to hypertension and reflex bradycardia. We characterized midodrine exposures reported to United States poison centers from 2000 to 2023.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of single-substance midodrine exposures reported to the National Poison Data System ®. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize temporal trends, demographics, exposure reasons, level of healthcare, and medical outcomes. National estimates of retail outpatient midodrine prescriptions during 2002–2023 were obtained from IQVIA Total Patient Tracker.

Results

The number of patients dispensed midodrine from retail pharmacies increased 695%, from 55,300 in 2002 to 439,659 in 2023. There were 1,935 midodrine exposures reported to the National Poison Data System ® from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2023. Exposures increased 714%, from 21 calls in 2000 to 171 calls in 2023. The most common features reported were hypertension in 277 (14.3%) and bradycardia in 197 (10.2%). Therapeutic errors accounted for most cases in most age groups except adolescents aged 13-19years, in which suspected suicide was the most commonly reported reason (50.2%). Most exposures were managed at home. Among 866 patients who sought medical care, 437 (50.5%) were treated/evaluated and released, but 115 (13.3%) were admitted to a critical care unit.

Discussion

Midodrine exposures increased over time, particularly among individuals aged 20-59years and 60 years and older, with a concomitant increase in retail midodrine dispensing. Although most exposures were managed at home, severe adverse effects have been reported, especially among patients with suspected suicidal ingestions compared to those with therapeutic errors. The National Poison Data System ® is limited by its passive surveillance design, and not all exposures are reported.

Conclusions

Better understanding of midodrine exposures and associated outcomes can inform poison center triage and medical management. Improved surveillance and clinician awareness may reduce morbidity and mortality associated with midodrine toxicity.

### Midodrine hydrochloride (midodrine HCl) [^3fb7587c]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical Studies

Midodrine has been studied in 3 principal controlled trials, one of 3-weeks duration and 2 of 1 to 2 days duration. All studies were randomized, double-blind and parallel-design trials in patients with orthostatic hypotension of any etiology and supine-to-standing fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 15 mmHg accompanied by at least moderate dizziness/lightheadedness.

Patients with pre-existing sustained supine hypertension above 180/110 mmHg were routinely excluded. In a 3-week study in 170 patients, most previously untreated with midodrine, the midodrine-treated patients (10 mg t.i.d., with the last dose not later than 6 P.M.) had significantly higher (by about 20 mmHg) 1-minute standing systolic pressure 1 hour after dosing (blood pressures were not measured at other times) for all 3 weeks. After week 1, midodrine-treated patients had small improvements in dizziness/ lightheadedness/unsteadiness scores and global evaluations, but these effects were made difficult to interpret by a high early drop-out rate (about 25% vs 5% on placebo). Supine and sitting blood pressure rose 16/8 mmHg and 20/10 mmHg, respectively, on average.

In a 2-day study, after open-label midodrine, known midodrine responders received midodrine 10 mg or placebo at 0, 3 and 6 hours. One-minute standing systolic blood pressures were increased 1 hour after each dose by about 15 mmHg and 3 hours after each dose by about 12 mmHg; 3-minute standing pressures were increased also at 1, but not 3, hours after dosing. There were increases in standing time seen intermittently 1 hour after dosing, but not at 3 hours.

In a 1-day, dose-response trial, single doses of 0 mg, 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg of midodrine were given to 25 patients. The 10 mg and 20 mg doses produced increases in standing 1-minute systolic pressure of about 30 mmHg at 1 hour; the increase was sustained in part for 2 hours after 10 mg and 4 hours after 20 mg. Supine systolic pressure was ≥ 200 mmHg in 22% of patients on 10 mg and 45% of patients on 20 mg; elevated pressures often lasted 6 hours or more.

Special Populations

A study with 16 patients undergoing hemodialysis demonstrated that midodrine hydrochloride is removed by dialysis.

### Oral midodrine for prophylaxis against post-spinal anesthesia hypotension during hip arthroplasty in elderly population: a randomized controlled trial [^91ef60dc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hip arthroplasty is performed for various underlying pathologies and most patients undergoing this procedure are elderly. Neuraxial anesthesia is the preferred route of anesthesia since it reduces the risk of postoperative complications. However, elderly patients are at increased risk of post-spinal anesthesia hypotension. Intraoperative hypotension compromises vital organ perfusion which consequently increases the risk of kidney injury, brain ischemia, cardiac ischemia, and 30-day mortality. Elderly patients commonly have systemic medical disorder; therefore, they are highly vulnerable to the complications of hypotension. Thus, intraoperative hypotension during hip surgery has been recently recognized as a major risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality.

Through the inhibitory effect of spinal anesthesia on the sympathetic nervous system, hypotension is induced due to vasodilatation which decreases the venous return, and consequently the cardiac output. Therefore, the main line for prevention and management of spinal anesthesia- induced hypotension is vasopressors. The commonly used vasopressor drugs in the perioperative settings are alpha-adrenoreceptor agonists such as ephedrine, phenylephrine, and recently norepinephrine. All these agents are effective in maintaining blood pressure; however, they have some disadvantages; ephedrine is commonly associated with tachycardia (due to the beta-agonist activity), phenylephrine and norepinephrine are usually associated with reactive bradycardia. Furthermore, all the mentioned drugs are used intravenously.

Midodrine hydrochloride is another alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist which has the advantage of being an oral drug with minimal central nervous system side effects, and good oral bioavailability. Midodrine is metabolized to desglymidodrine which is a direct arteriolar and venous vasopressor. Midodrine is used for management of some hypotensive disorders. Midodrine was previously used for management of orthostatic hypotension, intra-dialysis hypotension, and in circulatory shock in critically ill patients. There is paucity of data about the value of midodrine in preoperative settings. in this study we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of midodrine as a prophylaxis against post-spinal hypotension in elderly patients undergoing hip arthroplasty.

Hemodialysis residual kidney function — hemodynamic management and diuretics: Episodes of intravascular volume depletion that frequently result in hypotension should be minimized and measures to maintain hemodynamic stability should be routine, with strategies to minimize hypotension during HD including avoidance of excessive ultrafiltration, maintaining the target hematocrit, reduction in dialysate temperature, increasing dialysate sodium concentration, and possibly administration of an α agonist, such as midodrine; avoidance of hypotension also helps ensure delivery of adequate dialysis and minimize symptoms during HD, and paradoxically, loop diuretics probably benefit HD patients because they reduce the requirement for fluid removal during dialysis.

### The impact of midodrine on outcomes in patients with intradialytic hypotension [^015912d0]. American Journal of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a frequent complication of hemodialysis, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Off-label use of the alpha-1 andrenergic receptor agonist midodrine to reduce the frequency and severity of IDH is common. However, limited data exist to support this practice. This study sought to examine real-world efficacy of midodrine with respect to relevant clinical and hemodynamic outcomes.

Methods

Here, we compared a variety of clinical and hemodynamic outcomes among adult patients who were prescribed midodrine (n = 1,046) and matched controls (n = 2,037), all of whom were receiving in-center hemodialysis treatment at dialysis facilities in the United States (July 2015 - September 2016). Mortality, all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular hospitalization, and hemodynamic outcomes were considered from the month following the initiation of midodrine (or corresponding month for controls) until censoring for discontinuation of dialysis, transplant, loss to follow-up, or study end (September 30, 2016). Rate outcomes were compared using Poisson models and quantitative outcomes using linear mixed models; all models were adjusted for imbalanced patient characteristics.

Results

Compared to non-use, midodrine use was associated with higher rates of death (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.15–1.62), all-cause hospitalization (1.31, 1.19–1.43) and cardiovascular hospitalization (1.41, 1.17–1.71). During follow-up, midodrine use tended to be associated with lower pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (SBP), lower nadir SBP, greater fall in SBP during dialysis, and a greater proportion of treatments affected by IDH.

Conclusion

Although residual confounding may have influenced the results, the associations observed here are not consistent with a potent beneficial effect of midodrine with respect to either clinical or hemodynamic outcomes.

Hepatorenal syndrome–acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) vasoconstrictor therapy — norepinephrine dosing and comparative efficacy are specified as follows: Norepinephrine is administered in a starting dose of 0.5 mg/h with dose increases every 4 hours by 0.5 mg/h to a maximum of 3 mg/h, targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 10 mm Hg or urine output > 50 mL/h for at least 4 hours; terlipressin was superior to norepinephrine. The combination of midodrine and octreotide works very slowly but reversal of HRS is possible; octreotide alone is ineffective and the combination is inferior to terlipressin in improving renal function or HRS reversal. Norepinephrine infusion outside the intensive care unit (ICU) was found to be safe in a small feasibility study, although ischemic complications, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory side effects may occur.

Because Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP can cause marked elevation of supine blood pressure (BP > 200 mmHg systolic), it should be used in patients whose lives are considerably impaired despite standard clinical care, including non-pharmacologic treatment (such as support stockings), fluid expansion, and lifestyle alterations. The indication is based on Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP effect on increases in 1-minute standing systolic blood pressure, a surrogate marker considered likely to correspond to a clinical benefit. At present, however, clinical benefits of Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP principally improved ability to perform life activities, have not been established. Further clinical trials are underway to verify and describe the clinical benefits of Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP.

After initiation of treatment, Midodrine Hydrochloride Tablets, USP should be continued only for patients who report significant symptomatic improvement.

### Efficacy of preoperative oral midodrine in preventing hypotension after spinal anesthesia in young adults: a randomized controlled trial [^47dd36ac]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Midodrine was effectively used for prophylaxis against hypotensive syndromes such as postural hypotension and intradialytic hypotension, and during the recovery phase of septic shock. In our study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of prophylactic administration of midodrine tablets before spinal anesthesia in reducing the occurrence of hypotension.

Methods

This randomized placebo-controlled study embraced 67 patients aged 18 to 40 years undergoing elective knee surgery under spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomized to midodrine group (given 10-mg tablets of midodrine) or placebo group (given placebo tablets), and tablets were administered 1 hour before spinal anesthesia (intrathecal injection of 12.5-mg 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 15-μg fentanyl). The primary outcome was the occurrence of hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or < 80% of baseline. Secondary outcomes were hemodynamic characteristics (mean arterial pressure [MAP] and heart rate [HR]) after spinal anesthesia, ephedrine dose, and occurrence of complications including bradycardia, vasovagal attacks, reactive hypertension nausea, vomiting, and shivering.

Results

The number of patients who became hypotensive after spinal anesthesia was 5 (14.7%) in midodrine group versus 14 (42.4%) in the placebo group; relative risk (95% confidence interval) was 0.35 (0.14–0.85) (P = 0.021). The median (interquartile range) total dose of ephedrine was significantly lower in midodrine group 0 (0–10) mg than in placebo group (0 (0–15) mg; the Hodges-Lehmann median difference (95% confidence interval) was 0 (0–5) mg (P = 0.015). For MAP data, the group × time interaction was significant (P = 0.038), and the MAP was significantly lower in the placebo group than in the midodrine group after intrathecal injection at 2 minutes (P = 0.047), 10 minutes (P = 0.045), 15 minutes (P < .001), 20 minutes (P = 0.007), 30 minutes (P = 0.013), 45 minutes (P = 0.029), 60 minutes (P = 0.029), and at the end of surgery (P < .001). For HR data, the group × time interaction was nonsignificant (P = 0.807), and the difference in means (95% confidence interval) between groups collapsing over time was -1.4 (-3.1 to 0.2) beats/min (P = 0.096). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding the occurrence of complications.

Conclusions

Prophylactic administration of 10-mg midodrine tablets before spinal anesthesia is an effective method in the prevention of hypotension in young adult patients undergoing elective orthopedic knee surgery.

### Midodrine hydrochloride [^959303a6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a 2-day study, after open-label midodrine, known midodrine responders received midodrine 10 mg or placebo at 0, 3, and 6 hours. One-minute standing systolic blood pressures were increased 1 hour after each dose by about 15 mmHg and 3 hours after each dose by about 12mmHg; 3-minute standing pressures were increased also at 1, but not 3, hours after dosing. There were increases in standing time seen intermittently 1 hour after dosing, but not at 3 hours.

In a 1-day, dose-response trial, single doses of 0, 2.5, 10, and 20 mg of midodrine were given to 25 patients. The 10- and 20-mg doses produced increases in standing 1- minute systolic pressure of about 30 mmHg at 1 hour; the increase was sustained in part for 2 hours after 10 mg and 4 hours after 20 mg. Supine systolic pressure was ≥ 200 mmHg in 22% of patients on 10mg and 45% of patients on 20 mg; elevated pressures often lasted 6 hours or more.

Special Populations

A study with 16 patients undergoing hemodialysis demonstrated that Midodrine hydrochloride is removed by dialysis.

### Oral midodrine for prophylaxis against post-spinal anesthesia hypotension during hip arthroplasty in elderly population: a randomized controlled trial [^aafc44ca]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We evaluated the use of preoperative oral midodrine in elderly population before spinal block and found that the intervention improved the intraoperative hemodynamic profile decreasing the vasopressor consumption and the incidence of hypotension denoting better maintenance of the blood pressure compared to control placebo.

Midodrine is an oral α1-adrenoreceptor agonist. Midodrine is a prodrug which is metabolized to desglymidodrine; the later molecule produces direct arteriolar and venous vasoconstriction and, consequently, increases the systemic vascular resistance; these pharmacologic properties explain the vasopressor-sparing effect of midodrine in our patients. Several studies in different populations support the positive cardiovascular effects of midodrine. The most established effect for midodrine is the treatment of chronic orthostatic hypotension. Midodrine also improved the symptoms of dialysis-induced hypotension. On the other hand, midodrine showed controversial results in some groups of patients such as critically ill patients with circulatory shock and postoperative surgical patients. The inconsistency in the results of the drug among different populations highlights the importance of adequate evaluation in various clinical settings before reaching a recommendation for its use.

The use of midodrine for prophylaxis against post-spinal hypotension had not been adequately evaluated. A randomized controlled trial showed that the drug can decrease the incidence of post-spinal hypotension in adult non-elderly population. Our study is the first to evaluate the use of midodrine in the special subgroup of elderly patients. Intraoperative hypotension is a serious independent risk factor perioperative mortality in patients undergoing hip surgery. Spinal anesthesia is the usual choice for anesthesia in hip surgery and is commonly associated with hypotension which has higher prevalence in elderly compared to young adults. Furthermore, elderly patients are more vulnerable to complications of hypotension due to age-related cardiovascular changes such as increased basal sympathetic activity and reduced baroreceptor sensitivity. It was found that pre-hydration alone would not eliminate spinal hypotension. Therefore, there is increased interest in the use of vasopressors, preferably prophylactic, to decrease the incidence and severity of hypotension.

### New horizons in orthostatic hypotension [^62be593a]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

Background

orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common disabling condition associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Much of the evidence available is derived from younger populations with chronic neurological disease leading to uncertainty for the diagnosis and management of older people.

Objective

to provide an overview of recent and emerging evidence for the diagnosis, management and prognosis of OH in older persons.

Methods

a narrative review of recent studies, emerging therapies and relevant regulatory updates.

Findings

revisions to the diagnostic criteria for OH include the duration of the blood pressure drop, specific criteria for initial and delayed OH and OH with hypertension. Non-drug therapies remain the first-line treatment option and Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment appears to result in lower rates of OH. Recent evidence concerning withdrawal of causative medication is inconsistent. Midodrine has recently become the only licenced medication for OH in the UK. Other emerging treatments include atomoxetine and droxidopa but these require further evaluation. Many other agents may be used but are not supported by high-quality evidence. The increase in mortality associated with OH is less apparent in older people.

Summary

OH remains common in older people, the new diagnostic criteria address some of the previous uncertainty but evidence concerning withdrawal of antihypertensives is conflicting. Midodrine is now the only licenced medication for OH in the UK, but non-drug therapies remain first line and fludrocortisone may be considered before midodrine. We may see other agents such as droxidopa becoming increasingly used over the coming years.

### Refractory hypotension due to rogaine® (minoxidil) ingestion managed with midodrine [^35c03a61]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Minoxidil (Rogaine®) is a direct vasodilator that can cause significant toxicity when ingested. We report a case of ingestion of topical minoxidil [Rogaine® (Johnson & Johnson Healthcare Products, Division of McNeil-PPC, Inc)] resulting in refractory hypotension that was successfully managed with the oral α (1) agonist midodrine.

Case Report

A 48-year-old male who ingested an eight ounce bottle of Rogaine® presented to the emergency department. The patient presented with a blood pressure of 57/45 mmHg and a pulse of 84 beats per minute. The patient received IV fluids and multiple vasopressors to maintain an adequate mean arterial pressure. Midodrine, an oral α (1) vasopressor, was added 10 hours post ingestion and was able to maintain an adequate mean arterial pressure. Over the next two days, midodrine was titrated down as his blood pressure returned to baseline.

Conclusion

Midodrine may serve as an additional option to treat toxicant induced hypotension.

### An updated "norepinephrine equivalent" score in intensive care as a marker of shock severity [^6f1e13da]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Since ATHOS-3 is the only multicenter randomized controlled trial to assess the equipotency of angiotensin II in intensive care settings, we adopted the result of this trial to calculate a conversion factor for angiotensin II. This trial reported that 20 ng/kg/min of angiotensin II infusion resulted in a mean decrease of 0.05 µg/kg/min of norepinephrine compared with the placebo to maintain a target MAP of 75 mmHg or 10 mmHg greater than baseline in the first 3 h of drug initiation, and a target MAP of 65 mmHg afterward. Thus, we applied a correction factor of 0.0025 to the angiotensin II dose in ng/kg/min.

Similarly, data from a recent multicenter randomized trial comparing terlipressin with norepinephrine in septic shock, we applied a correction factor of 10 to the terlipressin dose in μg/kg/min.

A randomized trial compared metaraminol and norepinephrine in septic shock. Based on the findings of this trial suggesting 2.5 μg/kg/min of metaraminol corresponded to 0.3 μg/kg/min of norepinephrine, we defined a correction factor of 1/8 to metaraminol dose in μg/kg/min.

A recent randomized trial found that 5 g of hydroxocobalamin reduced norepinephrine by 0.08 µg/kg/min, which led us to apply 0.02 as a correction factor to hydroxocobalamin dose in g.

A randomized trial comparing oral midodrine with intravenous norepinephrine found that 30 mg/day of midodrine reduced 73 mg of norepinephrine during six days in septic shock, which gave a correction factor of 0.4 to midodrine dose in μg/kg/min.

### The effects of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes in septic shock: a systematic review of randomised trials as a guide for future research [^d4c93ce7]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Terlipressin was compared to norepinephrine in 4 studies. Three studies, including a total of 119 participants, suggest improvement in the odds of AKI with terlipressin, however no study demonstrated statistical significance. The dominant study of terlipressin (526 participants) reported no difference in the rate of KDIGO graded AKI between vasopressor arms. Heterogeneity was present across all terlipressin studies, including in baseline clinical characteristics and vasopressor doses (terlipressin 1.3–8.3 mcg/min, norepinephrine 5–35 mcg/min). In addition, the study by Gupta et al. was of a sub-population of septic shock with acute on chronic liver failure. Resulting heterogeneity is difficult to evaluate further, as was the case previously for septic shock subpopulation studies.

The remaining two studies were of a pilot nature. Chawla et al. recruited a sample of 20 particularly high risk patients with distributive shock, confirmed by the study author to all be septic, and compared angiotensin II to placebo. Although designed to test for changes in open-label norepinephrine required to maintain target MAP, there was one new case of AKI giving 2 additional cases overall with angiotensin II as compared to placebo. In their work on enteral midodrine alongside standard care norepinephrine, Davoudi-Monfared et al. report one additional case of AKI with midodrine.

### Orthostatic hypotension in adults with hypertension: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^27741c94]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Although orthostatic hypotension (OH) has long been recognized as a manifestation of autonomic dysfunction, a growing body of literature has identified OH as a common comorbidity of hypertension. This connection is complex, related to pathophysiology in blood pressure regulation and the manner by which OH is derived as the difference between 2 blood pressure measurements. While traditional therapeutic approaches to OH among patients with neurodegenerative disorders focus on increasing upright blood pressure to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion, the management of OH among patients with hypertension is more nuanced; resting hypertension is itself associated with adverse outcomes among these patients. Although there is substantial evidence that intensive blood pressure treatment does not cause OH in the majority of patients with essential hypertension, some classes of antihypertensive agents may unmask OH in patients with an underlying autonomic impairment. Practical steps to manage OH among adults with hypertension start with (1) a thorough characterization of its patterns, triggers, and cause; (2) review and removal of aggravating factors (often pharmacological agents not related to hypertension treatment); (3) optimization of an antihypertensive regimen; and (4) adoption of a tailored treatment strategy that avoids exacerbating hypertension. These strategies include countermaneuvers and short-acting vasoactive agents (midodrine, droxidopa). Ultimately, further research is needed on the epidemiology of OH, the impact of hypertension treatment on OH, approaches to the screening and diagnosis of OH, and OH treatment among adults with hypertension to improve the care of these patients and their complex blood pressure pathophysiology.

### A dose response trial using 5 and 10 Mg of midodrine hydrochloride… [^ed116fd9]. ClinicalTrials (2007). Low credibility.

Study Overview In individuals with SCI, blood pressure regulation is altered compared to the non-SCI population and relates to the degree of sympathetic vascular denervation. The inadequate release of norepinephrine with postural change is a primary component of OH and several reports have documented significantly reduced plasma norepinephrine levels in individuals with tetraplegia. Ephedrine sulfate and midodrine hydrochloride, both 1 receptor agonists, are recommended for the treatment of postural hypotension in this population. Although there are case reports documenting improved blood pressure regulation in persons with SCI treated with an 1 receptor agonist, this pharmacological treatment for OH has not been adequately studied in this population.

A dose response trial will be used to determine the efficacy of midodrine hydrochloride compared to no drug at improving systemic blood pressure, cerebral blood flow and oxygenation and at reducing symptomatic hypotension during tilt-table testing in 16 individuals with SCI who manifest significant orthostatic hypotension |The difference between the average supine systolic blood pressure and the average systolic blood pressure at 45 degree head-up tilt position. |.

### Fludrocortisone is associated with a higher risk of all-cause hospitalizations compared with midodrine in patients with orthostatic hypotension [^affbe184]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, some clinical information such as functional status or specific measurements of OH severity are not recorded in our study databases, and although we made extensive efforts to control confounding, residual confounding cannot be ruled out. However, our analyses adjusted for several surrogate variables that are correlated with those unmeasured factors, minimizing their potential confounding effect. Second, we based our exposure classification on pharmacy refill data, but we cannot demonstrate that patients were actually taking the dispensed medications. Nevertheless, automated pharmacy records are an excellent source of prescription medication data because these records are not subject to incomplete patient reporting or recall bias and have concordance of better than 90% with patient self‐reports of medication use. 25, 26, 27 Furthermore, our study classified exposure into categories designed to minimize exposure classification and facilitate the comparison of periods of current use of study medications. As OH is a chronic condition with periodic exacerbation periods, it would be challenging to compare periods of current use with periods of no medication use using an observational study design. Third, we used retrospective records to identify our study outcomes. However, we relied on validated computerized definitions for identification of CHF‐related hospitalizations, 19 which should reduce concerns about outcome misclassification. Fourth, the number of CHF hospitalizations was small, and limited the precision of some estimates. Our study was not powered to study less frequent outcomes, such as mortality. Fifth, we used all‐cause hospitalization as a proxy for healthcare need, but the analysis was not designed to assess specific causes of hospitalization. Lastly, our study population overrepresents patients with low income, and high prevalence of comorbidities and disabilities. Additional studies in other populations would be useful to complement our observations.

Long COVID — autonomic dysfunction lists manifestations as "postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), orthostatic hypotension, inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST), and neurocardiogenic syncope (also called vasovagal syncope)", with pharmacologic management noting that "First-line medications still include beta blockers, midodrine, fludrocortisone, and pyridostigmine" and that "Guanfacine has now been added to the list of second-line".

### Oral midodrine for prophylaxis against post-spinal anesthesia hypotension during hip arthroplasty in elderly population: a randomized controlled trial [^bba9dc2d]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We used a dose of 5 mg of the drug administered 90 min before spinal anesthesia. The usual dose of the drug in previous studies ranged between 2.5- and 10 mg per dose. The peak effect of desglymidodrine ranges between 60 and 120 min after oral administration of midodrine. The effects of other doses and time of drug administration require further investigation.

According to our results, we suggest that the use of midodrine would maintain stable blood pressure in elderly patients receiving spinal block. We chose the total vasopressor requirements rather than the incidence of hypotension as primary outcome because the former reflects both the frequency and severity of hypotension.

Our study has several important advantages such as the randomized controlled design and adequate sample size. Furthermore, the median age in our patients 78 years which represents a highly vulnerable group of elderly patients. There are some limitations which should be addressed in the study such as being performed in single center, the use of one dose of the drug, and excluding patients with significant cardiovascular pathologies. These limitations warrant future appropriate studies.

In conclusion, the use of 5 mg oral midodrine decreased the vasopressor requirements and incidence of hypotension after spinal anesthesia for hip surgery in elderly patients.

### Feasibility and effectiveness of norepinephrine outside the intensive care setting for treatment of hepatorenal syndrome [^b8e3785d]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Vasoconstrictors are the treatment of choice for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). We evaluate the real-life effectiveness of a sequential vasoconstrictor regimen of midodrine-octreotide followed by norepinephrine in a nonintensive care unit (non-ICU) setting in the United States, where terlipressin is not available. The diagnosis of HRS and definitions of response to therapy were based on 2015 guidelines from the International Club of Ascites. In adult patients with HRS without partial or full response to oral midodrine and subcutaneous octreotide, norepinephrine was administered at a starting dose of 5 mcg/minute, with a goal to achieve a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 10 mm Hg above baseline. We assessed predictors of response and treatment outcomes. A total of 61 patients were administered midodrine and octreotide for the treatment of HRS, with a 28% response rate. The median MELD-Na (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-sodium) score was 30 (interquartile range [IQR] 24–35). Responders were more likely to have alcohol-related liver disease and lower Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) grade. Of the nonresponders, 20 were then administered norepinephrine, of whom 45% achieved full or partial response. Achieving an MAP increase of ≥ 10 mm Hg was associated with a greater probability of response. Patients who responded to norepinephrine experienced improved transplant-free survival at 90 days (88% versus 27%; P = 0.02); 5 of 20 patients experienced norepinephrine treatment-related adverse events, namely arrhythmias. Norepinephrine can be effectively used in a non-ICU setting as rescue therapy in patients who have not responded to midodrine and octreotide. Based on these data, we propose a practical stepwise algorithm for vasoconstrictor therapy to manage HRS in situations where terlipressin is not an option.

### Refractory bradycardia and hypotension in patients with autonomic dysfunction treated with pseudoephedrine [^38cc927b]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We describe a man in his 40s with a history of chronic intranasal cocaine use and C5-C7 incomplete quadriplegia complicated by neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, admitted to the intensive care unit for worsening bradycardia and hypotension requiring initiation of dopamine and an increase of his home midodrine dose. The patient experienced refractory bradycardia and hypotension with weaning of dopamine, and therefore a recommendation was made to add pseudoephedrine to his current regimen. This case describes the addition of pseudoephedrine to facilitate weaning off intravenous vasopressors within 24 hours in a patient with refractory bradycardia and hypotension secondary to autonomic dysfunction.
