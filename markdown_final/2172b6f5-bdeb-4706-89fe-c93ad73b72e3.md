## Question

how much of elevated alkaline phosphatase is significant

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much of an elevation in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is considered significant and how to interpret and respond to it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "significance" differs across clinical contexts: drug-induced liver injury, cholestatic liver disease, bone disease, and general prognostic use. Then, I should verify validated thresholds and patterns used in guidelines. Next, I will examine source confirmation of ALP (hepatic vs bone vs other), and consider age- and sex-specific norms. Finally, I will integrate this into a pragmatic, stepwise clinical approach with attention to red flags and follow-up intervals.

> Let me first confirm the overarching principle: "significance" is context-dependent, and the magnitude of ALP elevation alone does not determine clinical importance. I need to check the pattern of liver chemistries, the patient's history and risk factors, and the time course, because mild abnormalities may herald serious disease while marked abnormalities may be transient or non-hepatic [^111Zqb9T] [^117VSnab].

> For drug-induced liver injury, I should double-check the accepted thresholds: clinically significant DILI includes ALP greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) on two separate occasions, or bilirubin greater than 2.5 mg/dL with enzyme elevations, or INR greater than 1.5 with enzyme elevations. I initially thought this applied after any single abnormal value, but wait, I should verify — yes, these thresholds are applied to values on two occasions at least 24 hours apart to ensure persistence and reduce false positives [^112Vcy3d] [^113s1NHW] [^114zraiE].

> Next, I should review the pattern-based interpretation of liver injury: a cholestatic pattern is suggested when ALP is disproportionately elevated compared with AST/ALT, and a mixed pattern reflects concurrent rises in both ALP and transaminases. Let me verify the R-ratio convention — R = (ALT/ULN) ÷ (ALP/ULN), with R less than 2 indicating cholestatic, R greater than 5 hepatocellular, and 2–5 mixed. This pattern classification helps frame the differential and urgency of evaluation [^116MrpTo] [^1155asMt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — before calling an ALP elevation "hepatic", I need to check its origin. GGT elevation supports a hepatobiliary source, whereas a normal GGT points toward bone or other sources; if uncertain, isoenzyme fractionation can differentiate liver, bone, intestinal, and placental fractions; in older adults, bone turnover is common, and in pregnancy, placental ALP can elevate total ALP, so I should confirm these possibilities before pursuing hepatobiliary imaging [^111Zqb9T] [^115xNaAK] [^113Fviv2].

> I will now examine thresholds for cholestatic liver disease workup: if ALP is greater than 2× ULN and of hepatic origin, guidelines recommend ultrasound of the liver and biliary tree to assess for obstruction or mass effect. If ducts are dilated, proceed to MRCP or ERCP, and if ducts are not dilated, evaluate for intrahepatic cholestasis including PBC and PSC with AMA and cholangiography. I should confirm that biopsy consideration enters when serology and imaging are unrevealing but cholestasis persists beyond 6 months [^114k6r3r] [^115udJMp] [^1168RP3N].

> But wait, what if ALP is only mildly elevated, say 1–2× ULN? I need to ensure I don't overcall this: in such cases, observation with repeat testing in about 3–6 months is reasonable, with escalation to biopsy or MRCP if the elevation persists, particularly if it exceeds 2× ULN or symptoms evolve. This cautious interval balances the possibility of transient or non-hepatic causes against the risk of missing progressive cholestatic disease [^114k6r3r] [^115PkWRv].

> For bone-related significance, let me consider validated thresholds: in suspected Paget's disease, ALP is typically markedly elevated and is the principal biochemical marker. A population-based study suggested a roughly 10-fold increased likelihood of Paget's when ALP is elevated in older adults with normal transaminases, albeit with imperfect sensitivity, so I should confirm with imaging when clinical suspicion is present. Similarly, in metastatic bone disease, ALP elevation often reflects osteoblastic activity and can be used in prognostic models, but I should correlate with clinical and imaging findings before concluding bone involvement [^112ZBeYJ] [^113zBMQ2] [^115KRU8T].

> Next, I should review age- and sex-specific norms because pediatric and adolescent reference ranges are much higher than adult ranges. Benign transient hyperphosphatasemia in children can show ALP values 5–10× ULN that resolve spontaneously, and adult reference intervals do not apply to neonates or adolescents, so I need to ensure the correct reference interval is used to avoid misclassification and unnecessary testing [^1164DS7j] [^113kShy2] [^116sUSJP].

> I need to check prognostic uses of ALP where thresholds carry meaning: in PBC, baseline and on-treatment ALP levels correlate with transplant-free survival, with ALP ≤ 2× ULN at one year associated with substantially better 10-year survival. Likewise, in large-duct PSC, higher ALP generally tracks with more severe disease strata, although spontaneous fluctuations are common and limit ALP's predictive value for short-term fibrosis progression. Thus, I should interpret ALP within longitudinal disease-specific prognostic frameworks rather than in isolation [^116bhGPj] [^113FGaYR] [^111U7ekM].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework: ALP elevation is more likely to be clinically significant when it is persistent, greater than 2× ULN, confirmed to be of hepatic origin by GGT or isoenzymes, and accompanied by a cholestatic pattern or symptoms. Conversely, transient, mild, isolated ALP elevations, especially in children or with non-hepatic sources, are less likely to be significant but still warrant follow-up. I should confirm persistence on repeat testing, verify source, assess pattern and risk factors, and escalate to imaging and disease-specific serologies if thresholds are crossed or symptoms arise [^114k6r3r] [^112Vcy3d] [^113XoUqa].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that ALP greater than 2× ULN is a broadly actionable threshold across several contexts — DILI recognition, cholestatic workup, and PBC prognostication — yet significance is ultimately determined by pattern, persistence, source, and clinical context. Therefore, my final answer is that ALP greater than 2× ULN merits prompt evaluation for hepatobiliary or drug-related causes, whereas milder elevations require source confirmation and interval reassessment before invasive testing or long-term labeling [^112Vcy3d] [^114k6r3r] [^116bhGPj].

A clinically significant alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevation is **ALP > 2× ULN** [^112Vcy3d] [^114zraiE] or a persistent mild elevation (> 1.5× ULN) for more than 6 months [^114k6r3r], especially when confirmed to be of hepatic origin by GGT or isoenzyme analysis [^111Zqb9T] [^113Fviv2]. Mild, transient elevations (< 1.5× ULN) are often benign or related to bone turnover, pregnancy, or growth [^113Fviv2]; persistent or higher elevations warrant evaluation for cholestatic liver disease [^115udJMp], biliary obstruction [^116VCtcF], malignancy [^113Fviv2], or metabolic bone disease [^112ZBeYJ]. Always interpret ALP in clinical context [^115LahNR] and confirm hepatic origin before pursuing liver-specific workup [^114k6r3r].

---

## Definition of clinically significant ALP elevation

Clinically significant ALP elevation is **generally defined as**:

- **> 2× ULN**: Strongly suggests hepatobiliary or bone disease and warrants further evaluation [^114k6r3r] [^113Fviv2].

- **Persistent mild elevation (> 1.5× ULN)**: For > 6 months is also considered significant, especially if hepatic in origin [^114k6r3r].

- **< 1.5× ULN**: Often benign or transient; may be due to bone turnover, pregnancy, or growth spurts [^113Fviv2].

---

## Clinical significance of ALP elevation by magnitude

| **Magnitude of elevation** | **Clinical significance** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| < 1.5× ULN | Usually benign or transient | - Bone turnover <br/> - Pregnancy <br/> - Growth spurts <br/> - Transient hyperphosphatasemia [^113Fviv2] [^113kShy2] |
| 1.5–2× ULN | - Possible early liver or bone disease <br/> - Monitor or investigate if persistent | - Early cholestasis <br/> - NAFLD <br/> - Mild bone disease [^111Zqb9T] [^112ZBeYJ] |
| > 2× ULN | Significant; warrants evaluation | - Cholestatic liver disease (PBC, PSC) <br/> - Biliary obstruction <br/> - Malignancy <br/> - Metabolic bone disease [^112Vcy3d] [^115fZ5hX] [^115KRU8T] |

---

## Factors influencing clinical significance

Several factors **influence the significance** of ALP elevation:

- **Age and sex**: Higher in children/adolescents due to growth; use age/sex-specific ranges [^113Fviv2] [^1164DS7j].

- **Pregnancy**: Placental ALP elevates levels, especially in late gestation [^113Fviv2].

- **Medications**: Many drugs can raise ALP (e.g. azithromycin, nifedipine, statins) [^113Q5DeJ] [^117Cxe1v] [^117CyXhi].

- **Bone disease**: Paget's, metastases, and metabolic bone disease can elevate ALP [^112ZBeYJ] [^113Fviv2].

---

## Confirming hepatic origin of ALP elevation

Before liver-specific workup, **confirm hepatic origin**:

- **GGT**: Elevated GGT supports hepatic ALP [^111Zqb9T] [^113Fviv2].

- **Isoenzyme analysis**: Differentiates hepatic, bone, intestinal, and placental ALP [^113Fviv2] [^117XpUm1].

- **Clinical context**: History, exam, and imaging guide interpretation [^114k6r3r] [^115PkWRv].

---

## Clinical implications and recommended actions

Clinically significant ALP elevation warrants **targeted evaluation**:

- **Imaging**: Right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess biliary tree and liver parenchyma [^116VCtcF] [^114k6r3r].

- **Laboratory tests**: AMA for PBC; ANA, ASMA, IgG4 for autoimmune cholangiopathies [^115fZ5hX] [^115udJMp].

- **MRCP/ERCP**: If PSC or obstruction suspected [^1168RP3N] [^114k6r3r].

- **Liver biopsy**: Consider if serology/imaging are inconclusive or ALP remains > 2× ULN after 6 months [^114k6r3r] [^1156xFwp].

---

## Prognostic significance

ALP level has prognostic value: in primary biliary cholangitis, **ALP > 2× ULN** predicts worse outcomes [^116bhGPj], and **normalization after therapy** indicates better prognosis [^111U7ekM]. In oncology, elevated ALP is linked to worse survival in metastatic disease [^116iTqtT] [^111azbu2].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **> 2× ULN**: Significant; evaluate for hepatobiliary or bone disease [^112Vcy3d].

- **Persistent > 1.5× ULN**: Significant if hepatic origin confirmed [^notfound].

- **< 1.5× ULN**: Usually benign; monitor and repeat if persistent [^notfound].

- **Confirm hepatic origin**: Use GGT or isoenzyme analysis before liver-specific workup [^111Zqb9T] [^113Fviv2].

---

A clinically significant ALP elevation is **ALP > 2× ULN** or a persistent mild elevation (> 1.5× ULN) for more than 6 months, especially when hepatic in origin. Mild, transient elevations are often benign, but persistent or higher elevations require evaluation for cholestatic liver disease, biliary obstruction, malignancy, or metabolic bone disease.

Research needs

The clinical presentation of renal sarcoidosis is often insidious, and renal damage is progressive without treatment. Elevated creatinine or available imaging technologies are not specific for renal sarcoidosis. Renal biopsy is often necessary to reliably establish the diagnosis of renal sarcoidosis, but carries risks of bleeding, pain, and, rarely, arteriovenous fistula formation. Future studies should consider convenient, noninvasive biomarkers of renal sarcoidosis; examples include evaluation of 24-hour urine parameters and research focused on prognosis, response to therapy, and mechanisms of fibrosis.

Question 5: Should Patients with Sarcoidosis Who Do Not Have Hepatic Symptoms Undergo Screening for Hepatic Sarcoidosis by Routine Transaminase and Alkaline Phosphatase Testing?

Rationale for question

The liver is commonly involved in sarcoidosis and is more common in African Americans than white individuals. Although liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and portal hypertension can result and require transplantation, the prevalence of these outcomes and the long-term consequences of hepatic sarcoidosis are not established, and the indications for treating hepatic sarcoidosis are unclear. Thus, the benefits of routine screening for hepatic sarcoidosis, based on liver function tests, is unknown. The committee asked if patients with sarcoidosis presenting with no liver manifestations should undergo routine baseline screening with liver function tests.

Summary of evidence

Our systematic review identified 575 potentially relevant articles; the full text of 15 was reviewed and 8 were selected to inform the guideline committee. None of the studies compared liver function testing to no testing; all were nonrandomized studies that reported the frequency of abnormal liver function and other outcomes (,–). Only one study explicitly stated that the patients had no hepatic symptoms; the others only implied that most patients had minimal to no hepatic symptoms. Meta-analysis of the selected studies found that liver function testing was abnormal in 12% (95% CI, 6–19%) of patients. Among those who underwent subsequent liver biopsy, granulomas were identified in 96% (95% CI, 88–99%). The committee's confidence in the generalizability of this result was limited by concern about selection bias due to nonconsecutive selection of patients for liver biopsy. The proportion of patients with abnormal liver function tests in whom systemic corticosteroids were initiated varied widely across studies, ranging from 25% to 95%.

### Diagnosis and management of Paget's disease of bone in adults: a clinical guideline [^112ZBeYJ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Biochemical markers

The elevations in bone remodeling that are characteristic of active PBD can be detected clinically by measurement of biochemical markers of bone turnover in blood and urine samples. It should be noted, however, that elevations in markers of bone turnover occur in many disease states and cannot be used in isolation for the diagnosis of PDB.

The most widely used biochemical marker for the diagnosis of PDB is serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which is usually performed as part of liver function tests in a routine biochemistry screen. A population‐based study by Eekhof (68) specifically looked at the performance of ALP in detecting PDB in participants of the Rotterdam study in Holland. The researchers selected 105 individuals from a cohort of 4406 subjects who had an elevated total ALP with normal transaminases and matched these subjects with 625 controls who had a normal total ALP. They found that the relative risk for PDB (based on radiographs of the hands, spine, pelvis, and knees) in the presence of a raised total ALP was 10.9 (95% CI 4.8–24.9) in men and women older than 55 years of age. 68 This is the only study that has addressed the accuracy of any biochemical marker for the diagnosis of PDB. It showed that the sensitivity of total ALP was 57.7% (95% CI 38.9–74.5); specificity 88.9% (95% CI 85.9–91.3); positive likelihood ratio 5.19 (95% CI 3.45–7.82); and negative likelihood ratio 0.48 (95% CI 0.30–0.75). It should be noted that the calculated sensitivity may be an underestimate because radiographic assessment of PDB in the study didn't include the skull and some patients with PDB of this site could have been missed. It's also important to emphasize that of 26 patients with radiological features of PDB, only 11 (42%) had elevated total ALP concentrations.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117VSnab]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Safety and tolerability of dalcetrapib (RO4607381 / JTT-705): results from a 48-week trial [^112YCkKZ]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests

Four percent of participants in each treatment group experienced elevations in creatine phosphokinase (CPK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). In the dalcetrapib group, CPK elevations > 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed in 2% (2/89) of participants and CPK elevations > 5 × ULN in 1% (1/89) of participants; also with elevated levels at baseline (> 1 but < 3 × ULN). In the placebo group, 2% (1/45) of participants experienced CPK elevations > 3 × ULN. Additionally, 1% (1/89) of participants administered dalcetrapib experienced ALT elevations > 3 × ULN, and 2% (1/45) of participants administered placebo experienced elevations in both ALT (> 5 × ULN) and AST (> 5 × ULN). Aspartate aminotransferase elevations > 3 × ULN were not observed with dalcetrapib. No participants with CPK elevations experienced myalgia, and no participant permanently discontinued treatment due to liver enzyme elevations. Treatment was interrupted for one dalcetrapib participant due to increased (> 3 × ULN) levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), ALT, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) on Day 19. This participant also had elevated ALP and GGT levels on Days 22, 28, 37, 55, 70, and 118, which progressively returned to normal. Elevation in ALP > 3 × ULN on Days 19 and 22 was not considered clinically significant (the definition being ALP and AST > 3 × ULN on two occasions ≥ 4 days apart). The AE was considered mild and possibly related to treatment by the investigator and resolved without sequelae.

### Liver function predicts survival in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation following cardiovascular surgery [^111LeBuN]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Generally, elevation of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin is considered as a cholestatic pattern. Cholestasis is defined as a decline of bile flow into the duodenum that may be caused by impaired secretion by hepatocytes or obstruction through intra- or extrahepatic bile ducts. Particularly, adverse effects of medications and systemic sepsis may be the underlying mechanism for elevated cholestatic parameters in the present study cohort. As preoperative bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels were in the upper normal range or only slightly elevated in the present study population, significant cholestasis is not suggested to be the sole organic correlate for poor outcome. The commonality of our study population is the severe cardiovascular disease that may itself affect liver function. The pathophysiology of cardiac hepatopathy is, on one hand, impaired arterial perfusion caused by acute heart failure and, on the other hand, passive congestion resulting from an increased central venous pressure due to elevated right ventricular pressure and right-sided heart failure. Mostly, forward and backward failure coexist and aggravate each other in patients with severe heart failure. Furthermore, hepatic derangements are not necessarily caused by primary liver disease, but may be a consequence of severe illness and may represent a surrogate marker of the generalized stress response.

In line with our results, elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin were identified to predict all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, or hospitalization for heart failure in patients with advanced heart failure. Hemodynamic alterations triggered by heart failure were found to be associated with the development of hypoxic hepatitis. Hypoxic hepatitis is a form of hepatic injury following acute arterial hypoxemia, hypoperfusion with consecutive ischemia, and passive congestion of the liver that significantly affects prognosis and the outcome of critically ill patients. It is tempting to speculate that preoperative determination of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels can detect patients with early-stage hepatocardiac disorders who have a reduced hepatic tolerance to intra- and postoperative hemodynamic changes. Our laboratory findings support this hypothesis, as alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are expected to be increased while transaminases are often normal or only slightly elevated in patients with cardiac hepatopathy as long as cardiac output is not severely compromised.

### Levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are surrogate end points of outcomes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis: an international follow-up study [^116bhGPj]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Noninvasive surrogate end points of long-term outcomes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are needed to monitor disease progression and evaluate potential treatments. We performed a meta-analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies to evaluate whether patients' levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin correlate with their outcomes and can be used as surrogate end points.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of data from 4845 patients included in 15 North American and European long-term follow-up cohort studies. Levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin were analyzed in different settings and subpopulations at different time points relative to the clinical end point (liver transplantation or death).

Results

Of the 4845 patients, 1118 reached a clinical end point. The median follow-up period was 7.3 years; 77% survived for 10 years after study enrollment. Levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin measured at study enrollment (baseline) and each year for 5 years were strongly associated with clinical outcomes (lower levels were associated with longer transplant-free survival). At 1 year after study enrollment, levels of alkaline phosphatase that were 2.0 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) best predicted patient outcome (C statistic, 0.71) but not significantly better than other thresholds. Of patients with alkaline phosphatase levels ≤ 2.0 times the ULN, 84% survived for 10 years compared with 62% of those with levels > 2.0 times the ULN (P < .0001). Absolute levels of alkaline phosphatase 1 year after study enrollment predicted patient outcomes better than percentage change in level. One year after study enrollment, a bilirubin level 1.0 times the ULN best predicted patient transplant-free survival (C statistic, 0.79). Of patients with bilirubin levels ≤ 1.0 times the ULN, 86% survived for 10 years after study enrollment compared with 41% of those with levels > 1.0 times the ULN (P < .0001). Combining levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin increased the ability to predict patient survival times. We confirmed the predictive value of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels in multiple subgroups, such as patients who had not received treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid, and at different time points after study enrollment.

Conclusions

Levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin can predict outcomes (liver transplantation or death) of patients with PBC and might be used as surrogate end points in therapy trials.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115eFu7U]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT) is abundant in the liver and also present in the kidney, intestine, prostate and pancreas but not in bone; therefore it can be useful in confirming that an elevated ALP is of liver and not bony origin.GGT is most commonly elevated as a result of obesity, excess alcohol consumption or may be induced by drugs. Although an elevated GGT has a low specificity for liver disease, it is one of the best predictors of liver mortality. It is particularly useful in children to establish the likelihood of biliary disease when ALP is not a reliable indicator. Predominant causes of cholestasis in children include congenital abnormalities of the biliary tract and genetic disorders affecting bile synthesis and excretion.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1156xFwp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — initial evaluation steps for abnormal liver chemistries emphasize confirming true abnormalities, medication/supplement review, selective biopsy, and GGT use. Before initiating a workup, repeat the laboratory panel and/or perform a clarifying test to confirm the abnormality. Physicians should ask about prescribed/over‑the‑counter drugs, complementary/alternative medicines, and dietary/herbal supplements that may be associated with drug‑induced liver injury (DILI). A liver biopsy is recommended when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible. An elevation of alkaline phosphatase should be confirmed with an elevation in gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT), and GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease without other abnormal chemistries. All are stated as Strong recommendation, very low level of evidence.

Details Alternative Title: Am J Kidney Dis Personal Author: Description: Background Elevated total serum alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with mortality in the general population and in dialysis patients. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting & Participants. 28, 678 patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4 were identified using the Cleveland Clinic Chronic Kidney Disease Registry. CKD was defined as two eGFR values < 60 ml/min/1. 73 m² drawn > 90 days apart using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration creatinine equation. Predictor ALP levels measured using the calorimetric assay was examined as quartiles and as a continuous measure. Outcomes & Measurements All-cause mortality and ESRD were ascertained using the Social Security Death Index and US Renal Data System. Results.

After a median follow up of 2. 2 years, 588 patients progressed to ESRD and 4, 755 died. There was a graded increase in the risk for mortality with higher ALP quartiles when compared to the reference quartile after adjusting for demographics, comorbid conditions, use of relevant medications and liver function tests. The highest quartile of ALP was associated with a hazard ratio for ESRD of 1.
38. Each 1-standard deviation higher ALP level was associated with 15% and 16% increased risk of ESRD and mortality respectively. Limitations Single center observational study, lack complete data including PTH for all study participants and attrition bias. Conclusions Higher serum ALP levels in CKD stages 3–4 were independently associated with all-cause mortality and ESRD. Subjects: Source: Am J Kidney Dis. 2013; 62: 703–710.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111amkCs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Research needs

Studies are needed to delineate the best screening test for hepatic sarcoidosis, such as alkaline phosphatase, serum transaminases, or others. In addition, little is known about the natural history of hepatic sarcoidosis. Case series demonstrate a broad range of disease outcomes, from spontaneous resolution to rapid progression to cirrhosis. Future studies should use long-term longitudinal follow-up to determine the natural history of hepatic sarcoidosis and consider the influence of genetic and environmental factors. Better tools are needed to: 1) detect progression from hepatitis to early fibrosis and cirrhosis, such as liver elastography ultrasound; 2) more accurately characterize disease phenotypes; and 3) identify patients who might need and respond best to therapy.

Question 6: Should Patients with Sarcoidosis Who Do Not Have Symptoms or Signs of Hypercalcemia Undergo Screening for Abnormal Calcium Metabolism by Routine Serum Calcium and Vitamin D Testing?

Rationale for question

Abnormal calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis can lead to hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and their manifestations, including kidney stones and renal failure; it is the most common cause of sarcoidosis-related renal insufficiency. Dysfunctional calcium metabolism can also result in elevated bone resorption and increased renal and intestinal absorption of calcium. The mechanisms of abnormal calcium metabolism are likely multifactorial, including increased 1α‐hydroxylase production by granulomatous macrophages, which converts 25-(OH) vitamin D to 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D, increased expression of parathyroid hormone–related protein in sarcoidosis macrophages, and cytokine and other growth factor production. Although hypercalcemia- or hypercalciuria-related symptoms may bring the problem to attention, the committee asked whether patients with sarcoidosis without symptoms should undergo screening for abnormal calcium metabolism by baseline serum calcium and vitamin D testing.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

Confirmed alkaline phosphatase elevations — primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) features chronic biliary inflammation and stricturing with malignancy risk: "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) also represents a rare chronic liver disease which is characterized by chronic immune-mediated inflammation and fibrosis of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, fixed multifocal bile duct strictures, progressive liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and an increased risk for both hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma (65)". Serologies lack a diagnostic hallmark: "Although no serologic hallmarks have been identified for PSC, IgG and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody are frequently elevated, and IgG4 may signal a specific IgG4-associated form of PSC". Imaging establishes diagnosis: "Diagnosis of PSC is established by characteristic imaging findings of thickened, inflamed bile ducts, dilatation of intrahepatic ducts, and focal strictures on MRI cholangiography or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography", and tissue sampling is seldom necessary because "liver biopsy is rarely required to establish a diagnosis or to significantly alter medical management". PSC commonly coexists with colonic disease: "There is a common association with inflammatory bowel disease of the colon". When PBC and PSC are excluded, alternative causes should be sought: "Chronic cholestatic liver injury in the absence of PBC or PSC should prompt further investigation for less common etiologies such as bile duct obstructions, medications, sepsis, total parenteral nutrition, vanishing bile duct syndrome, and sarcoidosis (66)".

### Prognostic value of serum alkaline phosphatase in spinal metastatic disease [^115KRU8T]. British Journal of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Spinal metastases are the most common type of bone metastasis and have a prevalence of 30–50% in cancer patients. – Spinal metastases lead to spinal instability, pathologic fractures, neurologic deficits, and decreased quality of life. Management of spinal metastases is primarily palliative and includes consideration of surgery, radiotherapy, medical management, and palliative therapy. Determination of the appropriateness of invasive management such as multi-level decompression and stabilisation requires accurate pre-operative estimation of survival. A number of prognostic factors have been identified in this population but routinely collected laboratory markers have yet to be fully understood or utilised. – Serum alkaline phosphatase is one such marker that is routinely collected in spinal metastatic disease patients but remains underutilised for prognostication.

Alkaline phosphatase has been well-established as a marker of hepatobiliary pathology and bone turnover and mineralisation. – This metalloenzyme is expressed on the cell surface of osteoblasts and serum levels of the enzyme correlate with increased osteoblastic activity. In osteolytic bone metastases this enzyme is elevated secondary to a local bone formation response in an attempt to compensate for the predominant destructive lesion. In osteoblastic bone metastases, alkaline phosphatase is elevated secondary to local stimulation of osteoblasts. In visceral metastasis, serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated secondary to intrahepatic biliary tract obstruction by hepatic metastatic tumour burden. On the basis of this known pathophysiology, we hypothesised that elevated serum alkaline phosphatase would be a marker for survival in spinal metastatic disease as an aggregate measure for metastatic tumour burden.

As such, the primary purpose of this study was to determine if serum alkaline phosphatase was an independent prognostic factor for survival in spinal metastatic disease. The secondary aim of this study was to characterise the relationship between serum alkaline phosphatase and metastatic tumour burden.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease presenting with an isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase [^111g4yEa]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Goals

To define a subset of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with isolated elevations in alkaline phophatase.

Background

NAFLD is a common referral to Gastroenterologists and Hepatologists. We have noted a subset of patients with biopsy proven NAFLD who present with an isolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase instead of the more typical aminotransferase elevations.

Study

A review of the liver biopsy database at Brooke Army Medical Center was performed with the key identifiers of "steatosis" and "steatohepatitis". Patients were separated into 2 groups depending on whether they presented with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase (group 1), or more typical aminotransferase elevations (group 2). Multiple variables were analyzed to determine any significant differences between these groups.

Results

A total of 297 liver biopsies were evaluated. Of these, 135 biopsies were included in the study. Group 1 consisted of 14 patients and group 2 had 121 patients. Patients in group 1 were more likely to be older females (P < 0.05). Within group 1, those with steatohepatitis were older than those with steatosis (P < 0.05). When analyzed with regard to histopathology, patients with steatosis in group 1 were more likely female than group 2 patients (P = 0.03). Those with steatohepatitis in group 1 were older than group 2 patients (P = 0.001). Five of the 7 patients with steatohepatitis in group 1 had advanced liver disease at the time of biopsy.

Conclusions

Older female patients with isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase and risk factors for NAFLD should be evaluated for evidence of significant steatohepatitis.

### Guideline review: EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^116PpXhr]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

HDS-associated liver toxicity appears to be an emerging determinant of DILI, with wide geographical variability. A prospective study in Iceland purported 16% of DILI related to HDS, while the US Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network reported a similar percentage (16%), with an increase from 7% from 2004 to 2005 to 20% in 2013–2014. Further case–control data suggested rates of 4%–5% in studies in Latin Americaand Germany, respectively.

DILI should be classified according to the dominant pattern of liver enzyme derangement; hepatocellular, cholestatic and mixed injury (figure 1).

Initially, alanine transferase (ALT) activity (patients ALT/upper limit of normal (ULN) of ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (patients ALP/ULN of ALP) is calculated. Then ALT/ALP ratio (R) is determined. Some of the other commonly encountered phenotypes, and characteristic findings and commonly implicated agents are summarised in table 1.

Table 1
Classification of DILI based on liver enzyme derangement

ALT, ALP and bilirubin are the typical indices used to define liver damage, and liver dysfunction in DILI and serial measurements are necessary to portray extent of hepatocellular injury and DILI phase. ALT is sensitive for hepatocyte injury, particularly alongside an elevated bilirubin and this pattern is a reliable biomarker of liver injury in DILI. Elevated aminotransferases do not reflect the extent to which the liver is damaged, particularly in insidious variants of hepatotoxicity such as indolent fibrosis, vascular liver disorders, cirrhosis and microvesicular steatosis secondary to mitochondrial toxicity. Elevated ALP values usually indicate cholestatic damage, which combined with elevated GGT provides evidence the ALP elevation is of hepatic origin. Isolated hyperbilirubinaemia does not qualify as DILI, given possibility of multiple confounding diagnoses. One important consideration is mild transaminase rises that may be apparent in relation to statin therapy, this may simply reflect an adaptive response and does not represent a true DILI. As such, given the benefit of statins in NAFLD(Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and cardiovascular disease such therapies should be continued where feasible.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^115LahNR]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

### Background… [^114qMUwo]. stacks.cdc.gov (2013). Low credibility.

Elevated total serum alkaline phosphatase levels have been associated with mortality in the general population and in dialysis patients. Retrospective cohort study. 28, 678 patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3 and 4. Each 1-standard deviation higher ALP level was associated with 15% and 16% increased risk of ESRD and mortality respectively. We included 28, 678 patients who had an ALP level between the first and second eGFR < 60 ml/min/1. 73 m², similar results were noted.

In a subgroup analysis that included patients who had serum phosphorus data, we found that while adjusting for serum phosphorus, each 1-standard deviation higher ALP was associated with a 10% increased hazard for mortality, and a non-significant 9% increased risk for ESRD. In a diverse population with CKD stages 3 and 4, we noted a graded increase in the risk for the composite outcome of all-cause mortality and ESRD even after adjusting for relevant confounding variables. Similar results were obtained when the analysis was restricted to those who had ALP levels within the normal ranges highlighting that even high-normal values of ALP might be associated with risk for adverse outcomes. In summary, elevated ALP levels are associated with an increased risk of ESRD and all cause mortality in patients with CKD stages 3–4.

These findings, along with previous studies in this area, suggest that clinicians may use ALP as a risk assessment tool to identify patients with higher risk for mortality and/or ESRD progression. More studies are warranted to confirm the association of ALP with ESRD and illuminate the pathogenetic process.

OS was significantly longer among patients with normal ALP BL than among those with elevated ALP BL (401 vs. 222 days, p = 0.01; Fig. 4), and among ALP responders (≥ 30% reduction) than among ALP nonresponders (363 vs. 115 days, p = 0.01; Fig. 5). When ALP response was defined as a reduction of ≥ 10% from baseline (exploratory analysis among patients with elevated ALP BL only), OS was significantly longer among ALP responders than among ALP nonresponders (256 vs. 137 days, p = 0.03; Fig. 6). Among patients with elevated ALP BL, a correlation was also observed between OS (233 days) and ALP max (r² = 0.24; Fig. 7). The correlation between OS and ALP max was weaker among patients with normal ALP BL (r² = 0.17).

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

### Normal alkaline phosphatase levels are dependent on race / ethnicity: nationalGEP health and nutrition examination survey data [^114miX4V]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Circulating alkaline phosphatase (ALP) primarily originates from the liver and bones and is routinely used as a as a marker of hepatic/biliary injury. Values exceeding the upper limit of normal (ULN) often prompt further clinical follow-up, including measurement of gamma-glutamyl transferase and fractionation of ALP to determine the origin of this elevation — thus the establishment of appropriate cutoffs has clinical implications. Standard procedures for the establishment of reference ranges for laboratory assays were published by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry in 2011; however, there is considerable variation in results for ALP across various laboratories, and there is not universal acceptance of a single ULN. Moreover, published reference intervals have been derived from racially and ethnically homogeneous samples, such as Northern Europeanor, more recently, Han Chinese, which may not be generalisable to the multiracial population of the USA. We used demographic and laboratory data from the annual National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)collected from 2009 to 2016 to evaluate normal ranges of ALP among a large, racially diverse sample of healthy adults in the USA.

CLINICAL LABORATORY

Minor persistent elevations in serum transaminases (SGOT, SGPT) have been noted in 7% of patients during pindolol tablets administration, but progressive elevations were not observed. These elevations were not associated with any other abnormalities that would suggest hepatic impairment, such as decreased serum albumin and total proteins. During more than a decade of worldwide marketing, there have been no reports in the medical literature of overt hepatic injury. Alkaline phosphatase, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), and uric acid are also elevated on rare occasions. The significance of these findings is unknown.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115xNaAK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Cholestatic liver diseases — evaluation of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the role of gamma‑glutamyl transferase (GGT) is outlined as follows: cholestatic liver diseases are associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase, with or without elevated bilirubin, and once alkaline phosphatase has been confirmed to be of hepatic origin, an ultrasound of the liver should be performed to assess the hepatic parenchyma and bile ducts. Biliary dilatation suggests an extrahepatic cause, whereas a non-dilated biliary system suggests that the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase is intrahepatic; some disease of extrahepatic cholestasis may not be apparent by ultrasound and cholangiography by MR/MRCP or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography should be undertaken when these disorders are suspected. With isolated alkaline phosphatase elevation, confirmation with GGT, or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes can be used to help differentiate alkaline phosphatase from non-liver sources; however, GGT elevation is not specific for cholestatic liver disease and can be elevated in > 50% of alcoholic patients without obvious evidence of liver disease, so GGT should not be used as a screening test for underlying liver disease in the absence of abnormal liver chemistries. In hospitalized patients with isolated alkaline phosphatase elevations, one study reported that ~80% could be given a clinical diagnosis solely based on history and physical examination, routine labs, and chest X-ray.

Osteosarcoma — prognostic serum markers and survival: Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are identified as prognostic indicators, with higher LDH at presentation in metastatic versus localized disease in a cohort of 1421 extremity cases (36.6% vs. 18.8%; P < .0001), and 5-year disease-free survival correlated with LDH (39.5% for high LDH vs 60% for normal). In a retrospective analysis of 789 extremity cases, ALP was a significant prognostic factor for event-free survival, with 5-year EFS 24% when serum ALP was more than four times the normal value and 46% when elevated below this limit (P < .001). However, in multivariate analyses, these markers did not retain prognostic significance when compared with tumor volume, age, and histologic response to chemotherapy.

### Biochemical phenotype of hypophosphatasia in asymptomatic individuals carrying ALPL variants [^117JBDy6]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is the rare metabolic disorder caused by variants in the ALPL gene, resulting in deficient activity of tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (ALP). This leads to accumulation of substrates contributing to impaired bone mineralization. Hypophosphatasia manifests with a broad clinical spectrum; however, an increasing number of individuals with ALPL variants have been identified presenting the hallmark biochemical feature of HPP of low serum ALP activity, with or without elevated serum pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) or urine phosphoethanolamine (PEA), while remaining asymptomatic. These ALPL carriers may represent a distinct subgroup within the HPP continuum, prompting the need for clearer classification. Using data from the Global ALPL Gene Variant Database, we identified 43 subjects who fulfilled the following criteria: low ALP (adjusted for age/sex), at least one ALPL variant, and no overt or reported HPP-related symptoms. Their median age was 29 yr (range 0–64); 23 were female. Serum ALP activity was reduced in all cases, with 76% of subjects showing levels less than 50% below the lower limit of normal. In 19 of 43 individuals, PLP or PEA was also elevated. Thirty distinct genotypes were observed; 79% of subjects were heterozygous, while 21% harbored homozygous or compound heterozygous variants. The identified variants were largely missense (77%), mostly affecting regions without a specific domain (38%). Five variants showed a dominant-negative effect in vitro, yet produced no clinical manifestations. Some identified genotypes were also linked to adult, childhood, or odontohypophosphatasia phenotypes, underscoring significant genotype-phenotype variability. These findings refine our understanding of the HPP spectrum, identifying a cohort of asymptomatic ALPL carriers with biochemical phenotype of HPP. Recognizing this group is important for improving diagnostic criteria and preventing overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify follow-up strategies and determine whether these individuals develop clinical manifestations later in life or remain asymptomatic.

### Lomitapide mesylate (Juxtapid) [^116fHboP]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISK OF HEPATOTOXICITY

JUXTAPID can cause elevations in transaminases. In the JUXTAPID clinical trial, 10 (34%) of the 29 patients treated with JUXTAPID had at least one elevation in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 3× upper limit of normal (ULN). There were no concomitant clinically meaningful elevations of total bilirubin, international normalized ratio (INR), or alkaline phosphatase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

JUXTAPID also increases hepatic fat, with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. The median absolute increase in hepatic fat was 6% after both 26 and 78 weeks of treatment, from 1% at baseline, measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Hepatic steatosis associated with JUXTAPID treatment may be a risk factor for progressive liver disease, including steatohepatitis and cirrhosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Measure ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin before initiating treatment and then ALT and AST regularly as recommended. During treatment, adjust the dose of JUXTAPID if the ALT or AST are ≥ 3× ULN. Discontinue JUXTAPID for clinically significant liver toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### High alkaline phosphatase levels in hemodialysis patients are associated with higher risk of hospitalization and death [^113rr9sD]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

We evaluated risks associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase in hemodialysis patients using longitudinal data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, a prospective observational study of hemodialysis patients in 12 countries. Alkaline phosphatase levels were normalized by the upper limit of the laboratory-reported reference range. Cause-specific hospitalization and mortality risks were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by region and adjusted for phosphorus, calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone, case mix, and numerous comorbidities. The odds of high normalized alkaline phosphatase were increased twofold in the United States in comparison to Japan. Elevations of normalized alkaline phosphatase were significantly associated with several comorbid conditions, increased fractures, parathyroidectomy, risk of hospitalization due to major adverse cardiac events, higher all-cause cardiovascular, and infection-related mortality risk. Our results also show that elevated serum normalized alkaline phosphatase was associated with higher risks of hospitalization and death in hemodialysis patients, independent of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels.

### Parathyroid carcinoma [^113mzzCB]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2008). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase activity is also higher in patients with parathyroid carcinoma than in those with adenoma in whom serum levels are generally close to the upper limit of the normal range. α- and β-subunits of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may be elevated in patients with parathyroid cancer but not in those with benign tumors. Urinary hCG levels were found to be elevated in a small group of subjects with parathyroid carcinomas, in contrast to a control group of patients with benign PHPT. In particular, the elevated hCG isotype was the hyperglycosolated form of hCG that is specifically associated with malignancy in trophoblastic and nontrophoblastic diseases. Moreover, elevations of hCG might be predictive of complications such as hip fracture and death.

When benign PHPT presents with markedly elevated serum calcium concentrations and overt target organ involvement, a clinical phenotype that was historically common but is now infrequently seen in most countries, the clinical distinction between benign and malignant disease may be difficult. It is preferable to have a high index of suspicion particularly when concomitant kidney and bone disease are present than to miss the opportunity for surgical cure by failing to consider cancer in the differential diagnosis.

Acute PHPT, sometimes called "parathyroid crisis", shares many clinical features with parathyroid carcinoma. In view of the marked elevations of serum calcium and PTH that are common in parathyroid crisis, parathyroid cancer should be considered in any differential diagnosis of this condition. Parathyroid cancer should also be considered in any hypercalcemic patient without a history of prior neck surgery who presents with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.

Discussion

According to CHB guidelines, patients should be considered for antivirus therapy when they have moderate to severe fibrosis (S ≥ 2). Therefore, it is important to stage significant (S ≥ 2) and insignificant (S ≤ 1) fibrosis in CHB patients. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for staging fibrosis. However, its limitations prevent its wide application. Thus, there is an urgent need for research on noninvasive procedures or tests to stage liver fibrosis.

HBeAg(+) and HBeAg(−) stages represent different stages of HBV infection, with different virological, serological and biochemical levels. In the HBeAg(+) phase, an inactive stage presents mild liver injury with no or mild fibrosis, whereas the active stage presents significant liver injury with progressive fibrosis. In the HBeAg(−) stage, the inactive stage shows repaired liver injury with regressive fibrosis, whereas the active stage involves significant liver re-injury with progressive re-fibrosis. In this study, we found that HBeAg(+) patients had higher HBsAg, HBeAg, AST and GGT levels, whereas HBeAg(−) patients had higher HBcAb, ALP and AFP levels. Therefore, it is important to differentiate HBeAg(+) and HBeAg(−) CHB when searching for and verifying noninvasive fibrosis markers.

Here, we analysed the relationship between clinical and laboratory data and histological fibrosis in CHB patients. We found that AST, ALP, GGT, AFP, HBcAb, PLT and HBeAg were related to significant fibrosis. Surprisingly, only ALP was an independent factor for significant fibrosis by multiple logistic regression analysis in CHB patients. Then, we differentiated the HBeAg(+) and HBeAg(−) patients. ALP was also the only independent factor for significant fibrosis in HBeAg(−) patients. In HBeAg(+) patients, ALP was one of the factors for significant fibrosis in univariate analysis; however, subsequent multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that age and HBeAg were associated with significant fibrosis, similar to previous studies. Age was an important predictor because the progression of fibrosis is time dependent in CHB. In HBeAg(+) patients, significant fibrosis patients had lower HBeAg levels. The specific mechanism is unknown. However, this might occur because, from high levels of HBeAg to low levels of HBeAg, immune clearance is improved, injury and healing are more obvious, and the fibrosis is more aggravated.

Biochemistry

Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) at presentation (while sometimes modestly raised, and occasionally normal) are typically about 10 times higher than normal (sometimes even higher). Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be mildly raised in active disease, but marked elevation suggests primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) variant syndromes (Section N).

AIH presentation might vary between races. African-American patients are (compared with Caucasian patients) younger, with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Caucasian patients had more cholestatic histological features and a higher rate of non-response to treatment, not fully explained by differences in access to medical care.

Severity assessment

Although no unified severity classification exists for AIH, there are seven distinct patterns. These incorporate current understanding of acute and chronic liver disease and are determined by the severity of the acute (mild, icteric, severe, fulminant) and chronic (mild, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, compensated and decompensated) components of liver injury:

Asymptomatic disease: (a) mild or (b) with fibrosis/cirrhosis

Asymptomatic patients might not have mild disease. While they tend to have lower serum transaminases than symptomatic patients, severity of necro-inflammation and fibrosis are similar, as is death/transplantation rate. Treating asymptomatic patients is associated with improved survival (Section F).

Chronic hepatitis

This is the most common form of AIH, with insidious onset and non-specific symptoms.

Cirrhosis: (a) compensated and (b) decompensated

About one-third of patients with AIH have cirrhosis at diagnosis. Sometimes patients (usually elderly) present with cirrhosis complications. Cirrhosis and decompensation are poor prognostic features.

Acute hepatitis with or without jaundice

Initial severity of inflammation has prognostic implications. Patients with initial serum AST > 10 x ULN are less likely than those with values < 10 x ULN) to present with cirrhosis and/or decompensation, and to die due to (or need transplantation for) liver disease.

Acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF)

ACLF is acute injury developing in patients with (often unrecognised) cirrhosis, and sometimes with extrahepatic organ failure. In patients with AIH, a disease 'flare' might precipitate ACLF. Such patients might benefit from corticosteroids and most treated patients recover (Section F). However, in the UK, a label of ACLF is a potential mechanism to expedite liver transplant.

THE PROS AND CONS OF ALP IN PSC

An elevated serum ALP level above the upper limit of normal (ULN) is part of the diagnostic criteria of PSC in adults in the EASL, but not in the AASLD clinical practice guidelines. According to the AASLD guidelines, the cholangiographic features of PSC, along with the exclusion of secondary sclerosing cholangitis, is sufficient for making a diagnosis, accounting for the fact that a significant proportion of individuals with PSC may have normal ALP levels. As PSC is increasingly diagnosed at earlier disease stages along with increased attention and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) availability and quality, omission of the elevated ALP criterion of the diagnosis, as now implemented in the AASLD guidelines, may be particularly relevant. High levels of ALP are associated with a more severe disease stratum, while normal levels are associated with a better prognosis. ALP is thus included in several prognostic models for PSC, including the Amsterdam-Oxford score, the UK-PSC score, and the PREsTO score. However, the intraindividual variability of ALP is considerable, and spontaneous normalization of ALP frequently occurs.,

Biology of ALP

ALPs are glycoproteins bound to the plasma membrane and are widely distributed in nature. In humans, zinc and magnesium serve as significant cofactors for their biological activity. ALPs exist in 4 different isoforms: intestinal ALP, placental ALP, germ cell ALP, and liver/bone/kidney (ie, tissue-nonspecific) ALP. Over 80% of the ALPs in serum originate from the liver and bone. Although ALPs are found in numerous tissues, their exact physiological function remains largely unknown. Elevated activity in the circulation is a marker for skeletal remodeling or hepatobiliary disease, but clinical variations in serum ALP levels also commonly occur in endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease, hematological diseases, malnutrition, and vitamin deficiencies. Genetic variation, for instance related to bile acid transport and glycobiology, associates with ALP levels in apparently healthy individuals. It is currently unknown to what extent ALP serves an integral part of cholestatic liver disease pathophysiology or merely represents a marker of biliary injury, altered bile composition, and cholestasis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^112US9Bg]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Concomitant Medications

The use of concomitant medications (eg, antibiotics/antimycotics) may complicate the interpretation of abnormal liver chemistries and the relationship between TAEAT and the oncotherapeutic agent.–Polypharmacy is prevalent among patients with cancer. It is estimated that approximately one third of the US elderly population (2005 to 2006) was prescribed ≥ 5 concurrent medications. Medications such as statins, antiepileptics (phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid), antifungals (ketoconazole and itraconazole), antituberculosis drugs (rifampin and isoniazid), cotrimoxazole, and allopurinol may all potentially elevate aminotransferases. Azole antifungals, in particular, are frequently used for prolonged periods in patients with hematologic malignancies, and have been implicated in idiosyncratic DILI, with nearly all azoles associated with minor changes in liver chemistries. The LiverTox Bookshelf and other resources provide an up-to-date summary of drugs implicated in DILI, and can aid in the differential diagnosis of elevated liver enzymes in patients being treated for malignancies.

Metastases

The effect of hepatic and bone metastases on liver enzymes is variable and confounded by relatively limited and often contrasting findings in the literature. Although alkaline phosphatase may be elevated with space-occupying lesions (eg, liver metastases) or due to extrahepatic biliary obstruction from enlarged lymphadenopathy in the area of the porta hepatis (as in breast cancer), firm incidence data are lacking. Aminotransferase elevations may reflect the infiltration of liver diseases, such as leukemia or lymphoma, or liver tests may remain normal. For example, despite having no obvious liver involvement in AML, autopsy reports indicated hepatic infiltration in > 75% of patients. In addition, higher rates of elevated aminotransferases (> 5×ULN) were reported in patients treated with onapristone with bone (2.4% to 4.8%) or liver (4.0%to 12.0%) metastases compared with those without these metastases (0.0% to 4.3% and 0.0% to 1.6%, respectively). Similarly, aminotransferases were significantly elevated in patients with solid tumors and liver metastasis versus those without metastases.–In contrast, a pooled analysis of 31 phase 2 and 3 oncology trials found that the incidence of ALT and AST elevations was generally similar in patients with or without liver metastases.

### Elevated liver enzymes: emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more common with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

Discussion

The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

Conclusions

By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management and evaluation of the patient with elevated LFTs.

### Clinical significance of elevated α-fetoprotein in alaskan native patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111MPw2b]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical significance of elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is not well defined. We analysed data from a population-based cohort of patients with HCV infection to assess the prevalence of elevated serum AFP, to determine its association with clinical and virologic parameters and with clinical outcomes. We defined a slightly elevated serum AFP level as 8 to < 15 and a high-AFP level as ≥ 15 microg/L. Among 541 HCV-RNA-positive persons, 61 (11%) had a slightly elevated or high AFP at the time of consent. AFP ≥ 8 microg/L was associated with the older age, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio > 1, and higher alkaline phosphatase levels, but not with heavy alcohol use, IV drug use, genotype, viral load or duration of HCV infection. Among 192 persons with an AFP at liver biopsy, 17% had an AFP ≥ 8 microg/L. The sensitivity/specificity of an AFP level ≥ 8 in detecting Ishak 3–6 fibrosis was 39%/95%. Among 372 persons with a minimum of four AFP measurements over 6 years, 5% had persistently elevated AFP > 8 microg/L, 19% had both elevated and normal AFP measurements, and 76% had persistently normal AFP. Elevated AFP at consent was associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and end-stage liver disease. Over 6 years of follow-up, persistently elevated AFP was associated with the development of HCC; no person with AFP persistently < 8 microg/mL developed HCC. Serial AFP measurements appear to be useful in identifying persons with advanced fibrosis and help to determine who needs periodic screening with liver ultrasound to detect HCC.

### Association between alkaline phosphatase levels and mortality in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases: a retrospective cohort study [^115Apgrt]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy worldwide, with liver metastasis being the leading cause of mortality. In 2020, approximately 1.9 million new CRC cases and 935,000 deaths were reported globally. In China, the incidence and mortality rates are notably high, with approximately 555,000 new cases and 286,000 deaths in the same year. Liver metastasis occurs in 20%–34% of patients at initial diagnosis, while 50%–60% develop metastases during disease progression. The presence of liver metastases significantly reduces survival rates, with the 5-year survival rate for patients with unresectable disease being less than 5%.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a hydrolase enzyme primarily produced by the liver, bones and placenta, is widely distributed in human tissues. Recent studies highlighted the potential use of ALP as a biomarker for various conditions. Its predictive value extends to non-malignant diseases such as cerebral haemorrhage, orthopaedic disorders and surgical complications. – Notably, elevated ALP levels are correlated with poor prognosis in several malignancies, including lung, liver, prostate and penile cancers, – making ALP an increasingly important tool in cancer prognostication. – Research has also revealed a significant relationship between ALP and carcinoembryonic antigen, which influences the prognosis of liver metastases from CRC. Elevated ALP levels in cases of liver metastasis can signify liver damage caused by invasive tumour cells. Previous single-centre retrospective studies have suggested that serum ALP levels are an independent predictor of overall survival in patients with stage I–IV CRC, excluding those with elevated ALP levels due to liver and kidney diseases. This research gap highlights the need to further investigate the role of ALP in prognostic assessments of patients with CRC and liver metastasis, which may provide a more valuable basis for clinical practice.

Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the association between ALP levels and mortality risk in Chinese patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Our study included 195 patients and considered multiple covariates to provide comprehensive and representative data for the Chinese population. These findings are expected to offer valuable insights for improving the prognostic assessment and personalised treatment strategies for patients with CRLM. The unique aspect of our study design lies in its comprehensive consideration of various clinical and biochemical indicators, aiming to more accurately assess the independent role of ALP in prognostic prediction.

### Benign transient hyperphosphatasemia in the pediatric population: a single center cohort study [^113kShy2]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be increased in a benign condition known as benign-transient hyperphosphatasemia (BTH). We aimed to evaluate the demographic, and clinical characteristics of infants and children with BTH.

Methods

In our retrospective study, infants and children diagnosed with BTH between September 2019 and September 2023 were included.

Results

Of 249 children with elevated ALP levels, 95 (38.1%) had BTH. The mean age at diagnosis of children with BTH was 2.4 ± 1.3 years (min 0.6 - max 6.2 years). ALP mean value was 2,587 ± 1252 U/L (min 972 - max 5757 U/L). ALP value was an average 7.4 ± 3.6 times higher than the corresponding upper limit of normal. The second measurement was made after an average of 13.2 ± 6 days, and a statistically significant difference was detected compared to the first value, with a decrease of 61 ± 23% in the ALP value (p < 0.001). ALP value returned to normal in an average of 44 ± 29.2 days. Elevated ALP was detected during infection in 49 (51.6%) children. When the sample was divided into those under 2 years of age and aged 2 and over, no statistical difference was observed in ALP levels in the time it took for ALP levels to return to the normal range (p = 0.480).

Conclusions

BTH should be kept in mind if high serum ALP is detected in children without clinical or laboratory suspicion of bone or liver disease. In the follow up detecting a significant decrease trend compared to the first value may be guiding for BTH.

### The liver in COVID-19: prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact on outcomes of liver test abnormalities [^116mgxHL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic unprecedented in over a century, with ≈35 million cases, and more than 1 million deaths globally. Though predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest.

Objective

To define prevalence, pattern, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Methods

Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 April 2020. Association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical and biochemical predictors, was examined.

Results

Data were available on 551 patients. Prevalence of any or ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal transaminase elevation on was 61.2 and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1 and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4 and 12.6%, respectively), and at peak (17.7 and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impact on mortality with AST positively, and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs.

Conclusion

LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 are very common, though majority are mild. Admission and peak bilirubin ≥ 1 mg/dl, as well as admission and peak AST:ALT ratio were significant predictors of mortality, along with age, myocardial injury, and chronic medical illness.

### How to use… alkaline phosphatase in neonatology [^116BVg9u]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is regularly measured in clinical practice. Changes in serum levels are observed in a number of clinical conditions. In neonatology, it has been proposed as a useful marker for both a diagnosis and an indication of the severity of metabolic bone disease (MBD) in infants born preterm. Nutritional practices, aimed at reducing the occurrence or severity of MBD, have led to ALP being proposed as a stand-alone means of monitoring treatment. The current evidence does not support this use: ALP only achieves usefulness in a diagnostic and monitoring capacity when combined with other serum and imaging techniques.

### Patient-derived reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase to support appropriate utility for isoenzymes determinations and hypophosphatasia [^1164DS7j]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appropriate age- and sex-specific reference intervals for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are essential to identify patients with hypophosphatasia (low ALP) and to avoid unnecessary ALP isoenzymes analysis (elevated ALP). This study used patient ALP historical data to statistically derive sex- and age-specific reference intervals.

Methods

The ALP values reported as part of clinical management during an 18 month period (from July 2021 to March 2023) were obtained. Following logarithmic transformation of ALP data and repeated removal of outliers, cumulative frequency plots were generated using a modified Hoffmann approach to derive age- and sex-specific reference intervals.

Results

Age-specific ALP reference intervals ranged from 110 to 250 and 120 to 295 U/L for males and females < 15 days old, 80 to 400 and 90 to 380 U/L for males and females 15 days to 1 year old, 105 to 280 and 90 to 290 U/L for males and females 1 to 10 years old, 75 to 300 and 90 to 300 U/L for males and females 10 to 13 years old, 80 to 300 and 60 to 175 U/L for males and females 13 to 15 years old, 55 to 150 and 60 to 180 U/L for males and females 15 to 18 years old, and 55 to 140 and 60 to 147 U/L for male and female adults, respectively (> 18 years old).

Conclusion

By applying derived ranges, a retrospective review of ALP isoenzymes would eliminate 24.5% of requests. Additionally, 9 neonates would have required investigation for possible hypophosphatasia.

### Transformative therapy in hypophosphatasia [^114sULVf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical findings of the most common manifestations are shown in figure 1; note that presentation can be multisystemic. Low ALP activity level is the hallmark of HPP and should be assessed when HPP is suspected. Measurement of ALP is easy to perform, readily available and can lead to rapid diagnosis. However, its interpretation requires some care. The normal range for ALP is age- and gender-specific, emphasising the need for appropriate laboratory reference ranges. Some laboratories only have one broad reference range for all ages; physicians should be wary because ALP levels that are normal for adults could represent pathological levels for children. Furthermore, there is often a focus upon elevated ALP for the diagnosis of rickets/osteomalacia, rather than low ALP levels.

Together with low ALP levels, typical radiological features of perinatal, infantile and childhood HPP can confirm the diagnosis. However, the radiological features in mild childhood, adult and odonto-HPP are not always diagnostic. Where the diagnosis is in doubt, confirmatory laboratory testing can include PLP, PPi or urinary phosphoethanolamine levels, which are usually above the reference range in patients with HPP, as well as ALPL mutational analyses.

The presence of any clinical findings shown in figure 1 with a combination of low ALP activity level should result in a working diagnosis of HPP until proven otherwise. Timely access to care and treatment options is dependent on the critical period between symptom onset and diagnosis. This is especially important for patients with perinatal and infantile HPP, where delays may have fatal consequences, or in older patients where treatment with bisphosphonates may worsen the bone phenotype. Improving awareness will increase the likelihood of a correct diagnosis and minimise the period between symptom onset and initiating the newly available, potentially life-saving therapy.

We hope that despite the inconvenience of frequent injections and the high cost of the treatment, this transformative therapy will be implemented for those in whom HPP is currently life-limiting.

### Serum alkaline phosphatase levels associate with elevated serum C-reactive protein in chronic kidney disease [^116APoDE]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

High serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations are associated with elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the general population. To examine whether this association is independent of serum vitamin D levels or modified in chronic kidney disease (CKD), we determined if such associations exist using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III of 14,420 adult participants in which 5.7% had CKD (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m²). For each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase, the odds of elevated serum CRP (over 3 mg/l) were increased 2.73-fold in the non-chronic and 2.50-fold in the CKD sub-populations, respectively. Regression coefficients of each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase with elevated CRP were not significantly different in between the sub-populations. Additional adjustment for the serum 25-hydroxy (OH) vitamin D level did not substantively change the results. Thus, associations of serum alkaline phosphatase with elevated CRP are independent of serum 25-OH vitamin D in the chronic and non-CKD populations. Hence, serum alkaline phosphatase might be a marker of the inflammatory milieu.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112YHG7F]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee conclusions

The evidence suggests that liver laboratory abnormalities will be found in 12% of patients with sarcoidosis who undergo routine liver function testing, most of whom have hepatic granulomas. We did not identify a specific pattern of liver function abnormalities indicative of hepatic sarcoidosis, but some studies suggest that liver granulomas are more often associated with increases of alkaline phosphatase and less frequently with rises in transaminases.

The committee discussed reports that immune suppression and ursodeoxycholic acid reduce transaminitis and cholestasis in patients with related symptoms (pruritus), suggesting that treatment is effective in reducing disease activity in patients with symptomatic hepatic sarcoidosis. However, according to both the committee's clinical experience and the systematic review, it is uncertain whether these effects can be extrapolated to asymptomatic patients with hepatic sarcoidosis. The systematic review found no difference in resolution or improvement of abnormal liver function tests with treatment; however, it was not designed to estimate the effects of treatment of hepatic sarcoidosis, and, therefore, better evidence about treatment may exist. Treatment decisions should not be undertaken carelessly, because death due to cirrhosis or liver failure is uncommon, yet the risks of chronic treatment, especially immune suppression, are significant. The committee also noted that prednisone treatment may confound the assessment, as it can cause transaminitis. The committee agreed that the evidence is too scarce to conclude whether treatment affects progression to cirrhosis or reduces the need for liver transplantation.

Taken together, the evidence suggests that more than 1 out of every 10 patients with sarcoidosis who undergo liver function testing will be identified as having liver involvement, but the implication on treatment is unclear. The committee concluded that there is value in identifying patients with liver involvement at the time of initial diagnosis, and to screen for liver involvement annually even if the initial screen is negative (Table 5), if for no other reason than to avoid hepatotoxic treatments, and to follow such patients more carefully for the development of symptoms that warrant treatment.

Recommendations

1 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we suggest baseline serum alkaline phosphatase testing to screen for hepatic sarcoidosis (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
2 For patients with sarcoidosis who have neither hepatic symptoms nor established hepatic sarcoidosis, we make no recommendation for or against baseline serum transaminase testing.

AUA renal mass follow-up — bone scan use directs that patients undergoing follow-up for treated malignant renal masses should only undergo bone scan if one or more of the following is present: clinical symptoms such as bone pain, elevated alkaline phosphatase, or radiographic findings suggestive of a bony neoplasm (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The text also notes that the routine use of bone scan in the absence of bone pain or elevated ALP should not be pursued, although with the presence of symptoms and/or elevated marker, radionuclide bone scan can be a useful test.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^114zraiE]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Guidance statements — clinically significant drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is defined as any of: serum AST or ALT > 5x ULN or ALP > 2x ULN on two separate occasions, total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP, or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; most hepatotoxic drugs cause injury within the first 6 months, so evaluation should include a detailed medication and HDS history within the 180 days before presentation; classify injury using the ratio (ALT/ULN)/(ALP/ULN) into hepatocellular (R ≥ 5), mixed (2 < R < 5), and cholestatic (R ≤ 2) profiles; excluding alternative causes is required, and certain drugs have phenotype "signatures" useful for causality; We recommend accessing the LiverTox website for literature covering over 1000 prescription drugs.

### Persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase [^117XpUm1]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 32-year-old overweight asymptomatic man was found to have a persistently raised serum alkaline phosphatase at 250–300&emsp14; U/l (normal range < 130). Other liver function tests were unremarkable apart from an initial marginally elevated alanine transaminase, which normalised with weight reduction. Abdominal imaging revealed a fatty liver but an extensive serological search for significant hepatobiliary disease was negative. Subsequent isoenzyme electrophoresis revealed normal liver and bone fractions of alkaline phosphatase but a grossly elevated intestinal fraction. Elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase should be considered in the investigation of unexplained alkaline phosphatase, particularly when the usual associated hepatobiliary and bony pathologies are not present. Although an elevated intestinal fraction of alkaline phosphatase can be linked to significant gastrointestinal pathology, this case report highlights that it can be a benign biochemical finding.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^116sUSJP]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis considerations for hypophosphatasia — Diagnosis in patients of any age can be established based on characteristic signs, symptoms, and complications together with consistently low age- and sex-adjusted serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after excluding other causes of low ALP and skeletal diseases with similar presentations. Because the lower limit of normal for ALP varies by age and sex, measured activity must be compared with the lower limit and range appropriate for the patient. Physicians should be aware that many institutions do not routinely flag low ALP and may incorrectly apply adult ALP reference ranges to all ages, and the report emphasizes that age- and sex-adjusted ALP reference intervals are critical to an accurate diagnosis of HPP.

### Association between alkaline phosphatase levels and mortality in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases: a retrospective cohort study [^111azbu2]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Univariate analysis of death.

The Cox proportional hazards model analysis revealed a significant association between ALP levels and mortality risk in patients with CRLM (Table 3). In the unadjusted model, each 100-unit increase in ALP was associated with a 13% increase in mortality risk (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04–1.22, p = 0.0023). After adjusting for sex, age and KPS, the association remained significant (HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02–1.21, p = 0.0209). In the fully adjusted model, which accounted for multiple additional clinical factors, the association strengthened with each 100-unit increase in ALP was associated with a 24% increase in mortality risk (HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.08–1.43, p = 0.0029). Across all models, the p -value was < 0.05, demonstrating the statistical significance of this association. These results highlight the potential importance of ALP in predicting the prognosis for patients with CRLM while also emphasising the need to consider the broader clinical context when evaluating the association between ALP and mortality risk.

How is PBC diagnosed?

Modes and routes of presentation

Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)towards presentation following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on screening(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver transplantation.

Figure 1
The BSG/UK-PBC consensus care pathway for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). While care needs always to be personalised to the patient, there are consensus pathways that are important for patients with PBC, which encompass the important 'pillars' of care that are believed to provide optimal management of disease and its complications.

Blood tests

The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (> 95% for both sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart of PBC diagnosis.

Liver biochemistry

PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.

### Tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase regulates tumour growth, epithelial plasticity and disease-free survival in metastatic prostate cancer [^113uWssD]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Our studies identify tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase as elevated in metastatic prostate cancer, associated with reduced disease-free survival. These findings, when combined with the elevated circulating alkaline phosphatase levels that are associated with advanced prostate cancer, identify alkaline phosphatase as a potential therapeutic target. In addition to the association with disease-free survival identified in the present study, increased expression of alkaline phosphatase is associated with vascular calcification. Considerable advances have been made to identify small-molecule inhibitors of TNAP for the treatment of diseases associated with arterial medial calcification, and our results suggest that these inhibitors would be of interest to evaluate in the setting of metastatic prostate cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated that bone-targeted alkaline phosphatase can act as enzyme-replacement therapy for hypophosphatasia, highlighting the promise of alkaline phosphatase as a therapeutic target.

The inevitable fatality associated with advanced prostate cancer and bone metastasis, and the unpredictable nature of progression from primary prostate cancer make it imperative to identify mechanisms that will ultimately enhance our understanding of disease progression, leading to new therapeutic approaches or prognostic indicators. Tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase represents one such mechanism, where a previously unrecognised role in tumour cell biology is associated with disease progression. Collectively, our studies have identified a novel role for tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase in MET and cell death. Moreover, we have highlighted the clinical association between tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase expression and metastatic disease, further supported by a significant decrease in disease-free survival in prostate cancer patients with high alkaline phosphatase expression.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^115PkWRv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

### Alkaline phosphatase normalization is associated with better prognosis in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^111U7ekM]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Primary sclerosing cholangitis results in elevated but fluctuating serum alkaline phosphatase levels that occasionally return to normal.

Aims

To investigate the frequency of normalization of alkaline phosphatase in newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients and the subsequent clinical outcomes.

Methods

Records of newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients were examined retrospectively for laboratory values and clinical end points (cholangiocarcinoma, liver transplantation and death) within 10 years of diagnosis. Data from a recent prospective ursodeoxycholic acid treatment trial were also studied.

Results

Eighty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. Normalization of alkaline phosphatase was seen in 35 (40%) patients. Five (14%) patients with normalization reached an end point whereas 17 (33%) of the patients with persistent elevation reached an end point (P = 0.02). Ursodeoxycholic acid was used similarly by both groups. When the investigative criteria were applied to a prospective trial, there was again a significant relationship between normalization of alkaline phosphatase and survival in patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (P < 0.01) and the placebo group (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Serum alkaline phosphatase was found to normalize in a high proportion of newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis patients. This was significantly associated with a better prognosis in a retrospective cohort and when data from a prospective treatment trial was evaluated.

### Clinical significance of transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferase (TAEAT) in oncology [^117G2zgw]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hundreds of drugs are associated with drug-induced liver injury (DILI), which has a wide spectrum of clinical and biochemical manifestations, ranging from transient asymptomatic elevations in aminotransferases (TAEAT) to acute liver failure. Most cases (> 90%) of DILI resolve fully within several weeks after drug discontinuation, although some cases can persist as chronic low-level enzyme elevations for 6 to 12 months despite the drug cessation. Drug adaptation may also occur, defined as the phenomenon whereby an agent fails to cause progressive worsening of DILI beyond what are generally transient, low-level, asymptomatic reversible alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations despite the drug continuation.

Although international working groups have defined threshold levels of ALT or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to distinguish acute DILI from mild elevations, the clinical significance of higher level (ie, grade 3 [G3] and grade 4 [G4]) asymptomatic transient elevations has not been extensively studied, especially in oncology. In addition, there are gaps in the understanding of mechanisms leading to significantly elevated aminotransferase levels, specifically in cases of asymptomatic and transient presentations without clinical signs of hepatocyte damage.

Herein, TAEAT is used to indicate the occurrence of transient asymptomatic G3 and G4 elevations in aminotransferases (ALT and/or AST) without associated elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase or corresponding histologic liver abnormalities. A review of TAEAT in oncology clinical trials and clinical practice is provided. In addition, the gaps in our current understanding of the phenomenon are identified, including those areas where consensus guidelines and practical suggestions for clinicians involved in managing oncology patients with elevated aminotransferases may offer value.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Associations of serum alkaline phosphatase with metabolic syndrome and mortality [^115SYA5t]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recent data suggest that elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels are associated with increased mortality, but the mechanisms for this association are unknown. As metabolic syndrome is associated with higher serum alkaline phosphatase levels, we examined the joint association of mortality with metabolic syndrome and serum alkaline phosphatase levels in the US general population.

Methods

Retrospective observational study of 15,234 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to jointly relate mortality risk to serum alkaline phosphatase and indicators of metabolic syndrome.

Results

Prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 14% to 41% among patients in lowest and higher quartiles, respectively, for baseline serum alkaline phosphatase. The mortality hazard ratio for each doubling of serum alkaline phosphatase was 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35–1.72) adjusting only for demographic factors, and 1.37 (95% CI, 1.21–1.56) adjusting for both demographic and metabolic syndrome factors in the full cohort, and was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.36–2.46) adjusting for demographic factors in the subgroup without any of the component conditions of metabolic syndrome.

Conclusions

In the US general population, higher levels of serum alkaline phosphatase is a predictor of mortality independent of the baseline prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Further studies are warranted to unravel the mechanisms of this association.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### Tumour-derived alkaline phosphatase regulates tumour growth, epithelial plasticity and disease-free survival in metastatic prostate cancer [^1126mWaH]. British Journal of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, with an estimated 1.1 million men diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012 worldwide. Whereas localised prostate cancer has a good prognosis, advanced disease metastasises frequently to the skeleton, and becomes castration resistant. Once prostate cancer has metastasised to distant sites, the disease is ultimately fatal and treatment is purely palliative. The most common metastatic sites are the lymph nodes and the bone, with bone metastases resulting in severe bone pain and fractures. Despite many advances in research, a greater understanding of the metastatic process is required, to identify new therapeutic targets.

Recent evidence suggests that bone-related parameters are the main prognostic factors for overall survival in advanced prostate cancer. These include alkaline phosphatase, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, urinary n -telopepetide, previous skeletal-related events and pain. Alkaline phosphatase, also known as tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) or mesenchymal stem cell antigen 1, is an enzyme that is expressed by a range of tissues including bone, and also the liver. There are four existing isoforms of alkaline phosphatase, and the ALPL gene encodes for TNAP. Alkaline phosphatase is highly expressed by osteoblasts and a key component of osteoblastic activity, acting to hydrolyse inorganic pyrophosphate resulting in mineralisation. The bone lesions associated with prostate cancer are predominantly osteosclerotic, arising because of an increase in osteoblastic activity and uncontrolled formation of new bone. As such, the elevated circulating levels of alkaline phosphatase seen in advanced prostate cancer are thought to reflect the dysregulated bone formation associated with cancer-induced bone disease.

### Impact of liver tumour burden, alkaline phosphatase elevation, and target lesion size on treatment outcomes withLu-dotatate: an analysis of the NETTER-1 study [^1135oMrE]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the impact of baseline liver tumour burden, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevation, and target lesion size on treatment outcomes with 177 Lu-Dotatate.

Methods

In the phase 3 NETTER-1 trial, patients with advanced, progressive midgut neuroendocrine tumours (NET) were randomised to 177Lu-Dotatate (every 8 weeks, four cycles) plus octreotide long-acting release (LAR) or to octreotide LAR 60 mg. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analyses of PFS by baseline factors, including liver tumour burden, ALP elevation, and target lesion size, were performed using Kaplan-Meier estimates; hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using Cox regression.

Results

Significantly prolonged median PFS occurred with 177 Lu-Dotatate versus octreotide LAR 60 mg in patients with low (< 25%), moderate (25–50%), and high (> 50%) liver tumour burden (HR 0.187, 0.216, 0.145), and normal or elevated ALP (HR 0.153, 0.177), and in the presence or absence of a large target lesion (diameter > 30 mm; HR, 0.213, 0.063). Within the 177 Lu-Dotatate arm, no significant difference in PFS was observed amongst patients with low/moderate/high liver tumour burden (P = 0.7225) or with normal/elevated baseline ALP (P = 0.3532), but absence of a large target lesion was associated with improved PFS (P = 0.0222). Grade 3 and 4 liver function abnormalities were rare and did not appear to be associated with high baseline liver tumour burden.

Conclusions

177 Lu-Dotatate demonstrated significant prolongation in PFS versus high-dose octreotide LAR in patients with advanced, progressive midgut NET, regardless of baseline liver tumour burden, elevated ALP, or the presence of a large target lesion.

### Alkaline phosphatase: discovery and naming of our favorite enzyme [^1126UAag]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase can be considered "our favorite enzyme" for reasons apparent to those who diagnose and treat metabolic bone diseases or who study skeletal biology. Few might know, however, that alkaline phosphatase likely represents the most frequently assayed enzyme in all of medicine. Elevated activity in the circulation is universally recognized as a marker for skeletal or hepatobiliary disease. Nevertheless, the assay conditions in many ways are nonphysiological. The term alkaline phosphatase emerged when it became necessary to distinguish "bone phosphatase" from the phosphatase in the prostate that features an acidic pH optimum. Beginning in 1948, studies of the inborn-error-of-metabolism hypophosphatasia would identify the natural substrates and establish the physiological role of alkaline phosphatase, including in biomineralization. Here, we recount the discovery in 1923 and then eventual naming of this enzyme that remains paramount in our field. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

### Drug-induced liver injury: recent advances in diagnosis and risk assessment [^1142Ngsv]. Gut (2017). Low credibility.

Standard of diagnosis: role of currently performed liver tests in assessing DILI

DILI most often presents as an acute viral hepatitis-like syndrome, without symptoms that specifically point to the drug aetiology unless rash or other cutaneous manifestationsreinforce the suspicion of drug toxicity. The clinical spectrum of DILI can mimic almost every other liver disorder. Accompanying blood eosinophilia is uncommon in large series of patients with DILI, but is clearly suggestive of drug allergy. Histopathological findings in DILI can resemble many other liver disorders, thereby limiting the value of liver biopsy in DILI diagnosis. However, biopsy can be of use to establish an alternative diagnosis when the underlying liver disease worsens (ie, alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH))(table 1).

Table 1
Examples of host and environmental variables influencing the diagnostic workup in patients assessed for suspected DILI

A diagnostic workflow for assessing cases of suspected DILI is shown in figure 3. Serum aminotransferases, that is, ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin (TB) levels, although not specific for DILI, remain the hallmark for detecting and classifying liver damage. Minor increases in aminotransferases that can result from adaptive and reversible liver responses to the drug (eg, statins) or from pre-existing liver disease (eg, fatty liver) should not be classified as DILI. An international expert groupproposed the following thresholds for a diagnosis of DILI: (a) ALT value ≥ 5× ULN, (b) ALP value ≥ 2× ULN or (c) ALT value ≥ 3× ULN and TB ≥ 2× ULN. The latter constellation defines 'Hy's Law', which anticipates a 10% risk of mortality/liver transplantation, as confirmed in large databases of DILI cases. The FDA guidance for DILI extends the interpretation of Hy's Law by stating that 'there should not be a prominent cholestatic component' in the hepatocellular nature of the liver injury, suggesting that a cholestatic component as defined by elevated ALP levels is associated with less risk of progression. However, a recent analysis from the Spanish DILI Registry showed that raised ALP > 2 ULN did not decrease the risk of acute liver failure in cases fulfilling Hy's Law. A marked increase of AST and an AST/ALT ratio > 1.5 at DILI recognition also predict a worse prognosis.

### Does an abnormally elevated maternal alkaline phosphatase pose problems for the fetus? [^116t8JQh]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We report a potential association between an abnormally raised pregnancy level of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). There are few reports of women with abnormally high ALP during pregnancy. However, there is work to suggest an association with placental insufficiency, low birth weight and preterm delivery. In conjunction with a rising ALP, fetal IUGR and intermittent absence of umbilical artery end diastolic flow had evolved. A greatly elevated ALP may be a marker for placental insufficiency and IUGR.

Clinically significant abnormalities (irrespective of drug relationship) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows: with an incidence of greater than 1%: decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and blood glucose; elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, potassium, ALT, GGT, AST, BUN, creatinine, blood glucose, platelet count, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils; with an incidence of less than 1%: leukopenia, neutropenia, decreased sodium, potassium, platelet count, elevated monocytes, basophils, bicarbonate, serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, LDH, and phosphate. The majority of subjects with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline. When follow-up was provided, changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible.

In multiple-dose clinical trials involving more than 5000 patients, four patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related liver enzyme abnormalities and one because of a renal function abnormality.

Pediatric Patients:

One, Three, and Five-Day Regimens

Laboratory data collected from comparative clinical trials employing two 3-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 3 days), or two 5-day regimens (30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg in divided doses over 5 days) were similar for regimens of azithromycin and all comparators combined, with most clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring at incidences of 1 to 5%. Laboratory data for patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose were collected in one single center trial. In that trial, an absolute neutrophil count between 500 to 1500 cells/mm3was observed in 10/64 patients receiving 30 mg/kg as a single dose, 9/62 patients receiving 30 mg/kg given over 3 days, and 8/63 comparator patients. No patient had an absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3.

In multiple-dose clinical trials involving approximately 4700 pediatric patients, no patients discontinued therapy because of treatment-related laboratory abnormalities.

### Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase concentrations are less variable than those of parathyroid hormone in stable hemodialysis patients [^112TEkPh]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with kidney failure frequently develop chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). This term encompasses biochemical abnormalities such as secondary hyperparathyroidism along with alterations in bone morphology and extraskeletal (vascular) calcification. Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that CKD-MBD contributes to morbidityand mortality, in the CKD population. The gold standard for diagnosis of the bone component of CKD-MBD is bone histomorphometry. However, this is a costly, painful, and invasive procedure that is not routinely performed in clinical practice. Instead, clinical management focuses on biochemical targets, especially plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH). The limitations of PTH as a marker in this respect are increasingly appreciated. Recently, we have demonstrated the high biological variability of PTH in patients on hemodialysis. Our data showed that in hemodialysis patients at least 26 specimens are required in order to estimate an individual's homeostatic set point within 10%. In addition, the concentration of PTH must differ by > 72% between any two measurements before it can be considered a significant change. These data raise further concerns over the use of PTH and PTH target concentrations in CKD-MBD and emphasize the need for better markers.

A possible alternative is serum bone–specific alkaline phosphatase (bone ALP), a marker of bone turnover. However, no data concerning the biological variation of bone ALP in the hemodialysis population have been reported. The measurement of any laboratory analyte is subject to error or variation, which can be divided into three categories: preanalytical, analytical, and biological. If sources of preanalytical variation are minimized, then intraindividual biological variation (CV I) can be estimated by removing the contribution of analytical variation (CV A) from total variation (CV T). These numerical data can be used to evaluate the number of samples required to estimate an individual's homeostatic set point and calculate the critical difference, also known as the reference change value. This is the degree of change that must be observed in any measured substance before that change can be considered statistically significant, and therefore has obvious clinical importance in the monitoring of any patients with a chronic condition. The importance of understanding biological variation in nephrology is increasingly realized. The aims of this study were to establish: (i) the within-subject biological variation of bone ALP in hemodialysis patients, (ii) how many measurements are required to estimate a true homeostatic set point in any individual, (iii) the critical difference, and (iv) how these results compare with those we previously reported for PTH.

### Inter-and intra-individual variation, and limited prognostic utility, of serum alkaline phosphatase in a trial of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113zTGZL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score are used as endpoints in trials of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We aimed to quantify inter- and intra-individual variation in levels of ALP and the ELF score over time, and evaluated their association with fibrosis progression.

Methods

We analyzed data from 234 patients with large-duct PSC enrolled in a 2-year, phase 2b placebo-controlled trial of simtuzumab. Participants were assessed by laboratory tests every 4 weeks, and liver biopsies collected at time of screening, week 48, and week 96.

Results

Serum levels of ALP and ELF scores did not differ significantly between simtuzumab and placebo groups, so the data were pooled. Median per-patient variations in ALP between clinic visits were approximately 12% over 12 weeks, 20% over 48 weeks, and 20% over 96 weeks. Reductions, unrelated to study intervention, of more than 40% in ALP were observed in 10.9% of patients with baseline activity greater than 2-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) and 12.5% of patients with more than 3-fold the ULN at 1 year. At 2 years, reductions of more than 40% in ALP were observed in 15.8% of patients with baseline activity greater than 2-fold the ULN and 17.9% of patients with more than 3-fold the ULN. Among the 209 patients with Ishak fibrosis stage 0–4 at baseline, serum ALP activity did not associate with development of cirrhosis or with a 2-point increase in fibrosis stage at 2 years. In contrast, the median per-patient variation in ELF scores between clinic visits was approximately 3% over 12 weeks, 4% over 48 weeks, and 4% over 96 weeks. Elevated ELF scores at baseline and at weeks 12, 24 and 48, each associated with development of cirrhosis at 2 years (odds ratio > 2.75; P < .01 for all timepoints). ELF scores at baseline and weeks 12, 24 and 48, also associated with a 2-point increase in fibrosis stage at 2 years (odds ratios all greater than 2; P < .01 for all timepoints).

Conclusions

In an analysis of data from patients with large-duct PSC enrolled in a prospective trial, we found large interindividual and intraindividual variations in serum ALP activity. Serum ALP activity did not associate with disease progression over a 2-year period. Variations in ELF score were smaller, and scores determined at multiple timepoints associated with fibrosis progression and development of cirrhosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114k6r3r]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 4 — Algorithm for evaluation of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) delineates two branches. Under "Normal total bilirubin and serum transaminases", proceed with "History and physical exam confirm with serum GGT"; if "GGT normal → evaluate for non-hepatobiliary etiologies", but if "GGT abnormal → obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound, evaluate for potential hepatotoxic medications, check AMA, ANA, and SMA". If the evaluation is negative, then "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy" or "If evaluation negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", with persistence prompting "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy". Under "Elevated serum transaminases ± elevated bilirubin", perform "History and physical exam Check right upper quadrant ultrasound"; if "If ductal dilatation → ERCP, MRCP" and if "If no ductal dilatation → check AMA, ANA, SMA". Next, "If AMA positive → evaluate for primary biliary cirrhosis/cholangitis", whereas "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase > 2x ULN → consider liver biopsy or MRCP" or "If AMA negative and alkaline phosphatase 1–2x ULN → consider observation", and persistent elevation leads to "If persistent elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase after 6 months observation → consider liver biopsy or MRCP".

### Nifedipine (adalat CC) [^117Cxe1v]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

Laboratory Tests

Rare, usually transient, but occasionally significant elevations of enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, CPK, LDH, SGOT, and SGPT have been noted. The relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain in most cases, but probable in some. These laboratory abnormalities have rarely been associated with clinical symptoms; however, cholestasis with or without jaundice has been reported. A small increase (< 5%) in mean alkaline phosphatase was noted in patients treated with Adalat CC. This was an isolated finding and it rarely resulted in values which fell outside the normal range. Rare instances of allergic hepatitis have been reported with nifedipine treatment. In controlled studies, Adalat CC did not adversely affect serum uric acid, glucose, cholesterol or potassium.

Nifedipine, like other calcium channel blockers, decreases platelet aggregation in vitro. Limited clinical studies have demonstrated a moderate but statistically significant decrease in platelet aggregation and increase in bleeding time in some nifedipine patients. This is thought to be a function of inhibition of calcium transport across the platelet membrane. No clinical significance for these findings has been demonstrated.

Positive direct Coombs' test with or without hemolytic anemia has been reported but a causal relationship between nifedipine administration and positivity of this laboratory test, including hemolysis, could not be determined.

Although nifedipine has been used safely in patients with renal dysfunction and has been reported to exert a beneficial effect in certain cases, rare reversible elevations in BUN and serum creatinine have been reported in patients with pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency. The relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain in most cases but probable in some.

Drug Interactions

Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and co-administration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions.

CYP3A inhibitors

CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (Azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic is void of clinically relevant CYP3A4 inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when co-administered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications.

### Benign familial hyperphosphatasemia… [^116VC1qq]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Elevated alkaline phosphatase activity in serum suggests bone or liver disease or a neoplasm but can also indicate pregnancy or another benign condition. A family with benign hyperphosphatasemia was studied to elucidate the genetics and enzyme defect. Serum total alkaline phosphatase activity was greater than the population mean in all six family members, and more than 7 SDs above the mean in two of four offspring. Monoclonal antibodies to three alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes, intestinal, placental, and tissue nonspecific, demonstrated markedly increased intestinal alkaline phosphatase levels in all family members and significantly elevated liver/bone/ kidney activity in the two offspring. Guanidine hydrochloride denaturation of the liver/bone/kidney component showed high alkaline phosphatase activity from liver in both siblings and from bone in one.

The mode of inheritance in this family is obscure, but a complex regulation of the products of two different alkaline phosphatase genes seems likely. Steps toward diagnosis are suggested. Early recognition of this benign biochemical abnormality should help to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests. Siraganian PA, Mulvihill JJ, Mulivor RA, Miller RW. Benign Familial Hyperphosphatasemia.

### Clinical significance of serum alkaline phosphatase level in advanced pancreatic cancer… [^112MVKsR]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

Abstract 183 Background: Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that is elevated by various hepatobiliary diseases. Generally its elevation is thought to indicate bile stasis. There are some reports that show ALP is an important prognostic factor for several cancers such as colon, lung, and gastric cancer. Often it is speculated that ALP elevation indicates bile stasis caused by liver metastasis. However, the significance of ALP elevation in advanced pancreatic cancer patients is not well evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine the significance of elevated serum ALP as a prognostic factor in patients with APC even without jaundice and liver metastasis. Methods: Serum ALP levels were measured in 393 patients with APC receiving gemcitabine monotherapy before treatment, and according to those levels, patients were subgrouped, UNL-500 U/L, 501–700 U/L, 701–1000 U/L, 1000U/L < ALP).

The clinical data of each group were analyzed to see characteristics of elevated ALP patients. The relationship between ALP level and survival, response were also examined. Results: The elevated ALP group included poor performance status patients, and associated with low serum albumin. The elevated ALP group 112 days) showed significantly worse prognosis and lower disease control rate compared to the normal ALP group. Multivariate analysis revealed ALP, CRP, ascites, distant metastasis, white blood cell count, PS, AST, and ALT were independent prognostic factors. Similar results were seen in liver metastasis free patients without jaundice. Conclusions: Elevated serum ALP level correlated with poor performance status and low serum albumin.

ALP was also the independent prognostic factor in liver metastasis free APC patients without jaundice. No significant financial relationships to disclose.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113s1NHW]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

PFS by normal or elevated ALP

In each treatment arm, 112 patients had evaluable baseline ALP. Statistically and clinically significant prolongation of PFS with 177 Lu-Dotatate was observed amongst patients with normal and elevated baseline ALP, with nearly identical HRs for progression or death in both prognostic groups (Fig. 2), as reported in the original subgroup analysis of the NETTER-1 study. Median PFS was NR in the 177 Lu-Dotatate arm versus 8.5 months in the high-dose octreotide arm (HR 0.15; P < 0.0001) in the normal ALP group and NR versus 5.8 months (HR 0.18; P < 0.0001) in the elevated baseline ALP group.

Data cutoff: 24 July 2015. One-hundred twelve patients in either treatment arm had evaluable baseline ALP levels and were included in this analysis. HRs with corresponding 95% CIs and P- values were estimated using a Cox regression model with randomised treatment, alkaline phosphatase level, and alkaline phosphatase level × randomised treatment interaction term as covariates. Log-rank test was used for within-treatment arm comparisons of PFS. ALP: alkaline phosphatase, CI: confidence interval, HR: hazard ratio, LAR: long-acting release, NR: not reached, PFS: progression-free survival, ULN: upper limit of normal

No significant difference in PFS was observed amongst patients with normal versus elevated ALP in the 177 Lu-Dotatate (log-rank P = 0.3532) or high-dose octreotide arm (log-rank P = 0.0911).

### The significance of isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in infants and young children [^1134VH4e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this study was to assess the clinical significance and prognosis of a prolonged isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases without cholestasis (> 3 months) in infants and young children, investigated for a variety of conditions, and to determine a protocol for their follow-up and investigation.

Methods

A combined prospective-retrospective analysis of apparently healthy babies and young children with isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases of at least 1.5 times above the norm for age which persisted for at least 3 months and whose creatine phosphokinase (CK), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels remained normal throughout the study duration. The children underwent the following investigations: abdominal ultrasound and infectious, metabolic and/or immunological investigation depending on the duration of the abnormality.

Results

Six children were eliminated following the finding of positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen in the urine. 72 children were investigated (47 males and 25 females). The duration of serum aminotransferases elevation was 3–36 months (average 12.4, median 11.5 months). The initial, maximal and final alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were 85.5, 140.5 and 39.8 IU/l, respectively. Of seven children who had liver biopsies performed, three (42.8%) were suspected of having a glycogen storage disease which was not confirmed enzymatically. Four biopsies revealed non-specific histological changes.

Conclusions

Isolated elevation of serum aminotransferases in healthy looking young children is mostly a benign condition that usually resolves within a year. If no pathology is found during routine investigation, these children can be followed conservatively. Liver biopsy does not contribute much to the diagnosis and is probably unnecessary.

### Towards a standardized classification of the hepatobiliary manifestations in cystic fibrosis (CFHBI): a joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN position paper [^115PhMmP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) in pwCF — associations with disease and predictive performance: In children diagnosed via newborn screening, a persistent elevation of AST or GGT > 1.5 x ULN before the age of 5 was linked to a 6-fold increase in risk of clinically significant liver disease, defined as cirrhosis, portal hypertension (PHT), or stage F3/4 fibrosis. In 244 children with CF, higher mean ALT/AST levels were reported in those with liver ultrasound abnormalities, although levels were mostly within the normal range with significant overlap. Elevated ALT, GGT, or ALP on 2 or more occasions before age 6.5 was linked to higher risk of PHT; elevated ALT had a hazard ratio of 2.7 but only a sensitivity of ~20% and PPV of ~20%. Overall, there is insufficient evidence that changes in ALT and/or AST levels over time can reliably predict development of structural hepatic abnormalities in pwCF.

### Exogenous alkaline phosphatase for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^112pwHye]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Increased activity of intestinal alkaline phosphatase (AP) occurs locally in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), aimed at repairing inflammatory tissue damage. We evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of exogenous AP administered to patients with UC in an open-label, first-in-patient exploratory trial, conducted in the Internal Medicine and Gastroenterology hospital departments in the Czech Republic and Italy.

Methods

Twenty-one patients were enrolled (13 females), age 23–54 years, with steroid- and/or immunosuppressant-refractory, moderate/severe UC (Mayo score 6–11). Oral AP enzyme 30,000 U was administered daily for 7 days, intraduodenally. Efficacy outcomes were changes in Mayo score at Day 21 posttreatment; changes in Modified Truelove-Witts Severity index (MTWSI) at Days 21, 63; C-reactive protein and stool calprotectin levels at Days 7, 21, 63. Safety evaluations were adverse events and laboratory abnormalities reported up to Day 63 posttreatment.

Results

No clinically relevant adverse events causing withdrawal or considered serious, or laboratory abnormalities or antibody formation against AP were observed. Mayo scores were significantly decreased at Day 21, and MTWSI at Days 21 and 63. C-reactive protein and stool calprotectin levels were decreased at Days 21 and 63. Clinical response on the Mayo score after a single 7-day AP course was 48% at Day 21.

Conclusions

In this uncontrolled trial, administration of exogenous AP enzyme daily over a 7-day course to patients with UC was associated with short-term improvement in disease activity scores, with clinical effects being observed within 21 days and associated with reductions in C-reactive protein and stool calprotectin. AP enzyme treatment was well tolerated and nonimmunogenic.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Abnormal Liver Function Tests: Liver function tests (γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT) and bilirubin level should be monitored. Treatment discontinuation should be considered if parameters increase to a level considered clinically significant in patients with stable historical liver function test levels. Caution should be exercised to maintain patients' bile flow. (5.1)
Enteroliths in Patients with Risk for Intestinal Stenosis or Stasis: Monitor for obstructive gastrointestinal symptoms; if symptoms occur, hold ursodiol until a clinical evaluation has been conducted. (5.2)

5.1 Abnormal Liver Function Tests

Liver function tests (γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT) and bilirubin levels should be monitored every month for three months after start of therapy, and every six months thereafter. This monitoring will allow the early detection of a possible deterioration of the hepatic function. Treatment discontinuation should be considered if the above parameters increase to a level considered clinically significant in patients with stable historical liver function test levels.

Caution has to be exercised to maintain the bile flow of the patients taking ursodiol.

5.2 Enteroliths in Patients with Risk for Intestinal Stenosis or Stasis

There have been rare postmarketing reports of ursodiol-treated patients who developed enteroliths (bezoars) resulting in obstructive symptoms that required surgical intervention. These patients had medical conditions that predisposed them to intestinal stenosis or stasis (e.g., surgical enteroanastomoses, Crohn's disease). If a patient presents with obstructive gastrointestinal symptoms, hold ursodiol until a clinical evaluation has been conducted.
