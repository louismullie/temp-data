## Question

Treatment for stroke with history of lupus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage stroke in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the stroke subtype and establishing the acute management pathway. Then, I should verify the APS/SLE status and risk stratify aPL profiles. Next, I will map secondary prevention choices to aPL status, while avoiding harmful strategies. After that, I need to address SLE-specific modifiers and a multidisciplinary plan. Finally, I will consider primary prevention, special populations, and synthesize a practical decision framework with monitoring and caveats, anchoring each step to current guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the stroke subtype and acute priorities because everything downstream depends on distinguishing hemorrhagic from ischemic stroke and acting within the reperfusion window. In acute ischemic stroke, I should follow standard reperfusion protocols, including IV thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy where indicated, and I should not delay for APS/SLE-specific issues unless there is a compelling contraindication. Hold on, I should verify antiphospholipid testing in the acute phase; routine aPL testing is not recommended in acute ischemic stroke without clinical suspicion of APS, so I should not let it delay reperfusion decisions, and I can defer aPL testing to later if indicated by history or recurrent events. I need to ensure we avoid estrogen-containing therapies in patients with SLE due to increased stroke and VTE risk, so I should reconcile medications and contraception promptly.

> Next, I should review the patient's SLE and APS status carefully and risk-stratify the aPL profile because this will determine secondary prevention. I need to check for persistently positive aPL on repeat testing 12 weeks apart and classify high-risk versus low-risk profiles, with high-risk defined by lupus anticoagulant positivity, double/triple aPL positivity, or persistently high titers of anticardiolipin or anti-β2-glycoprotein I antibodies. Wait, let me verify the threshold: titers at or above the 99th percentile or anticardiolipin IgG/IgM greater than 40 GPL/MPL units meet high-risk criteria in guidelines, and this classification meaningfully changes thrombotic risk and treatment choices.

> For patients with definite APS who have had an arterial thrombotic event, I should confirm that warfarin is preferred over DOACs. I need to ensure an INR target of 2.0–3.0 and avoid pushing above 3 because higher targets increase bleeding without improving thrombotic outcomes. Hold on, I should verify the DOAC signal; multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show increased thrombotic events with rivaroxaban and apixaban compared with warfarin in APS, especially with arterial events or triple positivity, so DOACs should be avoided here. The RAPS trial showed noninferiority on a surrogate endpoint for venous thrombosis but excluded arterial events, reinforcing that DOACs are not appropriate for stroke/TIA in APS. The FDA labeling for rivaroxaban also warns against use in triple-positive APS, which aligns with guideline harm statements, so I should document that counseling and choose warfarin.

> But wait, what if the patient has an isolated aPL positivity that does not meet APS criteria. I should double-check that in this scenario, antiplatelet therapy alone is recommended for secondary stroke prevention, and routine anticoagulation is not indicated. The APASS/WARSS analysis did not show a differential benefit of warfarin versus aspirin in aPL-positive patients, supporting the choice of antiplatelet therapy when APS criteria are not fulfilled. So aspirin or another antiplatelet agent is appropriate here, and I should tailor the agent to comorbidities and bleeding risk.

> I will now examine SLE-specific modifiers because they can shift management. If there is active inflammatory NPSLE with vasculitic features, I need to ensure immunosuppression is added to standard stroke care, as ACR recommends a multidisciplinary approach with neurology/rheumatology co-management and escalation to high-dose glucocorticoids with immunosuppressants when active SLE-mediated inflammation is present. Hold on, I should verify disease activity using a validated metric like SLEDAI and consider adjuncts such as hydroxychloroquine for its antithrombotic and vascular risk benefits. If lupus anticoagulant causes INR instability, I need to plan close INR monitoring and consider using calibrated thromboplastins or local laboratory standardization to mitigate variability.

> Next, I should review and aggressively manage traditional cardiovascular risk factors because SLE confers a 2–3 fold increase in stroke and MI risk even after accounting for conventional risk, and early disease course carries the highest hazard. I need to ensure strict blood pressure control, lipid lowering to LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL in very high-risk patients, diabetes optimization, and smoking cessation. Let me consider imaging; if ASCVD risk seems underestimated by generic calculators, carotid ultrasound can reclassify risk and justify intensified lipid therapy in SLE, consistent with EULAR-aligned approaches and observational data showing plaque burden predicts events in SLE cohorts.

> For primary prevention in patients with SLE who have never had a stroke, I should confirm the aPL profile and consider aspirin 75–100 mg daily if the profile is high-risk, and consider it if low-risk after shared decision-making, as AHA/ASA recommends. Wait, I should verify the magnitude of benefit; meta-analytic data suggest roughly a 50% reduction in first thrombosis with aspirin in asymptomatic aPL carriers, with greater protection for arterial events, supporting a cautious prophylactic strategy in appropriately selected patients. I also need to remember that routine aPL testing is not advised in stroke patients who have an alternative explanation, so primary prevention decisions should be grounded in documented persistent aPL positivity rather than a one-time assay.

> I need to ensure I address special populations and high-risk phenotypes. In triple-positive APS, I should avoid DOACs altogether and favor warfarin for both primary and secondary prevention contexts, aligning with FDA warnings and AHA/ASA harm statements. In pregnancy or the immediate postpartum period, I should use low molecular weight heparin with or without low-dose aspirin, tailored to obstetric history and aPL profile, and avoid warfarin in the first trimester. In patients with recurrent strokes despite therapeutic INR, I should consider adding low-dose aspirin cautiously and re-evaluate adherence, drug interactions, and aPL titer trends, recognizing that combination therapy data are limited and may increase bleeding. Hold on, I should verify that we do not escalate to INR above 3 for nonresponse, as high-intensity warfarin does not improve outcomes and increases bleeding.

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I will double-check it against guidelines. If the stroke is ischemic and APS is confirmed with an arterial event, use warfarin with INR 2.0–3.0 and avoid DOACs. If APS is confirmed but this was a venous event, standard-intensity warfarin remains appropriate, with RAPS suggesting DOACs may be reasonable in selected venous-only phenotypes, though many experts still prefer warfarin given mixed signals and labeling concerns. If APS is not confirmed and only isolated aPL are present, use antiplatelet therapy alone. If SLE is active with inflammatory CNS vasculitis, add immunosuppression in coordination with rheumatology. If aPL are negative, follow standard secondary prevention without APS-specific therapy, while still aggressively managing SLE and vascular risk factors.

> I should confirm a monitoring and follow-up plan. Repeat aPL testing in 12 weeks to confirm persistence if APS is suspected, monitor INR closely with attention to lupus anticoagulant interference, and reassess stroke risk factors every 3–6 months. Let me reconsider bleeding risk in SLE; observational data associate antithrombotic use with increased hemorrhagic stroke risk in SLE, so I need to weigh benefits and harms carefully, avoid unnecessary dual therapy, and monitor for neurologic change or bleeding symptoms. If recurrent events occur despite guideline-concordant therapy, I should re-open the differential for non-APS mechanisms such as cardioembolism or large artery atherosclerosis and pursue advanced imaging or echocardiography as indicated.

> In summary, I need to ensure the management is phase-specific and mechanism-aligned: reperfusion first for acute ischemic stroke without delaying for aPL testing, risk-stratify and confirm APS with repeat aPLs, choose warfarin with INR 2.0–3.0 for definite APS with arterial events, prefer antiplatelet therapy when APS criteria are not met, add immunosuppression when NPSLE inflammation is active, and rigorously control vascular risk factors with SLE-specific intensity. Hold on, let me verify I closed the loop on DOACs. The balance of RCTs, meta-analyses, and regulatory guidance indicates harm or inferiority of DOACs in APS-associated arterial thrombosis, so warfarin remains the standard, and I should document this discussion and the rationale for the chosen regimen with the patient and care team.

For stroke in patients with lupus, management should prioritize **standard acute stroke care** (tPA and thrombectomy if eligible) and **warfarin for secondary prevention** if antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is confirmed, targeting INR 2–3; DOACs are not recommended in APS due to increased thrombotic risk [^111QTEhP] [^113aGwKJ] [^114WJNnd]. If APS is not confirmed, use **antiplatelet therapy** (aspirin or clopidogrel) [^116EQEtT]. Immunosuppression (e.g. glucocorticoids, rituximab) is added for active SLE or inflammatory stroke, and hydroxychloroquine is used for all SLE patients to reduce thrombosis and stroke risk [^114b3Y5T] [^116EV65D]. Aggressive control of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes is essential, and multidisciplinary care is recommended [^113YwziS] [^116EV65D].

---

## Acute stroke management

### Initial evaluation and diagnosis

During initial evaluation, obtain **MRI or CT** to confirm stroke subtype and exclude hemorrhage, and perform **aPL testing** if APS is suspected (repeat at 12 weeks to confirm persistence) [^117H65Bt] [^113FrEjF].

---

### Acute interventions

- **Thrombolysis**: IV tPA within 4.5 hours if eligible; lupus alone is not a contraindication.

- **Thrombectomy**: Mechanical thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion within 6–24 hours if eligible.

- **Anticoagulation**: Avoid in acute ischemic stroke unless indicated (e.g. venous thrombosis).

---

## Secondary stroke prevention

### Antithrombotic therapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Confirmed APS | Warfarin (INR 2–3) | - DOACs inferior to warfarin in APS [^111QTEhP] [^113aGwKJ] [^114WJNnd] <br/> - INR 2–3 balances efficacy and bleeding [^114Jp86e] |
| No APS | Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel) | Standard secondary prevention [^116EQEtT] |
| Recurrent stroke despite warfarin | Consider adding aspirin or switching to high-intensity warfarin (INR 2.5–3.5) | Limited evidence; individualized decision [^112tDEok] |

---

### Immunosuppressive therapy

Immunosuppressive therapy should be **initiated** for active SLE or inflammatory stroke — typically glucocorticoids with rituximab or cyclophosphamide for severe disease [^116EV65D]. Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all SLE patients to reduce thrombosis and stroke risk [^notfound].

---

## Management of cardiovascular risk factors

Aggressive risk-factor control is essential; target **blood pressure** to < 130/80 mmHg using ACE inhibitors or ARBs when possible [^notfound], and manage **dyslipidemia** to an LDL < 70 mg/dL (or < 55 mg/dL if very high risk) with high-intensity statins [^notfound]. For diabetes, aim for HbA1c < 7% if feasible [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Multidisciplinary care involves **co-management** by neurology, rheumatology, cardiology, and primary care, along with **patient education** on adherence, recognition of recurrence, and lifestyle modification [^114b3Y5T].

---

## Emerging therapies and research gaps

Among emerging therapies, **direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)** are under study but are currently not recommended in APS due to increased thrombotic events, and **novel immunotherapies** remain investigational with ongoing trials of targeted biologics [^113aGwKJ] [^1137wDvX].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Acute management**: Standard stroke care (tPA, thrombectomy) as indicated.

- **Secondary prevention**: Warfarin (INR 2–3) if APS confirmed; antiplatelet therapy if not.

- **Immunosuppression**: For active SLE or inflammatory stroke; hydroxychloroquine for all SLE patients.

- **Risk-factor control**: Aggressive management of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes.

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Essential for optimal outcomes.

---

Stroke management in lupus requires a coordinated approach integrating **standard acute care**, **APS-specific anticoagulation**, **immunosuppression** for active disease, and **aggressive risk-factor control** to reduce recurrence and improve outcomes.

### Clinical thrombotic manifestations in SLE patients with and without antiphospholipid antibodies: a 5-year follow-up [^112S4aJd]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the association of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) with the development of clinical thrombotic manifestations and to characterize the efficacy of anti-thrombotic therapies used.

Methods

272 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients participated in the study. Patient files and a cumulative database were used to collect patients' medical histories. Anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (abeta2GPI) antibodies, and lupus anticoagulant (LAC) were measured according to international recommendations. New thrombotic events were registered during follow-up.

Results

The patients were prospectively studied for 5 years, of whom 107 were aPL negative (aPL- group). Criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) were fulfilled by 84 of 165 aPL-positive patients (APS+ group) indicating that SLE patients with aPL have around 50% risk to develop thrombotic complications. The aPL+ group (n = 81) consisted of aPL+ but APS- patients. LAC was the most common aPL (n = 27, 32.1%) in patients with APS. The cumulative presence of aPL further increased the prevalence of thrombotic events. During the follow-up period, aPL developed in 8 of 107 patients (7.5%) from the aPL- group, of whom 3 (2.8%) presented with thrombotic complications. Other types of aPL developed in 7 of 165 (4.2%) aPL+ patients within 5 years. New thrombotic events occurred in 3.7% of aPL+ (n = 3) and 8.3% (n = 7) of the APS group. During follow-up, 52 of 81 aPL+ patients received primary prophylaxis, and 1 (1.9%) had transient ischemic attack (TIA). In the non-treatment group, 2 (6.9%) had stroke. Seventy-nine of 84 of the APS patients received secondary prophylaxis, and myocardial infarction occurred in 2 patients (on cumarine therapy maintaining an international normalized ratio around 2.5–3.0), and 5 suffered a stroke/TIA (1 on aspirin and 4 on aspirin + cumarine).

Conclusion

The findings emphasize the importance of determining both aCL and abeta2GPI antibodies and LAC in SLE patients and the need for adequate anticoagulant therapy.

Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) profiles and titers — definitions are as follows: High-risk aPL profile includes the presence on ≥ 2 occasions ≥ 12 weeks apart of lupus anticoagulant, double or triple aPL positivity, or persistently high aPL titers; low-risk aPL profile includes isolated anticardiolipin or anti–β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies at low–medium titers (particularly if transient); medium–high aPL titers include anticardiolipin IgG/IgM > 40 GPL units or > 40 MPL units or above the 99th percentile, and anti–β2-glycoprotein 1 IgG/IgM above the 99th percentile by ELISA.

### Stroke in systemic lupus erythematosus: a meta-analysis of population-based cohort studies [^1117whQ4]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Two studies, which lacked a general population comparator but estimated expected risks using the Framingham risk score, reported that SLE was associated with a sixfold to sevenfold increased risk. Stroke risk estimates and scores reported in the literature differ substantially between each other, and the use of a risk score to estimate the general population's expected risk may not always yield an accurate comparison. Nevertheless, these studies highlighted that traditional risk factors are not as useful for predicting stroke risk in SLE. Patients with SLE have a unique constellation of characteristics which are rarely seen in the general population, such as antiphospholipid syndrome and vasculitis, indicating the need for awareness of SLE-specific risk factors for stroke.

Few studies presented estimates stratified by patient characteristics; these could shed light on which patients are at the highest risk of stroke and would benefit most from targeted prevention strategies. Two studies observed an increased risk of stroke in patients prescribed a steroid. This may indicate that during periods of flare and high disease activity, patients are especially vulnerable. Two studies also reported that individuals within 1 year of diagnosis were at the highest risk, which also may indicate a time period of poorly controlled disease.

We observed a significant amount of heterogeneity in RRs for ischaemic stroke that decreased when the study by Mok et al was excluded. The differing results seen in Mok et al could be due to the inclusion of individuals with SLE who had been diagnosed with ACR criteria in a hospital-based clinic, compared to the other studies which used ICD codes from large administrative databases. Mok et al also differed in that they did not indicate whether SLE was prevalent or incident at the start of follow-up; also individuals with a history of stroke were not excluded and estimates were not adjusted for known confounders. There were several studies which used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, and two studies reported different estimates with CIs that did not overlap. This may be due to differences in matching schemes or definitions of stroke. Depending on which studies from Taiwan were included in the pooled estimates for ischaemic stroke, we found RRs which ranged from 2.1 to 2.5.

Table 4
Cumulative incidence of ischaemic stroke

Figure 2
Analysis of ischaemic stroke risk in patients with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Within the total of the 448 patients with SLE who had an ischaemic stroke, 33 used anticoagulants and 169 used antiplatelets. In addition, 22 patients used both anticoagulants and antiplatelets. Within the total of the 115 patients with SLE who had a haemorrhagic stroke, 7 used anticoagulants and 40 used antiplatelets. In addition, four patients used both anticoagulants and antiplatelets. We used another multivariable model to analyse the effect of antithrombotics on the stroke risk in patients with SLE after adjustments for age, gender, CCI and urbanisation level (table 5). The use of antithrombotics was found to increase the risk of stroke in SLE, with aHRs of 2.02 for antiplatelets (95% CI: 1.66 to 2.45), 2.56 for anticoagulants (95% CI: 1.79 to 3.66) and 2.06 for all antithrombotics (95% CI: 1.70 to 2.49). Additionally, the risk of haemorrhagic stroke increased when patients with SLE received antiplatelets (aHR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.57) and antithrombotics (aHR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.63). There was a non-significant trend of developing haemorrhagic stroke related to the use of anticoagulants (aHR = 2.00, 95% CI: 0.91 to 4.20).

### Antiphospholipid antibodies and subsequent thrombo-occlusive events in patients with ischemic stroke [^115CLyGD]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) has been associated with vascular occlusive events. However, the role of aPL in predicting ischemic events, particularly recurrent ischemic stroke, is controversial.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of baseline aPL positivity (ie, positivity for anticardiolipin antibodies [aCL], lupus anticoagulant antibodies [LA], or both) on subsequent thrombo-occlusive events, including recurrent stroke.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Antiphospholipid Antibodies and Stroke Study (APASS), a prospective cohort study within the Warfarin vs Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study (WARSS), a randomized double-blind trial (N = 2206) conducted at multiple US clinical sites from June 1993 through June 2000 and comparing adjusted-dose warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 1.4–2.8) and aspirin (325 mg/d) for prevention of recurrent stroke or death. APASS participants were 1770 (80%) WARSS participants who consented to enroll in the APASS, with usable baseline blood samples drawn prior to randomization to the WARSS and analyzed for aPL status within 90 days of index stroke by a central independent laboratory. Quality assurance was performed on approximately 10% of samples by a second independent laboratory.

Main Outcome Measure

Two-year rate of the composite end point of death from any cause, ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and other systemic thrombo-occlusive events. The primary analysis assessed the outcome associated with aPL positivity within each WARSS treatment group separately, after risk-factor adjustment (since these aPL-positive vs aPL-negative comparisons were not randomized).

Results

Of the 1770 APASS patients, 720 (41%) were classified as aPL-positive and 1050 (59%) as aPL-negative. There was no increased risk of thrombo-occlusive events associated with baseline aPL status in patients treated with either warfarin (relative risk [RR], 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.75–1.31; p = 0.94), or aspirin (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.70–1.28; p = 0.71). The overall event rate was 22.2% among aPL-positive and 21.8% among aPL-negative patients. There was no treatment x aPL interaction (P = .91). Patients with baseline positivity for both LA and aCL antibodies tended to have a higher event rate (31.7%) than did patients who tested negative for both antibodies (24.0%) (unadjusted RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.97–1.92; p = 0.07). Classification and regression tree analyses did not identify a specific LA test or aCL isotype or titer that was associated with increased risk of thrombo-occlusive event.

Conclusions

The presence of aPL (either LA or aCL) among patients with ischemic stroke does not predict either increased risk for subsequent vascular occlusive events over 2 years or a differential response to aspirin or warfarin therapy. Routine screening for aPL in patients with ischemic stroke does not appear warranted.

### Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) [^115ypaXV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Acute PE in Hemodynamically Unstable Patients or Patients Who Require Thrombolysis or Pulmonary Embolectomy

Initiation of XARELTO is not recommended acutely as an alternative to unfractionated heparin in patients with pulmonary embolism who present with hemodynamic instability or who may receive thrombolysis or pulmonary embolectomy.

5.10 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including XARELTO, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

### Management of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: a systematic review [^113769uo]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Antiphospholipid antibodies are autoantibodies directed against proteins that bind to phospholipid. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) refers to the association between antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis risk or pregnancy morbidity. Patients with APS may be at increased risk of recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis or pregnancy loss.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence for treatment of thrombosis risk in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies or APS.

Evidence Acquisition

Search of MEDLINE (1966 to November 2005) and Cochrane Library electronic databases (2005) and reference lists for randomized trials, meta-analyses of randomized trials, and prospective cohort studies of the treatment of thrombosis risk in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies or APS. Studies were selected on the basis of clinical relevance.

Evidence Synthesis

Among patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, the absolute risk of developing new thrombosis is low (< 1% per year) in otherwise healthy patients without prior thrombotic events, may be moderately increased (up to 10% per year) in women with recurrent fetal loss without prior thrombosis, and is highest (> 10% in the first year) in patients with a history of venous thrombosis who have discontinued anticoagulant drugs within 6 months. Compared with placebo or untreated control, anticoagulation with moderate-intensity warfarin (adjusted to a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.0–3.0) reduces the risk of recurrent venous thrombosis by 80% to 90% irrespective of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and may be effective for preventing recurrent arterial thrombosis. No evidence exists that high-intensity warfarin (target INR, > 3.0) is more effective than moderate-intensity warfarin. For patients with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result and prior stroke, aspirin and moderate-intensity warfarin appear equally effective for preventing recurrent stroke. Treatment issues that have not been addressed in clinical trials, or for which the evidence is conflicting, include the role of antithrombotic prophylaxis in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies without prior thrombosis, the optimal treatment of noncerebrovascular arterial thrombosis, recurrent thrombosis despite warfarin therapy, and treatment of women with antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent fetal loss.

Conclusions

In patients with APS, moderate-intensity warfarin is effective for preventing recurrent venous thrombosis and perhaps also arterial thrombosis. Aspirin appears to be as effective as moderate-intensity warfarin for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with prior stroke and a single positive test result for antiphospholipid antibody. The optimal treatment of other thrombotic aspects of APS needs to be addressed in well-designed prospective studies.

### Modern therapy of patients with lupus erythematosus must include appropriate management of their heightened rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events: a literature update [^1143uz9y]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

It is a sign of therapeutic success that patients with lupus erythematosus (LE) only rarely die early from their disease or its complications anymore. But this success means that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), always an important source of morbidity and mortality in LE, has become even more prominent as patients with LE live longer. Thus, modern comprehensive management of patients with LE must include prevention and treatment of ASCVD to avoid its clinical manifestations — called 'events' — chiefly heart attacks, strokes and new-onset symptomatic peripheral artery disease.

To address the burden of ASCVD in LE, we reviewed published literature several years ago, concluding that most studies in this area show that patients with LE are at a heightened risk of ASCVD events. Accordingly, we also proposed guidelines for assessing patients with systemic LE (SLE) and cutaneous LE (CLE) using four defined categories of ASCVD event risk, with corresponding guidance for clinical management in each ASCVD event risk category with lifestyle modifications and modern medications (table 1). We explicitly modelled our proposed guidelines after risk categories and therapeutic goals that had been established for diabetes mellitus, a well-studied condition that also shows a heightened risk for ASCVD events and has been incorporated into standard clinical guidelines for the management of ASCVD event risk. Recently published longitudinal data from usand others, reviewed in more detail in several of the sections below, provide quantitative support for the use of guidelines that treat lupus as a diabetes equivalent, or even as a diabetes-plus-smoking equivalent, in the context of management of ASCVD event risk.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^1121i6ro]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Contraceptive eligibility — systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Persons with SLE are at increased risk for ischemic heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolism (VTE), and categories assigned to such conditions in U.S. MEC should be the same for persons with SLE who have these conditions; for all subconditions of SLE, classifications are based on the assumption that no other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are present and must be modified in the presence of such risk factors. In SLE with severe thrombocytopenia, severe thrombocytopenia increases the risk for bleeding and the category should be assessed according to the severity of thrombocytopenia and its clinical manifestations; in persons with very severe thrombocytopenia who are at risk for spontaneous bleeding, consultation with a specialist and certain treatments might be warranted.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in people with antiphospholipid syndrome [^112tDEok]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis (or both), and/or pregnancy morbidity in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The prevalence of APS is estimated at 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. The most common sites of thrombosis are cerebral arteries and deep veins of the lower limbs. People with a definite APS diagnosis have an increased lifetime risk of recurrent thrombotic events.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiplatelet (AP) or anticoagulant agents, or both, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis, particularly ischemic stroke, in people with APS.

Search Methods

We last searched the MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, and ongoing trials registers on 22 November 2019. We checked reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines. We also contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or AP agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS, according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently worked on each step of the review, following Cochrane methods. We summarized the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We identified eight studies including 811 participants that compared different AP or anticoagulant agents. NOAC (non-VKA oral anticoagulant: rivaroxaban 15 or 20 mg/d) versus standard-dose VKA (vitamin K antagonist: warfarin at moderate International Normalized Ratio [INR] - 2.5) or adjusted [INR 2.0–3.0] dose): In three studies there were no differences in any thromboembolic event (including death) and major bleeding (moderate-certainty evidence), but an increased risk of stroke (risk ratio [RR] 14.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.87 to 106.8; moderate-certainty evidence). One of the studies reported a small benefit of rivaroxaban in terms of quality of life at 180 days measured as health state on Visual Analogue Scale (mean difference [MD] 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low-certainty evidence), but not measured as health utility on a scale from 0 to 1 (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10; low-certainty evidence). High-dose VKA (warfarin with a target INR of 3.1 to 4.0 [mean 3.3] or 3.5 [mean 3.2]) versus standard-dose VKA (warfarin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 [mean 2.3] or 2.5 [mean 2.5]): In two studies there were no differences in the rates of thrombotic events and major bleeding (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23, low-certainty evidence), but an increased risk of minor bleeding in one study during a mean of 3.4 years (standard deviation [SD] 1.2) of follow-up (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07). In both trials there was evidence of a higher risk of any bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low-certainty evidence) in the high-dose VKA group, and for this outcome (any bleeding) the incidence is not different, only the time to event is showing an effect. Standard-dose VKA plus a single AP agent (warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 plus aspirin 100 mg/d) versus standard-dose VKA (warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0): One high-risk-of-bias study showed an increased risk of any thromboembolic event with combined treatment (RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.43; low-certainty evidence) and reported on major bleeding with five cases in the combined treatment group and one case in the standard-dose VKA treatment group, resulting in RR 7.42 (95% CI 0.91 to 60.7; low-certainty evidence) and no differences for secondary outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Single/dual AP agent and standard-dose VKA (pooled results): Two high-risk-of-bias studies compared a combination of AP and VKA (aspirin 100 mg/d plus warfarin or unspecified VKA at a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 or 2.0 to 2.5) with a single AP agent (aspirin 100 mg/d), but did not provide any conclusive evidence regarding the effects of those drugs in people with APS (very low-certainty evidence). One of the above-mentioned studies was a three-armed study that compared a combination of AP and VKA (aspirin 100 mg/d plus warfarin at a target INR of 2.0 to 2.5) with dual AP therapy (aspirin 100 mg/d plus cilostazol 200 mg/d) and dual AP therapy (aspirin 100 mg/d plus cilostazol 200 mg/d) versus a single AP treatment (aspirin 100 mg/d). This study reported on stroke (very low-certainty evidence) but did not report on any thromboembolic events, major bleeding, or any secondary outcomes. We identified two ongoing studies and three studies are awaiting classification.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence identified indicates that NOACs compared with standard-dose VKAs may increase the risk of stroke and do not appear to alter the risk of other outcomes (moderate-certainty evidence). Using high-dose VKA versus standard-dose VKA did not alter the risk of any thromboembolic event or major bleeding but may increase the risk of any form of bleeding (low-certainty evidence). Standard-dose VKA combined with an AP agent compared with standard-dose VKA alone may increase the risk of any thromboembolic event and does not appear to alter the risk of major bleeding or other outcomes (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the benefit or harm of using standard-dose VKA plus AP agents versus single or dual AP therapy, or dual versus single AP therapy, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis in people with APS (very low-certainty evidence).

Thrombophilic states and stroke — knowledge gaps and research priorities: "Although thrombophilic states have been associated with a higher risk of stroke in epidemiological studies, it is uncertain whether specific treatment should be offered to people with stroke and some of these traits". Key uncertainties include whether "in the absence of venous thrombosis, there is an indication for anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention in people with thrombophilic states", and whether "the presence of a PFO may modify the risk of stroke recurrence and possible preventive strategies in people with thrombophilic states suspected to have paradoxical emboli". Given "the relatively low prevalence of thrombophilic traits in populations with stroke, larger, adequately powered multicenter studies are needed", and "if a heightened risk of stroke is confirmed, clinical trials may be needed to evaluate whether anticoagulation may be useful". For antiphospholipid syndrome specifically, "There is less certainty on secondary stroke preventive measures", and "There is an urgent need to clarify whether DOACs may be used instead of warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke in this population".

Systemic lupus erythematosus general treatment strategies — good practice statements emphasize that people with active SLE symptoms should be diagnosed and treated promptly, with severity of lupus activity guiding intensity and choice of therapy, and that when multiple organ systems are involved at onset or during a flare of SLE, therapy should be directed toward all manifestations but should prioritize areas at greatest risk for irreversible damage. They further note that organ- or life-threatening SLE should be treated urgently/emergently with aggressive therapy (e.g., pulse/high-dose glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive therapy), including consideration of combination therapies, as time may not permit sequential therapy; the clinical situation and patient's preference should guide the specific combination therapy, that when interventions, procedures, and surgeries beyond the scope of rheumatology practice are considered, the decision to proceed requires multidisciplinary discussion between the rheumatologist and the relevant specialists/proceduralists/surgeons, and that when clinical or serologic findings suggest an additional diagnosis or overlap with SLE, therapy should be adjusted if necessary in consultation with the relevant specialist(s).

### Lack of efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^11791CuZ]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

It has been suggested that the use of DOAC may be considered in some selected cases of APS, such as individuals with a history of a single venous thrombosis or with a low-risk APL antibody profile, but, until now, no studies are available to support this hypothesis.

We found that DOAC therapy is associated with an increased risk of arterial events, particularly stroke, also in "high-risk" APS patients treated for prior venous thrombotic events or miscarriages. Arterial events were also reported in patients with "low-risk" APL antibody profile, but only few patients with these characteristics were included in the studies selected for our meta-analysis, and, thus, no conclusions can be drawn.

Given the high risk of arterial events in APS patients, alternative approaches may be considered in future studies. One of these includes the association of DOAC and low dose aspirin (LDA), for which there are currently insufficient data to provide any recommendation. LDA, in combination with prophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), is the standard of treatment during pregnancy for obstetric APSand the use of LDA has been associated with the same risk of first event compared with LDA plus warfarin in primary prevention of patients positive for antiphospholipid antibodies. Few data exist on the association of LDA and warfarin for the secondary prevention of thrombotic events in APS. In a small cohort of patients, this drug combination was associated with increased risk of bleeding and no effect on thrombosis recurrence. Yet, this strategy is recommended by the European Alliance Of Association For Rheumatology guidelines as an option following a first arterial thrombosis or recurrent arterial or venous thrombosis in APS patients.

In conclusion, the use of DOAC as a single therapeutic approach appears to be insufficiently effective in high risk patients with APS, even without a history of arterial thrombosis. Since in patients treated with VKA the risk of thrombosis remains non-negligible, further studies are needed to assess alternative approaches in this setting.

### Neuropsychiatric lupus: new mechanistic insights and future treatment directions [^113WFeKo]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) frequently show symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, termed neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE). The CNS manifestations of SLE are diverse and have a broad spectrum of severity and prognostic implications. Patients with NPSLE typically present with nonspecific symptoms, such as headache and cognitive impairment, but might also experience devastating features, such as memory loss, seizures and stroke. Some features of NPSLE, in particular those related to coagulopathy, have been characterized and an evidence-based treatment algorithm is available. The cognitive and affective manifestations of NPSLE, however, remain poorly understood. Various immune effectors have been evaluated as contributors to its pathogenesis, including brain-reactive autoantibodies, cytokines and cell-mediated inflammation. Additional brain-intrinsic elements (such as resident microglia, the blood-brain barrier and other neurovascular interfaces) are important facilitators of NPSLE. As yet, however, no unifying model has been found to underlie the pathogenesis of NPSLE, suggesting that this disease has multiple contributors and perhaps several distinct aetiologies. This heterogeneity presents a challenge for clinicians who have traditionally relied on empirical judgement in choosing treatment modalities for patients with NPSLE. Improved understanding of this manifestation of SLE might yield further options for managing this disease.

### Ten-year follow-up investigation of stroke risk in systemic lupus erythematosus [^117EkiZ1]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Studies have shown that diverse mechanisms, including vasculitis, premature atherosclerosis, antibody alteration, endothelial dysfunction and steroid usage, are involved in stroke pathogenesis in patients with SLE. Old age is also associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis, while atherothrombotic stroke is the most common type of ischaemic stroke. Previous studies had demonstrated that the risk of thrombosis lasts throughout the course of SLE; although vasculitis-related events are predominant and occur most frequently in the first 5 years, increased risks of atherosclerosis and vessel calcification change are lifelong effects. Low-dose aspirin may be helpful as a preventive treatment in patients with SLE.

This study showed that patients with SLE had a significantly increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (HR = 2.24), echoing the result of Wang et al (HR = 3.23).SLE is independently associated with haemorrhagic stroke, but the pathophysiological relationship between SLE and haemorrhagic stroke remains ambiguous. Although the use of antithrombotics is a risk factor for haemorrhagic stroke, few studies have studied the association between haemorrhagic stroke and antithrombotic use in SLE. According to our findings, patients with SLE on antithrombotics had an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke; aHRs of antiplatelets and antithrombotics were 1.74 and 1.79, respectively. The association between anticoagulants and haemorrhagic stroke was non-significant in patients with SLE.

### Digital ulcers as presenting symptom of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome [^115xzAtS]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Due to the limited amount of evidence, guidelines for the management of patients with APS have not been standardized. For primary thrombotic prevention, the use of low-dose aspirin (LDA) is controversial, with evidence showing mixed results. In 2019, the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) developed a set of recommendations for the management of APS in adults. These recommendations stratify patients into one of 3 tiers based on aPL titers (low, medium-high, and high risk). For any asymptomatic patient with SLE and aPL positivity and a high-risk designation, LDA is recommended. For patients categorized as low risk, LDA should be considered. This recommendation varies slightly from the proposal of the 16 th International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies Task Force, which suggested that LDA should be considered on a case-by-case basis. In the acute setting, low-molecular-weight heparins, followed by long-term warfarin treatment, is considered standard of care. Warfarin is also recommended for secondary thromboprophylaxis with a goal international normalized ratio of 2–3. Management of arterial thrombotic events is less established: recommendations include the use of warfarin alone or with LDA. The use of direct oral anticoagulants is contraindicated in patients with arterial thrombotic events, small-vessel thrombosis, aPL-related valvular disease, or triple aPL positivity. Direct oral anticoagulants are not only less effective than warfarin but associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events in patients with a history of arterial thrombosis or triple positive aPL. In a randomized trial, 6 of 23 patients with APS on apixaban experienced a stroke compared to 0 of 25 patients on warfarin. Rituximab, hydroxychloroquine, eculizumab, and statins have been evaluated as alternate or adjunctive therapies and can be considered in cases of catastrophic APS.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease that involves inflammation, multiple organ damage and manifold clinical manifestations. Patients with SLE face a range of threats, including disease activity, infection, drug side effects and thrombotic events. Previous studies have discovered that thrombotic events are an important risk factor for mortality throughout the course of SLE.

In patients with SLE, the incidence of strokes is higher. Furthermore, neuropsychiatric complications account for 10%–15% of deaths following stroke. Patients with SLE who have stroke have extensive morbidity, higher rates of premature mortality and higher hospitalisation costs. Consequently, stroke is a key thrombotic event in SLE.

Patients experiencing recent-onset autoimmune diseases are at an increased risk of thrombotic events. Among patients with SLE, most thrombotic events occur during the first 5 years of disease course. The risk of ischaemic stroke is greatest during the first year of SLE, with adjusted HR (aHR) of 6.47; however, the risk remains significant throughout the first 5 years. Research on the need for adequate prophylaxis is ongoing, but few large population-based cohort studies have examined the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with SLE for over 10 years.

Along with the traditional risk factors for stroke, a number of different mechanisms relating to ischaemic stroke pathogenesis are common in SLE, including vasculitis, antibody alterations, endothelial dysfunction, cumulative steroid usage and premature atherosclerosis. However, there is inadequate knowledge of the correlation between SLE and haemorrhagic stroke. The primary prophylaxis for thrombotic events in patients with SLE is the administration of antiplatelets or anticoagulants. However, such treatment is associated with an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. No studies have evaluated the associations of ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke with simultaneous use of antiplatelets or anticoagulants by patients with SLE. Most previous studies have investigated the pathogenesis of stroke in SLE.

Because the risk of thrombosis is high throughout the course of SLE, studies investigating the long-term risk of ischaemic stroke are required. Antithrombotic is used to prevent thrombosis in patients with SLE; thus, association between haemorrhagic stroke and antithrombotics should also be evaluated. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using population databases, which had a follow-up period of over 10 years, to explore the long-term risk of ischaemic stroke and the clinical effects of antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) on the development of haemorrhagic stroke in patients with SLE.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — For intrauterine devices (IUDs), the table clarifies that persons with SLE are at increased risk for ischemic heart disease, stroke, and venous thromboembolism (VTE); categories for these conditions in U.S. MEC should be the same for persons with SLE who have them, and for all SLE subconditions classifications must be modified if other cardiovascular risk factors are present. In SLE with severe thrombocytopenia, severe thrombocytopenia increases bleeding risk and in persons with very severe thrombocytopenia who are at risk for spontaneous bleeding, consultation with a specialist and certain pretreatments might be warranted. Evidence statements note no direct evidence on POC use among persons with SLE with antiphospholipid antibodies and that the LNG-IUD might be a useful treatment for menorrhagia in women with severe thrombocytopenia.

Protocol modifications

Following enrollment of the initial 25 patients, a routine DSMB review occurred. The DSMB observed that 3 strokes, all among patients in the apixaban arm, had occurred and recommended that all future patients randomized to receive apixaban, and all patients already enrolled, receive a higher dose of 5 mg twice daily, and this was adopted. In the subsequent 3 months, 5 additional patients were enrolled, and despite the higher apixaban dose, 3 additional strokes occurred in patients randomized to apixaban. At that time, an ad-hoc DSMB assessment was requested by the principal investigator. After reviewing the data, the DSMB recommended: (1) to continue enrollment, (2) that any patient previously enrolled with a history of arterial thrombosis and randomized to apixaban to be returned to warfarin, (3) that only patients without a history of arterial thrombosis to be considered eligible subsequently, and (4) that brain magnetic resonance imaging using a stroke detection protocol be obtained for all subsequent eligible candidates, and that only patients without radiographic evidence of prior stroke or white matter changes disproportionate for patient age can be enrolled. These recommendations were communicated to the IRB, and all recommendations were adopted, protocol modifications were published, and enrollment ensued until April 2019.

Current treatments of NPSLE

In the absence of high-level evidence for the treatment of NPSLE, it is necessary to develop pragmatic therapeutic strategies supported by expert opinion, published observational cohort data on NPSLE and extrapolation from experience with other organ system disease in SLE. This is in line with the EULAR recommendations for the management of NPSLE published > 10 years ago and with the recent 2019 update of EULAR recommendations for the management of SLE. Identification of the most likely cause and contributing factors to the NP event is determined by careful clinical assessment and the use of appropriate diagnostic tests that will vary depending on the clinical presentation. These may include a search for autoantibodies, examination of CSF primarily to exclude infection, neuroimaging, formal cognitive assessment and electrophysiological testing. Upon completion of this exercise, the patient's NP event should be attributed exclusively to SLE, exclusively to non-SLE factors or to a combination of both. Regardless of attribution, it is important to distinguish between ongoing activity and organ damage, as only the former is reversible, although the consequences of some forms of damage may be modifiable (e.g. stroke rehabilitation). These determinations provide a framework for the selection of treatment modalities and outcomes for measuring efficacy in individual patients.

Stroke or TIA — epidemiology and rationale: approximately 0.9% to 2.7% of patients with COVID-19 may experience stroke, frequently with large vessel occlusion. Observational data suggested that markers of coagulation and hemostatic activation (eg, D-dimer elevation) are associated significantly with thromboembolic events among patients with COVID-19, and an increased positivity of lupus anticoagulant was also observed in patients with COVID-19. In the general population of patients with ischemic stroke or TIA, antiplatelet alone (class 1) is recommended for those with an isolated antiphospholipid antibody who do not fulfill antiphospholipid syndrome criteria, and warfarin (class 2) for those who meet the criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome.

CONCLUSION

The risk of stroke and MI events among adult patients with SLE is twofold to threefold higher compared with the general population or healthy controls. Known MI and stroke risk factors and SLE-related factors are likely to be associated with the observed elevated risk. Understanding the various mechanisms underlying increased CVD risk in patients with SLE, including how antiphospholipid antibodies or antiphospholipid syndrome may modify this risk, will support prevention and treatment strategies and advance informed patient and physician decisions.

Discussion

SLE has been associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. However, the risk of cardiovascular events among a high-risk population such as the Appalachian population is not well understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study on cardiovascular morbidity risk factors among Appalachian patients with lupus. In a prospective lupus cohort, several risk factors were found to be predictive of a first cardiovascular event including arthritis, pleuritis and venous thrombosis. We found similar correlation in venous thrombosis and association with cardiovascular morbidity. As we analysed our cases with venous thrombosis, they were mainly patients who developed strokes and peripheral ischaemia rather than myocardial infarction. Generally, we show in our study trends towards higher traditional cardiovascular risk factors in the cases group, particularly using tobacco showing statistical significance (only on univariate analysis). Similarly, results from the University of Toronto lupus cohort identified tobacco as a risk factor for cardiovascular end points (myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and peripheral ischaemia). Appalachian communities are at higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity. For instance, a 2020 study noted an average BMI of 33 kg/m 2 in the Kentucky Appalachian community with a concerning 94.3% tobacco use among men.

Beyond showing the contribution of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, we were able to identify venous thrombosis as significantly higher in cases with adverse cardiovascular events compared with controls. In view of this result, we believe it is important that clinicians be vigilant in regarding a new diagnosis of lupus as a risk factor for stroke and regard lupus as a potential risk factor for early stroke, particularly in patients with history of venous thrombosis. Nonetheless, we show some cases who developed myocardial infarction or stroke prior to lupus diagnosis in our study. Initially, those events were attributed to traditional risk factors. Prior study from the University of Toronto showed myocardial infarction prior to or early on after diagnoses of lupus.

Our cases had mean SLEDAI-2K score of 11.15 prior to the event. A prospective study evaluating stroke in lupus found an SLEDAI-2K of 12.6 on average in comparison with 8.4 in control group. Hinting that even in the Appalachian community, which has high level of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, lupus activity remains a contributing factor for stroke. Prior studies supported our findings, namely the Framingham score, fell short of predicting cardiovascular morbidity in patients with lupus indicating lupus-related risk.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^112AiyvX]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

A limitation of RAPS is that it was not designed to confirm clinical efficacy and long-term safety. Rather, the trial was designed with a laboratory surrogate outcome measure to assess the mechanism of action of the interventions in these patients. A trial with a primary endpoint of recurrent thrombosis would require a sample of several thousand patients, which is unfeasible for patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, and a much longer follow-up period. There was an intended selection bias because we excluded patients who had had venous thromboembolism and developed recurrent events while taking standard-intensity anticoagulation (ie, needing higher-intensity anticoagulation) and those with arterial events. Thus, our cohort seemed to have antiphospholipid antibodies that caused clinical disease at the less aggressive end of the range seen in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome. Nevertheless, limiting the selection of patients to those with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism leading to treatment with standard intensity warfarin ensured a clinically homogeneous study population which is in contrast to two previous, slightly smaller, randomised controlled trials. This feature is an important strength of RAPS. Thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome is clinically heterogeneous, with the risk of recurrent thrombosis and intensity of anticoagulation being dependent on the clinical phenotype. Thus, trials, such as RAPS, that involve clinically homogeneous thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome populations, maximise clinical applicability for subgroups of patients. We caution, therefore, that our results are not applicable to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and venous thromboembolism who need greater than standard-intensity anticoagulation or with stroke or other arterial thrombosis.

### Management of the neurological manifestations of APS – what do the trials tell us? [^115qS25k]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To systematically review evidence from clinical trials about the management of neurological manifestations of Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS).

Methods

Articles reporting case-control, cohort and prospective studies and treatment trials of primary or secondary stroke prevention in patients with aPL were identified in an OVID literature search from 1966 to 2004, using the keywords: APS, aPL and cerebrovascular disease. Articles were evaluated according to the standard system for assessing medical evidence to answer the following questions: (1) What is the role of aPL and recurrent stroke risk in both primary and secondary APS populations? (2) What is the evidence to support specific treatment strategies for secondary prevention of aPL-associated stroke? (3) What is the evidence to support specific treatment strategies for primary prevention of aPL-associated stroke?

Conclusions

(1) aPL are a risk factor for incident stroke (Grade A, established as useful for the given condition in the specified population). (2) The evidence to support the role of aPL in recurrent stroke is conflicting and, therefore, inconclusive. (3) Warfarin at moderate-intensity doses is equally effective in preventing a recurrent thrombotic event as warfarin at high-intensity doses in patients with APS (Grade A evidence, established as useful for the given condition in the specified population). (4) Warfarin, at moderate-intensity doses is as effective as aspirin (at a dose of 325 mg/day) in preventing recurrent thrombotic events in patients who are aPL-positive at the time of an initial stroke (Grade B evidence, probably useful for the given condition in the given population). (5) Currently there are no data to support the use of any prophylactic therapy in patients with aPL and no clinical manifestations for the purposes of preventing an incident stroke.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113djaSV]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome — Evidence and testing considerations for secondary stroke prevention: In a WARSS (Warfarin-Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study) subgroup, investigators found no differential stroke risk reduction in people with a 1-time positive antiphospholipid antibody with warfarin (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.75–1.31]) or aspirin (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.70–1.28]; treatment-by-antiphospholipid interaction, P = 0.91), and therefore aspirin is more preferable than warfarin because of the lower risk of bleeding with aspirin. Approximately 13% of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have stroke as the initial clinical manifestation of the disease. In patients with cryptogenic stroke and a history of thrombosis or rheumatological disease, it would seem reasonable to consider testing for antiphospholipid antibodies, whereas in older populations with increasing frequency of vascular risk factors, there is no evidence supporting the systematic testing for antiphospholipid antibodies. Although no trials of antithrombotic intervention have been performed exclusively in stroke patients, the available evidence favors anticoagulation with VKA compared with aspirin to reduce recurrent arterial thromboses; an INR with a target range of 2 to 3 is preferable over an INR with a target range > 3, and when anticoagulation has been tested against aspirin, an INR of 2 to 3 is a typical range to be used as a comparison arm. Limited evidence also notes that in a small (N = 20) RCT comparing a single-antiplatelet arm versus a triple-therapy arm (dual antiplatelets plus anticoagulation), participants with single antiplatelets had a higher risk of recurrent stroke (log-rank test, P = 0.026) with similar rates of hemorrhage during a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, and the clinical consensus favors using only anticoagulation.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for secondary prevention of stroke and other thromboembolic events in people with antiphospholipid syndrome [^1151Dy8F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by arterial or venous thrombosis (or both) and/or pregnancy morbidity in association with the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. The prevalence is estimated at 40 to 50 cases per 100,000 people. The most common sites of thrombosis are cerebral arteries and deep veins of the lower limbs. People with a definite APS diagnosis have an increased lifetime risk of recurrent thrombotic events.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, or both, for the secondary prevention of recurrent thrombosis, particularly ischemic stroke, in people with antiphospholipid syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (February 2017), CENTRAL (last search February 2017), MEDLINE (from 1948 to February 2017), Embase (from 1980 to February 2017), and several ongoing trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and we contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agent, or both, in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people diagnosed with APS according to the criteria valid when the study took place. We did not include studies specifically addressing women with obstetrical APS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion or by consulting a third review author and, in addition, one review author checked all the extracted data.

Main Results

We included five studies involving 419 randomized participants with APS. Only one study was at low risk of bias in all domains. One study was at low risk of bias in all domains for objective outcomes but not for quality of life (measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). We judged the other three studies to be at unclear or high risk of bias in three or more domains. The duration of intervention ranged from 180 days to a mean of 3.9 years. One study compared rivaroxaban (a novel oral anticoagulant: NOAC) with standard warfarin treatment and reported no thrombotic or major bleeding events, but it was not powered to detect such differences (low-quality evidence). Investigators reported similar rates of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 8.33; moderate-quality evidence) and minor bleeding (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.83) for participants receiving rivaroxaban and the standard vitamin K antagonists (VKA). This study also reported some small benefit with rivaroxaban over the standard VKA treatment in terms of quality of life health state measured at 180 days with the EQ-5D-5L 100 mm visual analogue scale (mean difference (MD) 7 mm, 95% CI 2.01 to 11.99; low-quality evidence) but not measured as health utility (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.10 [on a scale from 0 to 1]). Two studies compared high dose VKA (warfarin) with moderate/standard intensity VKA and found no differences in the rates of any thrombotic events (RR 2.22, 95% CI 0.79 to 6.23) or major bleeding (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.25) between the groups (low-quality evidence). Minor bleeding analyzed using the RR and any bleeding using the hazard ratio (HR) were more frequent in participants receiving high-intensity warfarin treatment compared to the standard-intensity therapy (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.07; and HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.68; low-quality evidence). In one study, it was not possible to estimate the RR for stroke with a combination of VKA plus antiplatelet agent compared to a single antiplatelet agent, while for major bleeding, a single event occurred in the single antiplatelet agent group. In one study, comparing combined VKA plus antiplatelet agent with dual antiplatelet therapy, the RR of the risk of stroke over three years of observation was 5.00 (95% CI 0.26 to 98.0). In a single small study, the RR for stroke during one year of observation with a dual antiplatelet therapy compared to single antiplatelet drug was 0.14 (95% CI 0.01 to 2.60).

Authors' Conclusions

There is not enough evidence for or against NOACs or for high-intensity VKA compared to the standard VKA therapy in the secondary prevention of thrombosis in people with APS. There is some evidence of harm for high-intensity VKA regarding minor and any bleeding. The evidence was also not sufficient to show benefit or harm for VKA plus antiplatelet agent or dual antiplatelet therapy compared to a single antiplatelet drug. Future studies should be adequately powered, with proper adherence to treatment, in order to evaluate the effects of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or both, for secondary thrombosis prevention in APS. We have identified five ongoing trials mainly using NOACs in APS, so increasing experimental efforts are likely to yield additional evidence of clinical relevance in the near future.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115LpSQH]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with autoimmune diseases, AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate prophylactic treatment with aspirin (75–100 mg daily) in patients with SLE and no history of thrombosis or pregnancy complications, who have a high-risk antiphospholipid profile, to reduce the risk of stroke.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^112wibGJ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

The absence of new thrombotic events during 6 months of treatment in RAPS justifies our selection of this subgroup of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and puts into context anecdotal case reports and findings in small case series of recurrent thrombosis after switching patients from warfarin to a direct oral anticoagulant. Of note, 28% of patients in RAPS had triple positivity for lupus anticoagulant and antibodies against cardiolipin and β 2 GPI at baseline and, therefore, had a particularly high-risk antibody profile.

Our findings suggest that in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who have had previous venous thromboembolism and need standard-intensity anticoagulation (ie, target INR 2·5) the overall thrombotic risk, based on the overall thrombogram, in-vivo coagulation activation markers and clinical outcomes, is not increased with rivaroxaban compared with that related to warfarin. The absence of new thrombosis or major bleeding and low rate of clinically relevant bleeding supports this conclusion. Further studies are required to define the role of direct oral anticoagulants in antiphospholipid syndrome patients, including those with venous thromboembolism who need higher-intensity anticoagulation (ie, those without recurrent venous thromboembolism while taking standard-intensity anticoagulation) or antiphospholipid syndrome patients with stroke or other arterial thrombosis. Overall, rivaroxaban seems efficacious and safe, and might offer a convenient alternative to warfarin in this subgroup of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.

### Under crossfire: thromboembolic risk in systemic lupus erythematosus [^117RkbaE]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cerebral and cardiovascular ischaemic events are frequent complications of SLE and constitute primary causes of permanent damage. However, the pathogenic determinants of an increased thromboembolic risk in patients with SLE are only partially understood. Atherosclerosis constitutes fertile soil for the development of thrombosis and shows disproportionately high prevalence and progression rates in patients with SLE. aPLs are independent risk factors for acute thrombosis but can also prompt long-term vascular inflammation. Aberrant interactions among immune cells and dysfunctions in the deployment of the coagulation cascade have historically been less explored in SLE, but recent evidence suggests they can also play a critical role at the crossroads between inflammation and haemostasis. In this review we discuss how different prothrombotic mechanisms can be prompted by and synergize with SLE-specific pathogenic events and speculate about novel potential directions for research and drug development.

Primary prevention of stroke — antiphospholipid syndrome/systemic lupus erythematosus: Antiplatelet therapy is recommended for patients with antiphospholipid syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus without a history of stroke or unprovoked venous thromboembolism to prevent stroke, and patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who have had a prior unprovoked venous thrombosis likely benefit from vitamin K antagonist therapy (target international normalized ratio, 2–3) over direct oral anticoagulants.

Qualitative evidence synthesis

Description of included studies

Study and patient characteristics of the five eligible randomised trialsare listed in table 1. The included studies comprised 305 patients with APS treated with rivaroxaban 20 mg/day or dabigatran etexilate 150 mg two times per day and 320 comparators treated with VKA (warfarin, target INR 2.0–3.0). The patients included in Goldhaber et al and the RAPS trialhad a history of VT only, whereas patients in the other studies had histories of both venous and arterial events. The pooled mean age for the DOAC group was 47.2 years (SD 13.8) and 47.7 years (SD 15.5) for the VKA group. The pooled body mass index (BMI) for the DOAC group was 28 kg/m 2 (SD 6) and 28.8 kg/m 2 (SD 6) for the VKA group. Overall, the groups were comparable in terms of age, BMI and sex. However, the percentage of patients with APS with SLE varies noticeably, from 9% in the Woller et al DOAC group to 33% in the Ordi-Ros et al DOAC group; only the RAPS was stratified for SLE. Woller et al, Ordi-Ros et al and TRAPShave collected data on cardiovascular risk factors; 36% of the DOAC group and 40% in the VKA group were smokers; 32% of the DOAC group and 29% of the VKA group had known hyperlipidaemia; 32% of the DOAC group and 35% of the VKA group had hypertension. Less than 10% in each group had diabetes.

Description of ongoing studies

Still underway, the RISAPS trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03684564) will compare higher-intensity rivaroxaban 15 mg two times per day versus higher-intensity warfarin (INR 3.0–4.0) for 24 months, in patients with APS, with or without SLE, after experiencing a stroke, a transient ischaemic attack or other ischaemic brain damage caused by blood clots in the brain arteries or smaller blood vessels. Planned completion is end of 2024, and the trial manager has been contacted for an update in June 2022.

### Ten-year follow-up investigation of stroke risk in systemic lupus erythematosus [^112M2C8M]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and purpose

To analyse the long-term risk of ischaemic stroke and the clinical effects of antithrombotics on the risk of haemorrhagic stroke in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a population-based database taken from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with SLE between 2000 and 2008 were registered and matched with two controls by the index date, age, gender and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). These subjects were followed until either stroke event or 31 December 2013. Adjusted HRs (aHRs) for strokes were estimated with Cox regression models, and the cumulative incidence of ischaemic stroke was analysed by log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results

In total, 8310 patients with SLE and 16 620 patients without SLE were included. In general, patients with SLE had higher rates of ischaemic stroke (5.4% vs 3.3%) and haemorrhagic stroke (1.5% vs 0.6%) than in controls. In multivariate analysis adjusted to age, gender, CCI, urbanisation level and antithrombotics uses, aHRs of all strokes, ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke were 1.73 (95% CI: 1.54 to 1.94), 1.65 (95% CI: 1.45 to 1.87) and 2.24 (95% CI: 1.71 to 2.95), respectively, in patients with SLE. Patients with SLE were significantly more likely to suffer ischaemic stroke than patients without SLE, even 10 years after SLE diagnosis (6.12% vs 3.50%, p < 0.001). Antiplatelet use increased the risk of haemorrhagic stroke in SLE group (aHR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.57).

Conclusions

Patients with SLE are at greater risk of developing ischaemic stroke that lasts for 10 years. Antiplatelets should be carefully administered to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with SLE due to the risk of haemorrhagic stroke.

Recommendation development and voting — consensus thresholds and statement types: Per ACR policy, consensus required ≥ 70% agreement on both direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. A recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel was very confident that the benefits of the intervention clearly outweighed its harms, or vice versa, a conditional recommendation expresses uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harm due to low-quality evidence, or that the decision is particularly sensitive to individual patient preferences or cost constraints, and good practice statements (GPS) were also generated; these are actionable statements where the desirable effects clearly outweigh the undesirable effects of an intervention.

Inflammation and stroke risk — synopsis: Autoimmune conditions and inflammatory conditions, cancers, and infections are established contributors to primary stroke risk, and these conditions are thought to predispose to stroke through mechanisms including hypercoagulability, accelerated atherosclerosis, abnormal vasoreactivity, endothelial dysfunction, and activation of intravascular leukocytes. Some conditions, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, HIV/AIDS, and others, are atherosclerotic CVD risk enhancers and should be considered in the determination of optimal lipid management; however, disease-specific treatments to lower stroke risk are not established, and heterogeneity between cancer types and stroke mechanisms has led to limited data on risk stratification and optimal preventive therapies.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^117H65Bt]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Autoimmune conditions — antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) context and definitions are outlined: Autoimmune conditions cause inflammation, which contributes to vascular injury and hypercoagulability, which may increase the risk of stroke, and the presence of aPLs is most convincingly associated with arterial thrombosis. APS is defined as an autoimmune condition characterized by the presence of venous or arterial thrombosis or pregnancy-related complications in patients with aPLs and is characterized by the persistent (repeat testing 12 weeks apart) presence of specific aPLs plus evidence of clinical criteria such as vascular thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity. APS can occur as a primary disease process or secondary to primarily autoimmune conditions (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren disease, or systemic sclerosis). Measurement of aPL titers (anticardiolipin antibodies or anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies and lupus anticoagulant) is used to define high-risk and low-risk aPL profiles.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus; stroke and myocardial infarction risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rtK3c]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterised by alternating periods of flares and remission, and irreversible organ damage associated with disease activity. The skin, joints, heart, kidneys, central nervous system and haematologic system are some of the most commonly affected organs. Organ damage has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Although recent data suggest that mortality decreased in patients with SLE over the last 30 years, mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) has remained high, an estimated twofold to threefold increased risk of CVD-associated mortality compared with the general population.

Stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) are major CVD events that are potentially life-threatening. Understanding the magnitude of stroke and MI risk in patients with SLE and characterising patients at highest risk would support the development of strategies for preventing and treating or modifying risk factors. Patients with SLE have an increased risk of strokeand MI. Evidence includes a meta-analysis of cohort studies published prior to 2015 that compared patients with SLE with the general population. There are no recent meta-analyses that evaluate both stroke and MI across multiple observational study types to estimate pooled risk.

We aimed to synthesise evidence from published observational studies reporting risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with SLE compared with the general population or healthy controls. We report our findings on the risk of stroke and MI in patients with SLE. We also evaluate the role of age and sex in stroke and MI risk.

### Cardiovascular complications of systemic lupus erythematosus: impact of risk factors and therapeutic efficacy-a tertiary centre experience in an appalachian state [^115fjYFP]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, our study highlights the significance of tobacco use and venous thrombosis in lupus cardiovascular morbidity, also in agreement with the similar findings in the University of Toronto cohort. In contrast to prior studies in the USA, we were able to show the effect of lupus manifestations, namely venous thrombosis. Statistical significance of this manifestation was found despite the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in our cases, particularly using tobacco, and overall higher cardiovascular risk factors in Appalachian communities. In regard to medications, we showed the potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine on reducing cardiovascular events as seen in prior analyses. We showed a lower steroid use in the cases which contrasts with higher mean duration use of steroids in a prior study among individuals with cardiovascular events.

Therefore, rheumatologists should be vigilant with cessation of tobacco use counselling in patients with lupus. Neurologists and clinicians caring for new patients who had a stroke should consider lupus as risk factors, especially in younger patients, even in the presence of other risk factors. We further note that, despite being generally regarded as a mainstay of therapy in all patients with lupus, hydroxychloroquine is still not prescribed consistently in clinical practice. In view of the potential benefit of hydroxychloroquine in reducing cardiovascular events, hydroxychloroquine initiation threshold should be lowered, particularly in patients who have other traditional risk factors or had venous thrombosis.

### Treatment of the antiphospholipid syndrome [^113c1EAJ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Despite increasing knowledge of the immunology and pathophysiology of the antiphospholipid syndrome, treating this condition remains challenging. Because of a paucity of randomized controlled trials, many of the treatment recommendations are not evidence-based. Retrospective case series suggest that a high level of oral anticoagulation is needed to prevent recurrent thrombosis. The combination of heparin and low-dose aspirin is effective in significantly increasing the chances of a successful pregnancy in woman with recurrent pregnancy failure associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. Primary prevention with aspirin is justified in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies but without a prior history of thrombosis. Interesting and controversial issues in the treatment of the antiphospholipid syndrome include the use of less intensive anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents in some patient subsets, anticoagulation for certain nonstroke neurologic conditions, the role of other agents (hydroxychloroquine, antioxidants), and novel immunomodulatory strategies.

### Stroke and antiphospholipid syndrome: the treatment debate [^117HRAUE]. Rheumatology (2005). Low credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is one of the most frequent acquired thrombophilias. Thromboses can be at both the venous and arterial level, are usually recurrent and frequently affect cerebral circulation. Although it is difficult to predict which patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) will develop thrombosis, once a thrombotic event has taken place, secondary prevention is mandatory. Recommendations for treatment of APS have long been based on studies with a retrospective design. Recently, three prospective studies (two controlled and one uncontrolled small series) have addressed the role of antiaggregant and anticoagulant therapy in patients with stroke and aPL. However, results from prospective and retrospective studies are not in full agreement. In addition to the obvious differences in design, other factors such as the important variability in the study groups account for the discrepancy. While future investigation must better define homogeneous subsets of patients with APS, current secondary prophylaxis of thrombosis in these patients must be tailored according to individual estimated risk of recurrences, risk of haemorrhage and severity of potential recurrent events. Due to the often devastating consequences of stroke, we believe there is a place for prolonged, high-intensity anticoagulation in patients with APS and cerebral arterial thrombosis.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for primary prevention of thrombosis in individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies [^113rXSP3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterised by the presence of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies that have prothrombotic activity. Antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications (recurrent miscarriage, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation) and thrombotic events (both arterial and venous). The most common thrombotic events include brain ischaemia (stroke or transient ischaemic attack) and deep vein thrombosis. To diagnose APS, the presence of aPL antibodies in two measurements and at least one thrombotic event or pregnancy complication are required. It is unclear if people with positive aPL antibodies but without any previous thrombotic events should receive primary antithrombotic prophylaxis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents versus placebo or no intervention or other intervention on the development of thrombosis in people with aPL antibodies who have not had a thrombotic event. We did not address obstetric outcomes in this review as these have been thoroughly addressed by other Cochrane Reviews.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register (4 December 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (last search 29 November 2017), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL, and AMED (searched 4 December 2017), and trials registries (searched 29 November 2017). We also checked reference lists of included studies, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines, and contacted experts in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, or their combinations, at any dose and mode of delivery with placebo, no intervention, or other intervention. We also included RCTs that compared antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents with each other or that compared two different doses of the same drug. We included studies performed in people of any age and with no history of thrombosis (as defined by APS Sapporo classification criteria or updated Sydney classification criteria), but with aPL antibodies confirmed on at last two separate measurements. The studies included both pregnant women who tested positive for aPL antibodies and had a history of recurrent obstetric complications, as well as non-pregnancy related cases with positive screening for antibodies, in accordance with the criteria mentioned above.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for the included studies and quality of evidence using GRADE. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third review author when necessary. In addition, one review author checked all the extracted numerical data.

Main Results

We included nine studies involving 1044 randomised participants. The studies took place in several countries and had different funding sources. No study was at low risk of bias in all domains. We classified all included studies as at unclear or high risk of bias in two or more domains. Seven included studies focused mainly on obstetric outcomes. One study included non-pregnancy-related cases, and one study included both pregnancy-related cases and other patients with positive results for aPL antibodies. The remaining studies concerned women with aPL antibodies and a history of pregnancy failure. Four studies compared anticoagulant with or without acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) versus ASA only and observed no clear difference in thrombosis risk (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 3.77; 4 studies; 493 participants; low-quality evidence). No major bleeding was reported, but minor bleeding risk (nasal bleeding, menorrhagia) was higher in the anticoagulant with ASA group as compared with ASA alone in one study (RR 22.45, 95% CI 1.34 to 374.81; 1 study; 164 participants; low-quality evidence). In one study ASA was compared with placebo, and there were no clear differences in thrombosis (RR 5.21, 95% CI 0.63 to 42.97; 1 study; 98 participants; low-quality evidence) or minor bleeding risk between the groups (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.34 to 29.01; 1 study; 98 participants; low-quality evidence), and no major bleeding was observed. Two studies compared ASA with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus placebo or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and no thrombotic events were observed in any of the groups. Moreover, there were no clear differences in the risk of bleeding requiring transfusion (RR 9.0, 95% CI 0.49 to 164.76; 1 study; 180 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or postpartum bleeding (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.81; 1 study; 180 participants; moderate-quality evidence) between the groups. Two studies compared ASA with high-dose LMWH versus ASA with low-dose LMWF or unfractionated heparin (UFH); no thrombotic events or major bleeding was reported. Mortality and quality of life data were not reported for any of the comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate benefit or harm of using anticoagulants with or without ASA versus ASA alone in people with aPL antibodies and a history of recurrent pregnancy loss and with no such history; ASA versus placebo in people with aPL antibodies; and ASA with LMWH versus placebo or IVIG, and ASA with high-dose LMWH versus ASA with low-dose LMWH or UFH, in women with aPL antibodies and a history of recurrent pregnancy loss, for the primary prevention of thrombotic events. In a mixed population of people with a history of previous pregnancy loss and without such a history treated with anticoagulant combined with ASA, the incidence of minor bleeding (nasal bleeding, menorrhagia) was increased when compared with ASA alone. Studies that are adequately powered and that focus mainly on thrombotic events are needed to draw any firm conclusions on the primary prevention of thrombotic events in people with antiphospholipid antibodies.

The management of a patient with SLE presents the OMS with a challenging array of decisions to make in regards to treatment sequencing. Careful reviews of the patient's medical history, the presentation of the illness, and the medication profile, and an open discourse with medical colleagues are necessary to ensure the safety of patients. By becoming comfortable with the medical treatment the patient is undergoing as well as having a firm understanding of where the patient is along the cascade of disease severity (see Fig. 7), appropriate decisions can be made in regards to the patient's outcome and prognosis. Proceeding into surgical treatment without following these guidelines could potentially result in catastrophic consequences for the patient.

Results

New cardiovascular events during follow-up period

Of the 100 patients recruited, 98 were women and 2 were men. All patients were followed up till the end of 2020, with the exception of three patients who died from non-cardiovascular causes (in 2015, 2016 and 2017) and nine lost to follow-up between 2016 and 2019. The mean (.) duration of follow-up from the first scan was 7.5 (0.5) years. The baseline characteristics of these 100 patients were published in our previous paper and are also included in Supplementary Table S1, available at Rheumatology online. Although 14 of the 100 studied were taking aspirin at baseline, review of the medical records showed that none of them was taking this drug for primary prevention of CVD. In 12 cases, aspirin was prescribed due to previous positive tests for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the absence of thrombosis. We were unable to identify the reason for taking aspirin in the other two cases. Of 34 patients who had ever been positive for aPL, five were on anticoagulation due to previous thrombosis. One of these five suffered a CVD event during the course of this study.

Seven patients developed CVD for the first time during the follow-up period. Five had coronary events whereas two had lacunar strokes. Details are shown in Table 1. All the patients who developed events were women with mean (.) age at event of 46.5 (4.5) years and mean (.) duration of SLE of 25.2 (1.5) years.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115iVGY1]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

This is the best evidence available and until more robust evidence is published, physicians need to choose which drug benefits the most their patients based on this reality.

Currently, two more RCTs are ongoing: ASTRO-APS (apixaban for secondary prevention of TE among patients with APS) and RISAPS (rivaroxaban for patients who had stroke with APS, with or without SLE, follows the results of RAPS trial, with estimated completion dates for 2021 and 2023, respectively. The ASTRO-APS will include only a strict set of patients with APS with history of venous TE. In this study, patients with previous arterial thrombosis were excluded as these events may be a marker of higher thrombogenicity, recurrent events and potential DOACs treatment non-response. The RISAPS trial aims to study higher intensity anticoagulation with rivaroxaban (15 mg, two times a day, a dose recommended for the acute treatment of VTE) and warfarin (target INR 3.5) — these being the novelties of this study.

Notwithstanding our data, the ongoing trials, despite the existing differences in the population (stricter in ATRO-APS), will inform more robustly about the possible class effect of DOACs in APS. The need of further trials depends on these results.

In conclusion, our review suggests that DOACs use, particularly rivaroxaban, among patients with APS, appears to be less effective than VKA, since it is associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events. In fact, some authorsreport patients, mostly triple-positive, who experienced catastrophic APS — microthromboses involving at least three organs within a week — after rivaroxaban introduction. Despite our results advising against DOACs, particularly rivaroxaban, judgements concerning other DOACs should be more watchful considering the ongoing trials, namely ASTRO-APS, that might provide additional data on this regard and consequently change the present approach to this class of drugs in patients with APS.

### Modern therapy of patients with lupus erythematosus must include appropriate management of their heightened rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events: a literature update [^1162JcXK]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conventional assessments of the risk of a future ASCVD event in the general non-autoimmune population rely on these conventional risk factors but also make a large distinction based on the absence or presence of clinically evident ASCVD. Clinically evident ASCVD includes prior myocardial infarction (MI), angina, atherosclerotic stroke, transient cerebrovascular ischaemic attacks and symptomatic peripheral artery disease — but not venous thromboembolic events, which are not atherosclerotic. In at least one guideline, unequivocally documented atherosclerosis on imaging known to be predictive of future ASCVD events, such as significant arterial plaque on coronary angiography or CT scan, was considered equivalent to clinically evident ASCVD in terms of assessment and management of event risk, and more recent data support this conclusion.

Risk assessment and management in patients without clinically evident ASCVD is called primary prevention and relies on open-access online risk assessment tools tailored specifically for this purpose, such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC) ASCVD Risk Estimator Plusand the newer PREVENT equationsfrom the USA, as well as the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation version 2 (SCORE2), which was developed for use across four risk regions within Europe. The clinician enters each primary prevention patient's values for a list of conventional risk factors into the online forms, and the tool calculates an estimate of the risk for an event in the next 10 years ('10-year ASCVD event risk'). This estimated 10-year ASCVD event risk is a major component of guideline-based care to direct the intensity of therapy. Many risk assessment tools now also provide an estimate of residual lifetime risk for an ASCVD event, meaning beyond just 10 years, to assist longer term management.

Since our guidelines were published, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) updated their guidelines for cardiovascular risk management in systemic LE. The EULAR guidelines include advice on the use of these 'generic' risk calculators, which were not developed specifically for patients with LE. The EULAR guidelines agree that patients with lupus have higher atherosclerotic event risk than predicted by these conventional calculators. Two principal authors of the EULAR guidelines emphasised this point in a more recent article presenting evidence of a mismatch in patients with SLE between the risk predicted by the SCORE2 and the risk revealed through the detection of subclinical atherosclerotic plaques using carotid and/or femoral arterial ultrasonography, a non-invasive imaging technique recommended by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) to enhance risk classification and guide lipid-lowering therapy in the general population of primary prevention patients.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to do not use rivaroxaban in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA and antiphospholipid syndrome with a history of thrombosis and triple-positive antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-β-2 glycoprotein 1) because of the excessive risk of thrombotic events compared with warfarin.

Antiphospholipid syndrome — Recommendations for patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA): Class 1 (B-NR) states that in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who have an isolated antiphospholipid antibody but do not fulfill the criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome, antiplatelet therapy alone is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke; Class 2a (C-LD) states that in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA who meet the criteria for the antiphospholipid syndrome, it is reasonable to anticoagulate with warfarin to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke or TIA; Class 2a (B-R) further states that in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA with confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome treated with warfarin, it is reasonable to choose a target INR between 2 and 3 over a target INR > 3 to effectively balance the risk of excessive bleeding against the risk of thrombosis; and Class 3: Harm (B-R) states that in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA, antiphospholipid syndrome with history of thrombosis and triple-positive antiphospholipid antibodies (ie, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti–β2 glycoprotein-I), rivaroxaban is not recommended because it is associated with excess thrombotic events compared with warfarin.

### Ten-year follow-up investigation of stroke risk in systemic lupus erythematosus [^113WHwn5]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

To analyse the long-term risk of ischaemic stroke and the clinical effects of antithrombotics on the risk of haemorrhagic stroke in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a population-based database taken from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with SLE between 2000 and 2008 were registered and matched with two controls by the index date, age, gender and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). These subjects were followed until either stroke event or 31 December 2013. Adjusted HRs (aHRs) for strokes were estimated with Cox regression models, and the cumulative incidence of ischaemic stroke was analysed by log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results

In total, 8310 patients with SLE and 16620 patients without SLE were included. In general, patients with SLE had higher rates of ischaemic stroke (5.4% vs 3.3%) and haemorrhagic stroke (1.5% vs 0.6%) than in controls. In multivariate analysis adjusted to age, gender, CCI, urbanisation level and antithrombotics uses, aHRs of all strokes, ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke were 1.73 (95% CI: 1.54 to 1.94), 1.65 (95% CI: 1.45 to 1.87) and 2.24 (95% CI: 1.71 to 2.95), respectively, in patients with SLE. Patients with SLE were significantly more likely to suffer ischaemic stroke than patients without SLE, even 10 years after SLE diagnosis (6.12% vs 3.50%, p < 0.001). Antiplatelet use increased the risk of haemorrhagic stroke in SLE group (aHR = 1.74, 95%CI: 1.18 to 2.57).

Conclusions

Patients with SLE are at greater risk of developing ischaemic stroke that lasts for 10 years. Antiplatelets should be carefully administered to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with SLE due to the risk of haemorrhagic stroke.

Regarding medical management for antiphospholipid syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of arterial thrombosis, BSH 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating anticoagulation with warfarin in patients < 50 years of age with ischemic stroke and APS, despite the lack of evidence that it is better than antiplatelet therapy.

Treatment with VKA vs LDA

In a prospective cohort study of patients with APS with prior ischaemic strokes, the likelihood of recurrent events over 34 months was lower among patients treated with warfarin versus those treated with LDA alone, with a wide CI (RR 0.37; 95% CI 0.05 to 2.47)(online supplementary table 5). INR was not reported. There was no comment regarding bleeding. Methodological quality was intermediate, with incomplete data on outcome assessment and follow-up. Another cohort study of patients with both venous (60%) and arterial (40%) events reported on recurrent thrombosis but not separately for these groups. Recurrences were lower among patients treated with VKA (30.6%) than those treated with LDA (57%). Data on bleeding were not reported. A single treatment arm study reported that three (37.5%) of eight patients with APS and prior ischaemic stroke who were treated with LDA had a recurrent thrombosis over a median of 8.9 years of follow-up. None had major bleeding.

The APASS study compared new cerebrovascular events over 24 months in elderly patients with recent stroke who were aPL positive on one occasion and treated with either LDA or warfarin at target INR 1.4–2.8. Most patients had cardiovascular risk factors (69% ever smoker; 69% hypertension; 32% diabetes). The primary outcome was death or new stroke, although deaths accounted for only a minority of events. Frequency of outcomes was similar between groups. Bleeding was not commented on. The study is not directly relevant because many patients likely did not have definite APS (single aPL measurement, low aPL titres). The relatively low target INR may have minimised differences in recurrences between treatment groups.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus; stroke and myocardial infarction risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uEQ7m]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Our analyses confirm that the relative risk of stroke is higher in younger patients with SLE compared with age-matched controls and corroborate findings from a previous systematic review. Although the underlying pathogenesis of increased stroke risk in patients with SLE is the subject of ongoing research, accelerated atherosclerosis likely plays a role. Accelerated atherosclerosis has also been shown to be associated with LN, which often develops at a young age and is also associated with increased CVD risk. A previous study found that patients with SLE and a history of LN had twice the rate of carotid plaque as age-matched patients with SLE without LN. Patients with SLE and no LN did not differ from age-matched non-SLE controls regarding carotid plaques. Accelerated atherosclerosis is often considered to be the primary cause of increased CVD risk in patients with SLE.

Our study is strengthened by a rigorous methodological approach based on international guidelines for conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The study design included a comprehensive search of multiple databases, reducing the likelihood of omitting evidence reported in key studies. The study selection criteria ensured that studies with overlapping populations were evaluated only once, ensuring greater confidence in reported relative risk estimates. Our study has some limitations. We identified heterogeneity across the evaluated studies that may be a result of variations in population characteristics, control group selection and risk measure reported. An additional source of heterogeneity may result from the extent to which the SLE and comparison populations were matched for CVD risk factors. Some studies matched the population for a wide range of risk factors or adjusted for them in the analysis, while others only matched or adjusted for a limited number of risk factors. However, multiple sensitivity analyses confirmed the increased risk of stroke and MI in patients with SLE. Because of limited data, meta-analyses could not be performed on patient subgroups.

### Clinical reasoning: a 56-year-old woman with right-sided weakness and recurrent MRI lesions [^112yyNZj]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Evaluating and managing patients with recurrent stroke presents a significant challenge, particularly in individuals with underlying autoimmune or rheumatologic conditions. We present a case of a 56-year-old woman with a long-standing history of medically controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who has experienced multiple ischemic strokes and a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite an unremarkable standard stroke workup and adherence to secondary prevention medications, including antithrombotic and lipid-lowering therapies, the patient continued to experience recurrent strokes, warranting further investigation. Serial follow-up imaging including CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and conventional angiography revealed progressive intracranial vascular narrowing, prompting a broad workup and differential diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of a stepwise and comprehensive diagnostic approach that integrates traditional vascular risk factors with those related to underlying autoimmune disease. It provides an insight into the diagnostic strategies and management of this high-risk population, ultimately supporting the need for personalized patient care to address the multifactorial causes of stroke.

5.10 Increased Risk of Thrombosis in Patients with Triple Positive Antiphospholipid Syndrome

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including rivaroxaban tablets, are not recommended for use in patients with triple-positive antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). For patients with APS (especially those who are triple positive [positive for lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies]), treatment with DOACs has been associated with increased rates of recurrent thrombotic events compared with vitamin K antagonist therapy.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116m29q8]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and related traits — knowledge gaps for primary prevention: Whether, in the absence of venous thrombosis, there is an indication for antithrombotic therapy for primary stroke prevention; whether, in the absence of venous thrombosis, the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) influences the risk of primary stroke and what the optimal primary prevention strategy is; and adequately powered studies of each trait individually with clinical trials to evaluate the optimal antithrombotic treatment to reduce risk if a heightened risk of primary stroke is confirmed. There remains a paucity of data to inform primary prevention of stroke in people with APS; further clarification is needed on whether direct oral anticoagulants (all or some) are less effective than warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke in this population and on the role of dual antiplatelets in APS, with reports suggesting a possible preventive role or in addition to anticoagulation.

Observational data "also suggest a high risk of recurrent thrombosis among patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who receive DOACs", and the guideline states "we do not recommend the use of DOACs in general and, specifically, rivaroxaban for antiphospholipid syndrome". There is also "a knowledge gap with respect to the role of dual antiplatelets in antiphospholipid syndrome", and "the absence of definitive data prevents us from providing a stronger recommendation at this point".

### Antiphospholipid antibodies in critical illness [^114JKu1Z]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The antiphospholipid syndrome is defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with recurrent venous or arterial thromboembolism or pregnancy morbidity. Antithrombotic therapies are the mainstay of treatment to reduce the risk of recurrent thromboembolism. Among patients with antiphospholipid antibodies, the absolute risk of new thrombosis developing is low in healthy patients without previous thrombotic events. However, the risk of recurrent thrombosis appears to be high in patients with a history of arterial or venous thrombosis. Compared with placebo or untreated control, anticoagulation with warfarin administered to achieve an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 probably reduces the risk of recurrence of thrombotic events. Aspirin and moderate-intensity warfarin appear equally effective for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with a single positive antiphospholipid antibody test result and previous stroke. It is unknown how best to prevent first stroke in patients found to be persistently positive for the antiphospholipid syndrome. The catastrophic variant of the antiphospholipid syndrome is a condition characterized by multiple vascular occlusive events, usually affecting small vessels and evolving over a short period of time. This condition has a very high mortality rate. First-line treatment with therapeutic anticoagulation, corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin seems to be effective in reducing mortality and risk of catastrophic thrombotic events in these patients. In conclusion, moderate-intensity warfarin is effective for preventing recurrent thrombotic events in patients with venous thrombosis. Aspirin appears to be as effective as moderate-intensity warfarin for preventing recurrent stroke in patients with previous stroke and a single positive test result for antiphospholipid antibody. The optimal treatment of other clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome needs to be addressed in well-designed prospective studies.

### EULAR recommendations for neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus vs usual care: results from two European centres [^112qyrd5]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of NPSLE with usual care in two tertiary centres and to detect potential pitfalls in their use for diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

A chart-based review of NPSLE manifestations was conducted in two European centres. Diagnostic and treatment decisions were compared against the EULAR recommendations for general NPSLE and specific manifestations.

Results

We studied a total of 94 patients who experienced 123 lupus-related neuropsychiatric events over 10 years. In 80% of the events, at least one EULAR-defined risk factor (previous NPSLE, generalized disease activity or aPL positivity) was present. Overall, there was good concordance between clinical care and recommendations for diagnosis and treatment (68.7% and 62.7% of events, respectively). Brain MRI was performed in the absence of a clear EULAR recommendation in 42.9% of events; therein, it was more frequently normal compared with imaging performed according to the recommendations (52.4% vs 18.5%, P = 0.008), and it did not influence management. Among patients reporting cognitive dysfunction, only 27.8% underwent the recommended neuropsychological assessment. In line with the recommendations, immunosuppressants were more frequently given in events suggestive of an inflammatory process (80.5% vs 47.6% in non-inflammatory events, P < 0.001). Notably, 52% of cerebrovascular events were managed with combined immunosuppressive/antithrombotic therapy due to either coexisting generalized lupus activity or recurrence despite prior antithrombotic treatment.

Conclusion

Despite good concordance between EULAR recommendations for NPSLE and usual clinical practice, we identified a number of issues (such as overutilization of brain MRI, suboptimal evaluation of cognitive dysfunction, and frequent use of immunosuppressives in cerebrovascular disease) that need to be investigated further.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114FUDPT]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) supporting evidence — aspirin effects on first thrombosis: Asymptomatic aPL carriers can be defined as individuals with ≥ 1 aPLs without history of thrombosis, obstetrical APS, or SLE. Use of aspirin (75–100 mg daily) for primary stroke prophylaxis was supported by a meta-analysis of 7 observational studies of 460 asymptomatic aPL carriers showing reduced risk of first thrombosis in aspirin users versus nonusers (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.25–0.99]). Subgroup analysis revealed a greater protective effect of aspirin against arterial thrombosis in asymptomatic aPL carriers (HR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.20–0.93]) compared with venous thrombosis (HR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.22–1.11]). In patients with SLE and high-risk aPL, a subanalysis of 8 mostly observational studies from a larger meta-analysis provides supportive evidence for the use of aspirin (75–100 mg daily) for primary stroke prevention.

### Therapy with direct oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention of thromboembolic events in the antiphospholipid syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113unUbQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analyses

Risk of thrombosis in subgroups of the trial population was analysed based on type of thrombosis, thrombosis history prior to trial inclusion and triple aPL positivity (forest plots of ORs in online supplemental appendix 6). There was a significantly increased risk of AT while treated with DOACs compared with VKA (OR 5.5, 95% CI 2.5 to 12.1, p < 0.0001), whereas there was no difference in the risk of VT (p = 0.87).

DOACs were significantly worse than VKA for secondary prophylaxis, especially among patients with a history of AT (OR 5.5 (95% CI 2.1 to 14.7) p = 0.0006). Although less harmful, DOACs were also inferior to VKA in patients with a history of VT (OR 2.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 6.1) p = 0.01). The risk of thrombosis for the subgroup of aPL triple-positive patients was higher with DOACs than VKA (OR 3.8 (95% CI 1.66 to 8.65) p = 0.002). Unfortunately, not all trials characterised how many patients had a history of both AT and VT or described the patients' aPL profiles.

Other outcomes

Due to three strokes in the DOAC arm, Woller et al doubled the daily dose of DOAC, after inclusion of 25 patients. Nevertheless, three more events occurred and subsequently all patients with a history of AT were excluded. Ordi-Ros et al registered catastrophic APS in one patient receiving DOAC. The RAPS trialmeasured thrombin generation as a primary efficacy endpoint and the endogenous thrombin potential was significantly higher in the DOAC group as compared with the warfarin group at day 42, but it did not reach the prespecified non-inferiority threshold of less than 20% difference in mean percentage change. RAPS trial also measured quality of life and found no difference between treatment groups in terms of health utility, but a small difference in the visual analogue score favoured the DOAC group (mean difference 6.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 11.5) p = 0.013). Patient satisfaction with DOAC was significantly higher than with warfarin, assessed by Woller et al.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and hypertension [^116idLmK]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with a high burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is in part imputed to classical vascular risk factors such as hypertension. Hypertension is frequent among patients with SLE and studies show it is more prevalent in SLE patients than in people without SLE. Despite the high frequency of hypertension in SLE patients, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of hypertension remain poorly understood. 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has emerged as a valuable tool in determining blood pressure (BP) in SLE patients in whom hypertension has been associated with damage accrual, stroke and cognitive dysfunction. Although prevalent, current guidelines neglect the specific management of hypertension in SLE patients in their recommendations. This review discusses the mechanisms that may lead to hypertension and the literature evaluating hypertension screening and management in SLE patients.

Higher-intensity warfarin showed no added efficacy over a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2–3; targets of 3 to 4 (versus 2–3) did not add benefit, and high-intensity warfarin was associated with a nonstatistically increased bleeding risk (HR, 2.18 [95% CI, 0.92–5.15]). When compared with aspirin, an INR of 2 to 3 has been shown to be effective.

### Baseline disease activity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension are predictive factors for ischemic stroke and stroke severity in systemic lupus erythematosus [^111dcQYX]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

To determine factors associated with ischemic stroke and stroke severity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

Methods

Between 1992 and January 2005, 238 consecutive systemic lupus erythematosus patients with no history of stroke were followed-up longitudinally at the Maryland Lupus Clinic. Patients were monitored quarterly for a mean of 8 years after their systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis, and 44 patients (19%) developed first-ever ischemic stroke. At the end of study, Cox proportional regression analyses were used to determine the effect of baseline clinical variables of systemic lupus erythematosus patients in relation to the subsequent occurrence of ischemic stroke and stroke severity after first-ever ischemic strokes. Severe stroke was defined as having a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale ≥ 6.

Results

Severe ischemic strokes occurred in 34 of 44 (77%) patients. Baseline predictors of ischemic strokes and severe ischemic strokes included disease activity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.

Conclusions

Severe ischemic strokes in systemic lupus erythematosus are not uncommon. Aggressive primary and secondary stroke prevention measures, particularly treatment of hyperlipidemia and hypertension, as well as vigorous treatment of clinical symptoms of active lupus, are needed to prevent serious morbidity and neurological disability.

### State of current management of the heightened risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in an established cohort of patients with lupus erythematosus [^115rykoC]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patients with lupus erythematosus (LE) are at heightened risk for clinical events, chiefly heart attacks and strokes, from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We recently proposed new guidelines to assess and manage ASCVD event risk specifically in LE. Here, we examined current cardiovascular management in light of these new recommendations.

Methods

We studied our entire UPenn Longitudinal Lupus Cohort of patients with cutaneous LE, without (CLE-only) or with (CLE+SLE) concurrent systemic LE, for whom we had full access to medical records (n = 370, LE-ASCVD Study Cohort).

Results

Of our LE-ASCVD Study Cohort, 336 out of 370 (90.8%) had a designated primary-care physician. By the new guidelines, the most recent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were above-goal for 249 out of 370 (67.3%). Two-hundred sixty-six (71.9%) had hypertension, which was undertreated or untreated in 198 out of 266 (74.4%). Of current smokers, 51 out of 63 (81.0%) had no documented smoking cessation counselling or referrals. Diabetes and triglyceridaemia were generally well managed. Of the cohort, 278 qualified for two widely used online estimators of ASCVD event risk in primary prevention: the ACC-ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus and QRisk3. We also stratified these 278 patients into our recently defined categories of ASCVD event risk in LE. These three methods for estimating ASCVD event risk showed clinically meaningful discordance for 169 out of 278 (60.8%). The documented rate of ASCVD events in the first 10 years after enrolment was 13.5% (95% CI 8.9%, 17.9%), similar between CLE-only and CLE+SLE, indicating an at-risk population despite the preponderance of women and an average age at enrolment of only 47 years.

Conclusion

Patients with CLE-only or CLE+SLE are undertreated compared with the new guidelines and, accordingly, they experience a significant burden of ASCVD events. Moreover, it is unclear how to accurately assess their future ASCVD event risk, except that it is substantial. Efforts are underway to improve ASCVD event risk estimation and guideline implementation in patients with lupus.

### Risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in newly diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus: a general population-based study [^116B5vFh]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the future risk and time trends of newly diagnosed myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, or both (cardiovascular disease [CVD]) in individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Methods

Using a population-based database that includes all residents of British Columbia, Canada, we conducted a matched cohort study of all patients with incident SLE and up to 10 age-, sex-, and entry time-matched individuals from the general population. We compared incidence rates (IRs) of MI, ischemic stroke, or CVD (i.e. MI or ischemic stroke) between the 2 groups according to SLE disease duration. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs), adjusting for confounders.

Results

Among 4,863 individuals with SLE (86% female, mean age 48.9 years), the IRs of MI, stroke, and CVD were 6.4, 4.4, and 9.9 events per 1,000 person-years, respectively, versus 2.8, 2.3, and 4.7 events per 1,000 person-years in the comparison cohort. Compared with non-SLE individuals, the fully adjusted multivariable HRs among SLE patients were 2.61 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.12–3.20) for MI, 2.14 (95% CI 1.64–2.79) for stroke, and 2.28 (95% CI 1.90–2.73) for CVD. The age-, sex-, and entry time-matched HRs for MI, stroke, and CVD were highest during the first year after SLE diagnosis: 5.63 (95% CI 4.02–7.87), 6.47 (95% CI 4.42–9.47), and 6.28 (95% CI 4.83–8.17), respectively.

Conclusion

Patients with SLE have an increased risk of cardiovascular events, particularly during the first year after diagnosis. Increased vigilance in monitoring for these potentially fatal outcomes and their modifiable risk factors is recommended in this patient population.

Regarding patients with SLE, several recent cohort and case–control studies showed higher rates of young ischaemic stroke (defined as an event occurring in patients under 50 years of age), clinically evident premature coronary artery disease (defined as occurring in men < 45 years old or in women < 50 years old)and MACE (defined as MI and ischaemic stroke)compared with rates in non-autoimmune controls. Importantly, in patients with SLE, symptomatic cardiovascular disease frequently preceded a first-time MI, which should prompt more aggressive management before the MI.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider targeting an INR of 2–3 rather than > 3 to effectively balance the risk of excessive bleeding against the risk of thrombosis in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA with confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome treated with warfarin.

### Would you use novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for thromboprophylaxis in patients with an underlying hypercoagulable state? A literature review through a case report [^114zPpSJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is an autoimmune condition that predisposes to venous and arterial thrombosis. Warfarin is the agent of choice for anticoagulation. However, a need for routine international normalised ratio (INR) checks and multiple drug interactions are some of the difficulties with warfarin. Currently, there is mixed evidence for and against the use of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) for thromboprophylaxis. We present a case report of a patient with APLS on a NOAC for secondary thromboprophylaxis who developed a stroke and discuss current evidence regarding the use of NOACs in patients with APLS. The patient was switched to warfarin for secondary thromboprophylaxis with an INR goal of 2–3. Literature review revealed mixed case reports for and against NOACs for secondary prevention of thrombotic events in patients with APLS. There needs to be further randomised controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of NOACs for thromboprophylaxis in patients with APLS.

### Evidence based treatment of the antiphospholipid syndrome II. optimal anticoagulant therapy for thrombosis [^115GibYo]. Thrombosis Research (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Current consensus recommendations suggest that patients with antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) are at high risk of recurrent arterial or venous thromboembolism (VTE) despite warfarin administered to achieve an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. These recommendations have been called into question by three recently reported studies.

Methods

We sought to determine the current "best practice" for the prevention of recurrent TE in patients with APLA and TE. Data was derived from a MEDLINE search and review of recent conference abstracts. The literature search was confined to studies of treatment to prevent recurrent thrombosis in patients with APLA.

Results

The overall proportion of patients suffering recurrent TE when allocated to moderated-intensity warfarin (target INR of 2.0 to 3.0) was 5/113 (4.4%), and it was 11/110 (10.0%) when such patients were randomized to high-intensity warfarin (target INR of 3.0 to 4.0). APLA-positive patients with noncardioembolic/nonatheroembolic stroke appear to have similar risks of recurrent TE whether they are treated with warfarin or aspirin.

Discussion

Patients with APLA and TE have an acceptable rate of recurrent TE if they are treated with usual-intensity warfarin. Patients with APLA and stroke are probably best treated with aspirin, while those with other forms of arterial TE are likely best treated with moderate-intensity warfarin plus aspirin.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with autoimmune diseases, AHA/ASA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider prophylactic treatment with aspirin (75–100 mg daily) in patients with SLE and no history of thrombosis or pregnancy complications, who have a low-risk antiphospholipid profile, to reduce the risk of stroke.

Secondary stroke prevention — laboratory and metabolic assessment. Control of hypertension, blood glucose, and lipids has been proven effective in reducing ischemic stroke risk; fasting is not routinely required for lipid testing except for patients with nonfasting triglycerides of > 440 mg/dL, who should have fasting levels drawn. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing can detect new type 2 diabetes in ≈11.5% and prediabetes in 36.2% of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke. In lacunar infarction, chronic kidney disease is associated with a 50% increase in risk of recurrent stroke. Prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time testing screens for relevant clotting and bleeding disorders; an isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time can be seen with heparin use, lupus anticoagulant, or clotting factor deficiencies.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to screening for thrombophilic States, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to do not obtain routine testing for antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with ischemic stroke having no other manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome and having an alternative explanation for the ischemic event, such as atherosclerosis, carotid stenosis, or AF.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^111rYcaH]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Rivaroxaban seems to offer an effective, safe, and convenient alternative to warfarin in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome who have had previous venous thromboembolism requiring standard-intensity warfarin therapy (ie, target INR 2·5, range 2·0–3·0). The RAPS findings are applicable to this group of patients due to the homogeneity of the study population. An alternative to warfarin would be welcomed by these patients and their treating clinicians, particularly because of issues with variable sensitivity of thromboplastins to lupus anticoagulant and unstable INR needing frequent and unpredictable anticoagulant monitoring. Warfarin is also associated with risks of thrombosis or bleeding due to underanticoagulation and overanticoagulation, respectively. The RAPS trial, however, was designed with a laboratory surrogate outcome measure that reflects the mechanisms of action of the interventions because the large-scale, long-term clinical trials needed to assess recurrent venous thromboembolism are not feasible in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. The absence of new thrombosis or major bleeding and the low rate of clinically relevant bleeding indicate low risks in the subgroup of patients assessed and puts into context anecdotal reports in case studies and small case series of recurrent thrombosis after switching from warfarin to a direct oral anticoagulant in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. The small but significant improvement in the quality of life visual analoge score seen with rivaroxaban in RAPS is encouraging. Further studies are needed to define the role of direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, including those who need higher-intensity anticoagulation after recurrent thrombotic events while they were taking standard-intensity anticoagulation, and those with stroke or other arterial thrombosis.

We did the Rivaroxaban in Antiphospholipid Syndrome (RAPS) trial to investigate whether rivaroxaban would provide anticoagulation non-inferior to that achieved with standard-intensity warfarin in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus. The studyhas been publishedand is available online.

Obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome without SLE — aspirin for primary prevention: In women with a history of obstetric APS, aspirin 75–100 mg daily was evaluated in a meta-analysis of 5 observational studies, yielding a pooled OR for first thrombosis (arterial and venous) of 0.25 (95% CI, 0.10–0.62). A retrospective subgroup of women with pregnancy-morbidity–only APS showed a protective effect with aspirin 75–100 mg daily, with 5% of non–aspirin-treated and 10% of aspirin-treated patients experiencing further aspirin-related clinical events (P = 0.00006). Although the data remain limited, evidence supports potential benefit in this population.

Systemic absorption may occur with the use of Estradiol Vaginal Cream 0.01%. The warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions associated with oral estrogen treatment should be taken into account.

1. Cardiovascular Disorders

An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen-alone therapy. An increased risk of PE, DVT, stroke and MI has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy. Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately.

Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE) (e.g., personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.

a. Stroke

In the WHI estrogen-alone substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg)-alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (45 versus 33 per 10,000 women-years). The increase in risk was demonstrated in year one and persisted [see CLINICAL STUDIES]. Should a stroke occur or be suspected, estrogenalone therapy should be discontinued immediately.

Materials and methods

Data source

In 1995, the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) programme was introduced, covering more than 99% of its 23 million inhabitants. Administrative claims data are kept within the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), including demographic information, diagnosis and the cost of medical services provided. For confidentiality, the NHIRD removes all traceable personal identifiers. The clinical diagnosis of NHIRD is made by using the diagnostic codes of International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). Researchers may request data on no more than 10% of the patients in the NHIRD. Thus, the National Health Research Institute has produced subsets of data. The Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2010 (LHID2010) includes the initial administrative claims data for one million randomly selected beneficiaries from the NHIRD from 2010. The age, gender and average insured payroll of the LHID2010 and NHIRD are not significantly different. The LHID2010 has been used for stroke-related studies.

### Controversies in the antiphospholipid syndrome and stroke [^115bRULj]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Many clinicians providing care and advice to patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), where the principal clinical manifestation is stroke, do so in the setting of an evidence base of mixed quality. Indeed, systematic studies have not particularly helped the practising clinician as they have been characterised by variable criteria used to select subjects, making it impossible to extrapolate to typical clinic patients. This has left us with a number of key questions, each of which attracts controversy in terms of patient management. In this review, these are posed as a series of questions with the answer, or lack of one, considered after each question. The review draws attention to the important questions that require answers for current primary and secondary prevention, as well as treatment of APS and stroke, and suggests a series of studies that are needed to clarify these issues.

### Lack of efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants compared to warfarin in antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [^111QkPvJ]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have a predictable anticoagulant effect, a rapid onset and offset of action, and fewer drug-drug interactions than vitamin K antagonists (VKA). These compounds have demonstrated similar efficacy and a better safety profile compared to VKA for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE)and for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (FANV)in large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.

Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) require long-term anticoagulation for the secondary prevention of thrombotic events. In this setting, VKA were shown to be more effective than DOACand are therefore recommended by international guidelines. However, the risk of recurrent thrombosis remains high even with VKA treatment, varying from 3% to 24%, and even increasing the intensity of VKA therapy does not reduce the probability of recurrence.

It is clear that adequate anticoagulation therapy still represents a clinical challenge in patients with APS and further investigation is needed before declaring DOAC ineffective. It has been reported that patients with previous arterial or venous manifestation recur with the same type of thromboses and that the risk of recurrence on DOAC is higher in patients with a history of arterial events. Two randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing DOAC and warfarin in APS have been prematurely interrupted due to the evidence of increased incidence of thrombotic events in the DOAC group, especially strokes. However, it remains unclear whether VKA are more effective than DOAC also in patients with VTE history and no arterial events. The aim of our study was to provide the best evidence from RCT on the risk of major vascular events and bleeding in patients with APS treated with DOAC versus warfarin and to evaluate if patients with no history of arterial thrombosis may be candidate to treatment with DOAC.

### Anticoagulation therapy in the antiphospholipid syndrome: recent advances [^1155HnSQ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The antiphospholipid syndrome is currently best treated with anticoagulation. This review discusses the recent literature addressing the duration, intensity, and appropriateness of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy in various clinical subcategories of this syndrome.

Recent Findings

Several recent articles reaffirm the benefits of long-term anticoagulation in patients with venous thromboembolism or undergoing renal transplantation and support recommendations for usual International Normalized Ratio targets. Aspirin seems to confer benefits similar to those of anticoagulation in arterial stroke. Appropriate anticoagulation strategies for pregnancy are controversial.

Summary

Anticoagulation will remain the mainstay of treatment for most patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. The optimal therapy for specific subgroups of patients will, however, require further good-quality studies.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^117SaHbV]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Autoimmune conditions — primary prevention of stroke recommendations include the following: In patients without a history of stroke and no clinical indication for anticoagulation, with a high-risk aPL profile, prophylactic treatment with aspirin (75–100 mg daily) is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and no history of thrombosis or pregnancy complications and with a high-risk antiphospholipid profile, prophylactic treatment with aspirin (75–100 mg daily) is recommended to reduce the risk of stroke (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) with prior venous thrombosis, it is reasonable to choose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy with a target international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 in preference to aspirin or direct oral anticoagulants for prevention of recurrent thrombotic events (COR 2a, LOE B-R). In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, statin treatment may be reasonable to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke (COR 2b, LOE B-R). In nonpregnant adults with a history of obstetric APS only, prophylactic treatment with aspirin (75–100 mg daily) after adequate risk/benefit evaluation may be considered to reduce the risk of stroke (COR 2b, LOE B-NR). In patients with SLE and no history of thrombosis or pregnancy complications and with a low-risk antiphospholipid profile, prophylactic treatment with aspirin (75–100 mg daily) may be considered to reduce the risk of stroke (COR 2b, LOE C-LD).
