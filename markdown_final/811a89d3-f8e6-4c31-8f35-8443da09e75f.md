## Question

What is the change in metabolism with red-haired individuals called?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the change in metabolism with red-haired individuals is called. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a recognized medical or scientific name for a metabolic syndrome unique to red-haired individuals. Then, I should verify the genetic basis of red hair and whether it intersects with metabolic pathways. Next, I will examine evidence for metabolic differences in red-haired people, including pain/anesthesia, vitamin D, and any endocrine links. After that, I should distinguish true metabolic effects from pigmentation biology and melanin synthesis. Finally, I will synthesize a precise answer and clarify terminology so we don't overstate claims.

> Let me first confirm the terminology question. I need to check if there is a named metabolic condition or syndrome specifically tied to red hair. Wait, let me verify across the provided sources: I do not find a coined term like "red hair metabolic syndrome" or a similarly branded metabolic entity in the literature provided, which instead discuss red hair primarily in the context of pigmentation genetics, melanoma risk, and pain/anesthesia phenotypes rather than a defined metabolic disorder [^115waxeD] [^1158eY7g] [^112zZrzg].

> Next, I should review the genetic basis to ensure I'm not missing a metabolic link. Red hair is predominantly due to loss-of-function variants in MC1R, with strong signals around MC1R and additional loci such as ASIP and POMC contributing to hair color variation. However, these discoveries map pigmentation traits rather than a unified metabolic syndrome, so I should be cautious not to infer a named metabolic condition from this genetic architecture alone [^115waxeD] [^113Hdpbq] [^115zMmck].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — are there metabolic effects documented in red-haired individuals that might justify a label? I will now examine the most frequently cited non-pigmentary phenotype: altered pain sensitivity and anesthesia requirements. Multiple studies and reviews report that MC1R variants are associated with greater thermal pain sensitivity and increased anesthetic requirements, with a classic anesthesia study showing higher desflurane requirements in redheads; this reflects neuropharmacologic modulation rather than a systemic metabolic syndrome per se [^116YKPg7] [^112zZrzg] [^111seSAj].

> I need to check vitamin D metabolism next, because skin pigmentation influences cutaneous vitamin D synthesis. Individuals with fair skin and red hair have less melanin and may have more efficient vitamin D production per unit UV exposure, but wait, I should verify whether this translates into a named metabolic condition; the endocrine literature emphasizes screening and supplementation strategies by skin complexion rather than describing a red-hair–specific metabolic disorder, so this is a risk modifier rather than a labeled syndrome [^1176GTJo] [^114qBNH9] [^1126dgNJ].

> Let me consider endocrine intersections. POMC deficiency can present with early-onset hyperphagic obesity and red hair in some individuals, but I should confirm that this is a distinct monogenic endocrine disorder and not a general metabolic trait of red-haired people; indeed, POMC deficiency is a rare syndrome with specific endocrine features, and red hair in that context reflects shared melanocortin pathway biology rather than a population-wide metabolic phenotype of red hair itself [^113Co89u] [^115rTWur] [^111xqmad].

> But wait, what if melanin synthesis itself is the "metabolic change"? I should double-check that distinction. Melanin metabolism refers to pigment biosynthesis within melanosomes and is a cellular pigment pathway rather than a systemic metabolic syndrome; recent fate-tracing work quantifies eumelanin versus pheomelanin synthesis differences by MC1R genotype, reinforcing that this is a pigment-cell metabolic process, not a whole-body metabolic disease designation [^1114zN1i] [^1115aPza].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no established medical or scientific name for a unique metabolic syndrome or disorder exclusive to red-haired individuals; documented differences include altered pain/anesthesia responses linked to MC1R, potential vitamin D synthesis advantages due to fair skin, and rare endocrine syndromes like POMC deficiency that include red hair, but none of these constitute a named red-hair metabolic condition in the literature provided [^116YKPg7] [^112zZrzg] [^1176GTJo] [^113Co89u].

> Final answer: There is no specific named metabolic change or syndrome unique to red-haired individuals. Reported differences are best described as phenotype-associated variations in pain/anesthesia sensitivity, potential vitamin D metabolism advantages, and rare endocrine disorders with red hair as a feature, rather than a unified metabolic diagnosis [^116YKPg7] [^1176GTJo] [^113Co89u].

There is **no specific medical term** for a unique metabolic change in red-haired individuals. Red hair is due to MC1R variants [^115waxeD] that increase pheomelanin and are linked to higher melanoma risk [^1158eY7g] and greater pain sensitivity [^111seSAj], but **no distinct metabolic syndrome** is recognized. Some studies suggest possible differences in vitamin D synthesis [^1176GTJo], anesthesia requirements [^116YKPg7], and oxidative stress [^1158eY7g], but these are not defined as a named metabolic condition. The main metabolic association is with melanin synthesis, not a systemic metabolic disorder [^1114zN1i].

---

## Genetic basis of red hair and its metabolic implications

- **MC1R gene**: Red hair is primarily due to variants in MC1R, which encodes a GPCR that regulates melanin synthesis [^115waxeD]; loss-of-function variants increase pheomelanin and decrease eumelanin [^1115aPza].

- **Melanin synthesis**: This is the core metabolic pathway affected, shifting balance toward pheomelanin, which is less photoprotective and more prone to UV-induced oxidative stress [^1158eY7g].

- **Oxidative stress**: Higher pheomelanin can generate reactive oxygen species, potentially increasing oxidative stress and DNA damage, and may contribute to melanoma risk [^1158eY7g].

---

## Documented metabolic differences in red-haired individuals

| **Metabolic aspect** | **Documented differences** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Vitamin D synthesis | Possibly more efficient due to lower melanin, but evidence is mixed | Moderate [^1176GTJo] [^114qBNH9] |
| Anesthesia requirements | Higher desflurane requirement reported in redheads | Moderate [^116YKPg7] |
| Pain sensitivity | Greater sensitivity to thermal and electrical pain | Moderate [^notfound] |
| Oxidative stress | Higher ROS from pheomelanin may increase oxidative stress | Moderate [^1158eY7g] |

---

## Absence of a specific medical term

There is **no specific term** for a unique metabolic change in red-haired individuals. The recognized associations are with melanin synthesis, pain sensitivity, and possible oxidative stress, but these do not constitute a defined metabolic syndrome.

---

## Clinical implications and health considerations

- **Melanoma risk**: Higher melanoma risk warrants sun protection and regular skin checks [^1158eY7g].

- **Pain management**: Greater pain sensitivity may require tailored analgesic strategies [^112zZrzg].

- **Vitamin D**: Possible differences in vitamin D synthesis may inform supplementation, especially with limited sun exposure [^1176GTJo].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no specific medical term** for a unique metabolic change in red-haired individuals. The main metabolic association is altered melanin synthesis, with possible effects on oxidative stress, pain sensitivity, and vitamin D, but these do not define a distinct metabolic syndrome.

### Phenylketonuria [^113FrQB5]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on phenylketonuria:

- **Definition**: Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the PAH gene, resulting in a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.
- **Pathophysiology**: Phenylketonuria is caused by a mutation in the PAH gene, most commonly a missense mutation, resulting in a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is responsible for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the body, causing brain dysfunction if untreated. In classic phenylketonuria, phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is absent or significantly reduced, while in mild phenylketonuria or mild hyperphenylalaninemia, partial enzymatic activity is preserved. The accumulation of phenylalanine and its metabolites triggers several biochemical changes involved in the pathogenesis of brain damage, including reduced activity of pyruvate kinase, HMG-CoA reductase, and monoamine oxidase B, along with impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission and hypomyelination.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of phenylketonuria is estimated at 1 in 15,000 live births in the US and 1 in 100,000 live births in Europe.
- **Disease course**: Phenylketonuria is typically detected through newborn screening, enabling early intervention. If left untreated, it can lead to seizures, eczema, intellectual disability, behavioral disturbances with autistic traits, parkinsonism, musty body odor, and reduced skin and hair pigmentation.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of phenylketonuria is significantly improved with early detection and strict dietary management, with most patients achieving normal development with adequate disease control.

### The MTHFR 1298CC and 677TT genotypes have opposite associations with red cell folate levels [^113KkJXi]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Individuals homozygous for the thermolabile variant (677TT) of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase exhibit reduced folate status as evidenced by a drop in the biomarker red cell folate (RCF) compared to those who carry at least one 677C allele. We now report that a different polymorphism in the same enzyme, namely 1298A > C, is associated with increased RCF levels. Thus, these two common polymorphisms change a metabolic phenotype in opposite directions suggesting that their cancer protective associations are by different mechanisms.

### Nutrition and hair: deficiencies and supplements [^1155S7NB]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Hair follicle cells have a high turnover. A caloric deprivation or deficiency of several components, such as proteins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and vitamins, caused by inborn errors or reduced uptake, can lead to structural abnormalities, pigmentation changes, or hair loss, although exact data are often lacking. The diagnosis is established through a careful history, clinical examination of hair loss activity, and hair quality and confirmed through targeted laboratory tests. Examples of genetic hair disorders caused by reduced nutritional components are zinc deficiency in acrodermatitis enteropathica and copper deficiency in Menkes kinky hair syndrome.

### Hair cortisol and adiposity in a population-based sample of 2, 527 men and women aged 54 to 87 years [^112XBRHY]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

A handful of studies have observed an association between long‐term cortisol and obesity, as we did in this study. Wester et al. 33 found that patients with obesity (n = 47) being evaluated in an obesity center had significantly higher hair cortisol levels than normal‐weight (n = 41) and overweight controls (n = 87), but there was no significant difference between the normal‐weight and overweight groups. Similar results have been observed in samples of young shift and day workers 25 and children 24, 30. Our study extends previous work by using data from two time points, 4 years apart, to retrospectively assess the relation between hair cortisol and the persistence of obesity. We found a linear association between the number of waves of obesity (0, 1, or 2) and hair cortisol levels: mean cortisol was lowest in individuals who did not have obesity at either time point, higher in those who had obesity at just one time point, and highest in those who had obesity at both times. This suggests that chronic high‐level cortisol exposure may play a role in the maintenance of obesity. However, it is important to note that as BMI measurements preceded the cortisol measurement, a reverse association is also possible whereby persistent obesity could play a role in the elevation of cortisol levels, for example through altered metabolism.

### Large scale clinical exome sequencing uncovers the scope and severity of skin disorders associated with MC1R genetic variants [^1154L2Bv]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Genetic variation in MC1R is a main determinant of red hair color (RHC) phenotype and confers susceptibility to skin disorders.

Methods

We assessed the effects and function of MC1R variants identified in our clinical cohort of 135,947 participants with available exome sequencing using phenome-wide association scan (PheWAS). Expression and function of several variants were evaluated.

Results

We found 24 nonsense and 215 missense variants in MC1R. Many common missense MC1R variants are strongly associated with skin disorders including skin cancer; however, each variant shows different penetrance and expressivity. Severity of skin phenotype was well correlated with the magnitude of functional defect measured as receptor expression and α-MSH stimulated cAMP production. Remarkably, MC1R deletions and nonsense variants are only weakly associated with milder skin phenotypes.

Conclusion

Our comprehensive assessment of all MC1R variants in a large cohort clearly establish that individuals with some missense variants are more susceptible to severe skin disorders than those with MC1R deletions or nonsense variants.

### The genetics of sun sensitivity in humans [^1127YWNu]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2004). Low credibility.

Humans vary > 100-fold in their sensitivity to the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. The main determinants of sensitivity are melanin pigmentation and less-well-characterized differences in skin inflammation and repair processes. Pigmentation has a high heritability, but susceptibility to cancers of the skin, a key marker of sun sensitivity, is less heritable. Despite a large number of murine coat-color mutations, only one gene in humans, the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), is known to account for substantial variation in skin and hair color and in skin cancer incidence. MC1R encodes a 317-amino acid G-coupled receptor that controls the relative amounts of the two major melanin classes, eumelanin and pheomelanin. Most persons with red hair are homozygous for alleles of the MC1R gene that show varying degrees of diminished function. More than 65 human MC1R alleles with nonsynonymous changes have been identified, and current evidence suggests that many of them vary in their physiological activity, such that a graded series of responses can be achieved on the basis of (i) dosage effects (of one or two alleles) and (ii) individual differences in the pharmacological profile in response to ligand. Thus, a single locus, identified within a Mendelian framework, can contribute significantly to human pigmentary variation.

### A novel and safe small molecule enhances hair follicle regeneration by facilitating metabolic reprogramming [^112qPkAX]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hair is produced in the hair follicle, which is a regenerating tissue that cycles through the three phases of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and resting (telogen). Hair follicle stem cells capable of proliferation and differentiation are responsible for the cyclic regeneration process, and many studies investigating stem cells, homeostasis, and the regeneration of the mammalian epidermis have been performed for hair loss control –. The hair follicle is among the most proliferative tissues in the bodyand undergoes repeated cycles of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation throughout life; thus, the process of hair growth requires higher bioenergetic capacities. Accumulating evidence has shown that human hair follicle stem cells have an aerobic glycolytic metabotype, and that cellular metabolism switches to mitochondrial-dependent oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) upon differentiation, which similarly occurs in other stem/progenitor cells, such as neural stem cells (NSCs), mesenchymal stem cells, and satellite cells. Although the significance of mitochondrial biogenesis and function in hair follicle regeneration has been emphasized, the possible applications of the metabolic control of hair follicle stem cells in hair regrowth are limited.

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^11344BnF]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Hirsutism/acne/alopecia — clinical markers and management in PCOS are described: Hirsutism is a good marker for hyperandrogenism and is present in approximately 70% of women with PCOS, and hyperandrogenemia should be evaluated biochemically in all women suspected of having PCOS; by comparison, acne and alopecia are not commonly associated with hyperandrogenemia and therefore should not be regarded as evidence of hyperandrogenemia; for women with PCOS in whom hirsutism is a major concern, treatment is focused on reduction of androgen production, decreasing the fraction of circulating free testosterone (T), and limiting androgen bioactivity to hair follicles; in those women with PCOS who have acne vulgaris, clinical benefit may be derived from many systemic therapeutic modalities; and because terminal hair turnover occurs slowly, at least 6 months of treatment is generally considered the minimal interval to see a response.

### Germline MC1R status influences somatic mutation burden in melanoma [^116bGLCR]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is a G protein-coupled receptor expressed on the surface of melanocytes that signals to downstream effectors, such as the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, to regulate skin pigmentation and to control cell proliferation and apoptosis. Melanin is generated by melanocytes in two major forms, pheomelanin and eumelanin. Unlike eumelanin, which is dark brown or black in colour, pheomelanin is red/orange, and is associated with type I/II skin, freckles, red hair and an inability to tan. People with this phenotype are generally highly photosensitive, and prone to sunburn when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light.

Population sequencing studies have revealed a number of null or hypomorphic MC1R alleles, which are collectively referred to as R alleles and are strongly associated with the red hair and light skin phenotype. Other missense variants are referred to as r alleles and are less strongly associated with this hair colour and complexion. While R/R individuals are generally red heads, and persons with 0 or 1 R alleles are rarely red heads, pigmentation traits such as degree of tanning after repeated UV exposureand skin reflectancedepend additively on the number of R alleles. In addition to regulating skin pigmentation, MC1R signalling has been reported to increase phosphorylation of DNA repair proteins, initiating the DNA damage repair process, and also to activate survival pathways. As such, polymorphisms in MC1R have been linked to increased melanocyte apoptosis and inefficient DNA repair. Collectively these factors link MC1R variants to increased melanoma risk. In animal model systems, null alleles of Mc1r (Mc1r e/e) have been shown to co-operate with Braf V600E to promote melanoma development via mechanisms including enhanced lipid peroxidation, a phenotype rescued on an albino mouse background owing to a lack of pheomelanin production. This has led to the suggestion that loss of MC1R function, even in the absence of UV light, may be oncogenic. Despite these insights, it is still unclear whether MC1R germline variant alleles influence the genome-wide somatic mutation burden in melanoma.

### Gender, genetics, and analgesia: understanding the differences in response to pain relief [^112zZrzg]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Individual variation in pain perception and response to analgesics has been a subject of interest for quite some time now. Genetic factors and sex of the patient are associated with differences in analgesia. For instance, the MC1R gene, which is associated with fair skin and red hair, has been found to play a role in sexual dimorphism of kappa-opioid analgesia. Red-haired women, with two variants of the MC1R allele, showed significantly greater analgesia in response to pentazocine, compared to red-haired men. This is an example of the role played by chromosomal sex in dissimilar responses to analgesic therapy, secondary to a specific genotype. There have been case reports of life-threatening respiratory depression in response to tramadol, codeine, and so on, in extensive metabolizers (EMs) of the prodrugs to their respective active forms. There are a number of other factors such as age, body composition, hormonal milieu, comorbid conditions, co-existing pharmacotherapy, past pain experiences, and environmental and psychosocial factors that play a role in the individual variation in the experience of pain and analgesia. Curiosity in this individual variation began ever since the period of Pythagoras, who noticed that some experienced fatal reactions on ingesting fava beans and others did not. Today, in an era of epigenetic therapies, understanding the genetic and gender differences in drug metabolism and drug response holds extreme significance and it has been facilitated by the successful completion of the human genome project in 2003.

This review aims to shed light on the gender differences and pharmacogenetics relevant to pain management. Pain is a subjective experience, which includes physical as well as emotional components, and is difficult to measure objectively. Each person is unique in perception and response to pain and so is each individual's response to analgesic therapy. The WHO pain ladder, which is a simple yet effective algorithm to manage pain, is nonetheless, an over-generalized management guideline when individual differences are considered. Understanding these differences is the first step toward individualized medicine or tailoring therapy to each individual, or in other words, a step toward an "ideal analgesic therapy".

### Genome-wide study of hair colour in UK biobank explains most of the SNP heritability [^115waxeD]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Red hair colour and MC1R

We performed a GWAS comparing individuals with red hair to a combined group of black- and brown-haired individuals. Accounting for genetic structure within the UK Biobank by inclusion of the first 15 genetic principal components adequately controlled the genomic inflation in our analysis (λ GC 1.024). The strongest association with red hair is located around the MC1R gene on human chromosome 16 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1a), which fits with the expectation that this locus is the principal genetic factor determining red hair colour. We find that the strongest signal of association in the region of MC1R (rs34357723; OR 9.59, p < 2.25×10 −308) does not originate from any observed amino acid changes, but is an SNP located some 97 kb from the 5′ end of MC1R and remains significant even after adjusting for all coding variants in MC1R. As we know that multiple MC1R alleles affect red hair colour, we performed stepwise conditional association testing and identified 31 additional association signals in this region at genome-wide levels of statistical significance (p ≤ 5×10 −8), altering the odds of having red hair compared to brown and black hair (Supplementary Table 1). Only ten association signals can be directly attributed to amino acid changes, nonsense or frameshift mutations within the MC1R coding region. Included in these are two missense variants rs368507952 (R306H) and rs200000734 (R213W) not previously associated with red hair colour.

### Protection against UVR involves MC1R-mediated non-pigmentary and pigmentary mechanisms in vivo [^1142icmZ]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Individuals with red hair and fair skin due to MC1R gene variants are at higher risk of cutaneous neoplasia, consistent with MC1R having a role in photoprotection. The exact reasons for greater UVR susceptibility as a result of compromised MC1R function are unclear, but hypotheses include reduced photoprotection due to less eumelanin, pheomelanin-induced phototoxicity, and lower protection by "non-pigmentary" MC1R effects. To determine how MC1R photoprotects, an in vivo hairless MC1R model containing Mc1r(-/-) albino, MC1R(+)Mc1r(-/-) albino, Mc1r(-/-) pigmented, and MC1R(+)Mc1r(-/-) pigmented mice was generated. After single doses of UVR, no significant differences in epidermal cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or sunburn cell (SBC) formation were observed between pigmented and albino groups. However, after repeated UVR exposure, the number of p53 clones in albino skin was significantly elevated when this was null for MC1R. Furthermore, in the absence of functional MC1R, fewer p53 clones were observed in pigmented than in albino skin. The results indicate that MC1R protects by a combination of pigmentary and non-pigmentary effects in vivo and that when MC1R function is compromised the melanin type in skin is still protective against UVR.

### Retinoids putting the "a" in alopecia [^116xFrsx]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin A (vitA) has many roles in human biology. With respect to hair, knockout mice for vitA receptor, hairless, and vitamin D genes have similar phenotypes, and follicle loss occurs during catagen. Hypovitaminosis A from inadequate vitA intake causes hair loss. This work suggests that dietary vitA may have a role in precipitating and maintaining alopecias as well.

### Technological advances in anti-hair loss and hair regrowth cosmeceuticals: mechanistic breakthroughs and industrial prospects driven by multidisciplinary collaborative innovation [^116Pm9kH]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Nutritional Supplements

Nutritional supplements provide essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients required for hair growth through oral intake, aiming to improve overall hair quality and growth rate by internal regulation. Common ingredients in these products include biotin, zinc, iron, and vitamin D, which are crucial for healthy hair growth.

Biotin (also known as Vitamin H) is a key nutrient promoting hair growth. It supports cell growth and division, aiding hair growth. Zinc and iron are other essential trace elements for maintaining healthy hair and preventing hair loss. Zinc plays a role in protein synthesis and cell division, while iron is essential for producing red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the scalp and hair follicles. Vitamin D is also crucial for regulating the immune system and promoting follicle health, and a deficiency in vitamin D has been associated with hair loss.

When combined in the form of supplements, these nutrients help support the hair's growth cycle, strengthening the hair from the inside out and improving its overall appearance and health.

However, despite the theoretical benefits of nutritional supplements in providing the necessary nutrients for hair growth, their effectiveness may vary from person to person. Some studies suggest that specific ingredients in nutritional supplements, such as MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) and antioxidants in green tea extract, may promote hair growth and improve hair quality. Additionally, one study found that vitamin E — tocotrienol — could increase hair count, possibly due to its antioxidant activity, which helps reduce lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress on the scalp.

However, there is also evidence that the effectiveness of nutritional supplements can be influenced by various factors, including an individual's nutritional status, genetic factors, and lifestyle choices. Furthermore, some components of nutritional supplements may have synergistic or antagonistic effects, meaning their outcomes could either enhance or counteract each other. Therefore, it may be necessary to tailor the supplementation plan to an individual's specific needs to maximize the effectiveness of nutritional supplements.

Therefore, nutritional supplements have the potential to improve hair quality and growth speed by providing essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients for hair growth. However, their effectiveness may vary, and various factors influence the outcomes. For those considering the use of nutritional supplements, it is advisable to do so under the guidance of a doctor or nutrition expert to ensure safety and effectiveness.

Main Ingredients and Their Mechanisms of Action

Different hair loss prevention and growth promotion products contain various active ingredients that work through different mechanisms to achieve the effects of preventing hair loss and promoting hair growth. Below are some of the main ingredients and their mechanisms of action:

### The multifaceted role of hair as a biospecimen: recent advances in precision medicine and forensic science [^117Qkw3p]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The hair shaft, despite its simplicity, is a valuable biospecimen in biological research, precision medicine and cosmetic science. Its versatility, noninvasiveness, easy collection, noninfectious nature and long-term storage suitability make it essential in forensic science, biomedical research, environmental studies, cosmetics and archaeology. Biospecimens such as tissue, blood, urine, skin and hair drive advancements in medicine, diagnostics and drug development. To ensure reliable results, the proper collection, processing and storage of specimens is crucial to prevent DNA, RNA and protein degradation while minimizing contamination. Unlike blood or tissue, which require complex biobanking, hair is easier to store. Advances in technology now prioritize 'fit-for-purpose' over 'high-quality' specimens.

Hair is a valuable specimen for studying cosmetics, predicting age through DNA methylation and identifying biomarkers for cardiovascular health, aging and cancer. It reveals metabolic changes linked to conditions such as obesity, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neurodegeneration, infant cognition and pregnancy complications. In precision medicine, hair analysis supports drug-level monitoring, treatment adherence and metabolic assessment, especially in cancer care. The key applications include (1) genetic testing in oncology and neurology; (2) monitoring toxins, pollutants and heavy metals; (3) drug and metabolite tracking in chronic disease management; and (4) biomarker-based diagnostics for metabolic, neurological and stress-related disorders. In forensic science, it is the most common biological specimen, aiding in determining sex, ethnicity, age, suspect identification, event reconstruction and drug-related crimes.

Hair samples can capture various exogenous and endogenous exposures, including inorganic elements, drugs, tobacco and alcohol markers, pesticides, micro-organic contaminants and other toxic pollutants. As a keratinized biological matrix composed mainly of keratin (65–95%), hair stores ingested substances, enabling retrospective drug analysis over months. Consequently, hair serves as a valuable biospecimen for biomarker discovery, drug monitoring, toxicology, forensics, nutrition, endocrinology, psychiatry, neurology and environmental health. Figure 1 highlights its key applications across disciplines.

Fig. 1
Diverse applications of hair biospecimens.

Hair analysis provides valuable insights across multiple fields, including (a) precision medicine for individualized treatment, (b) forensic science for identity and evidence analysis, (c) diagnostics for disease detection and monitoring, and (d) cosmetics and health for assessing exposure and well-being.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^113Co89u]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Genetic syndromes associated with obesity — selected examples and features — include MC4R deficiency with increased lean body mass, accelerated linear growth, hyperinsulinemia, and possibly lower blood pressure; leptin deficiency with normal linear growth with reduced adult height, rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction and responsiveness to leptin treatment; leptin receptor deficiency with similar growth pattern and rapid-onset obesity but not responsive to leptin therapy; POMC deficiency with accelerated childhood growth and red hair, light skin (non-Hispanic white individuals); Prader-Willi syndrome with poor feeding, failure to thrive, and hypotonia in the neonatal period followed by, by 4–8 y, hyperphagia with food impulsiveness; 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome with developmental and communication impairments; brain derived neurotrophic factor deficiency in which patients with WAGR syndrome have subset deletions on chromosome 11p 13; and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome with a genetic alteration in chromosome 11p15.5.

### Pigmentation-related phenotypes and risk of prostate cancer [^11716Pri]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an established causal factor for skin cancer, but may be associated inversely with prostate cancer. This latter association is hypothesised to be mediated through improved vitamin D status resulting from sunlight-induced epidermal vitamin D synthesis. However, meta-analyses have not demonstrated a vitamin D–prostate cancer association. We sought to test the hypothesis through an alternative approach by examining the pigmentation-related traits of hair colour, eye colour, and skin phototype, which influence vitamin D synthesis, in relation to prostate cancer incidence.

### Genome-wide study of hair colour in UK biobank explains most of the SNP heritability [^112bMQLS]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Manhattan plots of GWAS data. Data plotted for a red hair vs. black plus brown hair, b blonde hair vs. black plus brown hair, c brown hair vs. black hair. Points are truncated at –log10(p) = 50 for clarity

In addition to these 10 coding variants, we find 21 associations beyond the MC1R coding region at distances up a megabase both 3′ and 5′. These distant associations have been observed in other studies. Although these variants potentially could affect long-range regulatory elements of MC1R, it is likely that they are synthetic associations caused by low linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the associated SNPs and multiple coding variants.

We asked how many cases of red hair can be accounted for by MC1R coding variation. We included rs3212379, located only 120 bp 5′ of the transcription start site of MC1R, as a candidate transcriptional regulatory variant. Including this variant, the two newly associated missense variants described above and 13 previously described coding variants we find that the proportion of red-haired individuals with two MC1R alleles is 92%, whilst only 6.3% carry a single allele. The cases of red hair with only one or no variants (similar to that seen in a study of an Australian cohort) may be explained by, for instance, (a) rare coding variant alleles not genotyped or imputed in this study, (b) additional extragenic variation affecting MC1R expression, (c) dominant action of specific alleles, (d) variation in other genes in the same or a parallel pathway or (e) misreporting of hair colour.

### Aberrant expression of agouti signaling protein (ASIP) as a cause of monogenic severe childhood obesity [^111Hj6t6]. Nature Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

The obesity phenotype is explained by murine nonagouti/ASIP and human ASIP sharing structural similarity with agouti-related peptide. When ectopically expressed in the hypothalamus, ASIP is hypothesized to interfere with the leptin–melanocortin axis by competitively antagonizing the natural ligand α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone at the MC4R and thereby centrally affecting food intake and energy expenditure; however, ubiquitous expression of ASIP in mice has been reported to result in rather moderate hyperphagia compared to leptin- or leptin-receptor-deficient mice. Similarly, our patient reported struggling with satiety before bariatric surgery and showed restrained eating, indicating a conscious counteracting of the hyperphagic drives that she sensed. Increased levels of incretins after bariatric surgery may have affected neuronal MC4R signaling in the patient, further facilitating restrained eating. Besides hyperphagia, other mechanisms may affect the development of obesity. Agouti-related peptide in the hypothalamus affects energy expenditure, locomotor activityand sympathetic tone as well as shifting substrate utilizationin peripheral tissues. Ectopic ASIP may have analogous effects. Indeed, we observed reduced spontaneous physical activity in our patient and observed a decreased resting metabolic rate at the whole body and cellular level, which might at least partially contribute to the obesity phenotype. The father suffers from obesity, diabetes and has red hair. In childhood and adolescence he engaged intensely in competitive sports, which affects energy balance beneficially, but did not entirely prevent obesity. Variable phenotype–genotype concordance is also known in other monogenic causes of obesity, for example MC4R mutations. It has been described that MC4R mutations and variants exhibit partial penetrance and age-dependent expressivity. Of note, our index patient reported that her hair changed with age, from deep red (as a toddler) to more reddish and brown (now as a young adult), which might indicate similar altered expressivity of the genotype–phenotype association. Although ectopic ASIP most likely promotes obesity primarily via central effects, ectopic ASIP may also contribute to obesity through peripheral effects as described for enhanced insulin secretion in the pancreas, leptin secretion from adipocytes, reduced lipolytic activity in adipocytes or regulation of adipogenic transcription factors, and it may even affect activation of brown AT. In line with this, the patient showed hyperinsulinemia and her SVF cells differentiated better into adipocytes than SVF cells from controls, indicating additional peripheral obesity-related effects of ubiquitous ASIP expression. Potentially, primary hyperinsulinemia may also drive the linear overgrowth, as recently shown for epigenetically driven hyperinsulinemia causing gigantism in mice.

### An ultraviolet-radiation-independent pathway to melanoma carcinogenesis in the red hair / fair skin background [^1158eY7g]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

People with pale skin, red hair, freckles and an inability to tan — the 'red hair/fair skin' phenotype — are at highest risk of developing melanoma, compared to all other pigmentation types. Genetically, this phenotype is frequently the product of inactivating polymorphisms in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. MC1R encodes a cyclic AMP-stimulating G-protein-coupled receptor that controls pigment production. Minimal receptor activity, as in red hair/fair skin polymorphisms, produces the red/yellow pheomelanin pigment, whereas increasing MC1R activity stimulates the production of black/brown eumelanin. Pheomelanin has weak shielding capacity against ultraviolet radiation relative to eumelanin, and has been shown to amplify ultraviolet-A-induced reactive oxygen species. Several observations, however, complicate the assumption that melanoma risk is completely ultraviolet-radiation-dependent. For example, unlike non-melanoma skin cancers, melanoma is not restricted to sun-exposed skin and ultraviolet radiation signature mutations are infrequently oncogenic drivers. Although linkage of melanoma risk to ultraviolet radiation exposure is beyond doubt, ultraviolet-radiation-independent events are likely to have a significant role. Here we introduce a conditional, melanocyte-targeted allele of the most common melanoma oncoprotein, BRAF(V600E), into mice carrying an inactivating mutation in the Mc1r gene (these mice have a phenotype analogous to red hair/fair skin humans). We observed a high incidence of invasive melanomas without providing additional gene aberrations or ultraviolet radiation exposure. To investigate the mechanism of ultraviolet-radiation-independent carcinogenesis, we introduced an albino allele, which ablates all pigment production on the Mc1r(e/e) background. Selective absence of pheomelanin synthesis was protective against melanoma development. In addition, normal Mc1r(e/e) mouse skin was found to have significantly greater oxidative DNA and lipid damage than albino-Mc1r(e/e) mouse skin. These data suggest that the pheomelanin pigment pathway produces ultraviolet-radiation-independent carcinogenic contributions to melanomagenesis by a mechanism of oxidative damage. Although protection from ultraviolet radiation remains important, additional strategies may be required for optimal melanoma prevention.

### Germline melanocortin-1-receptor genotype is associated with severity of cutaneous phenotype in congenital melanocytic nevi: a role for MC1R in human fetal development [^115gCWQK]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies of the effects of MC1R genotype in postnatal life have documented fewer acquired melanocytic nevi in red-haired children and adults, and in individuals homozygous or compound heterozygous for R alleles at the MC1R locus. In addition, genome-wide association studies have not found any association between MC1R genotype and numbers of acquired melanocytic nevi, and no association between MC1R variants and higher numbers of acquired nevi in families with inherited melanoma. However, in the current study, we have identified associations between families with CMN-affected children and the red hair pigmentary phenotype, and associations between MC1R variants and the presence of CMN, as well with more extensive CMN. Taken in the context of the effect on birth weight, this difference between congenital and acquired nevi may be due to the differential effects of MC1R during pre- and postnatal life, although other inherent genetic differences between congenital and acquired nevi could also be significant factors.

### Contributions by MC1R variants to melanoma risk in males and females [^114GHcLy]. JAMA Dermatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Recently, the red hair variants of MC1R were found to contribute differently to pigmentation phenotype in males and females.

Objective

To investigate the role of these variants in melanoma risk in males and females separately because carriers of the red hair variants of MC1R are at increased risk of melanoma.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this hospital-based, case-control study, we evaluated the effect of MC1R and melanoma risk for males and females separately by performing multivariate logistic regression analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Association of MC1R variants and melanoma risk in males and females.

Results

A total of 905 females (473 melanoma cases, 432 controls) and 886 males (518 melanoma cases, 368 controls) were included in the analyses. The mean (SD) age of the study population was 59.2 (15.6). In females, carrying any MC1R red hair variants remained an independent risk factor of melanoma in a multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.19 [95% CI, 1.60–2.99]), whereas in males, only signs of actinic skin damage (lentigines on the back [OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.47–4.45; p = 0.001] and the hands [OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.24–4.29; p = 0.008] and wrinkling on the neck [OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.23–3.82; p = 0.007]) and sunburns (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.12–2.42; p = 0.01) remained significant risk factors.

Conclusions and Relevance

MC1R variants contribute differently to melanoma risk in males and females. This could be helpful to better classify melanoma risk factors between the sexes.

### Plucked human hair as a tissue in which to assess pharmacodynamic end points during drug development studies [^115xLoSc]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Given the caveat that there were often small numbers of hairs present within each stage, while there was a difference in some marker levels between hairs at different stages, the pattern was not entirely consistent across all markers, and, in the majority of cases, failed to reach statistical significance (data not shown).

Initial estimates of the intra- and intersubject components of variance for the different markers in scalp hair are shown in Table 4. It is likely that the reliability of these CV estimates could be improved further if a larger data set were used in terms of the number of individuals or number of hairs per individual, or if multiple sections from each hair were counted for each marker, particularly if the sections were stepped to avoid the same cell being counted more than once. It can be seen by comparing corresponding cells in Table 4 that, even when the hair stage effect is highly significant (e.g. total pRb – P < 0.001 for stage difference), the improvement in intrasubject CV due to the stage adjustment is modest, with a greater impact on intersubject CV, perhaps reflecting a greater variation in the distribution of stages between subjects. Therefore, it seems unlikely that allowing for the effect of stage would make much difference in future studies primarily using within-subject comparisons. The potential impact of factors such as ethnicity and gender, or of any relevant pre-study treatment, for example, whether hair follicles are synchronised in anagen during the recovery from cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced alopecia, is currently unknown.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility of detecting and quantifying a range of cell-cycle-related nuclear markers in plucked human hair, which could be used as PD end points in intervention studies using drugs that interact with these pathways.

### Functional variation of MC1R alleles from red-haired individuals [^115pqns4]. Human Molecular Genetics (2001). Low credibility.

Red hair in humans is associated with variant alleles of the alphaMSH receptor gene, MC1R. Loss of MC1R function in other mammals results in red or yellow hair pigmentation. We show that a mouse bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) which contains Mc1r will efficiently rescue loss of Mc1r in transgenic mice, and that overexpression of the receptor suppresses the effect of the endogenous antagonist, agouti protein. We engineered the BAC to replace the mouse coding region with the human MC1R sequence and used this in the transgenic assay. The human receptor also efficiently rescued Mc1r deficiency, and in addition, appeared to be completely resistant to the effects of agouti, suggesting agouti protein may not play a role in human pigmentary variation. Three human variant alleles account for 60% of all cases of red hair. We engineered each of these in turn into the BAC and find that they have reduced, but not completely absent, function in transgenic mice. Comparison of the phenotypes of alphaMSH-deficient mice and humans in conjunction with this data suggests that red hair may not be the null phenotype of MC1R.

### Pigmentation-related phenotypes and risk of prostate cancer [^117SG7fv]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Solar ultraviolet radiation exposure has been inversely related to prostate cancer incidence and mortality, possibly mediated through vitamin D status. Pigmentation-related traits influence endogenous vitamin D synthesis and may alter risk of prostate cancer.

Methods

We examined prostate cancer in relation to hair and eye colour, and skin phototype in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort. Incident cancer was diagnosed in 1982 out of 20863 men. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Prostate cancer risk did not differ by eye colour or skin phototype. Men with naturally red hair were significantly less likely to develop prostate cancer (HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.24–0.89) than men with light brown hair (reference).

Conclusion

The red hair phenotype, which results from polymorphisms in the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene, is associated with lower risk of prostate cancer. This pigmentation-related trait may influence prostate cancer development either directly, through genetic effects or regulatory mechanisms related to MC1R, another nearby gene, or other pigmentation genes, or indirectly, through associations with other exposures such as sunlight or vitamin D status.

### The MC1R r allele does not increase melanoma risk in MITF E318K carriers [^115zsBvF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Comparison of melanoma risk within each MC1R red hair colour allele and genotype in MITF E318K – and E318K + individuals

In the E318K + cohort, the MC1R R allele was associated with a significantly higher risk of melanoma [OR 1.67 (1.13–2.49)] relative to the E318K + MC1R wt allele, while the r allele was not associated with increased melanoma risk [OR 0.78 (0.54–1.14)]. For the E318K + group, RHC genotypes – R/R [OR 2.01 (0.68–5.98)], R/r [OR 1.64 (0.77–3.49)], R/wt [OR 1.86 (0.96–3.59)], r/r [OR 0.52 (0.20–1.38)] and r/wt [OR 0.81 (0.43–1.53)] – were not significantly associated with an increased risk of melanoma relative to the E318K + MC1R wt/wt genotype. The r/r genotype was inversely but not significantly associated with melanoma risk [OR 0.52 (0.20–1.38), P = 0.19]. However, when the E318K + RHC genotypes were grouped, all MC1R R genotypes (R/R, R/r and R/wt) were associated with significantly higher melanoma risk compared with non-R genotypes (r/r, r/wt and wt/wt) (P < 0.001) (data not shown in Table 3).

### The relation between melanocortin 1 receptor genotype and experimentally assessed ultraviolet radiation sensitivity [^115MNnCP]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Pigmentary phenotype is a key determinant of an individual's response to ultraviolet radiation with the presence of phaeomelanin thought to be of particular importance. Reports of minimal erythema testing, however, have failed to show a consistent difference between skin type I and other skin types. The melanocortin 1 receptor is a key genetic determinant of the cutaneous response to ultraviolet radiation. In this study we investigate the relation between experimentally induced erythemal response to ultraviolet radiation and the melanocortin 1 receptor genotype. Phototesting was performed in 20 redheads and 20 nonredheaded subjects, the majority of whom were also screened for the presence of melanocortin 1 receptor variants. The majority of redheads sequenced (89%) had two melanocortin 1 receptor variants previously found to be associated with red hair compared to none of the controls. There was no significant difference between the groups in minimal erythema dose: the median minimal erythema dose in redheads was 44 mJ per cm2 (interquartile range 34–56) and in the nonredheaded group was 40 mJ per cm2 (interquartile range 40–56). Objective measurements of ultraviolet-B-induced erythema were performed using reflectance instrument measurements of erythema intensity and dose-response curves constructed for each subject. The slope of the dose-response curve in the redheaded group was statistically greater than in the nonredheaded group (median in redheads 4.08 vs 3.56 for controls, 95% confidence interval for the difference between the medians being 0.01–1.23, p = 0.043). In addition the ratio D0.05:D0.025 was significantly lower for the redheaded group (median in redheads 1.22, interquartile range 1.18–1.26; median in nonreds 1.28, interquartile range 1.23–1.32; p < 0.05). Thus, although the minimal erythema dose values were not different, subjects with red hair develop greater intensity of erythema than nonredheaded individuals when doses greater than the minimal erythema dose are given. Importantly, when analyzed by genotype alone rather than phenotype, the slope of the erythema dose-response differed between those persons who were homozygous or heterozygous mutants and wildtype/pseudo-wildtype (p = 0.026).

### Reframing micronutrient deficiencies for modern times: a review [^1149xQsT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Presentation and Pathophysiology

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency or scurvy has been historically associated with sailors crossing the ocean, their diets lacking the water-soluble vitamin commonly found in citrus, potatoes, tomatoes, and green vegetables. Though the vitamin is stored in the liver and red blood cells and partially resorbed by the kidney, the body can be depleted after 3 months of deficient intake. Prolonged cooking, pasteurization, and high-heat canning can destroy the vitamin.

The vitamin acts as a cofactor (electron donor) for enzymatic reactions involved in the synthesis of collagen, neurotransmitters, and nitric oxide. Its ability to reduce dietary iron, allows for more efficient absorption of iron and reduced risk for anemia.

Vitamin C may also have a role in dampening the over-activation of the inflammatory cascade in processes such as sepsis. However clinical trials that have evaluated addition of vitamin C to sepsis regimes have not shown a clear benefit. –

Presentation can include hyperkeratosis, petechiae, coiled hairs, hemorrhage around the hair follicles, along with easy bruising and gingivitis. Depression, arthralgias, and vasomotor instability have been noted. Anemia may be present due to impaired absorption of iron.

The clinical manifestations can often mimic conditions associated with drug side effects, chronic liver disease, or malignancy. The petechiae and perifollicular hemorrhages can mimic the palpable purpura of vasculitis and initiate an extensive rheumatologic evaluation.

Risk factors

In the modern era, individuals reliant on shelf-stable foods, the so called "bachelor's diet", may present with scurvy despite overall adequate caloric intake. The disease has been noted to be more common in populations who live in remote areas and are at risk for food insecurity due to low socio-economic status. Scurvy has also been associated with chronic substance and tobacco use. Studies have suggested that vitamin C deficiency could be more common than thiamine deficiency in those with alcohol use disorder (~ 80% vs 30%). Some guidelines proposed vitamin C as well as thiamine repletion for those with chronic alcoholism.

Low dose oral supplementation in hemodialysis patients has been associated with decreased epoetin and iron requirements. Low vitamin C levels have been noted in critically ill inpatients;, however this should be interpreted with caution as suppressed levels may be due to intracellular uptake as part of an acute phase response.

### Germline melanocortin-1-receptor genotype is associated with severity of cutaneous phenotype in congenital melanocytic nevi: a role for MC1R in human fetal development [^114Un2qN]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) are congenital moles that cover up to 80% of the body surface area and can number hundreds in a single individual. They are permanent and grow in proportion to the child, although they often lighten in color. They are currently categorized by projected adult size (PAS) of the largest nevus and by total number of nevi. Neurological abnormalities such as neuromelanosis, congenital malformations, hydrocephalus, and benign tumors are the commonest complication of CMN, with the prevalence increasing with the severity of cutaneous lesions. Primary malignant melanoma of the skin or the CNS is a much rarer complication in childhood, although almost universally fatal, and prophylactic removal of skin lesions has not been shown to decrease the risk of malignancy. The recent finding of characteristic facies in children with CMN has broadened the description of this condition, and the term CMN syndrome has been proposed with preliminary diagnostic criteria (Kinsler et al. Am J Med Genet, 2012 (in press)). The genetic cause of these syndromic features is likely to be a somatic change affecting the ectoderm or neural crest, but is still to be elucidated.

There is, however, evidence of a germline predisposition for the development of CMN syndrome; this includes a higher prevalence of smaller CMN in family members of affected individuals, together with a handful of reports of large CMN in first-degree family members. We hypothesized that the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene might have a role in this predisposition, on the basis of a clinical observation of a high prevalence of red hair in families of children with CMN (for examples see Figure 1). The red hair/fair skin/freckling phenotype is strongly associated with variants of MC1R on chromosome 16q24.3. MC1R is a G-protein-coupled receptor expressed on melanocytes, melanoma cells, and CMN cells. The gene is highly polymorphic, with over 100 variants reported to date. Variants with a stronger association with the red-hair phenotype in humans have been designated R alleles (D84E, R151C, R160W, and D294H), whereas those with a weaker association are designated r alleles. This study was undertaken to examine whether the MC1R genotype influenced the development of CMN.

### The contribution of neanderthals to phenotypic variation in modern humans [^114aMFhh]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

The strongest association we found in this study was an archaic allele under-represented among red-haired individuals. This archaic allele is on an introgressed haplotype composed of 71 aSNPs and encompassing five genes: FANCA (MIM:), SPIRE2 (MIM:), TCF25 (MIM:), MC1R (MIM:), and TUBB3 (MIM:) (rs62052168, p = 3.7 × 10 −202; Figure 1 and Table 1). MC1R is a key genetic determinant of pigmentation and hair color and is therefore a good candidate for this association. More than 20 variants in MC1R have been shown to alter hair color in humans. None of the variants resulting in red hair in modern humans are present in either of the two high-coverage Neanderthal genomes that have been sequenced (Table S5). Therefore, Neanderthals appear not to carry any of the variants associated with red hair in modern humans. Further, a Neanderthal-specific variant (p. Arg307Gly) postulated to reduce the activity of MC1R and result in red hair was identified by PCR amplification of MC1R in two Neanderthals. However, this putative Neanderthal-specific variant is also not present in the Neanderthals genomes that have been sequenced to date, suggesting that if this variant was present in Neanderthals, it was rare. Using the high-coverage Neanderthal genomes, we identified only one additional Neanderthal-specific MC1R amino acid change for which the effect on hair color is unknown. However, it is polymorphic among Neanderthals, indicating that any phenotype that it confers was variable in Neanderthals (Table S5). Finally, because the introgressed haplotype we identified in this cohort is under-represented among red-haired individuals, we conclude that if variants contributing to red hair were present in Neanderthals, they were probably not at high frequency.

### Receptor function, dominant negative activity and phenotype correlations for MC1R variant alleles [^113Hdpbq]. Human Molecular Genetics (2007). Low credibility.

The human melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is a G-protein coupled receptor involved in the regulation of pigmentation. Several MC1R variant alleles are associated with red hair, fair skin and increased skin cancer risk. We have performed a systematic functional analysis of nine common MC1R variants and correlated these results with the strength of the genetic association of each variant allele with pigmentation phenotypes. In vitro expression studies revealed that variant receptors with reduced cell surface expression, including V60L, D84E, R151C, I155T, R160W and R163Q, showed a corresponding impairment in cAMP coupling. The R142H and D294H variants demonstrated normal cell surface expression, but had reduced functional responses, indicating that altered G-protein coupling may be responsible for this loss of function. The V92M variant cAMP activation was equal to or higher than that for wild-type MC1R. In co-expression studies, the D84E, R151C, I155T and R160W variants showed a dominant negative effect on wild-type receptor cell surface expression, which was reflected in a decreased ability to elevate intracellular cAMP levels. The D294H variant also demonstrated a dominant negative effect on wild-type MC1R cAMP signalling, but had no effect on wild-type surface expression. Importantly, comparison of the in vitro receptor characteristics with skin and hair colour data of individuals both homozygous and heterozygous for MC1R variant alleles revealed parallels between variant MC1R cell surface expression, functional ability, dominant negative activity and their effects on human pigmentation. These findings show the first direct correlations between variant MC1R biochemical properties and pigmentation phenotype.

### Germline MC1R status influences somatic mutation burden in melanoma [^113MBxu7]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Most mutations found in melanoma genomes are likely to be passengers, and are thus reflective of the UV exposure and other mutagenic processes operative over a patient's lifetime. Our regression analyses suggest that the estimated increase in expected SNV count associated with the presence of an MC1R R allele for the C > T mutation class is comparable to the estimated increase associated with an additional 21 years of age in the combined data set, with similar estimates across the other mutation classes (range 18–29 years; Table 1). R allele presence is also a significant predictor of total SNV count (Supplementary Fig. 5). Interestingly, our analysis did not reveal any consistent patterns in mutation counts between individuals with one as compared with two R alleles (Methods section, Supplementary Fig. 4). This suggests that the majority of persons with one R allele, who do not have a red hair/sun sensitivity phenotype, may still be highly susceptible to the mutagenic effects of UV light. Of note, it has been suggested that red haired, sun-sensitive individuals are more likely to practice sun avoidance, a factor that confounds ready interpretation of the association between mutation count and number of R alleles.

Our study finds that melanomas from individuals carrying MC1R R variants associated with red hair and freckling have a significantly higher somatic mutational burden than melanomas from individuals with no MC1R R variants. Intriguingly, while C > T mutations were the most common mutational class observed across all MC1R genotypes, all mutation classes were significantly and similarly increased. This might reflect a form of 'collateral damage' resulting from a decreased ability of cells in patients with R alleles to protect themselves from UV damage, or indicate that other mutational processes are operative in melanocytes from these patients. When we compared the mutational signatures present in MC1R R allele carriers to those present in non-carriers (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7), we observed no significant differences between the two groups apart from the age-associated 5-methylcytosine deamination, a result explained in part by the marginally younger average age of MC1R R allele carriers. This suggests that the same mutational processes are operative in R allele carriers as in non-carriers, but that the relative frequency of mutational events may be what differs between these groups. However, studies with larger sample sizes should be performed to further investigate this relationship.

### A single-nucleotide polymorphism in CYP2B6 leads to > 3-fold increases in efavirenz concentrations in plasma and hair among HIV-infected women [^117NaJUC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Efavirenz exhibits marked interindividual variability in plasma levels and toxicities. Prior pharmacogenetic studies usually measure exposure via single plasma levels, examine limited numbers of polymorphisms, and rarely model multiple contributors. We analyzed numerous genetic and nongenetic factors impacting short-term and long-term exposure in a large heterogeneous population of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women.

Methods

We performed 24-hour intensive pharmacokinetic studies in 111 women receiving efavirenz under actual-use conditions and calculated the area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC) to assess short-term exposure; the efavirenz concentration in hair was measured to estimate long-term exposure. A total of 182 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 45 haplotypes in 9 genes were analyzed in relationship to exposure by use of multivariate models that included a number of nongenetic factors.

Results

Efavirenz AUCs increased 1.26-fold per doubling of the alanine aminotransferase level and 1.23-fold with orange and/or orange juice consumption. Individuals with the CYP2B6 516TT genotype displayed 3.5-fold increases in AUCs and 3.2-fold increases in hair concentrations, compared with individuals with the TG/GG genotype. Another SNP in CYP2B6 (983TT) and a p-glycoprotein haplotype affected AUCs without substantially altering long-term exposure.

Conclusions

This comprehensive pharmacogenomics study showed that individuals with the CYP2B6 516TT genotype displayed > 3-fold increases in both short-term and long-term efavirenz exposure, signifying durable effects. Pharmacogenetic testing combined with monitoring of hair levels may improve efavirenz outcomes and reduce toxicities.

### An atypical case of familial glucocorticoid deficiency without pigmentation caused by coexistent homozygous mutations in MC2R (T152K) and MC1R (R160W) [^11489UZK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which cortisol and adrenal androgen secretions are deficient due to adrenal unresponsiveness to ACTH stimulation. The most significant phenotypic features are severe neonatal hypoglycemia, frequent childhood infection, and excessive generalized skin pigmentation related to elevated proopiomelanocortin (POMC) products. FGD can be caused by mutations in genes encoding the ACTH receptor [melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R)] or its accessory protein (MRAP), and a similar clinical presentation has been observed in some patients with specific "mild" mutations in the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. Most commonly, MC2R is mutated, and this is referred to as FGD type 1 (OMIM 202200).

MSH (melanotropin) and ACTH are products of the same gene, POMC, and they regulate pigmentation and adrenocortical function, respectively. Mutations in POMC result in a red hair phenotype with metabolic abnormalities, including adrenal insufficiency and obesity.

MC1R plays a central role in the regulation of skin pigmentation, is expressed in melanocytes, and binds α-MSH and ACTH with similar affinity. MC1R activation increases the ratio of black, strongly photoprotective eumelanins to reddish, poorly photoprotective pheomelanins. Several MC1R variants are associated with red hair/fair skin. Increased circulating ACTH acting through MC1R is believed to be the cause of the hyperpigmentation seen in primary adrenal failure. There are, however, a few reports of Addison's cases without hyperpigmentation. So far, no pathogenetic mechanism has been described to explain this phenomenon, although it has been noted that it is more frequently observed in fair-skinned individuals.

Here we report coexistent homozygous MC2R and MC1R mutations in the same individual, causing an unusual presentation of FGD without hyperpigmentation.

### Gender, genetics, and analgesia: understanding the differences in response to pain relief [^114gBrb1]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamics

Drugs interact with their specific receptors and initiate a cascade involving the second messenger system, finally culminating in the drug effect. The components in this cascade are subject to genetic variability resulting in variable responses.

MOR belongs to a family of 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). OPRM1 gene coding for MOR is highly polymorphic, and there are case reports of OPRM1 variants with significantly decreased analgesic response to opioids and greater postoperative opioid requirements. There are many studies on genetic variability of MOR and its relation to pain, but the results are inconsistent.

Nonfunctional variants of the MC1R gene, which results in red hair and fair skin, are associated with sexual dimorphism in kappa-opioid responses. Red-haired women with these MC1R variants are known to require a lesser dose of drugs such as pentazocine compared to red-haired men.

NSAIDs act through the inhibition of COX pathways. Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS) 1 and 2 code for COX 1 and 2, respectively. Genetic variations in these enzymes can result in an altered NSAID response. Individuals with an increased expression of PTGS 2 and hence COX 2 experience better analgesic response to COX 2-specific agents such as celecoxib, while lower levels of expression of COX 2 result in better analgesic response to nonselective NSAIDs.

COMT degrades neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, which play an integral role in CNS pain pathways. Increased dopamine suppresses the production of endogenous opioid peptides, which in turn upregulates opioid receptor levels and hence altered response to opioids. Genetic variability in COMT expression has been related to variability in opioid dose requirements.–

Local anesthetics are sodium channel inhibitors; hence, genetic variations in sodium channels may be expected to alter local anesthetic binding and response. This has been proven by in vitro studies showing greater resistance to lidocaine in certain mutations of the SCN9A gene coding for sodium channels. This has also been linked to increased susceptibility to local anesthetic toxicity.

Apart from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variabilities in drug responses, genetic variability in immune-mediated drug hypersensitivity has been studied. Antiepileptics are increasingly used in the management of chronic pain and neuropathic pain. These anticonvulsants commonly cause cutaneous adverse drug reactions including fatal ones such as Stevens–Johnsons syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These reactions are HLA-mediated immune reactions, and incidence of these adverse reactions is closely linked to specific HLA alleles.–

### Navigating complexities: vitamin D, skin pigmentation, and race [^114qBNH9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D plays a critical role in many physiological functions, including calcium metabolism and musculoskeletal health. This commentary aims to explore the intricate relationships among skin complexion, race, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels, focusing on challenges the Endocrine Society encountered during clinical practice guideline development. Given that increased melanin content reduces 25(OH)D production in the skin in response to UV light, the guideline development panel addressed the potential role for 25(OH)D screening in individuals with dark skin complexion. The panel discovered that no randomized clinical trials have directly assessed vitamin D related patient-important outcomes based on participants' skin pigmentation, although race and ethnicity often served as presumed proxies for skin pigmentation in the literature. In their deliberations, guideline panel members and selected Endocrine Society leaders underscored the critical need to distinguish between skin pigmentation as a biological variable and race and ethnicity as socially determined constructs. This differentiation is vital to maximize scientific rigor and, thus, the validity of resulting recommendations. Lessons learned from the guideline development process emphasize the necessity of clarity when incorporating race and ethnicity into clinical guidelines. Such clarity is an essential step toward improving health outcomes and ensuring equitable healthcare practices.

### Pediatric obesity-assessment, treatment, and prevention: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111xqmad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Genetic obesity syndromes — Table 3 organizes genetic causes of obesity with and without developmental delay and lists associated clinical features. Under obesity with developmental delay, Prader-Willi syndrome features hypotonia, failure to thrive in infancy followed by weight gain, short stature (due to GH deficiency), hyperphagia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, sleep disturbance, and obsessive behaviors; Albright hereditary osteodystrophy includes short stature in some but not all patients, skeletal defects, impaired olfaction, and hormone resistance if maternally inherited; SIM1 deficiency presents with hyperphagia with autonomic dysfunction, speech and language delay, and neurobehavioral abnormalities including autistic type behaviors; and BDNF/TrkB deficiency has hyperactivity, impaired concentration, limited attention span, and impaired short-term memory and pain sensation. Additional listed syndromes include Bardet-Biedl syndrome with dysmorphic extremities, retinal dystrophy or pigmentary retinopathy, hypogonadism, and renal abnormalities/impairment, and TUB deficiency with retinal dystrophy and deafness. Under obesity without developmental delay, Alström syndrome lists retinal dystrophy, extreme insulin resistance, deafness, dilated cardiomyopathy, and progressive pulmonary, hepatic, and renal dysfunction; MC4R deficiency includes hyperphagia, accelerated linear growth, disproportionate hyperinsulinemia, and low/normal blood pressure; SH2B1 deficiency includes hyperphagia, disproportionate hyperinsulinemia, early speech and language delay that often resolves, and behavioral problems including aggression; KSR2 deficiency includes mild hyperphagia, reduced basal metabolic rate, insulin resistance often with acanthosis nigricans, irregular menses, and early development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); leptin deficiency and leptin receptor deficiency each include extreme hyperphagia, frequent infections, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and mild hypothyroidism; proopiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency includes hyperphagia, cholestatic jaundice or adrenal crisis due to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency, pale skin, and red hair in whites; and PCSK1 deficiency includes small bowel enteropathy, hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, ACTH deficiency, and diabetes insipidus.

### An atypical case of familial glucocorticoid deficiency without pigmentation caused by coexistent homozygous mutations in MC2R (T152K) and MC1R (R160W) [^1164ESZ1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pigmentary skin changes are one of the most important clinical features and diagnostic clues in adrenal failure for clinicians. Here, we report a case of FGD without this clinical feature due to homozygous mutations in two unrelated genes, located on different chromosomes but belonging to the same family, the melanocortin receptors. The ligands of MC2R and MC1R are ACTH and α-MSH, respectively, both products of the same gene, POMC, which encodes a polypeptide hormone precursor that undergoes tissue-specific, posttranslational processing via cleavage by prohormone convertases. ACTH and α-MSH share the first 13 amino acids, and MC1R binds both peptides with similar affinity because of this structural similarity. Therefore, increased ACTH levels lead to hyperpigmentation in adrenal failure; in our case, skin pigmentation is absent due to a loss-of-function mutation in MC1R.

MC1R is a control point in the regulation of pigmentation; genetic variants are detected in over 80% of individuals with red hair and/or fair skin that tan poorly, but in fewer than 20% of individuals with brown or black hair. The R160W change reported in our case is one of most common changes reported in red-haired individuals and reduces the cAMP response to α-MSH. Our patient had red hair when she was born, which darkened as she got older; after treatment and normalization of ACTH levels, her hair gradually lightened.

There are no reports of adrenal failure without pigmentation caused by AAAS, DAX-1, or SF-1 mutation, but some nonpigmented, so-called "white Addison's" cases have been reported. All such cases have been recorded in Europeans with fair skin, which suggests that MC1R variants could be implicated; in many instances, diagnosis was unexpected or delayed because of the absence of pigmentation. In only one patient was a mechanism for the absence of hyperpigmentation proposed; it was attributed to generalized vitiligo, with a high degree of melanosome degradation in secondary lysosomes being reported in a skin biopsy.

Here we report the first case of coexistent MC2R and MC1R homozygous mutations resulting in an unusual case of FGD1 without hyperpigmentation. The finding of a MC1R mutation may explain the absence of hyperpigmentation in this case. Additionally, MC1R variants could explain cases of white Addison's disease and might also handicap early phenotypic recognition of adrenal failure.

### Genetics of structural hair disorders [^116cuk1S]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The identification of causative genes carries the promise of new and innovative therapeutic strategies for both inherited and acquired hair disorders. Moreover, the delineation of the relationships between similar phenotypes, resulting from mutations affecting seemingly distinct regulatory pathways, paves the way to improved diagnosis and treatment. Finally, understanding the biological processes governing HF development and maintenance may have implications for more general disease processes in the skin, such as inflammation and cancer.

### Pigmentation-related phenotypes and risk of prostate cancer [^1133uZJ5]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Strengths of our study include the prospective design and complete endpoint ascertainment. Men who dropped out of the ATBC study before the clinic visit during which hair and eye colour and skin phototype information would have been collected could not be included in the present analysis, and, as a result, we do not have data to examine the red hair–prostate cancer association in that initial post-baseline period. In addition, as the trial excluded men who were not 50–69 years of age at baseline, our study does not include prostate cancers occurring at younger ages. Natural hair colour at age 20 was self-reported, but misclassification due to recall bias seems unlikely for such a physical characteristic. The ATBC study cohort included only smokers and may not be generalisable to non-smokers; however, smoking intensity and duration were not related to hair colour or prostate cancer. Because the red hair trait was uncommon, our finding is based on a relatively small number of men (and cases) with red hair.

In conclusion, in the present study we found that men with naturally red hair experienced significantly lower prostate cancer incidence than men with other hair colours. Although the novelty of our findings warrant reexamination in other study populations, they support the idea that some pigmentation-related traits may influence the development of prostate cancer, either directly through genetic effects or regulatory mechanisms related to MC1R, another nearby gene, or other pigmentation genes or indirectly through associations with other exposures that may have an impact on risk (e.g. effects of UV-B or vitamin D status).

The location of each variant within MC 1 protein is shown in the scheme. b Percentage (%) and number (No.) of patients carrying each of the haplotypes identified (total n = 20). c Effect of BMS on proliferation of SF cell lines obtained from each of the 20 patients genotyped. Patient cells cluster into responders (n = 16, green panel) and non-responders (n = 4, yellow panel) according to the effect of BMS in the proliferation assay. For each group, the MC1R variant analysis is shown (A: consensus allele; a: variant allele; q: allele "a" frequency; %: proportion of allele "a" carriers; p: p value two-tailed Fisher's test). Moreover, superscript R: high penetrance red hair variant; superscript r: weakly associated with red hair. Quantification and images of SA-βGal staining are shown for each group (scale bars indicate 100 μm) as well as cholesterol production measured by enzyme immunoassay. Data are mean ± SE (Student's t -test vs. control, C, ✱ p < 0.05). Source data are provided as Source Data file.

This genomic analysis reveals a potential therapeutic impact of variants of the MC1R gene like D294H. Other common variants weakly associated with the red hair phenotype do not seem to impact the cellular response evoked by BMS in SF.

### Associations of hair cortisol concentrations with cardiometabolic risk factors in childhood [^112euAmd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Stress is associated with cardiometabolic disease in adults. Results from a study among 136 637 individuals showed that stress-related disorders were robustly associated with multiple types of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertensive diseases and heart failure. Similarly, a prospective cohort study, among 10 308 men and women, reported that those with chronic work stress were twice as likely to develop metabolic syndrome. It has also been suggested that long-term exposure to elevated cortisol concentrations may lead to long-term physiological alterations compromising the anatomy and function of the cardiovascular and metabolic systems. Cortisol concentrations measured in saliva, serum, and urine are subject to situational and intraindividual fluctuations. Hair cortisol concentrations reflect long-term cumulative cortisol concentrations and are therefore a useful biomarker of long-term systemic cortisol exposure, which is mainly determined by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis activity. A recent review among 11 cross-sectional studies shows positive associations of hair cortisol with adverse cardiometabolic outcomes including higher systolic blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and adiposity. In addition, hair cortisol concentrations have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of having cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease, in elderly. The associations of chronic stress with adverse cardiometabolic outcomes may originate in early life. It is well known that adverse exposures in early life are associated with cardiovascular risk factors development from childhood onward. Also, cardiometabolic risk factors tend to track from childhood into adulthood. We previously reported associations of hair cortisol concentrations with childhood body mass index (BMI) and fat mass distribution at ages 6 and 10 years. Thus far, studies in children have not reported associations between hair cortisol concentrations and cardiometabolic risk factors. These previous studies had small sample sizes and, mostly, a cross-sectional design.

We hypothesized that chronic exposure to higher cortisol concentrations is associated with an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile already in school-aged children, and thereby predispose individuals to later-life cardiovascular disease. We examined, in a population-based prospective cohort study among 2598 children, the associations of hair cortisol concentrations at age 6 years with blood pressure, heart rate, lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and C-reactive protein concentrations at ages 6 and 10 years, and explored the potential mediating role of childhood BMI.

### Genome-wide association meta-analysis of individuals of European ancestry identifies new loci explaining a substantial fraction of hair color variation and heritability [^114tTtys]. Nature Genetics (2018). Medium credibility.

Hair color is one of the most recognizable visual traits in European populations and is under strong genetic control. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of almost 300,000 participants of European descent. We identified 123 autosomal and one X-chromosome loci significantly associated with hair color; all but 13 are novel. Collectively, single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with hair color within these loci explain 34.6% of red hair, 24.8% of blond hair, and 26.1% of black hair heritability in the study populations. These results confirm the polygenic nature of complex phenotypes and improve our understanding of melanin pigment metabolism in humans.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^11546jKq]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Hairless is a corepressor of VDR expressed primarily in the brain and skin. It binds to the central region of the ligand-binding domain of VDR, as does NCoR/SMRT. The role of hairless is complex in that it represses ligand-dependent VDR functions with respect to epidermal differentiation but is required for ligand-independent VDR regulation of hair follicle cycling. In mice, VDR gene ablation elicits both rickets and hair loss, while point mutations specifically compromising either 1,25(OH) 2 D ligand or coactivator contacts in human VDR result in rickets without hair cycle disruption. On the other hand, loss-of-function mutations in human VDR results in disrupted VDR-DNA binding or VDR-RXR heterodimerization; this impaired corepressor activity on VDR-mediated transactivation, in part due to the attenuated interaction of hairless with HDACs, can result in clinical conditions, such as the rare autosomal recessive disease atrichia with papular lesions or alopecia universalis congenita. VDR interaction with its heterodimeric partner RXR is probably pivotal to hair cycling, as the conditional inactivation of RXRα in mouse skin results in alopecia resembling that in VDR -null mice. Similar to mutations in the VDR -encoding gene, mutations in the mammalian hairless gene result in congenital hair loss both in mice and humans. Remarkably, the hair loss phenotype caused by the mutated human VDR gene resembles the generalized atrichia caused by mutations in the hairless gene.

In summary, new insights into the regulation of vitamin D–related enzymes and the differential mechanism of action of VDR have demonstrated important links between metabolic disorders and vitamin D metabolism. A better understanding of how the VDR interacts with other transcription factors in a cell-specific fashion will provide a greater understanding of how the same molecule can have such different actions in many physiologic processes. In turn, more insights may lead to more nuanced and/or specific uses of vitamin D and its metabolites in clinical situations, as discussed next.

### The basic science of hair biology: what are the causal mechanisms for the disordered hair follicle? [^117WdcqF]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

A hair disorder can be difficult to define, but patients are typically motivated to seek treatment when their hair growth patterns are significantly different from their cultural group or when growth patterns change significantly. The causes of hair disorders are many and varied, but fundamentally the disorder is a consequence of aberrant alterations of normal hair biology. The potential trigger factors for hair disorders can be attributed to inflammation, genetics, the environment, or hormones, of which the relative contributions vary for different diagnoses, between individuals, and over time. This article discusses the causal mechanisms for the disordered hair follicle.

### The multifaceted role of hair as a biospecimen: recent advances in precision medicine and forensic science [^116tr7wY]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Challenges and limitations

Over the past decade, hair analysis has become valuable in diagnostics, therapeutics and forensic toxicology. While urine and blood are reliable for acute exposures, hair captures long-term substance exposure, offering insights over extended periods. However, hair analysis presents several methodological and interpretive challenges that limit its consistency and reliability across clinical and forensic settings. Hair shafts are susceptible to external contamination from environmental pollutants, drugs, smoke and personal care products, which can adsorb to or infiltrate the hair shaft, confounding the distinction between endogenous and exogenous substances. Decontamination procedures, such as sequential solvent washes, are necessary but not standardized and may either fail to fully remove contaminants or strip endogenous compounds. Interindividual variability in hair growth rate, pigmentation and cosmetic treatments further complicates analysis and interpretation. Sampling inconsistencies — including anatomical collection site, hair length, orientation and storage — add to the variability in results across studies and laboratories. Additionally, ultraviolet exposure can degrade melanin, affecting analyte binding and diffusion. In forensic cases, the lack of hair roots precludes nuclear DNA analysis, requiring reliance on less discriminatory mitochondrial DNA or protein-based approaches, which also suffer from a lack of standardization.

Despite its value as a noninvasive and longitudinal matrix, hair analysis has several inherent limitations that restrict its clinical and diagnostic applicability. It is less effective for detecting recent or sporadic exposures due to a 1–2 week incorporation lag. Hair lacks temporal precision, making it more suitable for retrospective exposure profiling rather than real-time monitoring. Biomarker concentrations in hair are typically lower than in other biological matrices, necessitating the use of highly sensitive and often costly analytical techniques such as LC−MS/MS, which may not be accessible in all settings. Additionally, hair biospecimens yield low and variable amounts of DNA or RNA, limiting their utility in genomics and transcriptomics. In neurodegenerative diseases and other systemic conditions, hair may primarily reflect peripheral changes, reducing its diagnostic specificity. The absence of widely accepted interpretive thresholds, clinical validation and regulatory standards further limits its integration into routine medical or public health practice.

### Germline MC1R status influences somatic mutation burden in melanoma [^113ztaMa]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

The major genetic determinants of cutaneous melanoma risk in the general population are disruptive variants (R alleles) in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. These alleles are also linked to red hair, freckling, and sun sensitivity, all of which are known melanoma phenotypic risk factors. Here we report that in melanomas and for somatic C > T mutations, a signature linked to sun exposure, the expected single-nucleotide variant count associated with the presence of an R allele is estimated to be 42% (95% CI, 15–76%) higher than that among persons without an R allele. This figure is comparable to the expected mutational burden associated with an additional 21 years of age. We also find significant and similar enrichment of non-C > T mutation classes supporting a role for additional mutagenic processes in melanoma development in individuals carrying R alleles.

### Vexed by red-headed conundrums [^115gVTgb]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Reduced function alleles of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) lead to red hair, freckling, and sun sensitivity. They are also associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. But what pathways link gene variants with the cancer phenotype? In this issue, Robinson et al. describe their use of mouse transgenics to demonstrate that the MC1R signaling pathway influences cancer risk via mechanisms in addition to pigmentation.

### Pharmacological characterization of loss of function mutations of the human melanocortin 1 receptor that are associated with red hair [^115Z2Lt8]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Variation in skin color is the major host risk factor for melanoma and other forms of skin cancer. Individuals with red hair show an increased ratio of phaeomelanin to eumelanin in both hair and skin. This ratio is regulated by the melanocortin (MC) 1 receptor. There are several common point mutations in the human MC1 receptor that are overrepresented in North European red-heads, and in individuals with pale skin. In order to determine the functional significance of these mutations, we expressed the Asp84Glu, Val92Met, Arg163Gln, and Asp294His variants of the human MC1 receptors in eukaryotic cells and determined their ability to bind alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) peptides and increase intracellular cAMP. The mutants Asp84Glu and Asp294His showed a much lower response to alpha-MSH in cAMP and a slightly impaired ability to bind alpha-MSH, and the Val92Met mutant bound alpha-MSH with 100-fold lower affinity as compared with the wild-type. The Arg163Gln variant, widely found in some Asian populations, reached normal level of cAMP response but had just slightly lower potency for alpha-MSH in binding and second messenger studies. The results provide important pharmacological characterization of common MC1 receptor variants in various world populations.

### Genome-wide study of hair colour in UK biobank explains most of the SNP heritability [^1126UiWU]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Natural hair colour within European populations is a complex genetic trait. Previous work has established that MC1R variants are the principal genetic cause of red hair colour, but with variable penetrance. Here, we have extensively mapped the genes responsible for hair colour in the white, British ancestry, participants in UK Biobank. MC1R only explains 73% of the SNP heritability for red hair in UK Biobank, and in fact most individuals with two MC1R variants have blonde or light brown hair. We identify other genes contributing to red hair, the combined effect of which accounts for ~90% of the SNP heritability. Blonde hair is associated with over 200 genetic variants and we find a continuum from black through dark and light brown to blonde and account for 73% of the SNP heritability of blonde hair. Many of the associated genes are involved in hair growth or texture, emphasising the cellular connections between keratinocytes and melanocytes in the determination of hair colour.

### Identification of gene variants associated with melanocyte stem cell differentiation in mice predisposed for hair graying [^1155Nc8U]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

In humans, the visible phenotype of graying scalp hair is associated primarily with aging and varies among people of different ethnic or ancestral geographic origin. In people 45–65 years of age, the intensity (percent per individual) and frequency (percent of individuals) of gray hair ranges from 15 to 42% and 43–93%, respectively. The fact that these differences are associated with ancestry, or genetic background, suggest that hair graying is, in part, a genetic trait. The quantitative nature of hair graying further suggests that this trait is influenced by the combination of effects at multiple genetic loci. Gray hair is easy to dismiss as a purely cosmetic phenotype, however, research into the molecular etiology of this phenotype has contributed to our basic understanding of stem cell biology, tissue regeneration and homeostasis, melanocyte-related diseases like vitiligo and melanoma, and the role of stem cells in aging phenotypes. Accordingly, we are interested in identifying the genetic modifications that contribute to hair graying variation in the hopes of discovering novel genes that participate in these processes.

### An update on new and existing treatments for the management of melasma [^111cU5Nb]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The shift in eumelanin to pheomelanin synthesis induced by cysteamine may pose a theoretical risk of melanoma-genesis. An increase in pheomelanin has been demonstrated to increase the rate of melanoma-genesis in mice induced to carry a high pheomelanin-to-eumelanin ratio, a change intended to mimic individuals with a red hair/fair skin phenotype. However, reassuringly, no studies have been identified that suggest an increased risk of melanoma in humans using cysteamine.

Although cysteamine may be inferior in efficacy to hydroquinone, it can be a well-tolerated, effective alternative for mild-moderate melasma.

Tranexamic Acid: Topical and Intradermal Formulations

TXA is a lysine amino acid derivative that targets melasma through reversible inhibition of plasminogen to plasmin conversion. UV exposure activates the plasmin-keratinocyte-plasminogen activator system, from which plasmin increases intracellular release of arachidonic acid and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, resulting in melanogenesis. New research has found an association between melasma and solar elastosis, an increase in mast cells and vascularisation in melasma lesions, and suggests that melasma carries a photoaging component. TXA also targets melasma by decreasing mast cells and angiogenesis.

Topical TXA has been trialled in formulations including gel, liposome, cream, and solution-based mediums of 2–10% concentrations, with varying efficacy. A double-blind, split-face trial found 3% topical TXA has comparable efficacy with 3% hydroquinone + 0.01% dexamethasone, with fewer adverse effects. In a prospective, single-arm study, topical 3% TXA demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in combination with 5% niacinamide and 1% kojic acid. However, a randomised vehicle-controlled trial of 21 women with melasma found 5% TXA to show no difference in MASI or melanin index to its vehicle.

### Understanding the evolution of human pigmentation: recent contributions from population genetics [^117J4526]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Variation in human skin and hair color is one of the most striking aspects of human variability, and explaining this diversity is one of the central questions of human biology. Only in the last decade or so has it been realistically possible to address this question experimentally using population genetic approaches. On the basis of earlier studies in mice, and on studies in humans with various Mendelian disorders, many of the genes underpinning population variation in skin color have been identified. More recently, genome-wide approaches have identified other loci that appear to contribute to pigmentary variation. The ability to study sequence diversity from world populations has allowed examination of whether the observed variability is due to random genetic drift or is a result of natural selection. The genetic evidence taken as a whole provides strong evidence for natural selection, functioning so as to increase pigment diversity across the world's populations. Future larger studies are likely to provide more details of this process and may provide evidence for exactly which mechanistic pathways have mediated selection.

### Women with red hair report a slightly increased rate of bruising but have normal coagulation tests [^112H5pgU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

There is an anecdotal impression that redheads experience more perioperative bleeding complications than do people with other hair colors. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that perceived problems with hemostasis could be detected with commonly used coagulation tests. We studied healthy female Caucasian volunteers, 18 to 40 yr of age, comparable in terms of height, weight, and age, with natural bright red (n = 25) or black or dark brown (n = 26) hair. Volunteers were questioned about their bleeding history and the following tests were performed: complete blood count, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, platelet function analysis, and platelet aggregation using standard turbidimetric methodology. Agonists for aggregation were adenosine diphosphate, arachidonic acid, collagen, epinephrine, and two concentrations of ristocetin. The red-haired volunteers reported significantly more bruising, but there were no significant differences between the red-haired and dark-haired groups in hemoglobin concentration, platelet numbers, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, or activated partial thromboplastin time. Furthermore, no significant differences in platelet function, as measured by platelet function analysis or platelet aggregometry, were observed. We conclude that if redheads have hemostasis abnormalities, they are subtle.

### The melanoma-linked "redhead" MC1R influences dopaminergic neuron survival [^115ASTQ1]. Annals of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Individuals with Parkinson disease are more likely to develop melanoma, and melanoma patients are reciprocally at higher risk of developing Parkinson disease. Melanoma is strongly tied to red hair/fair skin, a phenotype of loss-of-function polymorphisms in the MC1R (melanocortin 1 receptor) gene. Loss-of-function variants of MC1R have also been linked to increased risk of Parkinson disease. The present study is to investigate the role of MC1R in dopaminergic neurons in vivo.

Methods

Genetic and pharmacological approaches were employed to manipulate MC1R, and nigrostriatal dopaminergic integrity was determined by comprehensive behavioral, neurochemical, and neuropathological measures.

Results

MC1R e/e mice, which carry an inactivating mutation of MC1R and mimic the human redhead phenotype, have compromised nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal integrity, and they are more susceptible to dopaminergic neuron toxins 6-hydroxydopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Furthermore, a selective MC1R agonist protects against MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity.

Interpretation

Our findings reveal a protective role of MC1R in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, and they provide a rationale for MC1R as a potential therapeutic target for Parkinson disease. Together with its established role in melanoma, MC1R may represent a common pathogenic pathway for melanoma and Parkinson disease. Ann Neurol 2017;81:395–406.

### Detangling red hair from pain: phenotype-specific contributions from different genetic variants in melanocortin-1 receptor [^117Rwpek]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Genetic variation in melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) has a known role in red hair. Studies on responses to noxious stimuli in red-haired individuals have also been conducted, with mixed findings. To investigate a possible divergence between variants responsible for red hair and pain sensitivity, we performed a genewide association analysis in the Orofacial Pain: Prospective Evaluation and Risk Assessment cohort. All genotyped (17) MC1R variants were tested for association with heat pain temporal summation and sensitivity. Our analyses showed an association for pain sensitivity with the 5'-UTR, tagged by rs3212361, and 1 missense variant, rs885479 (R163Q), previously shown to be weakly associated with red hair. For both variants, the minor allele was protective. These results were validated in the 500,000-person UK Biobank cohort, where the minor alleles of rs3212361 and rs885479 were associated with a reduced count of persistent pain conditions as well as individual pain conditions. Haplotype association analysis revealed a possible joint effect from the 2 individual variants. The 5'-UTR variant rs3212361 was further identified as an expression quantitative trait locus, associated with reduced transcript levels of MC1R in the brain and in the peripheral tibial nerve. Hair colour association analysis of the loss-of-function 5'-UTR rs3212361 allele identified association with red hair, and red hair colour itself was associated with a reduced count of persistent pain conditions. Together, our results suggest that primarily different mechanisms-affecting expression levels vs protein activity-mediated by different genetic variants in the MC1R locus contribute to red hair and pain.

### A review of vitamin B12 in dermatology [^1128KHBH]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that is important in the hematological and nervous systems, and it has a complex relationship with the skin. Altered cobalamin levels can lead to dermatological manifestations, which may indicate a deficiency or excess of this vitamin. The biochemistry and metabolism of cobalamin is complex, and diseases can be associated with alterations of this metabolic pathway. The cutaneous manifestations of cobalamin deficiency include hyperpigmentation (most commonly); hair and nail changes; and oral changes, including glossitis. Additionally, several dermatologic conditions, including vitiligo, aphthous stomatitis, atopic dermatitis, and acne are related to cobalamin excess or deficiency. The cutaneous complications of cobalamin therapy include acne, rosacea, and allergic site reactions, or anaphylaxis with cobalamin injections. As cobalt is a component of cobalamin, patients with cobalt sensitivity have been reported to have cutaneous manifestations when receiving cobalamin replacement therapy.

### Pigmentation-related phenotypes and risk of prostate cancer [^11144Rob]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large cohort, men with naturally red hair experienced approximately half the risk of prostate cancer compared with men with light brown hair. Eye colour and skin phototype were not associated with risk.

The melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene is among several loci regulating pigmentation in humans, and the first to be identified. Over 80 allelic variants in the gene have been reported, which are associated with red hair, fair skin, increased susceptibility to epidermal injury from exposure to UV radiation, and higher risks of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. The MC1R protein determines the relative synthesis and secretion by melanocytes of black/brown eumelanin and red/yellow pheomelanin, with many allelic variants expressing a red hair trait. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified other genetic variants associated with hair colour, eye colour, and skin pigmentation in European populations and have associated MC1R with risk of cutaneous melanoma, but not with prostate cancer or other cancers.

Endocrine Practice (2013). Medium credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin D requirements, AACE/ACE/OS 2013 guidelines recommend to advise older adults, individuals with increased skin pigmentation, or those exposed to insufficient sunlight to increase their vitamin D intake from vitamin D-fortified foods and/or supplements to at least 800–1,000 IU/day.

### How to diagnose hair loss [^113pwuv6]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

This review presents a systematic approach to the diagnosis of hair loss. An accurate diagnosis is based on history, clinical examination, laboratory tests, and scalp biopsy. Whether the hair loss is a cicatricial or noncicatricial alopecia guides one's history taking. After assessing the patient's global appearance, the hair and scalp are evaluated, aided by a hair pull, hair tug, Hair Card, and hair mount. Scalp biopsies can confirm a diagnosis and are essential in all cases of cicatricial alopecia. In all patients with hair loss a complete blood count, ferritin, thyroid stimulating hormone, and vitamin D 25OH should be ordered.

### Lipids to the top of hair biology [^111T3mze]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Little attention has been given to the impact of lipid metabolism on hair follicle biology and pathology. Three recent papers (one in the current issue) describe a major effect of altered lipid metabolism on hair growth. A direct link was made to at least one form of cicatricial alopecia, but the role lipids play in other follicular pathologies, such as the acneiform conditions, are inadequately explored and must be tested.

### Nutritional factors and hair loss [^114wGBTH]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

The literature reveals what little is known about nutritional factors and hair loss. What we do know emanates from studies in protein-energy malnutrition, starvation, and eating disorders. In otherwise healthy individuals, nutritional factors appear to play a role in subjects with persistent increased hair shedding. Hård, 40 years ago, demonstrated the importance of iron supplements in nonanaemic, iron-deficient women with hair loss. Serum ferritin concentrations provide a good assessment of an individual's iron status. Rushton et al. first published data showing that serum ferritin concentrations were a factor in female hair loss and, 10 years later, Kantor et al. confirmed this association. What level of serum ferritin to employ in subjects with increased hair shedding is yet to be definitively established but 70 micro g/L, with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (< 10 mm/h), is recommended. The role of the essential amino acid, l-lysine in hair loss also appears to be important. Double-blind data confirmed the findings of an open study in women with increased hair shedding, where a significant proportion responded to l-lysine and iron therapy. There is no evidence to support the popular view that low serum zinc concentrations cause hair loss. Excessive intakes of nutritional supplements may actually cause hair loss and are not recommended in the absence of a proven deficiency. While nutritional factors affect the hair directly, one should not forget that they also affect the skin. In the management of subjects with hair loss, eliminating scaling problems is important as is good hair care advice and the need to explain fully the hair cycle. Many individuals reduced their shampooing frequency due to fear of losing more hair but this increases the amount seen in subsequent shampoos fuelling their fear of going bald and adversely affecting their quality of life.

### Oxalate nephropathy associated with glyoxylate-containing hair-straightening products: a call for caution [^111gXgUV]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent reports have described acute kidney injury in otherwise healthy individuals after exposure to hair-straightening products. In this issue, Robert et al. help elucidate the underlying mechanisms in a murine model that replicates the human pathology. Cutaneous absorption of glyoxylic acid from hair-straightening products and its subsequent conversion to oxalate are identified as crucial steps in the development of oxalate nephropathy. This newly described "skin-kidney" axis expands our understanding of oxalate metabolism, calls for additional studies to explore susceptibility to acute kidney injury following cutaneous glyoxylate exposure, and warrants vigilance around the use of these products.

### Pigmentation-related phenotypes and risk of prostate cancer [^117NqJmJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Melanocortin-1-receptor may also influence cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA damage and repair in melanocytes and keratinocytes; however, whether such functions are expressed by MC1R in other cells is unknown. In addition, MC1R, along with α -MSH, which has anti-inflammatory properties and both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive effects, may have a role in inflammation and may consequently influence cancer development.

The wild-type allele of the MC1R variant Arg160Trp has been associated with increased prostate cancer risk in a case–control study, and the authors speculated that this variant may mediate the UV/sunlight–prostate cancer association. Others have also hypothesised that the association between geographic latitude, sun exposure, and prostate cancer risk is through a vitamin D mechanism; however, prospective studies of circulating 25(OH)D and prostate cancer have generally been null, with some studies, including our own, suggesting an adverse association for higher vitamin D status. Although 25(OH)D concentrations in our study did not differ by hair colour, they were lower among individuals with red hair in another study and postulated to reflect avoidance of sun exposure. Whether the lower prostate cancer risk in men with red hair relates to vitamin D, some aspect of melanogenesis, or another mechanism is unclear and will require investigation. A genetic association between hair colour or pigmentation-related traits and family history of prostate cancer can also be studied. Although skin phototype appeared associated with hair colour, mutual adjustment for these factors and eye colour did not influence the hazard estimates. Why only hair colour, but not eye colour or skin phototype, was associated with prostate cancer risk is unclear.

### Measurement of melanin metabolism in live cells by [U-C]-L-tyrosine fate tracing using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry [^1114zN1i]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Melanin synthesis occurs within a specialized organelle called the melanosome. Traditional methods for measuring melanin levels rely on the detection of chemical degradation products of melanin by high-performance liquid chromatography. Although these methods are robust, they are unable to distinguish between melanin synthesis and degradation and are best suited to measure melanin changes over long periods of time. We developed a method that actively measures both eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesis by fate tracing [U- 13 C] L-tyrosine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Using this method, we confirmed the previous reports of the differences in melanin synthesis between melanocytes derived from individuals with different skin colors and MC1R genotype and uncovered new information regarding the differential de novo synthesis of eumelanin and pheomelanin, also called mixed melanogenesis. We also revealed that distinct mechanisms that alter melanosomal pH differentially induce new eumelanin and pheomelanin synthesis. Finally, we revealed that the synthesis of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, an important metabolite of L-tyrosine, is differentially controlled by multiple factors. Because L-tyrosine fate tracing is compatible with untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry‒based metabolomics, this approach enables the broad measurement of cellular metabolism in combination with melanin metabolism, and we anticipate that this approach will shed new light on multiple mechanisms of melanogenesis.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1176GTJo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D screening with a 25(OH)D test for adults with dark complexion — background: "Dark complexion" is defined by a phenotype that involves dark color of eyes, hair, and skin, and the panel was especially interested in skin pigmentation determined by the amount of melanin that can interfere with the production of vitamin D in response to exposure to UV-B rays. People at higher risk of low vitamin D status include individuals with dark skin, generally those whose ancestors originated from sunnier regions of the planet, including those with African heritage and descendants of indigenous peoples of the Americas, Oceania, and Asia. Some but not all studies suggest that the increase in 25(OH)D levels in response to vitamin D supplementation is not as robust in those with dark complexion compared to those with lighter complexion, but many such studies assess groups according to race/ethnicity rather than skin complexion, introducing uncertainty regarding the degree to which dark complexion per se impacts circulating 25(OH)D concentrations.

### Pigmentation-related phenotypes and risk of prostate cancer [^113p5GUW]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Background:

Solar ultraviolet radiation exposure has been inversely related to prostate cancer incidence and mortality, possibly mediated through vitamin D status. Pigmentation-related traits influence endogenous vitamin D synthesis and may alter risk of prostate cancer.

Methods:

We examined prostate cancer in relation to hair and eye colour, and skin phototype in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort. Incident cancer was diagnosed in 1982 out of 20 863 men. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from Cox proportional hazards models.

Results:

Prostate cancer risk did not differ by eye colour or skin phototype. Men with naturally red hair were significantly less likely to develop prostate cancer (HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.24–0.89) than men with light brown hair (reference).

Conclusion:

The red hair phenotype, which results from polymorphisms in the melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R) gene, is associated with lower risk of prostate cancer. This pigmentation-related trait may influence prostate cancer development either directly, through genetic effects or regulatory mechanisms related to MC1R, another nearby gene, or other pigmentation genes, or indirectly, through associations with other exposures such as sunlight or vitamin D status.

### The meaning of adaptation in aging: insights from cellular senescence, epigenetic clocks and stem cell alterations [^112WWXQ8]. Nature Aging (2023). High credibility.

In addition to their role during tissue homeostasis, stem cells are extremely important during tissue injury, even to the extent that depletion of some types of stem cells has no effect on homeostasis, but impedes regeneration. Skin stem cells, residing in hair follicles and in the basal layer of the epidermis, are mobilized out of their niches during wound healing in order to support re-epithelialization, among others. It has been observed that in the aged skin, stem cells residing within hair follicles migrate to the epidermis, which has been causally linked to age-related hair loss. As age-related changes of skin include an increase in inflammation and degradation of the ECM, conditions that are highly resemblant of skin wounding, it is possible that aged skin bears phenotypic resemblance to wounded skin. Thus, the age-related changes in skin stem cells could be potentially attributed to their adaptations to the wound-like conditions of the aged skin.

Another example is the bone marrow providing a niche for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These stem cells are responsible for the generation of new blood cells, both the red blood cells like erythrocytes originating in the process called "myelopoiesis" and the white blood cells like lymphocytes originating in the process of "lymphopoiesis". While the processes of myelopoiesis and lymphopoieses are balanced during homeostasis, certain physiological conditions can shift the balance towards the preference of one process over the other that skews the differentiation profile of HSCs. Such conditions include blood loss/hemorrhage when HSCs are stimulated to skew the differentiation profile with a concomitant increase in the generation of erythrocytes over lymphocytes. In a surprising similarity, the aging process of the HSC compartment is well-known to result in the skewing of the differentiation process to generate fewer lymphoid and more myeloid progeny. Knowing that the process of aging is associated with a general decline in the fitness and oxygen carrying capacity of erythrocytes –, it is possible that the commitment of HSCs towards myeloid differentiation is an adaptation compensating for the decrease in the functionality of erythrocytes in the aging body.

### Endocannabinoid and N-acylethanolamine concentrations in hair of female patients with posttraumatic stress disorder-associations with clinical symptoms and outcomes following multimodal trauma-focused inpatient treatment [^114pSH3H]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering the comparatively high burden of our sample and the chronic nature of the PTSD symptoms as evident in an average PCL-5 score above 55 at pre-treatment and patients endorsing on average 7 lifetime traumatic events, our findings indicate that more cumulative trauma and greater PTSD- distinct symptom severity and the associated chronic stressful state may be associated with elevated long-term integrated hair AEA and NAE levels. Variation in ECS alterations in PTSD over time and with traumatic experiences may partly explain the heterogeneity in the literature. A recent study conducting metabolomics, proteomics, and DNA methylome assay in recent-onset and chronic PTSD cohorts identified distinct signaling and metabolic pathway activity, suggesting an initial compensatory response in the acute phase which changes with chronicity. Also, a recent investigation demonstrated that individuals who developed high and severe comorbid PTSD and depressive symptoms had elevated plasma AEA levels shortly after trauma which were not reduced after 6 months. A previous study has linked lower hair NAE levels greater lifetime trauma and PTSD symptoms in individuals with a high trauma load between 17 and 36 experienced traumatic events. In contrast, the positive associations between hair AEA and PTSD- distinct symptoms and hair NAEs and trauma exposure in our chronic PTSD sample - with on average 7 traumatic events - suggest that the relationship between hair ECs/NAEs and traumatic stressors and PTSD- distinct symptoms may shift with cumulative trauma exposure. This may fit with the building block effect's postulated long-term reduction in cortisol following trauma.

### Cortisol in hair and the metabolic syndrome [^114diGnD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Although exposure to supraphysiological levels of glucocorticoids is known to contribute to the development of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), the importance of physiological variation in basal cortisol secretion is less clear. This issue can be addressed by using hair cortisol analysis, which for the first time allows the assessment of long-term integrated hormone levels.

Objective and Design

We used the analysis of cortisol in hair (hairF) to examine associations of long-term cortisol levels with prevalence of MetS and individual cardiometabolic parameters in a large occupational cohort. In additional exploratory analyses, we also studied cardiometabolic associations with hair cortisone levels.

Participants

Participants included 1258 employees of a large aerospace company (aged 16–64 years; 84.8% males) who partook in a voluntary health assessment.

Main Outcome Measures

The first 3 cm of scalp-near hair were analyzed for glucocorticoid concentrations using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Relevant cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed and MetS was diagnosed (according to 2009 international task force criteria).

Results

A higher prevalence of MetS was seen in individuals falling into the third (odds ratio 1.71, 95% confidence interval 1.08–2.69) or fourth hairF quartile (odds ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.55–3.75) compared with the first quartile, in fully adjusted analyses. HairF also showed positive associations with weight-related anthropometric measures (body mass index, waist to hip ratio, waist circumference) and glycated hemoglobin. The exploratory analysis of hair cortisone also indicated relevant associations with cardiometabolic parameters.

Conclusion

Normal physiological differences in long-term cortisol secretion, as assessed in hair, show relevant relationships with MetS and individual cardiometabolic parameters.

### Genome-wide study of hair colour in UK biobank explains most of the SNP heritability [^1115aPza]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Natural hair colour within European populations is strikingly variable and is a complex genetic trait that is impacted relatively little by known, non-genetic, factors. Furthermore, hair colour is largely determined by only a few well-characterised cell types: the melanocytes where the melanin pigment is made, the keratinocytes of the hair to which the pigment is transferred and fibroblasts of the dermal papilla, which signal to and regulate the melanocytes. It is thus an excellent model system to explore genetic and cellular interactions in development and homoeostasis. Hair colour variation is partially correlated with skin and eye colour variation, reflecting differences in cellular interaction in different tissues.

Several studies have examined the genetic basis of hair colour variation. Red hair is well established as being associated with coding variation in the MC1R gene. Less well known is the observation that most of these variants are only partially penetrant, and some of them have very low penetrance indeed. Other genetic factors must be interacting with MC1R to modify the penetrance of these variants. MC1R is a G-protein-coupled receptor, expressed on the surface of skin and hair melanocytes. Binding of the MC1R cognate ligand, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH), induces a melanogenic cascade resulting in the production of dark eumelanin. This is packaged into vesicles, termed melanosomes, for transport to epidermal keratinocytes where it provides protection against ultraviolet radiation. The cellular trafficking of melanosomes to keratinocytes in the hair follicle additionally gives colour to the growing hair. Loss of MC1R signalling in many vertebrate species results in the inability of the melanocytes to produce eumelanin that instead default to synthesising phaeomelanin, a red or yellow pigment. MC1R has a second ligand, an inverse agonist, agouti signalling protein (ASIP). Overexpression of ASIP, in mice for example, leads to synthesis of only yellow phaeomelanin, even in the presence of a functional MC1R and α-MSH. Previous studies have defined a role for ASIP in red hair in humans, but its molecular basis is largely unknown.

### New insight into the pathophysiology of hair loss trigger a paradigm shift in the treatment approach [^114BAU1m]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hair loss affects millions of men and women of all ages and ethnicities, impacting appearance, social interactions, and psycho-emotional well-being. Although a number of options are available, they are limited, carry a potential risk of side effects, and none have proven to be comprehensive for treatment of hair loss. Across the spectrum of hair loss disorders, there has long been a segmentation into distinct mechanisms, driving the main trend in current therapeutics to focus on targeting single molecules or pathways. However, research points to similar dysregulation of intrinsic signaling pathways within follicle physiology that span the hair loss disorder spectrum - with a common inflammatory component identified in most hair loss pathogenesis, including that of androgenetic alopecia (AGA). <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(11 Suppl):s135–140. </em>.

Low energy availability (LEA) and REDs — LEA is when total energy consumed may be less than energy required for basal metabolism after accounting for activity; LEA can suppress normal reproductive hormone cycling, cause menstrual dysfunction, and diminish bone mineral density (BMD), with the concurrence of these three factors referred to as the female athlete triad; other LEA-associated issues include altered bone microarchitecture and diminished bone strength, increased risk of bone stress injuries, and altered cardiovascular risk factors, and when energy intake does not match expenditure this multisystem condition is termed relative energy deficiency in sport (REDs), which may impact sports performance.

### MC1R mutations modify the classic phenotype of oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) [^112D8fc8]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

The heterogeneous group of disorders known as oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) shares cutaneous and ocular hypopigmentation associated with common developmental abnormalities of the eye. Mutations of at least 11 loci produce this phenotype. The majority of affected individuals develop some cutaneous melanin; this is predominantly seen as yellow/blond hair, whereas fewer have brown hair. The OCA phenotype is dependent on the constitutional pigmentation background of the family, with more OCA pigmentation found in families with darker constitutional pigmentation, which indicates that other genes may modify the OCA phenotype. Sequence variation in the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene is associated with red hair in the normal population, but red hair is unusual in OCA. We identified eight probands with OCA who had red hair at birth. Mutations in the P gene were responsible for classic phenotype of oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) in all eight, and mutations in the MC1R gene were responsible for the red (rather than yellow/blond) hair in the six of eight who continued to have red hair after birth. This is the first demonstration of a gene modifying the OCA phenotype in humans.

### Pigmentation-related phenotypes and risk of prostate cancer [^1145HH5o]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Only 188 men (0.9%), including 9 who developed prostate cancer, reported their natural hair colour as red, whereas 12%, 40%, 35%, and 12% reported it being blonde, light brown, dark brown, or black/almost black, respectively. Men with red hair were more educated, more likely to use vitamin D or calcium supplements, and more likely to report that their skin burns easily and does not tan upon prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, compared with men of other hair colour (Table 1). Serum vitamin D did not differ by hair colour.

Men with red hair had a significantly lower prostate cancer risk compared with men with light brown hair, the most common hair colour in the cohort (HR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.24–0.89, Table 2). The risk for red hair compared with all other hair colours combined was similar (multivariate HR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.25–0.92). There was no evidence of confounding. We were unable to examine the association in subgroups defined by disease stage, the trial vitamin supplementation, vitamin D status, or other potential effect modifiers because of the small number of prostate cancer cases with red hair. Risk did not differ by eye colour or skin phototype, although lower risk was suggested for men with brown eyes.

### Model-based prediction of human hair color using DNA variants [^112SmWo8]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Fig. 2
ROC curves for the final model including 13 DNA predictors for 4 (a) and 7 (b) hair color categories in a Polish sample

We noticed that the prediction accuracies for the blond and brown colors were somewhat lower than those for black and red colors. One reason for this difference may be in the environmental rather than genetic contribution to hair color variation. Hair color changes in some individuals during adolescence and such change is most often from blond to brown (Rees). Since in our study we used adult individuals, those volunteers who had experienced such specific hair color change when being younger were grouped most likely in the brown hair category, although they may have blond associated genotypes. Consequently, these individuals would have lowered the prediction accuracy for brown relative to the brown-haired individuals who have not changed from blond. Our study design did not allow recording age-dependent hair color change, but this factor may be considered and tested in future studies. Although, volunteers in the red hair color group of our study was significantly younger at time of sampling than people in any other hair color category groups (P < 0.01), including age in the prediction modeling had only very little impact on the accuracy (AUC change < 0.01). The age difference is most likely due to our targeted sampling procedure in which the red hair color category was over-sampled in young individuals (see material section for further details). In this study, gender was not significantly associated with any hair color and had no significant impact on hair color prediction accuracy.

### Model-based prediction of human hair color using DNA variants [^1151zohp]. Human Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Results and discussion

First, we tested the genotyped SNPs for hair color association in our study sample. Although variation in MC1R is usually attributed to red hair color (Branicki et al; Grimes et al; Valverde et al.), the compound variant MC1R-R in our study was significantly associated with all but one (auburn) hair color category, albeit its association was strongest with red hair (allelic OR: 12.6; 95% CI: [7.0–22.7]; P = 2.5×10 −17; Table 1). The lack of association of the MC1R-R variant with auburn hair color may be caused by the small sample size of the auburn category and/or problems with correct classification of this hair color as reported elsewhere (Mengel-From et al.). Furthermore, MC1R-R showed a clear recessive effect and a compound-heterozygote effect in that the R/R genotype carriers were much more likely to have red hair (genotypic OR: 262.2; 95% CI: [65.2–1,055.3]; P = 4.5 × 10 −15) than the wt/R carriers (genotypic OR: 5.6; 95% CI: [2.5–12.6]; P = 4.0 × 10 −5; Supplementary Table S2). The stronger association of MC1R SNPs with red hair than with non-red hair colors as observed here was also found previously (Han et al; Sulem et al.). The SNP rs12913832 in the HERC2 gene was significantly associated with all hair color categories, most significantly with brown (allelic OR for T vs. C: 3.5; 95% CI: [2.0–6.1]; P = 1.3 × 10 −5) and black (allelic OR: 3.3; 95% CI: [2.0–5.6]; P = 4.3 × 10 −6; Table 1) hair. The T allele of rs12913832 showed a dominant effect on darker hair color in that the heterozygote carriers had a further increased OR of black hair (genotypic OR: 8.6; 95% CI: [3.9–18.9]; P = 7.2 × 10 −8; Supplementary Table S2). This SNP was associated with total hair melanin in a recent study (Valenzuela et al.). A previous study found HERC2 SNPs significantly associated with non-red, but not with red, hair colors (Sulem et al.), and another one reported HERC2 association only with dark hair color (Mengel-From et al.). However, an additional study found HERC2 association with all hair colors, albeit reported stronger association with non-red hair colors than with red hair (Han et al.), in agreement with our findings. Additional SNPs in MC1R and HERC2 were also significantly associated with several hair colors (Table 1). Except for MC1R and HERC2 genes, no significant evidence of a dominant or a recessive effects on hair color was found for any other gene studied (Supplementary Table S2). SNPs in SLC45A2 (rs28777 allelic OR for C vs. G: 7.05; 95% CI: [2.2–22.3]; P = 0.001), IRF4 (rs12203592 allelic OR for T vs. C: 7.05; 95% CI: [2.2–22.3]; P = 0.01), and EXOC2 (rs4959270 allelic OR for A vs. C: 0.56; 95% CI: [0.35–0.91]; P = 0.02) were most significantly associated with black hair color (Table 1), in line with the previous reports (Han et al; Mengel-From et al.). Further, an association of SLC45A2 with total hair melanin was reported (Valenzuela et al.). SNPs in the ASIP gene were associated with red (rs2378249, P = 0.02), dark blond (rs2378249, P = 0.02), and blond-red (rs1015362, P = 0.04; Table 1). Significant ASIP association with red hair was reported previously (Sulem et al.), as well as with total hair melanin (Valenzuela et al.). The OCA2 gene was most significantly associated with brown hair color (rs4778138, P = 0.03), confirming previous findings of OCA2 involvement in hair color variation (Han et al; Mengel-From et al; Valenzuela et al.), although one previous GWAS did not find significant evidence (Sulem et al.). The TYR gene was significantly associated with brown (rs1393350, P = 0.02) and the SLC24A4 gene with blond (rs4904868, P = 0.04) and dark blond (rs2402130, P = 0.03). These results are largely consistent with previous findings (Sulem et al; Han et al; Mengel-From et al.). Overall, at least one SNP in 9 out of the 12 genes studied showed significant association with certain hair color categories in our sample (Table 1). For three genes (TYRP1, TPCN2, and KITLG) the SNPs tested did not reveal statistically significant hair color association (but see below for the predictive effects of two of these genes), although these genes have been implicated in human hair color variation elsewhere (Sulem et al; Valenzuela et al; Mengel-From et al.). This discrepancy may be influenced by the relatively small sample size in our study and the putatively smaller effect size of these three genes relative to the other genes studied.

Healthy hair is vital to identity. Understanding the intricate anatomy and physiology of hair provides insight into the aging process and the eventual loss of either hair pigmentation or hair shafts. Several biologics are available that have enabled altering or slowing the aging process of hair, but, unfortunately, no agent exists that can reverse the natural course. The commonly used biologics are discussed.

### The multifaceted role of hair as a biospecimen: recent advances in precision medicine and forensic science [^1164t7oa]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Variability in hair characteristics such as pigmentation, cosmetic treatments, environmental factors and growth rate, poses a persistent challenge in hair analysis, influencing analyte incorporation, stability and temporal interpretation. Melanin content, the lipophilicity, basicity and polarity of a drug and its metabolites have been shown to affect drug binding, introducing potential bias related to hair color. Cosmetic and chemical treatments (for example, bleaching, dyeing or perming) and environmental factors (for example, UV light) can alter the structure of the hair shaft, compromising analyte integrity, stability and extraction efficiency. Additionally, growth rate variability by factors such as age, health status and anatomical site complicates the reconstruction of exposure timelines. In forensics, diagnostics, clinical sciences and research contexts, these variabilities are often underrecognized. Existing analytical practices, including pre-analysis screening, segmental analysis and normalization may provide limited mitigation. To minimize the impact of these sources of variability, fundamental research is needed to better understand their effects and to develop robust reference databases that account for these factors in both forensic and diagnostic contexts. Integrating this knowledge into standardized analytical protocols is essential to improve the validity, reliability, and equity of hair biospecimen analysis. Recent advancements in MS, microscopy and spectroscopy techniques have greatly improved our understanding of hair biology. Technologies such as multiphoton fluorescence, synchrotron radiation X-ray and FTIR enable noninvasive disease diagnosis, monitoring and treatment customization. Enhanced MS sensitivity and molecular bioinformatics are advancing omics-based approaches, identifying disease biomarkers, drug exposure and nutritional status. These technologies improve detection limits and distinguish between acute and chronic exposure, with hair reflecting long-term hormonal changes such as cortisol, aiding mental health assessments.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113WLzMC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society hirsutism — pretest probability and neoplasm red flags: The decision to test for androgen excess depends both on the pretest likelihood that an abnormal value may be found and upon whether a detected abnormality will determine the approach to treatment. Most women with local hair growth and regular menses who have no evidence to suggest an endocrine cause have a very low likelihood of excess androgen production, whereas patients with hirsutism or with clinical features suggesting an underlying endocrine disorder are more likely to have excess androgen production. A rapid pace of development or progression of hirsutism, progression in spite of therapy, or evidence of virilization points to a greater likelihood of an androgen-secreting neoplasm, although some tumors producing only moderately excessive androgen have indolent presentations.

### Nutrition and hair [^117EdZ69]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Healthy-appearing hair is a sign of excellent general health, as well as good hair care practices. Most healthy individuals have adequate nutrients in their diet; however, many people do not have access to good nutrition, and others have medical illnesses that predispose them to nutritional deficiency. This is often reflected in changes of scalp and, at times, body hair. Malnutrition, congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disease, chronic illnesses, malignancy, alcoholism, and advanced age can cause hair to change color, be weakened, or lost. Recognition of the populations at risk for vitamin deficiency is the first step to their detection. Changes in skin and hair can provide clues to the presence of an underlying vitamin deficiency.

### Therapeutic senescence via GPCR activation in synovial fibroblasts facilitates resolution of arthritis [^1149oG2W]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

MC1R is a highly polymorphic gene, and more than 200 variants have been described. This variation is associated with the diversity in human normal pigmentation. MC1R variants are found in around 80% red/blonde hair poor tanning individuals and are strongly associated with skin cancer risk. Diminished MC 1 function leads to impaired melanin production, which increases skin vulnerability to UV radiation and compromises nuclear excision repair mechanisms. Distinct mechanisms can lead to MC 1 loss of function, including uncoupling from the G-protein, limited surface expression, or alterations in the agonist binding sites. Consequently, the high frequency of these variants in the population may impact on the development of MC 1 -based therapies.

RA management is suffering from a high economical burden derived from the poor response rates to current treatments (~40% failure). The inability to predict treatment responses transforms RA management into trial-and-error algorithms. Precision medicine approaches should be incorporated into the drug development process to maximize treatments benefits: as such MC 1 is an ideal drug target in which this approach might be feasible as multiple variants and their functional outcomes are known. A high proportion (55%) of patient cells studied here carried at least one variant, and consistent with previous studies on similar populations (British/Irish), multiple highly penetrant variants (R alleles) with strong association with red hair were identified. In general, MC1R variants did not associate with the effects of BMS on SF senescence: however, the R variant D294H was associated with reduced BMS-induced senescence. Although other R alleles were also identified (R151C, R160W, D84E), D294H variant considerably differs in the mechanism leading to loss of function, as it increases cell surface expression (in contrast to the other variants) possibly due to its resistance to internalization derived from defective G-protein coupling and hence deficient signaling. Larger studies will be necessary to provide a conclusive association of D294H, and maybe other variants, with a reduced MC 1 -mediated pro-senescence effect. The high number of possible variants and their multiple combinations as compound heterozygous, together with the absence of homozygous in this study limits the possibility of creating a rule to predict response. However, these initial findings suggest a likely role for the D294H variant, present in > 50% of red hair individuals, on the efficacy of BMS to induce SF senescence, and more generally emphasizes the importance of incorporating pharmacogenomics analysis on MC 1 -based therapies, to ensure that the right drug is given to the right patient.

### Genome-wide association study of pain sensitivity assessed by questionnaire and the cold pressor test [^111seSAj]. Pain (2022). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

It has been established that pain sensitivity is predictive of acute postoperative pain, and of risk for the development of chronic pain conditions. The precise assessment of pain sensitivity requires well-controlled experimental pain and emotional stimuli. In general, such assessments are time-consuming in clinical settings because there is substantial interindividual variability in pain sensitivity and perception, and they can only be deployed for modest cohort sizes. As a result, there have been few studies with large sample sizes, impeding progress in understanding the genetic architecture of pain sensitivity. Although hundreds of genes have been proposed to have associations with different types of pain, most pain genetics studies analyzed small sample sizes, often using candidate gene or gene panel approaches. To date, the number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on pain phenotypes is still very limited. The largest pain GWAS have been performed in the UK Biobank and 23andMe, Inc cohorts for chronic pain, knee pain, neck and shoulder pain, and migraine. These studies have identified dozens of putative causal genes, which are primarily expressed within brain tissues and have been implicated in neurogenesis, neuronal development, neural connectivity, and cell-cycle processes. Pain phenotypes have been correlated with a range of psychiatric, personality, autoimmune, anthropometric, and circadian traits. Only a couple of small GWAS studies have directly explored the genetic architecture of pain sensitivity. They have found a small number of associations, but none of them have been replicated.

Several clinical and population-based studies have also reported that individuals who naturally have red hair tend to be more resistant to local anesthetics and more sensitive to thermal and dental pain. Red hair, as well as fair skin and freckles, is associated with genetic variations of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), and it has been suggested that these mutations could directly modulate pain sensitivity, particularly in women.,

We recently validated an online version of the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) and an at-home version of the cold pressor test (CPT), both of which are used in clinical assessments of pain. The PSQ asks participants to imagine 14 painful situations and 3 nonpainful control situations. Subjects are asked to rate their painfulness on a 0 to 10 numeric scale. The CPT measures how long subjects can immerse one hand in ice water. The validation study demonstrated that these 2 pain sensitivity measures can be consistently collected online and allow pain sensitivity analyses in very large cohorts.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^1144gQ9Y]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction and Methodology

Androgen excess is defined as clinical or biochemical evidence of increased production of androgenic steroids in women. It is observed in up to 10% of women of reproductive age and less commonly in postmenopausal women. Androgen excess typically manifests clinically as hirsutism or acne, but more severe and prolonged exposure can lead to overt virilisation, including clitoromegaly, deepening of the voice, female pattern hair‐loss (FPHL) or erythrocytosis. Most adolescents and women of reproductive age who present to secondary or tertiary care with androgen excess will have underlying polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, other primary underlying pathologies must be excluded in a subset of patients harbouring red flag clinical features. These include severe biochemical disturbances, rapidly progressive symptoms or signs or presentation in the postmenopausal phase of life. This cohort of patients have increased likelihood of underlying neoplastic ovarian, adrenal or pituitary disease, or occasionally monogenic disorders of insulin signalling or androgen metabolism, compared to those with milder disturbances in the PCOS range. A detailed clinical history, targeted physical examination and careful interrogation of the pattern and severity of biochemical disturbances are critical to rationalise the requirement and strategy for further biochemical, radiological and, where appropriate, genetic investigations. Although androgen excess in women with PCOS is closely correlated with adverse metabolic health outcomes throughout their life course, severe biochemical disturbances or overt virilisation are rarely observed in PCOS. Therefore, a systematic diagnostic approach is required to investigate patients with typical red flag signs and symptoms.

### High naevus count and MC1R red hair alleles contribute synergistically to increased melanoma risk [^116BVo9A]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A high total body naevus count is the highest risk factor for melanoma; the phenotype of red hair colour, freckling and pale skin that burns easily, produced by MC1R R alleles, also predisposes to melanoma.

Objectives

To determine whether the known melanoma risk factors of high naevus count and red hair or MC1R R alleles act synergistically to increase melanoma risk.

Methods

The Brisbane Naevus Morphology Study involved 1267 participants from volunteers presenting at a melanoma unit, dermatology outpatient clinic, private dermatology clinics, the Brisbane Longitudinal Twin Study and the QSkin Study. We examined pigmentation characteristics, total body naevus ≥ 5 mm count, and MC1R, ASIP and CDKN2A genotype in participants with and without a personal history of melanoma, living in Queensland, Australia, which is an area of high ultraviolet radiation.

Results

Cases were older than controls (median 57 vs. 33 years). Compared with individuals with dark brown hair and zero to four naevi, individuals with red hair and ≥ 20 naevi had a melanoma odds ratio of 10.0 (95% confidence interval 4.2–24.3). Individuals with MC1R R/R genotype and ≥ 20 naevi (≥ 5 mm diameter) had a melanoma odds ratio of 25.1 (95% confidence interval 8.4–82.7) compared with wild-type (WT)/WT individuals with zero to four naevi. The highest risk group is Australian men with the MC1R R/R genotype and ≥ 20 moles, who have an absolute risk of melanoma to age 75 years of 23.3%, compared with 0.8% for men with the WT/WT genotype and zero to four naevi.

Conclusions

Patients who live in areas of high ultraviolet radiation, and have many large naevi and the red hair colour phenotype, particularly those with the MC1R R/R genotype, have a high risk of melanoma above the threshold recommended for screening in other cancers. Therefore, they should undergo intensive physician-led surveillance. What's already known about this topic? A high number of acquired melanocytic naevi, the red hair phenotype and MC1R R alleles all independently increase melanoma risk. Women with atypical naevi have an increasing melanoma risk gradient from darker hair to lighter hair. Women with many naevi have an increasing melanoma risk gradient from those with no elements of the red hair phenotype, to those with freckles but not red hair, to those with red hair. What does this study add? In Queensland, Australia, people with ≥ 20 naevi (≥ 5 mm diameter) and MC1R R/R genotype have a 25-fold increased melanoma risk, relative to people with zero to four naevi and the MC1R WT/WT genotype. In Queensland, individuals with ≥ 20 naevi and the MC1R R/R genotype have an absolute melanoma risk to age 75 years of 23.3% for men and 19.3% for women. This effect is independent of CDKN2A genotype. Further research is required to determine the effect of areas of lower ultraviolet radiation, as this study took place in the Queensland, Australia, which is an area of high ultraviolet radiation. MC1R R/r genotype is associated with increased total body naevus count but this is not the case for R/R. What is the translational message? Patients with many large naevi and the red hair colour phenotype, particularly those with an MC1R R/R genotype, have an unusually high risk of melanoma. In a high ultraviolet environment, this risk exceeds the threshold recommended for screening in other cancers, and such individuals should undergo intensive, regular, physician-led surveillance. Patients with many large naevi but with non-red colour hair may benefit further from clinical MC1R genotyping.

### Measuring resilience to chronic pain in population surveys using hair cortisol [^114Ru9iS]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Measuring dysregulation in cortisol production necessitates the use of statistical methods that go beyond a focus on average levels of cortisol. A focus on effects at the mean can result in important effects being ignored among people at the extremes of the cortisol distribution, even though it is at the extremes where we expect to find dysregulation of the HPA axis functioning. As an example, higher levels of neuroticism among middle-aged adults were associated with increased allostatic load, with the associations increasing in magnitude among adults at the high end of the distribution of physiological 'wear and tear' (Atkins, Turner, Chandola, & Sutton).

We use quantile regression methods, specifically the Recentered Influence Function (RIF) regression approach (Firpo, Fortin, & Lemieux,), to assess the relationship between cortisol levels and chronic pain among adults at different points of the hair cortisol distribution. Standard regression models estimate the effect of an explanatory variable, X, on the population unconditional mean of an outcome variable, Y. Quantile regression methods enable estimation at specific percentiles (or 'quantiles') of the distribution of Y. In relation to hair cortisol, quantile regression models may be particularly useful, as the effect of a stressor (such as chronic pain) may differ between adults with high and low levels of cortisol (or in other words, across different parts of the distribution of cortisol). For example, in any random sample of people, those with chronic pain, who have a prolonged response to cortisol, may be expected to be located at the higher ends of the hair cortisol distribution (the red line in Figure 1e). On the other hand, it is unclear whether people with an adaptive or inadequate response to chronic pain would result in patterns such that (a) the adaptive response is located at the lower end of the hair cortisol distribution and the inadequate response around the median, or (b) the inadequate response is located at the lower end of the hair cortisol distribution and the adaptive response at the median. It is also unclear whether the associations between chronic pain and cortisol would differ across the distribution of hair cortisol or whether a standard linear regression model of hair cortisol could adequately represent the association between chronic pain and hair cortisol.

### A study in scarlet: MC1R as the main predictor of red hair and exemplar of the flip-flop effect [^1149UmZU]. Human Molecular Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Genetic variation in melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) is a known contributor to disease-free red hair in humans. Three loss-of-function single-nucleotide variants (rs1805007, rs1805008 and rs1805009) have been established as strongly correlated with red hair. The contribution of other loss-of-function MC1R variants (in particular rs1805005, rs2228479 and rs885479) and the extent to which other genetic loci are involved in red hair colour is less well understood. Here, we used the UK Biobank cohort to capture a comprehensive list of MC1R variants contributing to red hair colour. We report a correlation with red hair for both strong-effect variants (rs1805007, rs1805008 and rs1805009) and weak-effect variants (rs1805005, rs2228479 and rs885479) and show that their coefficients differ by two orders of magnitude. On the haplotype level, both strong- and weak-effect variants contribute to the red hair phenotype, but when considered individually, weak-effect variants show a reverse, negative association with red hair. The reversal of association direction in the single-variant analysis is facilitated by a distinguishing structure of MC1R, in which loss-of-function variants are never found to co-occur on the same haplotype. The other previously reported hair colour genes' variants do not substantially improve the MC1R red hair colour predictive model. Our best model for predicting red versus other hair colours yields an unparalleled area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.96 using only MC1R variants. In summary, we present a comprehensive statistically derived characterization of the role of MC1R variants in red hair colour and offer a powerful, economical and parsimonious model that achieves unsurpassed performance.

### Anesthetic requirement is increased in redheads [^116YKPg7]. Anesthesiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Age and body temperature alter inhalational anesthetic requirement; however, no human genotype is associated with inhalational anesthetic requirement. There is an anecdotal impression that anesthetic requirement is increased in redheads. Furthermore, red hair results from distinct mutations of the melanocortin-1 receptor. Therefore, the authors tested the hypothesis that the requirement for the volatile anesthetic desflurane is greater in natural redheaded than in dark-haired women.

Methods

The authors studied healthy women with bright red (n = 10) or dark (n = 10) hair. Blood was sampled for subsequent analyses of melanocortin-1 receptor alleles. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and maintained with desflurane randomly set at an end-tidal concentration between 5.5 and 7.5%. After an equilibration period, a noxious electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 70 mA) was transmitted through bilateral intradermal needles. If the volunteer moved in response to stimulation, desflurane was increased by 0.5%; otherwise, it was decreased by 0.5%. This was continued until volunteers "crossed over" from movement to nonmovement (or vice versa) four times. Individual logistic regression curves were used to determine desflurane requirement (P50). Desflurane requirements in the two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney nonparametric two-sample test; P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

The desflurane requirement in redheads (6.2 vol% [95% CI, 5.9–6.5]) was significantly greater than in dark-haired women (5.2 vol% [4.9–5.5]; P = 0.0004). Nine of 10 redheads were either homozygous or compound heterozygotes for mutations on the melanocortin-1 receptor gene.

Conclusions

Red hair seems to be a distinct phenotype linked to anesthetic requirement in humans that can also be traced to a specific genotype.

### Is hypercortisolism in anorexia nervosa detectable using hair samples? [^111scirP]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental disorder accompanied by extensive metabolic and endocrine abnormalities. It has been associated with hypercortisolism using short-term measurement methods such as 24 h-urine, saliva, and blood. The aim of this study was to examine whether the proposed hypercortisolism in acutely underweight AN (acAN) is also reflected in a long-term measure: hair cortisol (HCC). To gain further insight, we compared hair cortisol to a well-established classical cortisol measure (24 h-urine; UCC) longitudinally in acAN. Hair samples were collected and analyzed using a LC-MS/MS-based method to provide a monthly cortisol value. We compared HCC in samples of 40 acAN with 40 pairwise age-matched healthy controls (HC) as well as 23 long-term recovered AN participants (recAN) with 23 pairwise age-matched HC (cross-sectional design). In the second part, UCC collected weekly during 14 weeks of weight-restoration therapy in 16 acAN was compared with the (time-corresponding) HCC using linear mixed models and bivariate correlations (longitudinal design). No group differences in HCC occurred comparing acAN and recAN to HC (cross-sectional study). The longitudinal analysis revealed a decrease of UCC but not HCC with weight gain. Furthermore, there was no overall significant association between UCC and HCC. Only in the last four weeks of weight-restoration therapy we found a significant moderate correlation between UCC and HCC. HCC did not reflect the expected hypercortisolism in acAN and did not decrease during short-term weight-restoration. Time-corresponding measurements of UCC and HCC were not consistently associated in our longitudinal analysis of acAN undergoing inpatient treatment. Given the drastic metabolic disturbances in acutely underweight AN our findings could be interpreted as disturbed cortisol incorporation or altered activity of 11-β-HSD-enzymes in the hair follicle.

### Measuring resilience to chronic pain in population surveys using hair cortisol [^111eJX9r]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

One explanation for the conflicting reports could be the difficulty in distinguishing between different patterns of adaptive and dysregulated cortisol responses to stressors. The HPA axis is normally controlled by a negative feedback system in which circulating cortisol inhibits the release of more cortisol after an initial increase in cortisol following exposure to a stressor (Figure 1a – the adaptive response). HPA axis dysregulation is characterized by either excessive (Figure 1b – the prolonged response) or a lack of cortisol production (Figure 1c – the inadequate response), resulting in an allostatic load (Figure 1d).

Figure 1.
Differential effects of a chronic stressor on cortisol.

Figure 1 (adapted from McEwen) represents the three patterns of cortisol responses to stressors (adaptive, prolonged, and inadequate responses) that correspond to the different stages of allostasis and allostatic load. In the case of chronic stress, where the stressor persists but fluctuates, an adaptive response (Figure 1a) requires some cortisol production initially, but this reduces after time – see the green line in Figure 1d. Cortisol is produced through activation of the HPA axis after exposure to a stressor (see the positive effect of the chronic stressor on cortisol at t1 in Figure 1a). However, the negative feedback loop in the HPA axis results in cortisol production being reduced when the levels of cortisol are too high (see the negative effect of cortisol at t1 on cortisol at t2 in Figure 1a). The initial positive effect on cortisol levels and the negative feedback loop on further cortisol release are adaptive responses that maintain allostasis. This adaptive response indicates resilience, marked by physiologically appropriate, moderated cortisol secretion. Hyperarousal refers to an exaggerated (or 'prolonged') stress response. The prolonged response is marked by a sustained production of stress hormones that does not rapidly decline post-exposure to the stressor – see Figure 1b and the red line in Figure 1d – which may indicate a lack of internal resources to cope with chronic stress, and the continued release of cortisol as a result of the chronic stressor (see the continuing positive effects of chronic stress on cortisol at t1 and t2 in Figure 1b). Hypo-arousal or an inadequate response is a stage where extreme exposure to stressors results in insufficient stress hormone production – see Figure 1c and the purple line in Figure 1d. The inadequate response suggests dysregulation or failure to mount an effective physiological response to the chronic stressor – see the lack of causal arrows from chronic stressor to cortisol at t1 or t2 in Figure 1c.

### Genome-wide study of hair colour in UK biobank explains most of the SNP heritability [^115zMmck]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Additional red hair colour-associated loci

In addition to the associations around MC1R on chromosome 16, we observe 8 additional associations at genome-wide significance (Supplementary Table 1). Statistical fine-mapping of causal SNPs (PICS)in some cases indicated a single likely casual variant, whilst in others one of more than 50 variants could potentially be the causal SNP. We find a previously unreported association at rs276645354, at which the minor allele reduces the probability of red hair. This variant lies less than 2 kb from transcriptional start site (TSS) of POMC, which encodes α-MSH, the agonist of MC1R. Increased expression of POMC is likely to promote melanogenic signalling and thus dampen the effect of those MC1R variants which have some, albeit reduced, signalling activity. A single variant in an intron of RALY, located 5′ of ASIP, the gene encoding the inverse agonist of MC1R, was associated with red hair. This variant, rs6059655, is also an expression QTL (eQTL) for ASIP expression in skin, with the red-hair-associated allele showing higher mean expression levels (Fig. 3a). We suggest that variants that increase ASIP expression in the skin or hair follicles lead to greater competition with α-MSH for melanocyte MC1R binding, antagonising melanogenic induction and increasing the pheomelanin in melanocytes.

### Hair cortisol and adiposity in a population-based sample of 2, 527 men and women aged 54 to 87 years [^114Xy18g]. Obesity (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is one of the leading risk factors for mortality worldwide, substantially increasing the risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancers 1; thus understanding the factors that promote the onset or maintenance of obesity has important therapeutic implications. Obesity is often accompanied by a cluster of comorbidities including hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, and dyslipidemia, known as the metabolic syndrome 2. The symptoms of the metabolic syndrome closely resemble those of Cushing's syndrome, a disorder characterized by extreme endogenous production of the stress hormone cortisol 3. Cortisol has a broad range of physiological effects throughout the human body and plays a role in glucose and lipid metabolism, body composition, and immunosuppressive and anti‐inflammatory responses 4. It is possible that long‐term hyperactivation of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis, the neuroendocrine system that regulates cortisol levels, may contribute to the development of obesity and the metabolic syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals.

Exposure to a physiological or psychological stressor activates the HPA axis, resulting in the release of cortisol. Chronic stress — and thus chronically elevated levels of cortisol — may promote obesity through effects on fat accumulation. The effects of cortisol are mediated via glucocorticoid receptors, which have a particularly high density in visceral adipose tissue. In the presence of insulin, cortisol promotes triglyceride accumulation and retention in visceral fat depots which results in increased abdominal fat 5. Indeed, animal studies have shown that chronic exposure to physical and psychological stressors increases deposition of visceral fat 6, 7.

In addition to influencing fat deposition, cortisol is associated with alterations in the quantity and type of foods consumed. In animal models, moderate and severe stressors (e.g. noise, immobilization) consistently reduce food intake, whereas mild stressors (e.g. a tail pinch) are associated with increased or unchanged intake 8. Laboratory studies in humans have shown increased ad libitum caloric intake in response to glucocorticoid infusion and artificially induced stress 9, 10. People tend to report eating more when stressed 11, 12, but some studies have observed reduced food intake in conditions of acute stress 13. In addition to absolute changes in energy intake, functional MRI studies have indicated that the sensitivity of central food reward circuits is lower during times of stress, which may increase cravings for "comfort foods" 14. Under stress, there is a shift in preference toward more palatable, energy‐dense foods irrespective of whether total energy intake increases 11, 12, 15. These observations are suggestive of a causal role of cortisol in the development and maintenance of obesity.
