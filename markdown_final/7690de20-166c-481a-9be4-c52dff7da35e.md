## Question

Cobblestoning in iluem

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "cobblestoning in ileum" means, how it forms, how it is identified endoscopically and radiologically, what diseases it suggests, how to distinguish it from similar findings in conditions like ulcerative colitis, intestinal tuberculosis, and EBV-associated enteritis, and how to confirm the diagnosis and plan next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining cobblestoning and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify how it appears on endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging. Next, I will consider its diagnostic weight for Crohn's disease versus mimics, followed by the key differentials and their distinguishing features. After that, I need to outline a diagnostic algorithm, including biopsy strategy and when to suspect alternative etiologies. Finally, I should confirm how this changes management and prognosis and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary anchored to guidelines and data.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathogenesis. Cobblestoning refers to an endoscopic pattern in which edematous, relatively preserved mucosal islands are separated by deep fissuring linear ulcers, creating a pebble-like mosaic that reflects transmural inflammation with deep ulceration and intervening islands of intact mucosa. I should double-check that this morphology indeed arises from longitudinal, deep fissuring ulcers rather than shallow erosions, which it does in classic Crohn's disease descriptions and modern imaging-endoscopy correlations [^112vqXPd] [^115zt3DZ] [^114ctQb6].

> Next, I should review how it looks on endoscopy and imaging. Endoscopically, cobblestoning presents as raised mucosal islands bordered by deep linear ulcers; capsule and double-balloon enteroscopy series describe pebble-like mucosal edema and cobblestone patterns in the ileum, and I need to ensure I note that this pattern often coexists with longitudinal ulcers, strictures, and segmental involvement in active Crohn's disease [^115CuSwf] [^115zt3DZ]. On cross-sectional imaging, CT/MR enterography detects transmural changes with bowel wall thickening, deep ulcers, and cobblestoning; I should confirm sensitivity, and yes, MR enteroclysis shows high sensitivity for deep ulcers and cobblestoning compared with conventional enteroclysis, and spectral CT can further characterize activity when cobblestone is present [^112T89fG] [^114dk5BV] [^114ctQb6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; cobblestoning is highly suggestive of Crohn's disease but not absolutely pathognomonic. I need to check guideline-weighted features: segmental distribution, skip lesions, aphthae, deep and longitudinal ulcers, strictures, perianal disease, and granulomas all support Crohn's disease, whereas continuous colitis with backwash ileitis points away from Crohn's disease and toward ulcerative colitis, so cobblestoning must be interpreted in distribution and histologic context [^115zt3DZ] [^1134Ymxr] [^112Wpkax].

> I will now examine mimics, starting with backwash ileitis in ulcerative colitis. Wait, let me verify the key discriminators: backwash ileitis is typically mild, superficial, continuous with pancolitis, and lacks strictures, linear ulcers, or true cobblestoning; the terminal ileum remains of normal caliber with a patent ileocecal valve on imaging, and the inflammation is usually limited to a short segment proximal to the valve, so if I see true cobblestoning or deep ulcers, I should reconsider the diagnosis toward Crohn's disease rather than UC [^116BGgpw] [^112Wpkax] [^112xhXJQ].

> Next, I should review intestinal tuberculosis, because cobblestoning can be described in TB but is less typical and often less frequent than in Crohn's disease. Let me consider comparative features: longitudinal ulcers, aphthae, anorectal disease, and cobblestone appearance favor Crohn's disease, whereas transverse or circumferential ulcers, patulous ileocecal valve, fewer than four segments involved, and scars or pseudopolyps favor TB; I should confirm that models incorporating cobblestone appearance and comb sign increase the odds of Crohn's disease in multivariate analyses, and yes, nomograms and multivariate studies repeatedly show cobblestone appearance as an independent predictor of Crohn's disease over TB [^115XjgQn] [^111PbWLJ] [^115DMDx8].

> But wait, what if the cobblestone-like pattern reflects EBV-associated enteritis rather than IBD? I need to check the literature on chronic active EBV enteritis, which can present with longitudinal ulcers and a cobblestone appearance and is frequently misdiagnosed as Crohn's disease; tissue EBER in situ hybridization and blood EBV DNA testing are essential when the clinical course is atypical or refractory to IBD therapy, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion in younger patients with systemic inflammatory features and nonresponse to biologics [^113habTP] [^1141Mrfa] [^113MHWH6].

> Let me think about how to confirm the diagnosis. I should confirm that ileocolonoscopy with biopsies is the cornerstone and that guidelines recommend systematic sampling of involved and uninvolved mucosa, including the ileum, because granulomas and focal active colitis support Crohn's disease; if TB is a concern, I need multiple biopsies for histology plus mycobacterial culture and PCR, and I should remember that the cobblestone pattern may be less prominent on mucosal biopsy than on resection specimens, which impacts yield [^113gycZk] [^114eDPUJ].

> Next, I should review adjunctive modalities. I need to ensure small-bowel evaluation when disease is suspected beyond the reach of colonoscopy. MR enterography or CT enterography can depict transmural changes, comb sign, and strictures, while MR enteroclysis offers high sensitivity for deep ulcers and cobblestoning. Capsule endoscopy detects more small-bowel lesions than CTE and standard ileocolonoscopy, though endoscopic access with balloon enteroscopy allows biopsies and therapy. Serologies like ASCA can support CD but are not diagnostic, and interferon-gamma release assays help in TB differentials, especially when combined with endoscopic and imaging features [^112T89fG] [^113Eh52H] [^114T6tWE].

> I should double-check that the diagnostic approach aligns with guideline algorithms. Pediatric and adult guidance converge on integrating endoscopic distribution, ileal morphology, and histology to distinguish CD from UC and from indeterminate colitis. Macroscopic cobblestoning, small-bowel stricturing or fistulization, and granulomas tip toward Crohn's disease, whereas superficial backwash ileitis in the setting of pancolitis supports UC. If uncertainty remains, provisional indeterminate colitis with planned re-evaluation is prudent because therapy can blur distinguishing features [^1178X2LW] [^112Wpkax] [^1134Ymxr] [^115txVoN].

> Now, I need to translate this into management implications. If cobblestoning in the ileum leads to a Crohn's diagnosis, I should confirm disease extent and behavior to guide therapy, recognizing that ileal and ileocolonic disease carries higher risks of stricturing and penetrating complications over time. Early biologic therapy is favored in high-risk phenotypes, and I should plan objective reassessment with endoscopy or cross-sectional imaging because symptoms do not reliably track inflammation, while also remembering that pouch or postoperative ileal cobblestoning may reflect recurrent Crohn's disease and requires tailored imaging follow-up [^1125gDQu] [^113gycZk] [^111dC16f].

> In summary, I should confirm that cobblestoning in the ileum reflects deep, transmural Crohn's disease with longitudinal ulcers creating pebble-like mucosal islands. It is a strong endoscopic predictor of Crohn's disease but must be differentiated from superficial backwash ileitis in UC, from intestinal tuberculosis which more often shows transverse ulcers and a patulous ileocecal valve, and from EBV-associated enteritis in refractory cases. Definitive diagnosis rests on ileocolonoscopy with targeted biopsies, small-bowel imaging for extent, and microbiologic testing when TB is suspected, with multidisciplinary correlation to avoid misclassification and to direct therapy [^112vqXPd] [^112Wpkax] [^114T6tWE].

Cobblestoning of the ileum is a **classic endoscopic feature of Crohn's disease** [^115zt3DZ], characterized by a pebble-like mucosa with edematous islands separated by deep fissuring ulcers and linear or serpiginous ulcers [^112vqXPd]. It reflects **transmural inflammation** with skip lesions and is most often seen in the terminal ileum [^112Wpkax]. This appearance helps distinguish Crohn's disease from ulcerative colitis [^116Uz7ZJ] and intestinal tuberculosis [^11348ifq], but it is not pathognomonic and can be mimicked by other conditions; therefore, diagnosis should integrate endoscopy, histology, and imaging [^1134Ymxr].

---

## Endoscopic features

- **Appearance**: Cobblestoning appears as raised, edematous mucosal islands separated by deep, fissuring ulcers, creating a pebble-like pattern [^114RTaTn].

- **Ulceration**: Linear or serpiginous ulcers are common, often coexisting with cobblestoning [^115zt3DZ].

- **Distribution**: Skip lesions are typical, with discontinuous involvement of the ileum and colon [^115zt3DZ].

- **Terminal ileum**: Most frequently involved, but can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract [^notfound].

---

## Histopathological features

- **Transmural inflammation**: Characterized by inflammation extending through the entire bowel wall [^112vqXPd].

- **Lymphoid aggregates**: Non-caseating granulomas and lymphoid aggregates are common [^1134Ymxr].

- **Fissuring ulcers**: Deep ulcers that separate mucosal islands, contributing to the cobblestone appearance [^114RTaTn].

---

## Clinical significance

Cobblestoning is **highly suggestive of Crohn's disease** [^115zt3DZ] and helps differentiate it from ulcerative colitis, which typically shows continuous, superficial inflammation without cobblestoning [^116Uz7ZJ]. It also aids in distinguishing Crohn's disease from intestinal tuberculosis, which more often shows transverse ulcers and concentric strictures [^11348ifq] [^111KpUqR]. However, cobblestoning is not pathognomonic for Crohn's disease and can be seen in other conditions, such as intestinal lymphoma [^notfound] and chronic active EBV infection [^1141Mrfa].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Diagnosis relies on **endoscopic evaluation** with ileocolonoscopy and biopsies to confirm transmural inflammation and exclude other conditions [^113gycZk]. Cross-sectional imaging (CT/MR enterography) assesses disease extent, strictures, and extraintestinal complications [^112T89fG]. Laboratory tests, including inflammatory markers and serologies, support the diagnosis and exclude infections [^1134Ymxr].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Endoscopic features** | **Histopathology** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Crohn's disease | Cobblestoning, skip lesions, linear ulcers | Transmural inflammation, non-caseating granulomas | Abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss |
| Ulcerative colitis | Continuous, superficial inflammation | Mucosal inflammation, crypt abscesses | Bloody diarrhea, urgency |
| Intestinal tuberculosis | Transverse ulcers, concentric strictures | Caseating granulomas | Weight loss, night sweats |
| Intestinal lymphoma | Mass lesions, ulcerations | Atypical lymphocytes | B symptoms, mass effect |
| Chronic active EBV infection | Longitudinal ulcers, cobblestoning | EBER-positive lymphocytes | Systemic symptoms |

---

## Management

Medical therapy includes **anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressants, and biologics** to induce and maintain remission [^notfound]. Nutritional support is important, and dietary modifications may help symptoms and growth in pediatrics. Surgery is reserved for complications such as strictures, fistulas, or refractory disease [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Cobblestoning reflects **severe, transmural inflammation** and is associated with a higher risk of complications, including strictures, fistulas, and recurrence after surgery [^114yHP5R]. With appropriate medical management, many patients achieve remission, but lifelong monitoring is often required [^112umrKD].

---

Cobblestoning of the ileum is a hallmark endoscopic feature of Crohn's disease, reflecting transmural inflammation and skip lesions. It is highly suggestive of Crohn's disease but not pathognomonic; therefore, diagnosis should be confirmed with histopathology and imaging [^1134Ymxr].

Pathologic features

Superficial ulcers and strictures were found in surgery pathology in all patients with CMUSE. Ulcers and strictures in 8(80%) patients with CMUSE were multiple. Cobblestone appearance, transmural inflammation and non- caseous epithelioid granulomas were absent in all the CMUSE cases. Table 4 shows the pathologic features (Fig. 3) of CMUSE patients and SBCD patients. There were significant differences in the ulcer location (P = 0.000) and ulcer depth (P = 0.003) between the two groups. Ulcer was observed to be located on strictures in 9 (90.0%) CMUSE patients but only in 1 (5.6%) SBCD patient. All ulcers observed in CMUSE patients (10, 100%) were superficial which were limited within mucosal and submucosal layers. Eight (44.4%) SBCD patients had deep ulcers that reached out of submucosal layers. Similarly, the incidence of transmural inflammation was higher in SBCD patients (16, 64.0%) than CMUSE patients (1, 10.0%) (P = 0.007).

Histological features

The histological features of patients with CD and ITB are summarized in Supplementary Table 5. Granulomas were found in 37.2% of patients with ITB and in 16.7% of patients with CD (P = 0.009) with significant statistical difference. Caseous necrosis was seen in 7.0% of patients with ITB but in none of the patients with CD (P = 0.032). Moreover, the histological findings of crypt abscesses and crypt atrophy were not significantly different between the groups (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Results of multivariate logistic regression with binary outcome (CD vs. ITB)

On multivariate analysis, T-SPOT positive (OR 0.004, 95%CI 0.000–0.054), cobblestone appearance (OR 28.589, 95%CI 1.155–707.746), comb sign (OR 84.397, 95%CI 4.461–1596.677) and granuloma (OR 0.051, 95% CI 0.003–0.859) were found to be significant predictors in differentiating CD and ITB (Table 1).

Nomogram construction

The diagnostic equation built for model was LogitP = 0.340–5.457 * T-SPOT positive + 3.353 * cobblestone appearance + 4.436 * comb sign − 2.967 * granuloma based on the basis of multivariable logistic regression, and the result was displayed as nomogram shown in Fig. 1. In the nomogram, each variable has a corresponding score according to the value, which was read out by drawing a line straight upward from each predictor to the point axis, and after calculating the total scores of the 4 variables, the possibility of diagnosing a patient as having CD was intuitively demonstrated.

Clinical, laboratory, radiologic, endoscopic, and pathologic features

Demographics (gender, age at gastrointestinal symptom onset and disease duration), the history of appendectomy, medication history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for more than 2 weeks, body mass index (BMI), clinical manifestations (symptoms, extra-intestinal manifestations, gastrointestinal complications, and lesion distribution), laboratory findings, radiologic features, endoscopic abnormalities, and pathologic features were collected. Haematochezia is defined as overt bloody stool. Lesion distribution was determined by radiologic and endoscopic examinations and surgical operation. Terminal ileum was defined as ileum that was within 30-cm of ileocecal valve. Radiologic features included skip lesions, enteric findings (ulcers, bowel strictures, bowel wall thickening, mural hyperenhancement, rough serosa, pseudodiverticulum and pseudo-polyps) and extraenteric findings (comb sign, enhanced density of the peri-intestinal fat, enlargement of the abdominal lymph nodes, and fistula) on CTE. Endoscopic features included the presence and number of ulcers (1, or ≥ 2), ulcer types (longitudinal ulcer, dot ulcer, circumferential ulcer, oval ulcer, aphthous ulcer or irregular ulcer), number of strictures (1, or ≥ 2), fistula, hyperplastic lesions (pseudo-polyps, nodular lesions or eminence lesions) and cobblestone appearance detected by double-balloon enteroscopy, coloscopy or capsule endoscopy. Aphthous ulcer was defined as a tiny, punched out, raised or flat red lesion with a white center.

Operation data included the number of patients underwent operation and the surgical indications. All samples for histopathological examination were surgical samples. Pathological feature included ulcer incidence, ulcernumber (1, or ≥ 2), the depth of the deepest ulcer (deep, or superficial, superficial ulcer means ulcer limited within mucosal and submucosal layers), ulcer located on stricture site, stricture number (1, or ≥ 2), cobblestone appearance, perforation, fistula, transmural inflammation, non- caseous epithelioid granulomas, and abscess. Images of radiologic, endoscopic or pathologic examinations were respectively reviewed by a radiologist (Wei Liu), an endoscopic expert (Weiyang Zheng) or pathologist (Weixun Zhou) who was blinded to the design of this study.

### Development and validation of a new algorithm model for differential diagnosis between Crohn's disease and intestinal tuberculosis: a combination of laboratory, imaging and endoscopic characteristics [^113JqdWG]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

For endoscopic characteristics, rectum or sigmoid colon involvement and longitudinal ulcers, aphthous ulcers were more common in CD, whereas transverse ulcers were more common in ITB, our results is the same as the previous published ones. Lee et al. selected eight endoscopic characteristics along to build the models: transverse ulcers, less than 4 segment lesions, patulous ileocecal valve, and pseudopolyp (favored ITB); anorectal lesions, aphthous ulcers, longitudinal ulcers, and cobblestone appearance (favored CD), and they hypothesized that if there were more parameters favored of ITB than CD, then a diagnosis of ITB could be made, and vice versa. This endoscopic model could make an accuracy rate of 87.5% and the PPV for CD and ITB was 95% and, respectively, indicating that a systematic analysis of endoscopic findings is very useful in differentiating ITB and CD. In our study, we found that the shapes of the ulcers were very important parameters in differentiating ITB and CD, and transverse ulcers, longitudinal ulcers, and aphthous ulcers were all selected in our CART model. Regarding the importance of the shapes of the ulcers, we suppose that it may be possible to use the artificial intelligence (AI) technique, which is now very popular, to help in differentiating ITB and CD. As it can be taught to identify the characteristics of the ulcers (such as the shapes), and if we further enter some other parameters, after calculation and combination, the AI might give us a satisfied answer.

Discussion

CD and ITB are both chronic granulomatous diseases of the intestine that share similar clinical manifestations, endoscopic findings, CTE and histological features. In China, where tuberculosis is prevalent and the incidence of CD is increasing, it is important to accurately identify these two diseases in a timely and accurate manner. It is very important to make a correct differential diagnosis and take reasonable treatment measures in the early stage because of the distinct natural history and prognosis of these two disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a better diagnostic tool to distinguish CD from ITB. In this research, we screened demographics, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination, endoscopic findings, CTE and pathological features in detail and searched for significant predictors for differentiating CD from ITB by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. We found some clinical manifestations, laboratory examination, endoscopic findings, CTE and pathological features are helpful to distinguish CD from ITB. Among them, T-SPOT positive, cobblestone appearance, comb sign and granuloma are the most important features to distinguish CD from ITB. Cobblestone appearance and comb sign are the independent predictors of CD, while T-SPOT positive and granuloma are the independent predictors of ITB. On this basis, a nomogram prediction model for distinguishing CD from ITB was developed and assessment, which has high discrimination, calibration and clinical efficiency. It can be used as an accurate and convenient diagnostic tool to distinguish Crohn's disease from intestinal tuberculosis, facilitating clinical decision-making.

The principal clinical manifestations of CD and ITB are abdominal pain, abdominal mass, and weight loss, accounting for more than 70%. However, the difference was not statistically significant, indicating that these main clinical manifestations lacked specificity in differential diagnosis. On univariate analysis of variables, diarrhea and perianal disease were more common in patients with CD, whereas ascites and pulmonary tuberculosis were suggestive of ITB, which is consistent with previous reports. In addition, it is reported that the T-SPOT has superior sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of ITB compared with tuberculin skin test because it is not affected by previous Bacille de Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination and most nontuberculous mycobacteria infections. Our results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of T-SPOT are 92.2% and 93.0% in the differential diagnosis of CD and ITB, suggesting a valuable laboratory examination based on its high sensitivity and specificity, which is similar to previous reports.

Endoscopic findings

Endoscopy is vital for diagnosing and managing GITB and CD. Ileocolonoscopy is the procedure of choice to diagnose both GITB and CD. The type of lesions, morphological characteristics of ulcers, their location, predominant regions of involvement and additional findings like pseudopolyps, etc. may suggest the underlying diagnosis. Both GITB and CD may have ileocecal involvement, although left-sided lesions may be more suggestive of CD. Certain endoscopic features like aphthous ulcers, linear ulcers, cobblestone appearance, and skip lesions are more frequent in CD (Fig. 2). In contrast, circumferential ulcers, transverse ulcers, and patulous ileo-cecal (IC) valve are more frequent in patients with GITB (Fig. 3). None of the endoscopic features, however, are specific to each disease. Other endoscopic findings like pseudopolyps, mucosal nodularity, and stricture do not have much discriminative value.

### An unusual method of diagnosing a common disease [^115vURgE]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 34-year-old woman presented with non-bloody diarrhoea of 14 days duration and vomiting. Physical examination was unremarkable. She had hypokalaemia and metabolic acidosis. Stool studies were negative for Clostridium difficile toxin, faecal leucocytes and parasites. Colon appeared normal on colonoscopy. Pronounced scalloping of ileal folds was noted on ileoscopy. Ileal biopsies revealed villous blunting, crypt hyperplasia, marked intraepithelial lymphocytosis and lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria, consistent with lymphocytic ileitis in coeliac disease. Serology revealed elevated antitissue transglutaminase IgA antibodies (> 100 U/ml). Institution of a strict gluten free diet resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. Although rare, coeliac disease can present as an acute diarrhoeal illness and should be considered after infectious aetiologies are excluded.

The radiological spectrum of cobblestone malformation and polymicrogyria

It is important to remark that the imaging features of cobblestone malformation and polymicrogyria may partially overlap, potentially causing difficulties and discrepancies in their definition and classification. Accounting for this phenotypical variability, the concepts of 'cobblestone/polymicrogyria-like' cortex can be suggested in order to include this spectrum of appearances. In some polymicrogyria forms, these overlapping imaging features seems to be the result of shared pathophysiological mechanisms. In particular, depending on the size of the gaps in the pial limiting membrane and the number of neurons migrating into the subarachnoid space, the resultant cortical phenotype may range from polymicrogyria (small gaps leading to small clumps of neurons on the cortical surface) to cobblestone malformation (large gaps leading to relatively smooth layers of neurons on the cortical surface).

Of note, in severe cases of cobblestone malformation and polymicrogyria, the cortex appears thicker and is sometimes incorrectly described as 'pachygyric', despite the fact that classic lissencephaly (of which pachygyria is a subtype) has a completely different pathophysiological mechanism related to neuronal under-migration, rather than over-migration. Remarkably, in these cases the apparently smooth surfaces on imaging may be due to technical limitations (i.e. insufficient spatial resolution) that may hamper the identification of irregularities of the cortical surface or cortical-white matter boundary.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^1165t1Pj]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Chronic diarrhea — colonoscopy diagnostic yield and biopsy approach is detailed: Histology is essential in evaluation because many etiologies are not macroscopically evident, the diagnostic yield of colonoscopy ranges from 7% to 32%, and in referral centers microscopic colitis accounts for approximately 10% of patients seen for chronic diarrhea; in a retrospective series of 809 patients, more than 99% of 122 abnormal pathologic findings were identifiable on distal colonic biopsies and the majority (80 of 122) showed microscopic colitis; because distribution can be patchy and left-sided sampling may miss disease, it is recommended that multiple biopsy samples should be taken from both the right and left sides of the colon, and clinicians should note that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause terminal ileal mucosal changes that mimic IBD.

Intestinal infections can mimic CD

The link between CD and infection is complex and can have implications both clinically (problems in diagnosis, differential diagnosis, approach to management and complications) and scientifically (issues in etiology and pathogenesis). Intestinal infections can mimic the classic endoscopic and clinical (abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss) features of IBD, and can present with identical extraintestinal manifestations (e.g. reactive arthritis, erythema nodosum). Abdominal tuberculosis can be part of a multiorgan disease process or, less commonly, presents as a primary disease. It has been rare in western countries since the introduction of tuberculostatic drugs. Recently, the incidence of this entity has increased due to the HIV epidemic and introduction of biological therapy. GI involvement with mycobacterial infection occurs primarily in the immunosuppressed patient but may occur in patients with normal immunity. Differentiation from CD can be very difficult on clinical and histological grounds if culture is negative. Treatment with steroids or a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor can lead to exacerbation of tuberculosis. The ileum is the most commonly-affected site, either in isolation or with the involvement of the adjacent bowel segments, especially the cecum. The main reasons for the predilection are due to a high density of lymphoid tissue, neutral pH environment and absorptive transport mechanisms that allow swallowed mycobacterium to be absorbed. Common presentations include abdominal pain and an abdominal mass in the right lower quadrant. Depending on the stage of the disease, findings may range from normal appearance to small polyps or nodules to extensive ulcerations, hypertrophic, ulcerohypertrophic and fibrotic lesions resulting in strictures, causing bowel obstructions and fistulae formations. Both endoscopy and radiological imaging can be used depending on the site affected. Rapid emptying of contrast, known as the "Sterling's sign", is commonly seen in TI involvement due to persistent irritability of the mucosa. Bowel wall thickening, mass lesions and regional adenopathy are best seen on CT. Differentiating ileal tuberculosis from CD can be very difficult. Furthermore, these two conditions may coexist. The presence of centrally necrotic regional lymph nodes favors tuberculosis, whereas a cobblestone appearance and skip lesions favor CD. In a recent study, clinical parameters more common in CD were anorectal lesions, longitudinal ulcers, aphthous ulcers, and a cobblestone appearance that involved fewer than four segments; a patulous ileocecal valve, transverse ulcers, and pseudopolyps were observed more frequently in patients with intestinal tuberculosis. The final clinical diagnosis is based on a combination of the clinical history with endoscopic studies, culture and polymerase chain reaction for mycobacterium tuberculosis, biopsy pathology, radiological investigations and response to therapy.

### Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young adults: report of a working group of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the Crohn's and colitis foundation of America [^1178X2LW]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN/CCFA working group — algorithm to assist clinicians in differentiating ulcerative colitis (UC) from Crohn disease (CD) in suspected inflammatory bowel disease specifies an initial evaluation with colonoscopy with biopsies, a barium upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through, and consideration of upper endoscopy with biopsies. The algorithm classifies CD when any of the following are present: noncaseating granulomas (that are not adjacent to ruptured crypts); radiographic or endoscopic evidence of small bowel stricturing, linear ulceration, fistulization, or cobblestoning; evidence of perianal fistulae, abscess, or large (> 5 mm) skin tags; or definite cobblestoning or stricturing in the terminal ileum or colon, or segmental colitis at time of colonoscopy and ileoscopy. In these branches, the action box states "Crohn's disease (identify disease locations, utilize Vienna classification)", and the caption notes that additional phenotyping may be performed "utilizing the Vienna or Montreal classification systems".

### A pilot study of transrectal endoscopic ultrasound elastography in inflammatory bowel disease [^114ZqWV6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is based on clinical, endoscopic, radiologic and histologic criteria. There are two main IBD phenotypes - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). In some circumstances, especially when disease extension is restricted exclusively to colon or in acute, severe phases of the disease like pancolitis when inflammation is widely spread to the colon, establishing an accurate diagnosis is very difficult. Assigning the exact phenotype of IBD as Crohn's colitis or UC is essential for guiding therapy decisions and detecting complications that warrant treatment and when IBD is confined to the colon it is especially important to define final phenotype before surgical decision.

Endoscopic examination is the mainstay in the diagnosis of IBD. Endoscopic appearance (distribution and shape of lesions) helps to differentiate CD from UC in most cases. Histology analysis confirms the elements of chronic inflammation but it is not exclusively diagnostic. Patients with UC may have atypical histological features such as microscopic inflammation of the ileum, patchiness, and relative rectal sparing at the time of diagnosis. These findings should not prompt the clinician to change the diagnosis from UC to CD. Other endoscopic findings, such as macroscopic cobblestoning, segmental colitis, ileal stenosis and ulceration, perianal disease, and pathologically confirmed multiple granulomas in the small bowel or colon more strongly suggest a diagnosis of CD.

Unfortunately, none of the classic or new endoscopic tools is strictly diagnostic for the exact IBD phenotype. The clinicians hope that progress being made in genetics, serological markers, and imaging studies will lead to more reliable determination of exact IBD phenotype. In the meantime it is reasonable to examine all possibilities to find better methods for differentiation between distinct IBD phenotypes. We think that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography is a perspective and promising method to achieve this goal. It is a new endoscopic procedure which can differentiate the stiffness of normal and pathological tissue by ultrasound. This finding is based on B-mode scanning during compressions. There are some data on elastography applied on the GI tract, biliary tract, kidney, muscle, breast and the heart. According to the fact that imaging of ultrasound tissue elasticity is a way to distinct characteristics of tissue we hypothesized that EUS elastography has the role in assessing the thickness of bowel wal in patients with IBD. As elastography has a potential to define tissue characteristics we hypothesized that using this method we can differentiate two forms of inflammation in colon: Crohn colitis and ulcerative colitis.

### Simplified approach to differential diagnosis of small bowel abnormalities [^115EJnt7]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

By analyzing the morphology of a focal lesion or the distribution, location, and morphology of the intestinal folds, the radiologist can come to a specific diagnosis or construct a graded differential diagnosis. This article presents a simplified approach to the differential diagnosis of small intestinal diseases by combining this roentgen analysis with the clinical history.

### Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young adults: report of a working group of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the Crohn's and colitis foundation of America [^111gCJAG]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Studies of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have varied in the criteria used to classify patients as having Crohn disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), or indeterminate colitis (IC). Patients undergoing an initial evaluation for IBD will often undergo a series of diagnostic tests, including barium upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through, abdominal CT, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy with biopsies. Other tests performed less frequently include magnetic resonance imaging scans, serological testing, and capsule endoscopy. The large amount of clinical information obtained may make a physician uncertain as to whether to label a patient as having CD or UC. Nevertheless, to facilitate the conduct of epidemiological studies in children, to allow the entry of children into clinical trials, and to allow physicians to more clearly discuss diagnosis with their patients, it is important that clinicians be able to differentiate between CD and UC.

Methods

A consensus conference regarding the diagnosis and classification of pediatric IBD was organized by the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America. The meeting included 10 pediatric gastroenterologists and 4 pediatric pathologists. The primary aim was to determine the utility of endoscopy and histology in establishing the diagnosis of CD and UC. Each member of the group was assigned a topic for review. Topics evaluated included differentiating inflammatory bowel disease from acute self-limited colitis, endoscopic and histological features that allow differentiation between CD and UC, upper endoscopic features seen in both CD and UC, ileal inflammation and "backwash ileitis" in UC, patchiness and rectal sparing in pediatric IBD, periappendiceal inflammation in CD and UC, and definitions of IC.

Results

Patients with UC may have histological features such as microscopic inflammation of the ileum, histological gastritis, periappendiceal inflammation, patchiness, and relative rectal sparing at the time of diagnosis. These findings should not prompt the clinician to change the diagnosis from UC to CD. Other endoscopic findings, such as macroscopic cobblestoning, segmental colitis, ileal stenosis and ulceration, perianal disease, and multiple granulomas in the small bowel or colon more strongly suggest a diagnosis of CD. An algorithm is provided to enable the clinician to differentiate more reliably between these 2 entities.

Conclusions

The recommendations and algorithm presented here aim to assist the clinician in differentiating childhood UC from CD. We hope the recommendations in this report will reduce variability among practitioners in how they use the terms "ulcerative colitis", "Crohn disease", and "indeterminate colitis". The authors hope that progress being made in genetic, serological, and imaging studies leads to more reliable phenotyping.

### Differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease and intestinal tuberculosis: development and assessment of a nomogram prediction model [^115DEh8F]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Assessment the performance of nomogram

The ROC curve of the nomogram prediction model was analyzed to evaluate the model's diagnostic effect. The area under the curve of model was 0.988, which was superior to 0.926 in T-SPOT positive, 0.832 in comb sign, 0.632 in cobblestone appearance and 0.603 in granuloma, suggesting that the nomogram was superior to predict the probability of CD (Fig. 2). The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the nomogram prediction model were 94.4%, 93.0%, 94.0%, 96.6% and 88.9% respectively in differentiating CD from ITB(Table 2). The C-index for the prediction nomogram was 0.988 for the cohort, and was confirmed to be 0.981 through bootstrapping validation, which suggested the model's good discrimination. The calibration curve was generated in this study, which showed that the apparent line and a bias-corrected line only slightly deviated from the ideal line, indicating a good consistency and a high degree of calibration(Fig. 3). Collectively, these findings show that the nomogram prediction model constructed with the above four indicators had an accurate predictive value for differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease and intestinal tuberculosis.

### Differentiating gastrointestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease-a comprehensive review [^114eDPUJ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

CD can affect any segment of the bowel. It can be either ileal, colonic, or ileocolonic. GITB, like CD, commonly affects the ileocecal region, but colonic involvement of any region can also be seen. Apart from ulcers, GITB can have strictures, or hypertrophic lesions like polypoidal mass. Segmental ulcer or colitis is the most common form of colonic TB. However, the rectum is rarely involved in TB. Isolated involvement of jejunum is infrequent in patients of GITB, but jejunal involvement can be seen in patients with CD. In a prospective study that compared capsule endoscopic findings in patients with CD and GITB, involvement of the proximal segment of the bowel, multiple segment involvement, and presence of aphthous ulcers were more common in CD. Patients with GITB patients had a higher frequency of IC junction involvement.

The diagnostic value of colonoscopy findings was evaluated in a comparative study. Four parameters (aphthous ulcer, longitudinal ulcer, cobblestone appearance, and anorectal involvement) were more frequent in CD, and four other parameters (transverse ulcer, patulous IC valve, pseudopolyps, and less than four segment involvement) were more common in GITB. Colonoscopy provides an opportunity to obtain tissue samples for histological and microbiological tests. Biopsy should be taken from the ulcer margin and sent for mycobacterial culture and molecular tests (polymerase chain ration-based tests, Nucleic acid amplification tests or NAATs) apart from routine histology. The optimal number of biopsy samples needs to be standardized, but the higher the number of biopsy samples, the better the yield of the positive result for TB. Recently, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in their standard treatment workflow, has suggested taking at least six biopsy samples in sterile saline solution for microbiological analysis. The endoscopic features of CD and GITB are summarised in Fig. 1.

Machine learning may also improve the analysis of histopathology and possibly tackle the unmet need of patients with unclassified IBD. Raman microspectroscopy as a cell and tissue diagnostics approach has been investigated to distinguish different IBD subtypes. Bielecki et al proposed that a machine learning-based workflow is capable of distinguishing tissue morphology among healthy subjects, CD and UC with great accuracy. Ultimately, artificial intelligence is promising in medical imaging and will undoubtedly have a considerable impact on endoscopy practice in the future (figure 4).

Both transverse colon and terminal ileum had bowel wall hyperenhancement and comb sign on conventional computed tomography (CT) images (Figures 5a and 5c, white arrows). Due to the difference of normalized iodine concentration (NIC) and slope of the HU curve (λ HU), they presented with different severity under endoscopy. On the iodine-based images (Figures 5b and 5d), NIC in lesion one was higher than that in lesion two (0.37 versus 0.27). On the HU curve image (Figure 5e), λ HU in lesion one was also higher than that in lesion two (3.59 versus 2.58). Under endoscopy, lesion one presented with cobblestone, deep and concave ulcers (Figure 5f). While, lesion two presented with mucosal edema and erosion (Figure 5g).

### Crohn's disease in the ileal pouch after total colectomy for ulcerative colitis: findings on pouch enemas in six patients [^111dC16f]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe our experience with six patients who developed Crohn's disease in the ileal pouch or distal ileum after a total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis.

Conclusion

Pouch enemas showed characteristic findings of Crohn's disease, including nodularity, thickened folds, ulceration, cobblestoning, strictures, sinus tracks, and fistulas to the perianal region and vagina. It is important for radiologists to be aware of the findings of Crohn's disease in the ileal pouch and distal ileum on radiographic studies of the pouch after total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis because of the implications for patient management.

### Are biopsies from endoscopically normal terminal ileum necessary? [^112FAKg7]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study corroborates previous observations with regard to the yield of abnormal histopathology, but adds value by exclusively evaluating findings in patients with an endoscopically normal appearing terminal ileum. We took further steps by investigating downstream clinical decision-making in all patients with abnormal histopathology, including follow up colonoscopies when available. Four patients (1.3%) had histopathologic findings that impacted management, with 2 diagnoses of drug-induced injury, 1 diagnosis of amyloidosis, and 1 diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Notably, all of these patients had a workup, including history and imaging, that was suspicious for these diagnoses prior to the colonoscopy. The histologic evidence could be considered confirmatory in these cases, rather than a new finding.

One limitation of our study was the retrospective design. Additionally, updated laboratory data were limited and could not be included in the analysis. Large prospective studies are warranted to determine when biopsies should be taken from endoscopically normal terminal ileum.

We conclude that performing biopsies of endoscopically normal appearing terminal ileum lacks clinically significant value, including for indications of chronic non-bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, hematochezia and abnormal imaging. The risks of increased costs and healthcare utilization, and higher levels of anxiety for patients may outweigh the benefits of obtaining biopsies.

Summary Box

What is already known:

The terminal ileum is often intubated and examined during colonoscopy procedures, particularly in the evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease
Biopsy of the terminal ileum is indicated to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease, even in the case of normal appearing terminal ileum
Greater costs, risk and healthcare utilization are associated with biopsy of the terminal ileum

What the new findings are:

Biopsy of normal appearing terminal ileum has limited diagnostic value in patients without inflammatory bowel disease
Additionally, biopsy of normal terminal ileum does not impact management
We do not recommend performing a biopsy of normal appearing terminal ileum in patients without inflammatory bowel disease, regardless of indication

### Development and validation of a new algorithm model for differential diagnosis between Crohn's disease and intestinal tuberculosis: a combination of laboratory, imaging and endoscopic characteristics [^116aQyth]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) are two intestinal diseases with different etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment. Sometimes in clinical practice, it is a great challenge to distinguish the two diseases. It was reported that the misdiagnosis rate between the two diseases could reach 50%-70%. The diagnosis of ITB can be made when acid fast bacilli (AFB) and granulomas with caseous necrosis are found in histopathology, but the positive rates are low. If ITB could not be excluded, 8–12 weeks of empirical antituberculosis treatment (ATT) is recommended, avoiding the severe adverse events if immunosuppressive drugs are prescribed to ITB patients by mistake. Nevertheless, the ATT can delay CD treatment, and ATT has many side effects. Hence, models that can be used at the bedside for easy and accurate differential diagnosis would be extremely useful in clinical practice. As a result, many researchers have tried to identify parameters and models that could improve the accuracy rate. For laboratory parameters, interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs, including T-SPOT and QuantiFERON-TB Gold) were important in differentiating ITB and CD, and a positive result was more likely to be ITB. For imaging characteristics, target sign, comb sign, adipose creeping sign and involvement of fewer than 4 segments were reported to be vital parameter, and the former three were more like to be the characteristics of CD, while the last was more likely to be ITB. For endoscopic parameters, longitudinal ulcers, transverse ulcers, aphthous ulcers, cobblestone, and stricture were proved to be useful, and transverse ulcers were specific to ITB, while the others were more likely to be CD. There parameters are of various kinds, and the scoring systems also vary from each other, and some models are complex to use. Therefore, we conducted this study to investigate the laboratory, imaging and endoscopic characteristics of CD and ITB, and to identify simple and useful algorithm for distinguishing the two diseases.

### Are biopsies from endoscopically normal terminal ileum necessary? [^116gyCqg]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The terminal ileum is typically examined during colonoscopies, especially in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and diarrhea. The yield from performing biopsies of endoscopically normal appearing terminal ileum is less clear, and may be associated with greater costs, healthcare utilization and risk. We aimed to determine whether the biopsy results from endoscopically normal terminal ileum affect clinical management.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent an ileocolonoscopy with terminal ileum biopsy at a multisite tertiary healthcare system. Patients with a diagnosis of IBD, prior ileocecal resection, or endoscopically abnormal appearing terminal ileum were excluded. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the electronic medical record. Comparison between patients was performed using Pearson's chi-square test.

Results

A total of 1018 consecutive patients were identified. Of the 299 who met the inclusion criteria, the majority were female (62.0%) and white (94.7%). Nearly 40% of the patients had a body mass index of 30 kg/m 2 or above (38.1%). Terminal ileum biopsies were abnormal in 13 patients (4.3%): 5 patients had chronic ileitis, 6 had acute ileitis, 1 had acute and chronic ileitis, and 1 had amyloid deposition. All patients with either chronic or acute ileitis had chronic diarrhea listed as an indication for their colonoscopy.

Conclusions

In patients with a normal appearing terminal ileum, clinically significant histologic abnormalities on biopsies were found in a very small percentage. Based on our findings, the routine biopsy of endoscopically normal appearing terminal ileum has limited diagnostic and therapeutic utility.

Abnormal terminal ileum histopathology by indication for colonoscopy*

Histology was abnormal in 13 patients (4.3%) (Table 3). Of those, 6 had acute ileitis, 5 had chronic ileitis, 1 had acute and chronic ileitis, and 1 had amyloidosis. There were no cases of eosinophilic ileitis. The finding of acute ileitis affected management in 2 of the 7 patients. These 2 patients had drug-induced injury and the indication for their colonoscopies was chronic diarrhea. The finding of chronic ileitis did not affect the management of any of the patients. The patient with acute and chronic ileitis underwent colonoscopy for suspected Crohn's disease and abnormal imaging, and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The patient with amyloidosis underwent colonoscopy for chronic diarrhea and suspected amyloidosis. In total, clinically significant diagnoses were made in 1.3% of all patients (n = 4).

### MR enteroclysis imaging of Crohn disease [^114yHP5R]. Radiographics (2001). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance (MR) enteroclysis imaging is emerging as a technique for evaluation of the small bowel in patients with Crohn disease. Administration of 1.5–2 L of isosmotic water solution through a nasojejunal catheter ensures distention of the bowel and facilitates identification of wall abnormalities. True fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP), half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE), and postgadolinium T1-weighted three-dimensional fast low-angle shot sequences can be employed in a comprehensive and integrated MR enteroclysis examination protocol to overcome specific disadvantages of each of the sequences involved. Superficial abnormalities that are ideally delineated with conventional enteroclysis are not consistently depicted with MR enteroclysis. The characteristic transmural abnormalities of Crohn disease such as bowel wall thickening, linear ulcers, and cobblestoning are accurately shown with MR enteroclysis imaging, especially with the true FISP sequence. MR enteroclysis is comparable to conventional enteroclysis in the detection of the number and extent of involved small bowel segments and in the disclosure of luminal narrowing or prestenotic intestinal dilatation. The clinical utility of MR enteroclysis in Crohn disease has not been fully established. At present, the method may be used for follow-up studies of known disease, estimation of disease activity, and determination of the extramucosal extent and spread of the disease process.

### Differential diagnosis of intestinal Behçet's disease and Crohn's disease by colonoscopic findings [^114wL3uo]. Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Intestinal Behçet's disease and Crohn's disease are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases that are difficult to distinguish from each other. We investigated their colonoscopic features and identified simple and valuable strategies for differential diagnosis.

Patients and Methods

Between 1995 and 2006, 250 consecutive patients with ulcers on colonoscopy (115 Behçet's, 135 Crohn's cases) were reviewed. All patients with Behçet's fulfilled the criteria of the International Study Group for Behçet's Disease or of the Behçet's Disease Research Committee of Japan, while Crohn's disease was confirmed by clinicopathological data. Patients were randomly allocated to a training set (70%) or a validation set (30%). Ulcer shapes, distributions, numbers, margins, and border contours, and the presence of aphthous, cobblestone, perianal, and strictured lesions were compared, in the training set. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed, using the X2-test and logistic regression. In addition, a classification and regression tree (CART) was then used to generate simplified algorithms for differential diagnosis.

Results

Round shape, five or fewer in number, focal distributions, and absence of aphthous and cobblestone lesions were significantly dominant features in Behçet's disease, according to multivariate analysis of the training set. The CART-generated algorithms proposed sequential use of shape (round, irregular/geographic, or longitudinal) and distribution (focal single/focal multiple, or segmental/diffuse). Diagnosis of Behçet's disease in the validation set produced sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of 94.3%, 90.0%, 94.7%, and 89.2%, respectively. Using the CART model, we made the correct diagnosis of intestinal Behçet's disease or Crohn's disease in 69 of 75 patients (92%).

Conclusion

It was determined that round and longitudinal ulcers are suggestive of Behçet's disease and Crohn's disease, respectively. Irregular/geographic-shaped ulcers and focal distributions are suggestive of Behçet's disease, while segmental/diffuse lesions suggest Crohn's.

### Crohn disease… [^112vqXPd]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Regional Ileitis, A Pathologic and Clinical Entity This article describes, in clinical and pathologic detail, a disease of the terminal ileum characterized by a subacute or chronic necrotizing and cicatrizing inflammation. The ulceration is reported to be accompanied by a disproportionate connective tissue reaction of the involved intestinal wall, which frequently leads to stenosis of the lumen and is associated with the formation of multiple fistulas. The disease is clinically featured by symptoms resembling those of ulcerative colitis, ie, fever, diarrhea, emaciation, and a mass in the right iliac fossa usually requiring surgical resection. The etiology is unknown. See PDF for full text of the original JAMA article.

In a 1932 issue of JAMA, Crohn, Ginzburg, and Oppenheimer1 brought into clear focus a new clinical entity with characteristic pathologic features that were previously only anecdotally recognized with uncertain meaning. 2 This disease, originally called regional ileitis, has now assumed Crohn's name to recognize the bellwether nature of these published findings1 and to account for the now recognized protean manifestations of this clinical syndrome that may involve the entire gastrointestinal tract without restriction to the ileum as originally described. This was pathologically characterized by transmural and segmental inflammation of the intestines with granulomas, linear ulcerations, and a "cobblestone" appearance. Perhaps most presciently, they categorized the now well-accepted subtypes of disease behavior as ulcerative, stenotic, perforating, or fistulizing.

The therapeutic implications of these discoveries are profound and amazingly may be outdistanced as investigators worldwide currently race to complete the first sequencing of the human intestinal microbiome, which has been largely driven by the need to understand IBD pathogenesis. Since the number of cells in the human body is 10% human and 90% intestinal bacterial, the opportunities for understanding CD and numerous other clinical entities at an even deeper level are just on the horizon.

A fluid collection with a thickened, hyper-enhancing wall corresponding to an abscess (star) is seen anteriorly to a bowel wall segment with thick walls at the level of the neo-terminal ileum (arrows) in a patient who had already undergone surgery due to Crohn's terminal ileitis

Although CT is by far the most frequent examination undertaken in this setting, we cannot simply discard gastrointestinal contrast studies just yet. A recent study found small bowel follow-through (SBFT) to be more sensitive and specific than CT for detecting recurrent CD in the neo-terminal ileum because of its ability to depict aphthoid ulcers not detectable on CT. Other findings of Crohn's recurrence at SBFT are luminal narrowing, thickened folds and deep ulcerations ("rose thorn" ulcers) (Fig. 23).

Barium follow-through of a patient with active Crohn's disease: there is severe irregular narrowing of the neo-terminal ileum, with separation from adjacent bowel loops and with some areas of cobblestoning (curved arrow) and linear deep ulcers (arrows)

Ulcerative colitis

Ulcerative colitis is normally continuous from the rectum to the colon. Total proctocolectomy is the definitive treatment for the disease, but two other types of surgery are usually performed to obviate the disadvantages of a permanent colostomy.

Patients who receive total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis are at risk for disease recurrence at the rectum, and thus clinical and endoscopic follow-up are advised. When proctocolectomy with ileal-anal pouch is chosen, there is an increased probability of the patient developing pouchitis (ileal pouch inflammation). The diagnosis depends on clinical, endoscopic and histopathological data, and there is usually no role for diagnostic imaging in this setting.

### Chronic active EBV infection in refractory enteritis with longitudinal ulcers with a cobblestone appearance: an autopsied case report [^113MHWH6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is defined as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive T/NK cell-related neoplasia, and its major clinical symptom is systemic inflammation presenting as infectious mononucleocytosis, whereas enteritis and diarrhea are minor clinical symptoms. The complex mixture of tumorigenic processes of EBV-positive cells and physical symptoms of systemic inflammatory disease constitutes the varied phenotypes of CAEBV. Herein, we describe a case of CAEBV that was initially diagnosed as Crohn's disease (CD) based on ileal ulcers and clinical symptoms of enteritis.

Case Presentation

A 19-year-old woman complained of abdominal pain and fever. Blood examination showed normal blood cell counts without atypical lymphocyte but detected modest inflammation, hypoalbuminemia, slight liver dysfunction, and evidence of past EBV infection. The esophagogastroduodenoscopic findings were normal. However, colonoscopy revealed a few small ulcers in the terminal ileum. The jejunum and ileum also exhibited various forms of ulcers, exhibiting a cobblestone appearance, on capsule endoscopy. Based on these clinical findings, she was strongly suspected with CD. In the course of treatment by steroid and biologics for refractory enteritis, skin ulcers appeared about 50 months after her initial hospital visit. Immunohistology of her skin biopsy revealed proliferation of EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER)-positive atypical lymphocytes. We retrospectively assessed her previous ileal ulcer biopsy before treatment and found many EBER-positive lymphocytes. Blood EBV DNA was also positive. Therefore, she was diagnosed with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma with CAEBV-related enteritis rather than CD. She was treated with cyclosporine and prednisolone combination therapy for CAEBV-related systemic inflammation and chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma. Unfortunately, her disease continued to progress, leading to multiple organ failure and death at the age of 23 years.

Conclusion

Clinicians need to remember the possibility of CAEBV as a differential diagnosis of refractory enteritis. Enteritis with intestinal ulcer is a rare symptom of CAEBV, and it is impossible to acquire a definitive diagnosis by ulcer morphology only. In cases where the possibility of CAEBV remains, tissue EBVR expression should be checked by in situ hybridization and blood EBV DNA.

Imaging features

The bowel can be evaluated by plain radiographs, ultrasound (US), barium studies, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET)-CT. The role of abdominal radiographs is limited except in emergencies like acute intestinal obstruction or suspected gastrointestinal perforation. A chest radiograph may be useful as approximately one-fourth of GITB patients may have evidence (past or current) of pulmonary TB. Barium studies, including barium meal follow-through (BMFT) and enteroclysis, although popular in the past, are not frequently performed now. This is because of declining expertise in interpreting barium studies, higher radiation exposure, and also because of advances in cross-sectional imaging (CT/MR enterography and enteroclysis), which have allowed simultaneous assessment of luminal and extraluminal pathology. Typical findings on a BMFT in GITB include linear or transverse ulcers in the terminal ileum, short segment strictures, and contracted and pulled-up caecum. Fleischner's sign due to patulous and gaping IC valve associated with narrowing of the terminal ileum, and Steirlin sign, which is rapid emptying of barium from the caecum to ascending colon due to irritable caecal mucosa may be seen in GITB. The other features are purse string stenosis opposite to the IC valve associated with dilated terminal ileum. On the contrary, BMFT in patients with CD shows aphthous ulcerations, deep ulcerations, longitudinal ulcerations, cobblestone appearance, and fistulas. There may be sacculations on the antimesenteric border because of the shortening of the mesenteric border as longitudinal ulcers heal by fibrosis. Involvement of multiple segments of the bowel along with normal intervening segments are characteristic of CD. Although the findings mentioned above are characteristic of CD, none are pathognomonic. The sensitivity of BMFT to detect CD is 67–72%.

Clinical and research consequences

Diagnosing IBD

Endoscopic examination is an essential part of the diagnostic work up for all patients with suspected IBD, and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) guidelines state that ileocolonoscopy with biopsies is the preferred method to confirm the diagnosis and allow an accurate assessment of disease extent and severity. Despite the high diagnostic accuracy of endoscopy, which can be further enhanced by histopathological examination of biopsies adequately sampling all the examined bowel segments, a minority of cases will remain undifferentiated at the index examination, while other patients will be reclassified over time [i.e. from Crohn's disease (CD) to ulcerative colitis (UC) and vice versa]. Establishing the right diagnosis is of the utmost importance owing to the differences in the therapeutic approach between CD and UC; ECCO guidelines currently recommend repeat endoscopy and additional biopsies as a means to enhance the diagnostic yield for cases where a definite diagnosis cannot be established after the initial evaluation. There is limited data to challenge or expand the guideline recommendations in this particular area. The first (index) ileocolonoscopy has the best accuracy for distinguishing between UC and CD of the colon, as medical therapy can change the endoscopic appearance of the bowel, especially in the setting of incomplete mucosal healing. Differentiating between the two types of IBD is usually easy if there is extracolonic involvement. At least 20–30% of CD patientspresent with lesions located proximally to the ileocecal valve, possibly out of the reach of the colonoscope and in 13% of cases the disease occurs in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The involvement of terminal ileum, once considered a hallmark for CD, may be present as 'backwash ileitis' in 10–25% of patients with established UC. In this instances, techniques such as video capsule endoscopy (CE), confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), or small-bowel endoscopy (SBE) could be helpful in clarifying the diagnosis. A recent metaanalysisshowed that CE found more intestinal lesions compared with computed tomography enterography (68% versus 21%, p < 0.00001) and ileocolonoscopy (47% versus 25%, p = 0.009), but not magnetic resonance enterography (55% versus 45%, p = 0.43).

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^112Wpkax]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease endoscopy — ileoscopy and backwash ileitis identification states that ileoscopy is fundamental for distinguishing true Crohn's disease (CD) ileitis from ulcerative colitis (UC) with backwash ileitis, which "occurs in up to 25% of patients with UC with pancolitis". Backwash ileitis is characterized endoscopically by "a short, contiguous segment of mildly inflamed ileum without stricture, stenosis, or significant ulcerations" that appears continuous with cecal colitis, whereas features that favor CD ileitis include "extensive inflammation", inflammation without pancolitis, patchiness, greater severity than cecal inflammation, and "discrete ulcers or stricturing of the terminal ileum or ileocecal valve". In UC, a "cecal patch" around the appendiceal orifice "should not be misdiagnosed as CD", and studies show UC patients with a cecal patch have a "similar rate of remission, relapse, and proximal extension" compared with those without a cecal patch.

Crohn disease (CD) diagnosis and endoscopic differentiation — Epidemiological definitions of CD are more variable; diagnosis is straightforward with clear radiographic and/or endoscopic evidence of small bowel involvement, multiple noncaseating granulomas on endoscopic mucosal biopsy, or evidence of severe perianal disease, but when CD is limited to the colon without granulomas the diagnosis is more difficult and differentiation from UC is based on focal discontinuous inflammation, deep fissuring ulcers, and aphthous lesions on a background of normal mucosa; UC shows diffuse erythema, friability, granularity, and loss of vascular pattern, whereas colonic CD shows deep fissuring ulcers and cobblestoned mucosa.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) nonclassic features at presentation — nonclassic clinical, endoscopic, and histological findings may be present in a child presenting with UC, and these findings include backwash ileitis, gastritis, periappendiceal inflammation, patchiness, and rectal sparing. Table 4 examples that do not exclude a diagnosis of UC include small anal fissures or skin tags (< 5 mm), gastritis without aphthae, Backwash ileitis — ileal erythema without linear ulceration, rectal inflammation less severe than in more proximal colon (relative rectal sparing), microscopic ileitis without granuloma, microscopic gastritis without granuloma, relative rectal sparing, and patchiness (normal colonic mucosa between 2 areas of colonic inflammation). Backwash ileitis is a term used originally to describe an abnormal appearance of the terminal ileum observed radiologically or endoscopically in patients with ulcerative pancolitis.

### Small bowel imaging in Crohn's disease patients [^114ctQb6]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Additional signs of mural disease may include ulceration (Fig. 1C) and a "cobblestone" appearance, characteristic of multiple continuous bowel wall ulcerations. Mural stratification entails the visualization of the different layers of the bowel wall (Fig. 1A). When present, the inner mucosa and outer serosa enhance avidly, but the intervening bowel wall can have various degrees of attenuation, depending on what pathological process is present. The presence of intramural edema (target sign) indicates active inflammation, whilst the presence of intramural fat indicates past or chronic inflammation on CTE and MRE. On US, partial or complete loss of the normal gut stratification results in diffuse hypoechogenicity of the bowel wall with a central echogenic line corresponding to the narrowed bowel.

A distinct advantage of cross-sectional imaging compared to endoscopy is its ability to evaluate the mesentery. CT density of the mesentery > 60 Hounsfield units (HU) is usually defined as severe disease, levels > 20 HU but ≤ 60 HU are classified as mild, and levels ≤ 20 HU are considered normal. Mesenteric fibrofatty proliferation is seen as finger-like projections of mesenteric fat, which extend towards and encase the anti-mesenteric border of the bowel, resulting in bowel loop separation. Although this "creeping fat phenomenon" (Fig. 1D) is a sign of CD, it persists in clinically quiescent disease.

The severity of mesenteric hypervascularity, known as the "comb sign" (Fig. 1A, B), is determined according to the diameter of each vessel. Vessels exhibiting a diameter twice that of normal are usually considered severe, while those with a diameter less than twice the normal diameter, but still with noticeable expansion, are considered mild. This is created by edematous, engorged and hypervascular mesenteric vasa recta vessels, which penetrate the bowel wall perpendicular to the bowel lumen. Engorged vasa recta indicate active inflammation and have been associated with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and longer hospital stays in patients with severe CD.

The presence of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (> 10 mm) is another feature of active inflammation (Fig. 1B). Intestinal stenosis is classified according to the constitutive narrowness of the intestinal lumen. A lumen > 11 mm is defined as normal, < 6 mm as severe, with measurements in between 6 and 11 mm being classified as mild.

### Are biopsies from endoscopically normal terminal ileum necessary? [^112Ysyc5]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Very few patients with a normal appearing terminal ileum had abnormal histopathology, and even fewer had clinically significant diagnoses that affected management. Of the 6 patients with acute ileitis, 2 had drug-induced injury (leflunomide and multiple breast cancer chemotherapy agents) which resolved clinically with cessation of the medications. Three patients were not given a specific diagnosis and had resolution of acute ileitis on subsequent examination. One patient was suspected to have prior radiation-induced injury. Of the 5 patients with chronic ileitis, 3 were not given specific diagnoses, but the differential included use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The other 2 patients had backwash ileitis from lymphocytic colitis, which was present on colon biopsies from the same exam. The patient with acute and chronic ileitis was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, based on enterography findings of multifocal small bowel lesions and terminal ileum biopsy histopathology.

To our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective review of patients who underwent terminal ileum biopsy during colonoscopy and the first to assess the clinical significance of the findings. Sayilir et al examined the diagnostic value of performing biopsies of an endoscopically normally appearing terminal ileum for chronic diarrhea. They found abnormal histopathology in 4.4% of all patients and 5.9% of patients with non-bloody diarrhea. For all of these patients, these findings neither resulted in a diagnosis, nor changed their clinical management. Abnormal pathology findings included elevated intraepithelial lymphocytes, shown to be commonly present in asymptomatic patients. Koskal et al found a comparable rate of abnormal histopathology with chronic ileitis present in 5.5% of patients with endoscopically normal terminal ileum. However, patients with known IBD were included in this study, whereas we excluded them from our study. A similar study by McHugh et al evaluated biopsies taken from endoscopically normal terminal ileum, including patients with known IBD. Abnormal histopathology was found in 5.1% of patients (17 cases). Fourteen of those cases were chronic ileitis, 1 of which was backwash ileitis from ulcerative colitis. The diagnostic yield of performing biopsies of normal appearing terminal ileum was statistically significant for the indication of Crohn's disease only. For indications of diarrhea, abdominal pain, hematochezia and abnormal imaging, there was no statistically significant diagnostic yield. Yusoff et al focused on patients undergoing colonoscopy for diarrhea, where 158 of 1131 patients had terminal ileum biopsy with endoscopically normal appearing terminal ileum. None of these biopsies had clinical significance.

Diagnostic approach shifts and misclassification risk — Before 1990 diagnosis used a combination of clinical features, radiography, and pathological features at bowel resection, whereas recent studies place less emphasis on radiographic studies such as barium enema and emphasize histology to confirm endoscopic findings; examples include criteria where focal disease or inflammation extending below the muscularis mucosa on colonic biopsy changed a diagnosis from UC to CD and where any microscopic ileal inflammation excluded UC, yet the histologic criteria were not well standardized and overreliance on histology without integrating clinical and gross endoscopic findings may inappropriately classify UC as CD.

A mild increase in eosinophils in cecal biopsies may represent checkpoint inhibitor microscopic colitis (Fig. 6). These abnormalities were distinct and different from a Crohn's disease-like appearance of the distal ileum.

Nivolumab is an anti-PD1 antibody and is a checkpoint inhibitor. A case series of 20 patients with immune-mediated gastroenterocolitis associated with PD-1 inhibitors summarizes the endoscopic findings that can be encountered. Endoscopic features may include normal mucosa, mild erythema, focal erosions, congested/granular mucosa, and ulceration. These features can be patchy, with apparent distal sparing of the disease. Two patients from the case series had ileitis without colonic involvement. It has been suggested that checkpoint-inhibitor colitis may represent a distinct type of inflammatory bowel disease; Bertha et aldescribed a case of ipilimumab-induced colitis transforming into a Crohn's colitis-like phenotype with severe deep ulceration and skip lesions. Although the endoscopic and clinical features may be similar to those of inflammatory bowel disease, there are key differences histologically, with an acute inflammatory histologic profile associated more with checkpoint-inhibitor–associated colitis. As in our case, although the ileum was involved, the histologic appearance was not consistent with Crohn's disease. The endoscopic appearance of the ileum did not have aphthous ulcers, linear ulcers, cobblestoning, or vascular pattern changes.

### Immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction: importance in the diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis in a Peruvian population [^113Gp8pa]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study, the ileocecal region was the most frequent site affected by tuberculosis which is consistent with previous studies. In fact, TB can compromise any level of the gastrointestinal tract, from the esophagus to the anus; however, the ileocecal region is the most affected area, accounting for 44%-84% of all gastrointestinal tuberculosis cases. Most authors believe that in these areas, the presence of lymphoid tissue and the physiologic stasis of the cecum promotes mycobacterial growth. This predilection for ileocecal region complicates the differentiation of tuberculosis from Crohn's disease, where ileocecal involvement is similar.

While upper gastrointestinal tract involvement by tuberculosis is rare, we found a greater rate (12.1%) of duodenum involvement than previously reported (1%-6%). Multisegmented involvement of the colon has been rarely reported. Only one report indicates the colonic involvement distribution in single and multiple site lesions (31% and 36%, respectively). In our study, multisegmented colonic involvement was found in 21.2% of cases.

In our study, ulcer was the most frequent endoscopic finding, mostly reported by the gastroenterologists as multiple, consistent with previous reports. However, the endoscopic presentation of intestinal tuberculosis is quite variable and also includes tumors, strictures, erosions, and nodularity of the mucosa. These endoscopic findings, however, were present only in a small group of patients in our study. The distinction between intestinal TB from Crohn´s disease ulcer can be a true challenge, especially when nodularity of the mucosa layer is described as "cobblestone". This endoscopic finding has been regularly related to Crohn´s disease, which makes the differential diagnosis even more difficult; however, four parameters have been proposed. These parameters would be more common in Crohn's disease than in intestinal TB, and they are: aphthous ulcers, longitudinal ulcers, anorectal lesions, and cobblestone appearance. Additionally, the mucosa surrounding intestinal TB ulcers tends to be abnormal (edematous, erythematous, irregular, or nodular), whereas the mucosa surrounding Crohn´s disease ulcers tends to be normal.

### Chronic active EBV infection in refractory enteritis with longitudinal ulcers with a cobblestone appearance: an autopsied case report [^114i37nf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, the first report of a case with gastrointestinal tract complications of CAEBV had serious colorectal bleeding. Later, in the 2000s, there were several reports of CAEBV with gastrointestinal tract complications, which had initially been misdiagnosed as IBD. Approximately 6% CAEBV-related deaths originated from intestinal bleeding or perforation. As summarized in the Additional file 2: Table S2, the ulcer morphology of "cobblestone appearance" characteristic of CD was first found in our current case, but this was not observed in all 27 previously reported CAEBV-related enteritis cases. According to the endoscopic features of these 28 cases, the diseased lesion was located in the colon (13 cases), small intestine (five cases), concomitant colon and small intestine (five cases), concomitant colon and ileocecal junction (one case), concomitant colon and stomach (one case), ileocecal junction (one case), and unknown location (two cases). Ulcer morphologies have generally been reported as small, shallow, irregular-shaped, and scattered, with the exception of eight cases of huge and profound ulcers. There was also a previous case in which the entire intestinal mucosa displayed lymphangiectasia. In our case, many small aphthous ulcers were found in the whole intestine, and a cobblestone appearance was observed, especially in the ileum, whereas no ulcer was found in the colon. These aphthous ulcers remained after intensive treatment with steroids and biologics. Based on these findings, CAEBV-related enteritis might present various ulcer morphologies depending on the reaction of each therapeutic treatment and/or time course. To detect intestinal lesions, we adopted CE, which has been increasingly used worldwide since its establishment in 2000. With the advent of CE, various diseases have been clearly visualized, resulting in a paradigm shift in the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel disease. According to a nationwide study in Japan, the frequent findings of CE in patients with CD include cobblestone appearance (occurrence rate: 33%), longitudinal ulcer (78%), irregular ulcer (84%), liner erosion (90%), irregular erosion (89%), circumferential alignment of diminutive lesions (75%), and longitudinal alignment of diminutive lesions (56%). In this previous study, Esaki et al. observed that the endoscopic diagnosis varied in endoscopist's clinical knowledge and proficiency; hence, this issue should be overcome. In this case, CD was most probable because ulcers with a cobblestone appearance were detected in the ileum. However, other characteristic findings, such as the bamboo joint-like appearance of the gastric mucosa in esophagogastroduodenoscopy, focally enhanced gastritis, and granuloma on histological evaluation were not actually confirmed.

3 Ulcerative colitis

3.1 Diagnosis

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by mucosal inflammation starting distally in the rectum, with continuous extension proximally for a variable distance, often with an abrupt demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa. Typically, patients with UC experience periods of relapse and remission. Up to 90% will have one or more relapses after the first attack, and early relapse or active disease in the first 2 years is associated with a worse disease course subsequently.

Statement 1. Where ulcerative colitis is diagnosed by sigmoidoscopy, we recommend a full ileocolonoscopy to delineate disease extent, severity of inflammation and to exclude Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In patients presenting with suspected UC, stool cultures and Clostridium difficile toxin assay should always be performed to rule out infective causes. While UC is often initially diagnosed at flexible (or rigid) sigmoidoscopy, it is important to confirm the diagnosis, extent and severity of disease by means of full ileocolonoscopy, usually within the first year, as this can more definitively confirm the diagnosis of UC versus Crohn's disease and give information that may help to predict future disease course, including potential and risk stratification for dysplasia, and thus will influence treatment choices. For histological assessment at least two biopsy specimens should be taken from five sites throughout the examined bowel, including the ileum and rectum, during the initial endoscopic evaluation.

Rectal sparing in UC has been described in up to > 3% of patients, but more frequently patchy inflammation of the rectum may be seen in those who have been given empirical topical therapy. The presence of a 'caecal patch', isolated peri-appendiceal inflammation and backwash ileitis can occur in UC, but if the histology and clinical pattern are not otherwise typical of UC, then small bowel evaluation is required to exclude Crohn's disease (see Section 4.1.3.1: Crohn's disease, Cross-sectional imaging: CT, MR and small bowel ultrasound). Backwash ileitis has been reported in up to 20% of patients with extensive colitis.

3.1.1 Histology

No histological feature is diagnostic of UC, but the combination of basal plasmacytosis, diffuse crypt atrophy and distortion, villous surface irregularity and mucus depletion are suggestive of a diagnosis of UC in the correct clinical context. Uneven distribution of inflammation within the colon or within biopsies can occur in patients with long-standing disease, or after treatment.

### Differentiating gastrointestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease-a comprehensive review [^114RTaTn]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

GITB and CD show both macroscopic and microscopic differences. Macroscopic features of GITB are short strictures, marked inflammatory thickening, fibrosis, and adhesions. Ulcerations are also a prominent feature of GITB and are transverse and often circumferential with ill-defined, sloping, or overhanging edges. The surrounding mucosal areas show changes like flattened mucosal folds, ulcerations, erosions, and pseudopolyps. Cross section of the intestinal wall often shows a loss of distinction between the different intestinal wall layers due to scar tissue and necrosis. Multiple 2–5 mm nodules and adhesions can be present within the serosa. Furthermore, GITB patients show enlarged regional lymph nodes with possible caseation.

Like GITB, CD also shows bowel wall thickening and strictures, although these are typically longer. Additionally, CD patients often present with adhesions, fistulae, sinuses and extra-intestinal abscesses. Different types of ulcerations can be seen in CD ranging from deep longitudinal fissuring ulcers to smaller longitudinal ones separating oedematous or unaffected parts of the mucosa creating a cobblestone pattern. Ulcers are seen to change with disease stages, appearing small aphthous in the initial phases and coalescing, and evolving to larger stellate ulcers.

### A case of darier disease with perioral cutaneous cobblestoning treated with dupilumab [^114WHTg5]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Perioral cutaneous cobblestoning is an unusual feature that does not fall into the classic features of DD. It is unclear if cutaneous cobblestoning represents a new clinical variant, represents the natural disease course in an untreated patient or if this finding is under-reported in the literature. Further studies are needed in order to fully investigate this finding. To the author's knowledge, treatment of DD with dupilumab has not yet been reported in the literature. In this case of severe DD, dupilumab led to modest improvement in the patient's clinical condition and resolution of pruritus. While further studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanism and efficacy, dupilumab may have a role in the treatment of DD, especially in the treatment of itch.

Can CLE distinguish between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)?

The diagnostic differentiation between CD and UC remains challenging contemporary gut pathology, but the differentiation is important for treatment strategy, surveillance, and surgical management. It often involves a diagnostic orchestration between clinical, endoscopic, radiographic, and histopathologic criteria. In cases where there is an immediate need for a rapid "endodiagnostic tool", particularly when patients have impaired coagulation or have high perforation risk (i.e. fulminant colitis) where conventional biopsy excision is not possible, CLE can provide a practical alternative.

In personal clinical observations by Hundorfean et al, CLE-based criteria were proposed to help distinguish between CD and UC. In CD, mucosal fissures, focal cryptitis, granulomas, and microscopic inflammation of the terminal ileum were seen. In contrast, UC patients often had characteristic bifid crypts, shortened and branched crypts with a microscopically normal terminal ileum. However, further studies are necessary to validate these CLE criteria in the differentiation between CD and UC. Additionally, with future technical refinement of CLE, deeper microscopic aspects beyond 250 µm may allow for visualization of features such as submucosal granulomas or thickening of muscularis mucosae, which may allow for further refinement of these diagnostic features.

### Imaging of small intestinal Crohn's disease: comparison between MR enteroclysis and conventional enteroclysis [^112T89fG]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to compare MR enteroclysis (MRE) with conventional enteroclysis (CE) in patients with small intestinal Crohn's disease. Fifty-two consecutive patients with known or suspected Crohn's disease underwent MR and conventional enteroclysis, which was considered the gold standard. Eleven imaging features, classified in three groups, mucosal, transmural and extraintestinal, were subjectively evaluated by two experienced radiologists. MRE and CE were in full agreement in revealing, localizing and estimating the length of all involved segments of the small bowel. The sensitivity of MRE for the detection of superficial ulcers, fold distortion and fold thickening was 40, 30 and 62.5%, respectively. The sensitivity of MRE for the detection of deep ulcers, cobble-stoning pattern, stenosis and prestenostic dilatation was 89.5, 92.3, 100 and 100%, respectively. Additional findings demonstrated on MRE images included fibrofatty proliferation in 15 cases and mesenteric lymphadenopathy in 19 cases. MRE strongly correlates with CE in the detection of individual lesions expressing small intestinal Crohn's disease. It provides additional information from the mesenteries; however, its capability to detect subtle lesions is still inferior to conventional enteroclysis.

Imaging — barium radiography is described as well established for differentiating ulcerative colitis (UC) from Crohn disease (CD): in CD of the ileum "the terminal ileum, ileocecal valve, and cecum demonstrate various degrees of narrowing, ulceration, and stenosis", whereas "in backwash ileitis the terminal ileum has a granular appearance, the ileocecal valve is wide open, and the cecum is a normal caliber", supporting that "the barium radiograph has a well-established role… in the differentiation of UC from CD", and "it is the opinion of the experts in this working group that a barium radiographic examination of the stomach and small intestine is an important part of the evaluation in a child with new-onset IBD".

### Are biopsies from endoscopically normal terminal ileum necessary? [^112ktGzc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The terminal ileum is often intubated and examined during colonoscopy procedures. Endoscopic evidence of inflammation in the terminal ileum can indicate a broad differential diagnosis, including Crohn's disease, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, infectious enteritis such as tuberculosis, as well as idiopathic ileitis. For evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a terminal ileum examination and biopsy is commonly utilized to establish a diagnosis. The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy supports biopsy of the terminal ileum for patients with diarrhea in case of suspected IBD, abnormal appearing terminal ileum on imaging, or endoscopically abnormal appearing terminal ileum. Even when the terminal ileum appears endoscopically normal, there is diagnostic value in obtaining terminal ileum biopsies for suspected IBD.

In the non-IBD population, routine examination and biopsy of the terminal ileum has an inconsistent yield, with abnormal findings reported in 0–5.9% of patients. This is particularly controversial if the terminal ileum appears normal. Biopsies of normal appearing terminal ileum may be associated with greater costs and healthcare utilization, risk, and increased levels of anxiety for patients. One study estimates the cost to be $430 per bottle of terminal ileum biopsies. The benefits of obtaining biopsies from a normal appearing terminal ileum remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether biopsies of normal appearing terminal ileum yielded clinically significant diagnoses that affected the management of patients who were evaluated in our institution.

### Endoscopic features and clinical course of patients with asymptomatic cecal ulcers [^1156FkHD]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, patients with an asymptomatic cecal ulcer may develop diseases such as colonic tuberculosis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Larger ulcer size (> 1 cm), terminal ileum involvement and ulcers with irregular fold were three endoscopic risk factors associated with clinically significant diseases. When the above features are present, patients should be closely monitored even if they are asymptomatic.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^1125gDQu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Crohn's disease — natural history and risk factors indicate progression risks and monitoring needs: Most patients initially present with nonpenetrating, nonstricturing behavior, but up to half develop an intestinal complication within 20 yr of diagnosis, particularly with ileal, ileocolonic, or proximal gastrointestinal involvement, extensive anatomic involvement, or deep ulcerations. High-risk features for progressive burden include young age at diagnosis, initial extensive bowel involvement, ileal/ileocolonic involvement, perianal/severe rectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations at diagnosis, and penetrating or stenosis phenotype. Over long observation, only 20%–30% have a nonprogressive or indolent course. Symptoms do not correlate well with active inflammation and therefore should not be the sole guide for therapy; objective evaluation by endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging should be used periodically. In the absence of immunomodulator or biologic treatment, corticosteroid dependency and/or resistance occurs in up to half of patients.

### Florid reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of terminal ileum [^113jqLzj]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Florid lymphoid hyperplasia in the terminal ileum can present to surgeons as an acute abdominal pain. Only few cases were reported in the literature. Our case illustrates that a rare case of florid lymphoid hyperplasia can present to surgeons as acute appendicitis. During the operation the gross appearance may mimic Crohn's disease. A limited resection is sufficient to clinch the diagnosis of florid lymphoid hyperplasia / Crohn's disease. In florid lymphoid hyperplasia limited resection may be curative.

### Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young adults: report of a working group of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the Crohn's and colitis foundation of America [^116Uz7ZJ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) versus Crohn disease (CD) in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — endoscopic and histological differentiators are detailed: Patients with UC may have histological features such as microscopic inflammation of the ileum, histological gastritis, periappendiceal inflammation, patchiness, and relative rectal sparing at the time of diagnosis. These findings should not prompt the clinician to change the diagnosis from UC to CD. Other endoscopic findings, such as macroscopic cobblestoning, segmental colitis, ileal stenosis and ulceration, perianal disease, and multiple granulomas in the small bowel or colon more strongly suggest a diagnosis of CD. An algorithm is provided to enable the clinician to differentiate more reliably between the 2 entities.

### Salpingographic demonstration of "cobblestone" mucosa of the distal tubes is indicative of irreversible mucosal damage [^111cJaFW]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish the predictive value of the observation of a "cobblestone" pattern of the distal tube mucosa shown on the selective salpingogram as an indicator of significant and probably irreparable damage to the ciliated epithelium.

Design

Clinical study.

Setting

Fertility and Laser Center and Academic Radiology Department.

Patient(S)

Patients with primary or secondary infertility and obstruction of the fallopian tubes documented on hysterosalpingogram.

Intervention(S)

Transcervical recanalization of obstructed tubes followed by reassessment by selective salpingogram.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Progression of mucosal disease with resultant low likelihood of intrauterine pregnancies and high probability of ectopic pregnancy.

Result(S)

In 32 asymptomatic patients, there was progression to coalescence and agglutination of mucosal folds in 13, to a thick wall pyosalpinx in 4. Five thin wall and 8 thick wall hydrosalpinges in asymptomatic patients showed no significant progression of mucosal disease but increasing peritubular fibrosis. In 12 symptomatic patients, progressive fusion of mucosal folds with polypoid hyperplasia was observed in 11, a thin wall hydrosalpinx in 2.

Conclusion(S)

Cobblestone appearance of the distal tubes heralds significant mucosal damage, prone to progressive disease and hence, a poor chance for conception.

### Can microscopic ileitis in patients with clinically suspected inflammatory bowel disease predict the future? [^111Q8N9d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ileocolonoscopy that includes performance of terminal ileum biopsies plays an essential role in the diagnostic work-up for suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It may aid in ruling out various infectious, inflammatory or functional disorders that may mimic IBD. When typical or suspicious endoscopic findings are encountered, multiple representative biopsies from terminal ileum (TI) and colon segments are warranted.

Performance of biopsies on a colon and a TI that appear normal during endoscopy, however, constitutes a dilemma for practitioners, as they are willing to complete the diagnostic evaluation by integrating histological data, but they are aware of the possible low diagnostic yield as well as the risks of prolonged or complicated procedures.

The importance of random biopsies in specific indications in a colon that appears normal in endoscopy has been proved in several studies. However, the role of biopsies in the TI under these circumstances is still not well defined. The predominant attitude in the literature is that biopsies from a normally appearing TI have a low diagnostic yield and are not routinely recommended.

However, the clinical setting and the indication for the procedure is of paramount importance and may be correlated with the diagnostic yield when performing biopsies in a suitable setting. Thus, TI biopsies may be of greatest value for patients who undergo endoscopy for known or strongly suspected Crohn's disease. Moreover, cases have been demonstrated of inflammatory as well as infectious disorders that have been diagnosed merely by biopsy when the TI appeared normal in endoscopy.

In our practice, during the ileocolonoscopy procedure in patients referred for suspected IBD, biopsies are usually undertaken from the TI whether or not it shows a normal endoscopic appearance. Histopathologic examinations of these biopsies frequently show normal findings, but frequently reveal changes that are consistent with chronic ileitis or other nonspecific inflammation. The significance of such microscopic ileitis (MI) and the correlation of these histological findings with long-term clinical outcome are unknown. These issues are addressed in this study and compared with the outcome of normal TI biopsy findings to appreciate the predictive value of MI in future diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

### Unveiling the superior diagnostic efficacy of double-balloon endoscopy compared to small intestine dual-energy CT enterography in small bowel Crohn's disease [^115CuSwf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Evaluation method

Two senior endoscopists and radiologists independently assessed the DBE and DECTE images in a blinded manner to determine the presence of CD, stenosis, fistulas, perianal lesions, and ulcers (Figs. 1 and 2).

Fig. 1
Double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) performances. a Bleeding: The terminal ileum exhibits bleeding from longitudinal ulcers, with associated tortuosity of the intestinal lumen. b Cobblestone Sign: A characteristic pebble-like mucosal edema was observed in the ileum, specifically 120 cm to the ileocecal valve, indicative of the cobblestone appearance. The cobblestone appearance has important clinical significance, aiding in the accurate diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and assessment of CD. c Longitudinal Ulcer: At 50–120cm from the ileocecal valve, a longitudinal deep ulcerative lesion, measuring approximately 70 cm in length, was discernible in the ileum. The clinical significance of longitudinal ulcers in the intestine involves multiple aspects, including indicating intestinal inflammation and assessing disease severity. Endoscopic longitudinal ulcers, which vary in length, are one of the clues for diagnosing CD. To distinguish them from aphthous ulcers, ulcers ≥ 2 cm in length are defined as long ulcers in this study. The severity of long ulcers in CD can reflect the progression of the disease. d Stenosis: A stricture is observed 150 cm from the Treitz ligament, with the mucosa at the site of narrowing showing nodular hyperplastic changes. e Ulcer: Scattered aphthous-like ulcers were identified within the terminal ileum. f Fistula: Distal jejunum (180 cm from the ligament of Treitz) with luminal stenosis, where ulcers and fistulas are visible at the site of stenosis. More fistulas indicate more severe disease and a higher risk of complications

Fig. 2
Dual-energy computed tomography enterography (DECTE) performances. a Ulcers: Multiple ulcers were identified within segments 6 of the small intestine, as well as at the ileocecal valve. b Clustered Mucosa: The mucous membrane of the ileum demonstrated localized immobilization and a star-like configuration, which is suggestive of a healed intestinal fistula. c & d Stenosis: Multiple instances of intestinal wall thickening in the small intestine. Following an enhanced scan, these areas exhibited moderate or greater enhancement, indicative of local intestinal stenosis

### Terminal ileitis is not always Crohn's disease [^117PRn9C]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Malignant disease

Primary malignant tumors of the small intestine are easy to be misdiagnosed because of nonspecific symptoms and signs and the limited examination methods. In the ileum, malignant lymphoma constitutes about half of all malignancies (48.3% in this group), followed by adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma and carcinoid tumors.

Small bowel lymphoma originates in the lymphoid follicle of the submucosa and may be solitary or diffuse. The solitary form tends to encircle the bowel, narrow the lumen and mimic CD clinically, radiologicaly and endoscopicaly. The diffuse form shows multisegment involvement with Terminal numerous polypoidal excrescences. Enlarged nodes in the mesentery adjacent to the lesion are common in primary lymphoma of the small bowel. Lymphoma most commonly manifests as single or multiple segmental areas of markedly thickened (1.5–7 cm) circumferential thickening, or may ulcerate with formation of a fistulous tract to adjacent bowel loops, mimicking CD.

90% of carcinoid tumors originate from the distal ileum or appendix (the embryologic midgut). Small-bowel adenocarcinoma, like other small bowel tumors, has a non-specific clinical manifestation. Since most of these lesions occur within 25 cm of the duodenojejunal junction, patients with pain, vomiting, and anemia should have assessment of the proximal jejunum as part of an extended upper-GI investigation. Most (70%) duodenal carcinomas are polypoid, larger lesions tend to ulcerate, and infiltrative duodenal carcinomas are relatively rare. Depending on their location, these may be identified by upper-GI endoscopy or barium studies. Carcinomas of the mesenteric small bowel are commonly constricting "apple core" lesions at the time of diagnosis. These display the typical features of GI malignancies on barium studies: shouldering; mucosal destruction; irregular luminal narrowing; and rigidity of a short segment, with variable degrees of intestinal obstruction. The main differential diagnoses for these appearances are CD, lymphoma, and leiomyosarcoma of the small bowel. CD usually involves longer segments than carcinoma, and the mucosa has a "cobblestone" appearance; lymphoma and leiomyosarcoma tend to be larger and softer tumors.

### Ultrasound features of purulent skin and soft tissue infection without abscess [^114ugQhk]. Emergency Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Ultrasound (US) aids clinical management of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) by differentiating non-purulent cellulitis from abscess. However, purulent SSTI may be present without abscess. Guidelines recommend incision and drainage (I & D) for purulent SSTI, but US descriptions of purulent SSTI without abscess are lacking.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed pediatric emergency department patients with US of the buttock read as negative for abscess. We identified US features of SSTI with adequate interobserver agreement (kappa > 0.45). Six independent observers then ranked presence or absence of these features on US exams. We studied association between US features and positive wound culture using logistic regression models (significance at p < 0.05).

Results

Of 217 children, 35 patients (16%) had cultures positive for pathogens by 8 h after US and 61 patients (32%) had cultures positive by 48 h after US. We found kappa > 0.45 for focal collection > 1.0 cm (κ = 0.57), hyperemia (κ = 0.57), swirling with compression (κ = 0.52), posterior acoustic enhancement (κ = 0.47), and cobblestoning or branching interstitial fluid (κ = 0.45). Only cobblestoning or interstitial fluid was associated with positive wound cultures in logistic regression models at 8 and 48 h.

Conclusions

Cobblestoning or interstitial fluid on US may indicate presence of culture-positive, purulent SSTI in patients without US appearance of abscess. Although our study has limitations due to its retrospective design, this US appearance should alert imagers that the patient may benefit from early I & D.

### Effect of ileocolonic transposition on gut morphology, gene expression, and function [^111DhEwm]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2003). Low credibility.

Intestinal morphology and expression of brush border enzymes can be dramatically altered by nutrient composition and position along the longitudinal gut axis. In contrast, endocrine gene expression appears to be relatively "imprinted" and is not significantly altered by positional changes. The purpose of our study was to assess the effects of transposing the ileum into the colonic position on intestinal morphology, gene expression, and enzyme activity. For this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either transposition of an approximately 8-cm segment of distal ileum into the colonic position or sham operation. Rats were sacrificed 2 months after operation and transposed or sham ileum was assessed. We found that transposition of the ileum to the colonic position resulted in no change in the ileal mucosal architecture. Furthermore, no change in the expression of the endocrine genes neurotensin and PYY or the apoptotic genes was detected. Although sucrase-isomaltase activity was decreased in the transposed ileum, this decrease did not achieve statistical significance. These results demonstrate that the ileum can be successfully interposed into the colonic position. In this location, the ileum functions normally without changes in the villus morphology or gene expression pattern despite the change in position and composition of the luminal content.

### Analysis of colonoscopic findings in the differential diagnosis between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease [^115XjgQn]. Endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Study Aims

Intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease are chronic inflammatory bowel disorders that are difficult to differentiate from one another. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of various colonoscopic findings in the differential diagnosis between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease.

Patients and Methods

Colonoscopic findings on initial work-up were prospectively recorded in patients with an initial diagnosis of either intestinal tuberculosis or Crohn's disease. These findings were analyzed after a final diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis (n = 44) or Crohn's disease (n = 44) had been made after follow-up.

Results

Four parameters (anorectal lesions, longitudinal ulcers, aphthous ulcers, and cobblestone appearance) were significantly more common in patients with Crohn's disease than in patients with intestinal tuberculosis. Four other parameters (involvement of fewer than four segments, a patulous ileocecal valve, transverse ulcers, and scars or pseudopolyps) were observed more frequently in patients with intestinal tuberculosis than in patients with Crohn's disease. We hypothesized that a diagnosis of Crohn's disease could be made when the number of parameters characteristic of Crohn's disease was higher than the number of parameters characteristic of intestinal tuberculosis, and vice versa. Making these assumptions, we calculated that the diagnosis of either intestinal tuberculosis or Crohn's disease would have been made made correctly in 77 of our 88 patients (87.5%), incorrectly in seven patients (8.0%), and would not have been made in four patients (4.5%).

Conclusions

A systematic analysis of colonoscopic findings is very useful in the differential diagnosis between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease.

### Aseptic abscess syndrome as first manifestation of Crohn's disease-a case report [^113i2rm2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Examinations performed to identify the etiology of lymphadenitis

After discharge, the patient newly developed daily abdominal pain, localized periumbilically, with relief after defecation. The patient's stool passed once a day and was without pathological admixture. In retrospect, an unexplained weight loss was reported (6 kg over the past 6 months). After excluding infectious diseases of the GIT and considering the ASCA positivity, we followed up with bowel US and subsequently magnetic resonance enterography. These showed inflammatory changes in 5–10 cm of terminal ileum and mild inflammatory changes of the appendix (Fig. 3). With respect to this information, we tested stool for fecal calprotectin, which was surprisingly low (40.2 ug/g), and fecal occult bleeding, which was positive (182 ng/ml).

Fig. 3

These findings led us to suspicion of IBD, so the patient was indicated for endoscopic examination of the GIT. Macroscopically on esophagogastroduodenoscopy there were multiple aphthous lesions in the gastric antrum. However, these had no histological correlation. Subsequent colonoscopy showed mucosal edema and cobblestone appearance in the initial 5 cm of the terminal ileum, followed by two aphthous lesions approximately 10 cm apart (Fig. 4); a few additional aphthous lesions were found in the rectum; the rest of the examined bowel was normal. Histological examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation of the terminal ileum, cecum and colon ascendens (Fig. 5). A diagnosis of Crohn's disease was established according to the revised Porto criteria. Remission was induced using a Crohn's disease exclusion diet (CD-ED) and maintenance treatment by azathioprine. The established therapy led to long-term remission of the disease. Furthermore, the patient was without recurrence of lymphadenitis and adverse effects of treatment and is regularly followed up by her pediatric gastroenterologist.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Differentiating UC from CD in children and adolescents — algorithm branch decisions: If there is "diffuse continuous superficial inflammation of the colon beginning at the anus and extending proximally, WITHOUT endoscopic or histologic evidence of ileal inflammation", classify as "Probable ulcerative colitis without backwash (subclassify into proctitis, left sided colitis, and pancolitis)". If not, assess for "diffuse pancolitis with superficial mucosal inflammation of the ileum identified by endoscopy or histology? (Upper GI series demonstrates a normal caliber ileum with a widely patent ileocecal valve)" and, if present, label "Probable ulcerative colitis with backwash (typically occurs in patients with pancolitis)". Then evaluate whether features "that raise the question of Crohn's disease and are uncommonly seen in ulcerative colitis (e.g. absolute rectal sparing, growth failure, 'focal active gastritis')" are present; if yes, follow "1. Classify as indeterminate colitis for now. 2. Carefully document the feature in the evaluation that raises diagnostic uncertainty. 3. Repeat diagnostic evaluation in the future to attempt to classify patient more definitively". If these features are absent, the terminal classification is "Ulcerative colitis".

### Chronic active EBV infection in refractory enteritis with longitudinal ulcers with a cobblestone appearance: an autopsied case report [^113habTP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic active Epstein–Barr virus infection (CAEBV) is defined as Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive T/NK cell-related neoplasia, and its major clinical symptom is systemic inflammation presenting as infectious mononucleocytosis, whereas enteritis and diarrhea are minor clinical symptoms. The complex mixture of tumorigenic processes of EBV-positive cells and physical symptoms of systemic inflammatory disease constitutes the varied phenotypes of CAEBV. Herein, we describe a case of CAEBV that was initially diagnosed as Crohn's disease (CD) based on ileal ulcers and clinical symptoms of enteritis.

Case presentation

A 19-year-old woman complained of abdominal pain and fever. Blood examination showed normal blood cell counts without atypical lymphocyte but detected modest inflammation, hypoalbuminemia, slight liver dysfunction, and evidence of past EBV infection. The esophagogastroduodenoscopic findings were normal. However, colonoscopy revealed a few small ulcers in the terminal ileum. The jejunum and ileum also exhibited various forms of ulcers, exhibiting a cobblestone appearance, on capsule endoscopy. Based on these clinical findings, she was strongly suspected with CD. In the course of treatment by steroid and biologics for refractory enteritis, skin ulcers appeared about 50 months after her initial hospital visit. Immunohistology of her skin biopsy revealed proliferation of EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER)-positive atypical lymphocytes. We retrospectively assessed her previous ileal ulcer biopsy before treatment and found many EBER-positive lymphocytes. Blood EBV DNA was also positive. Therefore, she was diagnosed with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma with CAEBV-related enteritis rather than CD. She was treated with cyclosporine and prednisolone combination therapy for CAEBV-related systemic inflammation and chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma. Unfortunately, her disease continued to progress, leading to multiple organ failure and death at the age of 23 years.

Conclusion

Clinicians need to remember the possibility of CAEBV as a differential diagnosis of refractory enteritis. Enteritis with intestinal ulcer is a rare symptom of CAEBV, and it is impossible to acquire a definitive diagnosis by ulcer morphology only. In cases where the possibility of CAEBV remains, tissue EBVR expression should be checked by in situ hybridization and blood EBV DNA.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^112umrKD]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease — postoperative evaluation and colorectal cancer surveillance: We suggest endoscopic evaluation of the neoterminal ileum 6 to 12 months after surgery in order to risk-stratify patients whose medical management may be affected by endoscopic recurrence. We recommend that all patients with UC or CD colitis undergo a screening colonoscopy 8 years after disease onset to (1) re-evaluate extent of disease and (2) initiate surveillance for colorectal neoplasia. We recommend surveillance colonoscopy be performed every 1 to 3 years beginning after 8 years of disease in patients with UC with macroscopic or histologic evidence of inflammation proximal to and including the sigmoid colon and for patients with Crohn's colitis with greater than one-third of colon involvement. We recommend chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies as the preferred surveillance technique to maximize dysplasia detection.

### Intestinal Behçet and Crohn's disease: two sides of the same coin [^115zLCdj]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Endoscopic and histological features

The most frequent localization of intestinal BD, as in CD, is the ileocecal area, although any part of the gastrointestinal tract, including oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, colon and extra-intestinal organs, such as liver, pancreas, or spleen, can be affected. Diffuse colonic involvement is rare, but it occurs in approximately 15% of patients who have gastrointestinal involvement. Skipped colonic lesions can be present both in BD and CD. Endoscopic findings of intestinal BD are described as single or few, large, discrete, and round or oval shaped ulcerations in the ileocecal area. However, these lesions vary from small aphthous ulcerations to multiple, irregular shaped ulcerations. In Crohn's disease, typical endoscopic findings include discontinuous distribution of longitudinal ulcers (defined as ≥ 4 to 5 cm), cobblestone appearance, and/or small aphthous ulcerations arranged in a longitudinal fashion. Lee et al. comparing colonoscopy findings of 115 intestinal BD and 135 CD patients, have proposed diagnostic criteria. Round shape, fewer numbers (≤ 5), focal distribution, discrete border, deep penetrating, ileocecal location and absence of aphthous and cobblestone appearance can be suggestive of typical ulcerations of intestinal BD (Fig. 4). There are no pathognomonic histologic findings regarding intestinal BD. There are two forms of intestinal BD lesions: one is mucosal inflammation and ulceration (neutrophilic phlebitis), the other is ischemic damage (vasculitis). The most common features are: vasculitis affecting small veins and venules; and a normal circumferential mucosa surrounding a large ulceration. Absence of non-caseating granuloma suggests intestinal BD rather than CD, even if non-caseating granulomas are observed in only 15–36% of patients with CD. Histopathological characteristics of CD include discontinuous cryptic architectural abnormalities, discontinuous inflammation, focal cryptitis, and epithelioid granulomas Table 1

### Confocal morphologic classification and clinical melanoma phenotypes… [^111uxNjf]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

A, Reflectance confocal microscopy reveals dendritic cells with large projections and nucleus within upper epidermis layers seen as an atypical cobblestone pattern; B, small round nucleated cells with refractive cytoplasm and dark nucleus in an atypical honeycomb epidermal pattern; C, large cerebriform nests formed. The median age of the participants was 53. 0 years, and the median age at the first melanoma was
46. 0 years., dermal nest, and combined melanomas. 11 The authors found that melanomas with a predominant population of dendritic cells were thinner by Breslow index, and melanomas typified by roundish melanocytes or dermal nests were smaller but thicker by Breslow index.

11 The purpose of this study was to correlate morphologic RCM patterns with clinical data, genetic variants, dermoscopic features, and histologic criteria in the context of patients with multiple primary and familial melanomas. On the basis of the presence of major or minor criteria of malignancy, the lesion was classified according to the Pellacani and Barcelona confocal microscopy total score. 14, 15 According to the Pellacani score, the cutoff for malignancy was a score equal to or greater than 3. According to the Barcelona algorithm, the cutoff for malignancy was a score equal to or greater than −1. The mean Breslow thickness was
0. 79 mm, and the median thickness was 0. 52 mm. The mean general TDS was 6. 2, the mean Barcelona general RCM score was

1. 0, and the mean Pellacani general RCM score was 5.
0. The second was associated with long-term sun damage and older age at onset, characterized via RCM as a dendritic cell type.

A third possible, less frequent route may exist, characterized by thick and fast-growing tumors with a nested pattern via confocal microscopy. More advanced lesions had a multicomponent pattern, probably reflecting lesion evolution with 1 of the 3 previous patterns. Finally, lesions with unspecific pattern are probably very early melanomas in which the pattern is as yet undefined. 21.

### A novel segmental absence of intestinal musculature with small intestinal stenosis: a case report [^115x3mBB]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Segmental absence of intestinal musculature (SAIM) is a rare cause of intestinal obstruction and perforation due to partial or complete defects in the intestinal muscularis propria in neonates and is occasionally observed in adulthood.

Case Presentation

The first case of small intestinal stenosis derived from SAIM, which was difficult to differentiate from Crohn's disease (CD), is reported. A 4-year-old girl presented with abdominal pain, anemia, and a positive fecal occult blood test. She was initially diagnosed with CD and started on treatment. Because her gastrointestinal symptoms persisted, her previous pediatricians tried to carry out capsule endoscopy, but it was not possible because the patency capsule was retained. Therefore, she was referred to our institute and re-evaluated. The patency capsule examination was repeated to re-evaluate small intestinal passage, but it stagnated again. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a poorly deformable intestinal tract that narrowed rapidly from the dilated segment and had a thin wall with an irregular laminar structure. In addition, unlike the typical ultrasonic CD findings, the power Doppler signal enhancement at the intestinal wall and "creeping fat sign" were not found. The patient was referred for laparoscopic observation to pediatric surgeons, who confirmed a prominently dilated intestinal tract 40cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, which was resected. Histopathological findings showed longitudinal muscle hypoplasia of the resected, dilated intestinal tract and fat replacement of the muscle layer. At the stenosis site, the muscle layer was fibrotic and showed incomplete muscle arrangement. Because of these findings, she was diagnosed with SAIM. After the surgical treatment, no gastrointestinal symptoms relapsed, and the fecal occult blood test has remained negative for 2years. Moreover, 8 months after surgery, double-balloon endoscopy showed no abnormalities, such as a longitudinal ulcer and cobblestone appearance.

Conclusions

In the present case, SAIM involved not only intestinal ileus and perforation, but also small intestinal stenosis. Although no other reports have demonstrated the usefulness of abdominal ultrasonography for the diagnosis of SAIM, the present report suggests that ultrasonography may be useful for differentiating SAIM from CD by close observation of the area around the small intestinal stenosis.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Backwash ileitis — endoscopic, radiographic, and diagnostic characterization indicates that radiographic studies of the terminal ileum demonstrate a normal caliber ileum without stenosis or cobblestoning, though a rough "sandpaper" appearance may be present; at endoscopy the ileocecal valve is normal without stricture, stenosis, or ulceration, and ileal erythema and granularity are diffuse, usually extending only a few centimeters (usually < 10 cm) proximal to the ileocecal valve, with normal lymphoid nodules possible but no linear ulcerations, deep fissures, or areas of cobblestoning; identification of nonspecific or microscopic ileitis in a patient with typical features of UC does not warrant a change of diagnosis unless features suggesting CD are present, and if nonspecific ileitis is identified, the term "UC with backwash ileitis" is more appropriate.

Pouchitis: morphological features and distinction from "CD of the pouch" are described for patients with inflammatory bowel disease who undergo ileal pouch anal anastomosis. The ileal pouch mucosa is subjected to an abnormal luminal environment, and as an adaptation the ileal mucosa commonly undergoes a modification consisting of mild villous blunting and a slight crypt hyperplasia accompanied by either no increase or a minimal increase in inflammation in the lamina propria; portions of the ileal mucosa may assume a colon-like appearance with complete loss of villi and crypt hyperplasia, with a mucin histochemical and inflammatory immunoprofile like that seen in ulcerative colitis, and these findings support the hypothesis that the majority of cases of relapsing or chronic pouchitis develop in transformed, UC-like, mucosa. On endoscopic examination, the features of pouchitis vary from mild mucosal hyperemia and edema with diminished vascular pattern and contact friability to severe mucosal hemorrhage, aphthous or larger ulcers, and pseudomembrane formation; on microscopic examination, biopsy specimens typically demonstrate partial to complete villous blunting with crypt hyperplasia and increased mononuclear inflammatory cells and eosinophils in the lamina propria, with superimposed activity characterized by neutrophils in the lamina propria, cryptitis, crypt abscesses, and, in severe cases, erosions or ulcers; the active inflammatory component is more often focal than diffuse, and granulomas of the mucin or foreign body type may also be identified. A minority of patients develop pathological changes that mimic Crohn disease of the pouch, including perianal abscesses, anal fissures, inflammation of the ileal limb proximal to the pouch, strictures (typically in the proximal pouch), and fistulas; in pouches removed to treat these complications, histologic diagnosis may document deep or transmural inflammation, and other pouch abnormalities related to the surgical procedure itself include ulcers and/or strictures at anastomotic lines, chronic ischemic changes secondary to vascular compromise, and pouch mucosal prolapse changes.

### Endoscopic features and clinical course of patients with asymptomatic cecal ulcers [^112KmPfb]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis is typically made by the evidence of a typical histological picture. For example, granuloma could be found in up to 73% of patients with a diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis (50 out of 68 patients). In our cases, the first patient had typical histological findings in the initial endoscopic exam, including granulomatous inflammation and positive acid-fast stain bacilli. In the second case, however, the diagnosis was obscure. The endoscopic biopsies were performed 3 times and results were all inconclusive. Tuberculosis cultures of endoscopic samples were also negative. The diagnosis was made based on positive quantiFERON test and complete remission after antituberculosis medications.

Atypical presentation was also reported in the early course of ulcerative colitis. A previous study reported that up to 19.2% (46 out of 240 cases) of ulcerative colitis cases had an atypical distribution, such as appendiceal orifice inflammation in the initial endoscopic exam. The case of ulcerative colitis in our study had only peri-appendiceal and terminal ileum ulcers initially. The diagnosis was not made until 3 years later when bloody stool occurred and the presence of a typical endoscopic picture of proctitis was observed.

Several endoscopic features have been reported to differentiate Crohn's disease from intestinal tuberculosis, such as longitudinal ulcers, and cobblestone appearance. The case with Crohn's disease in our study did not show these two typical endoscopic characteristics and the location of the involved area was confined to the cecal and terminal ileum. It may again represent a case in which an early natural course was discovered due to the initial screening colonoscopy.

### The role of endoscopy in inflammatory bowel disease [^115zt3DZ]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2015). Medium credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) versus ulcerative colitis (UC) — endoscopic distinguishing features and limitations: Patients with other colitides can have clinical presentations and endoscopic features similar to those observed with IBD, and the value of endoscopy alone in distinguishing IBD from non-IBD colitides is limited, so additional clinical and histologic data often are required. The acquisition of detailed information from an index colonoscopy before initiating therapy is important for differentiating CD and UC because therapy, once initiated, may obscure discriminating features of CD from UC such as segmental colitis, patchy distribution of inflammatory changes, and rectal sparing. The most useful endoscopic features consistent with CD rather than UC are skip lesions (segmental colitis), rectal sparing, involvement of the terminal ileum, identification of the internal opening of a fistula tract, and anal or perianal disease; other endoscopic features suggestive of CD include aphthous ulcers, deep ulcers, serpiginous ulcers, and cobblestoning. Endoscopic features suggestive of UC include diffuse and continuous inflammation proximal to the anal canal, granularity, and loss of the normal vascular pattern.

### The role of endoscopy in the management of patients with diarrhea [^115ZDpUC]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Terminal ileoscopy and ileal biopsy — diagnostic yield and use in diarrhea are summarized: In a prospective evaluation of 138 patients, ileoscopy yielded incidental, conclusive diagnoses in 2.7% of asymptomatic surveillance colonoscopies, increasing to 18% in 22 non–human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients with diarrhea; terminal ileal biopsy is most helpful in inflammatory diarrhea, and in one report microscopic terminal ileal lesions were found in 125 (49%) of 257 patients with diarrhea and suspected IBD, with ileal biopsies essential in 15 (6%) and contributory in 53 (21%); for normal-appearing mucosa, significant findings range from 0% to 4.2% of patients and the routine value is controversial and probably low yield.

### Differentiating gastrointestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease-a comprehensive review [^111KpUqR]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In summary, based on the site and pattern of involvement, and the presence of sinuses or fistulas, necrotic lymph nodes, and other ancillary findings, imaging studies help differentiate GITB from CD. Caecum and right-sided colon are more involved in GITB (83%) than CD (33%). Left-sided colon is more frequently involved in CD than GITB. More patients with CD have skip lesions (99%) than GITB (15%). Asymmetric and greater (more than 6 mm) bowel wall thickness and wall stratification are seen more commonly with CD than GITB.

Eccentric stricture with sacculation is usually seen with CD, while concentric strictures are more common in GITB. Peritoneal thickening, omental caking, ascites, cocoon formation, and the necrotic mesenteric lymph node highly suggest GITB, and enteroenteric fistula, mesenteric fibrofatty proliferation, small homogenous mesenteric lymph node, and perianal fistulas are more characteristic of CD. Figure 1 summarises the radiological differences between GITB and CD.

Histopathology

Distinguishing GITB and CD is challenging due to the overlapping macroscopic and microscopic histological features. Endoscopic biopsy has, however, become an important diagnostic tool to shed light on the few mucosal differences present in both diseases making differentiation possible. Granuloma detection rates in intestinal biopsies vary in the literature ranging from 10 to 80% in GITB cases and 15% to 65% in CD patients. As expected, the yield of endoscopic mucosal biopsies is lower than surgically resected specimens. Obtaining a reliable diagnosis requires an appropriate number of mucosal biopsies. According to the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization and the European Society of Pathology, multiple biopsies from five sites around the colon (including the rectum) and ileum should be obtained for an adequate histopathological diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple biopsies (minimally two samples from each side of the intestinal wall) show a better understanding of the distribution pattern of the inflammation than single tissue biopsies, secondarily increasing the granuloma detection rate. The highest granuloma detection rate can be established in cases showing longitudinal ulcers on endoscopy. In one study, basal plasmacytosis was exclusively detected in cases with longitudinal ulcer and cobblestone appearance.

4 Crohn's disease

4.1 Diagnosis, classification and assessment

Crohn's disease is a complex chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal condition with variable age of onset, disease location and behaviour. There is no single unifying definition of Crohn's disease and a combination of investigative modalities is often needed to confirm the diagnosis. The most widely accepted framework for making a diagnosis dates back nearly 30 years. Factors include an appropriate clinical history and examination, ileocolonoscopy, small bowel imaging, blood tests and histology. Mucosal biopsies from endoscopic procedures or surgical resection specimens show focal or patchy (rather than diffuse) inflammation and/or crypt distortion. Discontinuous segments of disease ('skip lesions'), ileal involvement and granulomatous inflammation are more suggestive of Crohn's disease, as is a tendency for inflammation to be worse in the proximal colon.

Distinguishing between Crohn's disease and UC can sometimes be complicated; partially-treated UC can demonstrate patches of inflammation, backwash ileitis occurs in UC, and granulomas only occur in about half of Crohn's disease patients. Cryptolytic granulomas can occur in UC, diverticular inflammation and all forms of colitis and are very non-specific. Pathologists find it easier to distinguish between IBD and non-IBD than they do to separate Crohn's from UC, and the diagnosis is helped greatly by discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting with clinicians and pathologist present. Studies have shown about 3% of UC patients will be reclassified as Crohn's colitis, and conversely a small number (0.6–3%) will be reclassified to UC after an initial diagnosis of Crohn's disease. There is a separate cohort who can be neither assigned as Crohn's disease or UC, so are labelled as IBD unclassified.

### Is ileocecal valve intubation essential for routine colonoscopic examination? [^112mr4j2]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In this study, we aimed to assess the diagnostic yield of terminal ileum intubation during routine colonoscopy.

Materials and Methods

We routinely performed terminal ileum intubation in all patients who underwent colonoscopy at Dokuz Eylul University Hospital between February 2014 and June 2015. Two gastroenterology fellows performed colonoscopies in the Central Endoscopy Unit. Demographic data of patients, indications of colonoscopies, cecum and ileum intubation rate/time, and endoscopic and histopathologic findings of the terminal ileum were all assessed.

Results

A total of 1310 consecutive patients (726 female and 584 male, median age: 55.79 ± 14.29 years) underwent colonoscopy during this study period. The colonoscopy was successfully completed in 1144 (87.3%) cases. The terminal ileum was successfully intubated in 1032 (90.2%) cases. The mean time taken to reach the ileum from the cecum was 63.08 ± 64.16s. Endoscopic abnormalities on the terminal ileum were present in 62 (6%) cases, and biopsies were taken from these patients. However, endoscopic abnormalities were found in 7 and 3.3% of patients who were symptomatic and asymptomatic, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (P = 0.02). Clinically significant histopathologic findings were observed in 22 cases, and 12 of the 22 cases were diagnosed as having Crohn's disease.

Conclusion

Terminal ileum intubation is particularly indicated in symptomatic patients. In cases of chronic diarrhea, iron-deficiency anemia, abdominal pain, and suspected inflammatory bowel disease, terminal ileum intubation should be done.

### Definitions and classification of malformations of cortical development: practical guidelines [^116XpiyZ]. Brain (2020). Medium credibility.

The cobblestone malformation

The term 'cobblestone malformation' (previously known as type II lissencephaly or cobblestone lissencephaly) was initially proposed to define a rather specific cortical appearance characterized by irregular, pebbled external and internal surfaces resembling on MRI the morphology of a cobblestone. This cortical malformation is usually bilateral and symmetric, frequently involving the entire brain or large areas of the cerebral hemispheres with anterior (more frequently) or posterior predominance. It is caused by over-migration of neurons through 'gaps' (holes) in the pial limiting membrane that result from an inability of RGCs to attach to the pial limiting membrane (also called cortical pial basement membrane); as a result, neurons disengage from the radial glia, with some unable to reach the pial limiting membrane and others migrating through the 'gaps' into the subarachnoid space.

On imaging, cobblestone malformations are characterized by an undersulcated cerebral surface, with mildly to moderately thick cortex, and jagged cortical-white matter border with frequent vertical (perpendicular to the cortical-white matter border) striations (Fig. 7). This appearance is often highlighted by the presence of intracortical white matter high signal on T 2 and FLAIR. The underlying white matter may also show high signal, increasing the demarcation of the cerebral cortical-white matter junction; however, these white matter signal abnormalities may be a temporary phenomenon that normalizes with age. There may also be characteristic posterior fossa abnormalities, such as brainstem clefts and cerebellar microcysts (postulated to be from extension of subarachnoid space through defects in the cerebellar pial limiting membrane). Of note, the cobblestone malformation includes several cortical phenotypes, ranging from an apparently undersulcated brain with relatively thin cortex, such as in the Walker-Warburg syndrome, to a more convoluted and thicker cortex, such as in muscle-eye brain disease.

Endoscopic features

The endoscopic features (Fig. 2) of CMUSE patients and SBCD patients are listed in Table 3. Longitudinal ulcers were more common in SBCD patients (16, 37.2% vs 0,0.0%, P = 0.041), while circumferential ulcers were more common in CMUSE patients (6,54.6% vs 8,18.6%, P = 0.041). More patients with CMUSE developed strictures than with SBCD (9, 69.2% vs 16, 29.6%, P = 0.020) and CMUSE patients were more likely to have multiple strictures compared to SBCD patients (4, 44% vs 3, 18.7%, P = 0.013). Cobblestone appearance, which was considered as the characteristic change of CD, tended to be observed in more SBCD patients (4, 7.4%) than CMUSE patients (0, 0.0%), but the differences were not significant (P = 1.000).

The comparison of endoscopic characteristics in patients with colonic ulceration

Next, we collected the endoscopic figures of patients with different diagnoses (UC, CD, monogenic IBD-like disorders and non-IBD, respectively) in Fig. 1, and sorted out the endoscopic information of patients (Table 4, Table S5 – S6). The existence of upper gastrointestinal ulceration presented no significant difference in IBD and non-IBD groups. Colonoscopy revealed that ulcers could be found in any segment of the colon, and a wider ulcer distribution range in LGIT was found in IBD group than in non-IBD group (P < 0.001), especially between CD and infectious enteritis groups. Besides, Table 4 displayed that cobblestone appearance, deep ulcer (mainly in CD group as Table S6), and pseudopolyps were mainly showed in IBD group.

### Differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn disease in children and young adults: report of a working group of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the Crohn's and colitis foundation of America [^115txVoN]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Medium credibility.

Differentiating UC from CD in children and adolescents — We propose first looking for features that definitely suggest CD, such as granulomas not adjacent to crypts, small bowel involvement, colonic stricturing, cobblestoning, or pronounced perianal disease; if these features are not present in patients with IBD limited to the colon and histological features of chronicity, then the diagnosis is most likely UC. A patient with UC may also have backwash ileitis (superficial ileal inflammation), gastritis, periappendiceal cecal patch, histological patchiness, and relative rectal sparing, and if superficial ileal inflammation is present in the patient with pancolitis, but barium radiography of the ileum is normal, then that patient should be classified as having UC with backwash ileitis. A patient with features that are highly atypical for UC (eg, ileal aphthae or backwash ileitis in a patient with left-sided colitis, growth failure, large oral aphthae, or absolute rectal sparing) can be given a provisional diagnosis of IC and evaluated subsequently (eg, after 1 year, during the next disease exacerbation, before surgery) to determine whether a diagnosis of CD or UC can be made; in re-evaluating a patient, the clinician needs to keep in mind that medical therapy can cause variable healing, and thus result in endoscopic and histological patchiness of disease.

### Unraveling the site-specific features in small intestinal stromal tumors: a retrospective study [^111MCmfC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The proportion of patients in all three groups of small intestinal GISTs who received preoperative neoadjuvant therapy was low. However, postoperative targeted treatment for ileal GISTs was significantly more frequent than for jejunal GISTs, which was in turn significantly higher than that for duodenal GISTs. Whether a more detailed differentiation of small intestinal GISTs is necessary during risk stratification still requires further evidence, which is important for the decision for subsequent treatment.

Results also indicate that patients with duodenal GISTs often experience a long disease course, yet their tumor staging, such as T stage, tends to be low. This may be due to the accessibility of the duodenum via gastroscopy, facilitating earlier detection. Although the statistical significance is lacking, it is noteworthy that the duration of bleeding in duodenal GISTs is among the longest. This suggests that the earlier identification of duodenal lesions through gastroscopy does not fully explain the phenomenon. Another possibility is that duodenal GISTs can cause bleeding even when quite small (especially intermittent bleeding) or lead to nonspecific symptoms like abdominal distension at early stages. In these cases, symptomatic treatments or management for gastric or duodenal ulcers may result in improvement, or the bleeding itself is intermittent or transient, causing patients not seeking further diagnosis or additional investigations, thus missing the detection of duodenal stromal tumors. Besides, ileal GISTs tend to occur in older patients but have a shorter disease course and higher T stage. This may be because ileal GISTs are more common in elderly individuals and tend to progress more rapidly; or because their insidious onset, where symptoms are absent for a long time, leading to a late diagnosis.

5 Common disease considerations

5.1 Infectious diseases and IBD: differential and concurrent diagnoses

5.1.1 Tuberculosis

Statement 73. We recommend that the differential diagnosis of tuberculosis should be considered in patients with suspected ileocaecal Crohn 's disease, particularly in patients born in or who have lived for extended periods in endemic areas or have other risk factors for infection (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Differentiating between intestinal tuberculosis (TB) and Crohn's disease may be challenging in those who have lived in endemic areas as clinical features may be similar. Features suggestive of a diagnosis of intestinal TB include night sweats, concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis, positive tuberculin skin test, antibodies to TB, abdominal lymphadenopathy, ascites, transverse ulcers and a patulous ileocecal valve. Haematochesia, involvement of the sigmoid colon, skip lesions and aphthous ulceration are more common in Crohn's disease, whereas weight loss may be predictive of TB. Extraintestinal manifestations are more commonly associated with Crohn's disease. A recent study from South Korea used 40 Crohn's patients and 40 with intestinal TB to develop a predictive model using colonoscopic, laboratory and radiological criteria. Features suggesting Crohn's at colonoscopy were anorectal lesions, longitudinal ulcers, aphthous ulcers and cobblestoning. Colonoscopic features suggesting TB were fewer than four segments of colon involved, patulous ileocaecal valve, transverse ulcers and scars or post-inflammatory polyps. Positive ASCA serology and proximal small bowel disease suggested Crohn's, and a positive quantiferon gold test and typical pulmonary lesions suggested TB. A score derived from these features was able to make an accurate diagnosis in 96.3% of patients.TB PCR performed on intestinal biopsies may be helpful for discrimination between the diseases.

### Ileal biopsy: clinical indications, endoscopic and histopathologic findings in 10, 000 patients [^111Whik8]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Ileal biopsies are often reported as having a low yield. Data from endoscopy practices in the private setting are lacking.

Aims

To correlate the frequency of histologic abnormalities in ileal biopsies with clinical indications and ileoscopic appearances.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic data from a large database.

Results

We studied 9785 unique adult patients (median age 46 years, 61.4% women) with ileal biopsies. The most common symptoms were diarrhoea (52.2%) and abdominal pain (37.1%). Ileoscopy was reported as being normal in 75.1% patients. Subjects screened for cancer had the highest prevalence of abnormal endoscopic findings (63.3%); patients with known or suspected Crohn's had the highest prevalence abnormal ileal histology (36.4%). Overall, 5.0% of ileal biopsies obtained from patients with normal endoscopy and 47.4% of biopsies from patients with an endoscopically abnormal ileum had significant histopathologic findings.

Conclusions

In adults, biopsies from the endoscopically normal ileum rarely provide clinically relevant information and cannot be recommended. In contrast, half of the adult patients with an endoscopically abnormal ileum have significant histopathologic findings in ileal biopsies. Therefore, ileoscopy associated with a sensible use of the ileal biopsy is a valuable complement to the colonoscopy.

### Pathology quiz case 3… [^1141y1YN]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

SECTION EDITOR: JULIA C. IEZZONI, MD A 38-year-old woman presented with a several-year history of recurrent sore throat, globus sensation, mild dysphagia and hoarseness, increased phlegm, and loud snoring. She underwent a tonsillectomy as a child but in the last few years had experienced 3 to 4 episodes of recurrent pharyngitis each year that required treatment with antibiotics and/or oral steroids. Physical examination revealed erythematous streaks and cobblestoning of the posterior pharyngeal wall. On fiberoptic examination, the patient was found to have large lingual tonsils filling the vallecula and significant erythema and edema of the arytenoid cartilages. Omeprazole therapy was initiated for presumed laryngopharyngeal reflux disease. Because of persistent symptoms 12 weeks later, the patient was started on a 300-mg bedtime dose of ranitidine and scheduled for esophagoscopy.

Esophagoscopy failed to show Barrett esophagus or reflux-related esophagitis. Examination of the esophagus with white-light and narrow-band imaging revealed 3 areas of columnar epithelium just distal to the cricopharyngeus. Davis KS, Welsh CT, Hawes RH, Gillespie MB.

### Chronic active EBV infection in refractory enteritis with longitudinal ulcers with a cobblestone appearance: an autopsied case report [^113VhQnz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Thus, a final diagnosis should be comprehensively made based on physical symptoms, medical histories, clinical findings, and culture, imaging, and pathological tests. Even if the characteristic endoscopic findings of specific enteritis are detected, differential diagnosis based only on these findings will be difficult because the characteristic findings of endoscopy do not always correspond to the specific disease. Some enteric diseases might show similar endoscopic appearances, whereas the same disease might demonstrate various phenotypes depending on the time course and severity.

Unfortunately, no successful treatment for CAEBV has yet been established, and further research is needed to improve the outcome in the future. Therefore, it is crucial for clinicians to definitely diagnose CAEBV as quickly as possible.

In conclusion, we diagnosed a rare case of CAEBV, with refractory enteritis as the main clinical symptom and without manifestation of a typical IM feature. Diagnosing CAEBV by ulcer morphology is difficult, even with CE and routine histopathological examination only; thus, clinicians should consider CAEBV as a differential diagnosis of refractory enteritis in younger patients and eagerly check blood EBV-DNA and EBER expression levels by ISH.

### Cobblestone throat in a younger patient infected with the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [^1152KViD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
Cobblestone throat of the posterior oropharynx in other COVID-19 cases.

The differential diagnosis is influenza from the symptoms and pharyngeal findings. Influenza follicles resulting from influenza infection are well known as pharyngeal findings of viral infection. The short time from infection to onset is associated with the characteristic follicular formation that is shiny and tense. In this case, follicles with similar luster were observed, suggesting that the findings may have appeared as a result of the characteristics of the short viral replication time of the Omicron strain. The finding of cobblestone inflammation of the posterior pharynx in SARS-CoV-2 infection without concurrent influenza infection raises the possibility of a broader differential diagnosis when this physical examination finding is noted, and SARS-CoV-2 and influenza should be differentiated from one another via available diagnostic testing.
