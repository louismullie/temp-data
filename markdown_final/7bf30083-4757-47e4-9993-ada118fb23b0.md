## Question

do urogyn treat ic and hrt

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether urogynecologists treat interstitial cystitis and manage hormone replacement therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and the scope of urogynecology. Then, I should verify the extent of urogynecologists' involvement in IC/BPS care versus urology. Next, I will examine how urogynecologists approach menopausal hormone therapy, distinguishing local vaginal estrogen from systemic HRT. Finally, I will synthesize practical guidance and highlight safety counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the terms and scope so I do not misframe the question. Interstitial cystitis here refers to interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, a chronic pain condition with urinary frequency and urgency where guidelines emphasize careful diagnosis and graded therapy, often via multidisciplinary care, while urogynecology is the subspecialty of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery that manages pelvic floor disorders and lower urinary tract dysfunction in women, guided by IUGA/ICS terminology standards [^112CK8ba] [^113DfuaK] [^112DYkXD].

> I will now examine how urogynecologists fit into IC/BPS pathways. Wait, let me verify whether authoritative guidance endorses collaboration that includes urogynecology. The 2022 AUA guideline for IC/BPS repeatedly recommends ongoing pain assessment and a multidisciplinary approach with appropriate referrals when pain control is inadequate, which aligns with urogynecologists co-managing pelvic floor, sexual pain, and hormonal contributors, and a 2025 consensus explicitly highlights gynecologic comorbidities common in IC/BPS such as overactive pelvic floor muscles, endometriosis, vulvodynia/vestibulodynia, and hormone-associated genitourinary changes, all squarely in urogynecology's wheelhouse [^112CK8ba] [^116gLTm7] [^112KQN2w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about procedural boundaries. My initial thought was that urogynecologists generally do not deliver bladder-centric intravesical therapies; however, I should double-check the guidelines and real-world practice. EAU and RCOG guidelines endorse intravesical agents such as hyaluronic acid, heparin, chondroitin sulfate, and lidocaine for IC/BPS before escalating invasiveness, and they do not restrict these to urologists, meaning FPMRS-trained urogynecologists in some settings do provide instillations and cystoscopic interventions; so my earlier blanket impression was too rigid and needs correction [^1153eDcF] [^114VeqSj].

> Next, I should review the nonbladder gynecologic and pelvic floor contributions that urogynecologists treat in IC/BPS patients. Let me consider the consensus list again and the first-line therapies. Urogynecologists commonly evaluate and manage overactive or hypertonic pelvic floor dysfunction, genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorders, and coexisting endometriosis, using pelvic floor physical therapy and multimodal pain strategies integrated with the IC/BPS pathway, which is consistent with guideline-endorsed stress management and multidisciplinary care for BPS [^112KQN2w] [^112YU3AE] [^112GCsXd].

> I should now clarify their role in menopausal hormone therapy, especially for GSM. The AUA/SUFU/AUGS 2025 guideline, co-authored by the urogynecology society, recommends offering local low-dose vaginal estrogen or vaginal DHEA for GSM to improve vulvovaginal discomfort, dryness, dyspareunia, and associated urinary symptoms, including in patients with comorbid lower urinary tract conditions such as overactive bladder, which urogynecologists routinely manage in clinic [^1118WtZF] [^117LmAxY] [^114Ka8N7].

> But wait, what about systemic HRT for urinary symptoms. I need to check the directionality of evidence. SOGC guidance advises against systemic estrogens for treatment of postmenopausal urinary incontinence, and IUGA committee opinions report that systemic estrogen, with or without progestin, is associated with worsening or de novo urinary incontinence; therefore, urogynecologists typically favor local vaginal estrogen for GSM-related urinary symptoms rather than systemic HRT when the goal is urogenital symptom relief [^114943EU] [^1166hu3z] [^1117QgHR].

> I should confirm safety counseling and monitoring practices for local therapy so advice is complete. The AUA/SUFU/AUGS 2025 guidance states there is no evidence linking low-dose vaginal estrogen to breast cancer and that routine endometrial surveillance is not indicated solely for use of local low-dose vaginal estrogen or vaginal DHEA, supporting urogynecologists' counseling that local options are effective and generally safe for GSM, including in many higher-risk contexts with shared decision-making [^115WhuAp] [^112unFbL] [^1118NYHE] [^114NwaYP].

> Let me reconsider broader hormone care context so I do not overgeneralize. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy can be appropriate for vasomotor symptoms and other systemic menopausal concerns in properly selected patients, often co-managed by gynecologists and urogynecologists; nevertheless, when urinary or GSM symptoms predominate, evidence and guidelines prioritize local vaginal estrogen or DHEA, including in women already receiving systemic estrogen, which urogynecologists regularly prescribe and monitor [^1139iWPf] [^1175RB9B] [^111HYfxb].

> I should also review related urologic benefits of local estrogen that urogynecologists often address. For postmenopausal women with recurrent UTIs in the setting of GSM, multiple trials and reviews support vaginal estrogen to reduce recurrence, and European guidance supports offering vaginal estrogen for female LUTS such as nocturia after appropriate counseling, which urogynecologists integrate into care plans [^113uo2fE] [^115N9MZ2].

> Bringing this together, I need to ensure the practical takeaways are precise. Urogynecologists do treat patients with IC/BPS, frequently as part of a multidisciplinary team, addressing pelvic floor dysfunction, sexual pain, endometriosis, and hormone-associated genitourinary changes, and many also provide bladder-directed therapies depending on training and local practice patterns; they also routinely evaluate and treat GSM with local vaginal estrogen or vaginal DHEA while generally avoiding systemic HRT for urinary indications due to evidence of harm, all with appropriate safety counseling and coordination with urology and primary care as needed [^112KQN2w] [^112CK8ba] [^1153eDcF] [^1118WtZF] [^114943EU].

---

Yes, urogynecologists routinely treat **interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS)** [^112CK8ba] with a multidisciplinary approach including behavioral, pharmacologic, intravesical [^1153eDcF], and procedural therapies. They also manage hormone replacement therapy (HRT), primarily using **local vaginal estrogen** [^1118WtZF] for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and related lower urinary tract symptoms, while **avoiding systemic estrogen** for urinary incontinence [^114943EU]. Care is **individualized**, with shared decision-making and coordination with other specialists as needed [^112CK8ba] [^114NwaYP].

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-International Urogynecological Association research and development-committee opinion [^1166hu3z]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

There is clear evidence of the presence of estradiol receptors (ERs) in the female lower urinary and genital tract. Furthermore, it is a fact that estrogen deficiency after menopause may cause atrophic changes of the urogenital tract as well as various urinary symptoms. Moreover, the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms as well as pelvic organ prolapse (POP), anal incontinence (AI), and vulvovaginal symptoms (VVS) is still a matter of debate. This committee opinion paper summarizes the best evidence on the influence of sex steroids as well as hormonal treatment (local and systemic) in postmenopausal women with pelvic floor disorders.

- **Methods**: A working subcommittee from the International Urogynecology Association (IUGA) Research and Development Committee was formed. A thorough literature search was conducted and an opinion statement expressed. The literature regarding hormones and pelvic floor disorders was reviewed independently and summarized by the individual members of the subcommittee.

- **Results**: The majority of studies reported that vaginal estrogen treatment, when compared with placebo, has more beneficial effects on symptoms and signs of vaginal atrophy, including sensation of burning, dyspareunia, and UI symptoms. However, definitive evidence on local estrogen application and prolapse treatment or prevention is lacking. A statistically significant increase in the risk of worsening of UI, as well as the development of de novo incontinence, was observed with estrogen-only or combination systemic HRT.

- **Conclusions**: In sum, the findings underscore the complexity and need for additional research in this area.

### Management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women with or at high risk for breast cancer: Consensus recommendations from The North American Menopause Society and The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health [^111778A2]. Menopause (2018). High credibility.

The objective of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) Expert Consensus Panel was to create a point-of-care algorithm for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in women with or at high risk for breast cancer. The consensus recommendations aim to assist healthcare providers in managing GSM, with the goal of improving care and quality of life for these women.

The Expert Consensus Panel consists of a diverse group of 16 multidisciplinary experts well-respected in their fields. Each panelist conducted an evidence-based review of the literature in their respective areas of expertise. They then convened to discuss the latest treatment options for GSM in breast cancer survivors and to review management strategies for GSM in women with or at high risk for breast cancer, using a modified Delphi method. This iterative process involved presentations summarizing the literature, debate, and discussion of divergent opinions concerning GSM assessment and management, leading to the development of consensus recommendations for clinicians.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is more prevalent in breast cancer survivors, commonly undiagnosed and untreated, and may have an early onset due to cancer treatments or risk-reducing strategies. The paucity of evidence regarding the safety of vaginal hormone therapies in women with or at high risk for breast cancer has resulted in the avoidance of treatment, potentially adversely affecting quality of life.

### The 2020 genitourinary syndrome of menopause position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111HYfxb]. Menopause (2020). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To update and expand the 2013 position statement of the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) on the management of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), of which symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a component.

- **Methods**: A panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on vaginal hormone therapies and other management options available or in development for GSM. A search of PubMed identified medical literature on VVA and GSM published since the 2013 position statement on the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for VVA in postmenopausal women. The panel revised and added recommendations based on evidence. The panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

- **Results**: Genitourinary syndrome of menopause affects approximately 27% to 84% of postmenopausal women and can significantly impair health, sexual function, and quality of life. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is likely underdiagnosed and undertreated. In most cases, symptoms can be effectively managed. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogens and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), systemic hormone therapy, and the estrogen agonist/antagonist ospemifene.

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international Urogynecological Association research and development-committee opinion [^113ef5Hm]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Pelvic floor disorders (PFD) are common gynecologic complaints that adversely impact the quality of life (QoL) for many postmenopausal women due to their influence on physical, social, emotional, and sexual wellbeing. Although it is challenging to isolate the effects of declining estrogen levels in menopause from the aging process in general, it is evident that the pelvic organs and their surrounding muscular and connective tissue support are responsive to estrogen. Epidemiologic studies indicate that menopause is a major risk factor for the development of PFD, and the severity of these disorders increases significantly after menopause.

In recent years, there has been considerable discussion and controversy regarding local and systemic hormone replacement in postmenopausal women with PFD. Despite the existence of large data sets and clinical trials on the effect of systemic hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the impact of hormonal therapy (HT) in menopause on PFD remains a matter of debate.

The aim of this review was to examine the evidence on the role of hormones in pelvic floor disorders. A literature review was conducted to summarize the evidence on the influence of sex steroids as well as local and systemic HRT in postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence (UI), urinary tract infections (UTI), vulvovaginal symptoms (VVS), pelvic organ prolapse (POP), and anal incontinence (AI).

### Role of gynecologic findings in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome: A consensus [^112KQN2w]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

To evaluate the role of gynecologic findings in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) by reviewing international guidelines and identifying relevant gynecologic comorbidities, this consensus statement was developed through a systematic four-phase process:

1. **Literature review**: A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases (from inception to January 2025) using predefined search terms related to IC/BPS and gynecologic conditions.

2. **Expert panel assembly**: A multidisciplinary expert panel of six members, including urologists, urogynecologists, gynecologists, and pain specialists, was assembled.

3. **Consensus development**: Utilizing a modified Delphi technique, consensus was achieved through several electronic rating rounds and a face-to-face meeting, with agreement defined as ≥ 80%.

4. **Manuscript preparation**: The manuscript underwent an iterative review process.

A number of associated gynecologic disorders may overlap with IC/BPS. Our consensus committee identified five main comorbid disorders: endometriosis/adenomyosis, genito-pelvic pain penetration disorder/sexual dysfunction, overactive pelvic floor muscles, hormone-associated genitourinary changes, and vulvodynia/vestibulodynia.

While this consensus is not exhaustive, it highlights the most prevalent gynecologic comorbidities supported by literature. Clinical evaluation should prioritize a detailed medical history and pelvic examination to identify these overlapping conditions. Future directions include developing a multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment algorithm to guide clinicians.

### Preclinical models of endometriosis and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome: An Innovative Medicines Initiative-PainCare initiative to improve their value for translational research in pelvic pain [^116kuLnb]. Pain (2021). Low credibility.

Endometriosis (ENDO) is a chronic, hormone-dependent, peripheral neuroinflammatory condition associated with devastating pelvic pain. The defining hallmark of the disorder is the presence of tissue fragments (lesions), similar to the endometrium, outside the uterine cavity, rather than in the center of the uterus (eutopic endometrium).

Three major subtypes of ENDO have been defined based on lesion locations: superficial peritoneal, ovarian (endometrioma/cysts), and deep ENDO. There are no effective biomarkers for ENDO, and definitive diagnosis is based on imaging (deep, ovarian cyst) or laparoscopic visualization of the pelvis. Endometriosis is estimated to affect 6% to 10% of women of reproductive age and up to 50% of infertile women.

The natural history of the disease remains poorly understood, although genetic, immunological, and hormonal factors are all believed to contribute to disease severity. Notably, although research has identified changes in the central nervous system of patients with ENDO, investigators report a poor correlation between pain severity and the amount, location, and subtype of endometriotic lesions, with some affected patients even being asymptomatic.

Currently, there is no cure for ENDO, and it is difficult to treat. Most patients are offered surgery or drugs that symptomatically and inadequately treat pain or suppress estrogen action/production, causing temporary chemical castration. There are high recurrence rates after surgery, with estimates that lesions return in 40% to 50% of patients within 5 years.

### International urogynecology consultation chapter 2 committee 3: The clinical evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse including investigations into associated morbidity/pelvic floor dysfunction [^117LtrJg]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Low credibility.

This report is part of a series of articles produced by the International Urogynecology Consultation (IUC), sponsored by the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA). It is a 4-year, four-chapter project consisting of 16 reports dedicated to reviewing and summarizing global literature on pelvic organ prolapse (POP).

This report, from the 2nd year and chapter of the project, is dedicated to the evaluation of POP. This chapter is divided into three reviews; the other two involve the radiographic evaluation of POP and the use of patient-reported outcomes (POP condition-specific quality-of-life questionnaires) in the evaluation of POP. This report focuses on the clinical evaluation of women with POP, describing how to use the physical examination to assess pelvic organ support or prolapse. Additionally, it evaluates the associated testing to assess comorbid conditions of the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts (GITs), including radiographic testing.

It is recommended that every patient with POP undergoes a thorough clinical examination. Describing and evaluating the patient for POP, while seemingly straightforward, is quite complex. First, there are several classification systems currently in use to describe and quantify POP. Clinicians are then tasked with determining the relative benefits of using one system over another. Moreover, it is acknowledged that many patients with POP often have pelvic floor comorbidities.

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international urogynecological association research and development-committee opinion [^1117QgHR]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The relationship between hormones and pelvic floor disorders is still not entirely clear. Vaginal estrogens may play a useful role as an adjunct in the management of common pelvic floor disorders in postmenopausal women, and oral systemic estrogen administration seems to worsen urinary incontinence.

- **Effect of local estrogen on prolapse symptoms**: Evidence is scarce or absent. A Cochrane review by Ismail et al. did not find any clear evidence to suggest whether estrogens help in reducing the symptoms and concluded that an adequately powered randomized controlled trial with long-term follow-up is needed to identify the benefits or risks associated with estrogen supplementation in the prevention and management of pelvic organ prolapse.

- **Effect of local estrogen on overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms**: The use of local estrogen seems to be of clinical importance. Postmenopausal women are frequently treated with anticholinergic drugs, but the side effects cause many women to discontinue the medication. As one study demonstrated equivalent improvements with an ultra-low dose vaginal estradiol ring compared with an immediate-release oral anticholinergic, the use of an estradiol ring provides another treatment option to avoid this common malady. Nevertheless, it is currently unknown whether other anticholinergic drugs will be superior to vaginal estrogens alone in the management of OAB.

To better understand the sensation of bladder "pressure" and "discomfort" and how they are similar or distinct from the "pain" and "urgency" symptoms in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and overactive bladder (OAB), the following study was conducted.

- **Methods**: IC/BPS and OAB patients rated their bladder pain, pressure, discomfort, and urinary urgency on separate 0–10 numeric rating scales (NRS). These NRS ratings were compared between IC/BPS and OAB, and Pearson correlations were performed to analyze the data.

- **Results**: Among IC/BPS patients (n = 27), the mean numeric ratings of pain, pressure, discomfort, and urinary urgency were almost identical: 6.6 ± 2.1, 6.0 ± 2.5, 6.5 ± 2.2, and 6.0 ± 2.8, respectively. The three-way correlations between pain, pressure, or discomfort were very strong, all exceeding 0.77. In contrast, among OAB patients (n = 51), the mean numeric ratings of pain, pressure, and discomfort were significantly lower (2.0 ± 2.6, 3.4 ± 2.9, 3.4 ± 2.9) than urgency, which rated 6.1 ± 2.6 (p < 0.001). The correlations between urgency and pain, and between urgency and pressure in OAB were weak at 0.21 and 0.26, respectively. However, the correlation between urgency and discomfort was moderate at 0.45. The most bothersome symptom reported by IC/BPS patients was bladder/pubic pain, while OAB patients identified urinary urgency and daytime frequency as the most bothersome symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: IC/BPS patients perceive bladder pain, pressure, or discomfort as similar concepts and rate their intensity similarly. It remains unclear whether pressure or discomfort provide additional information beyond pain in IC/BPS. In OAB, discomfort may also be confused with urgency. It is recommended to re-examine the descriptors "pressure" or "discomfort" in the context of IC/BPS.

### AUA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome [^1126bonT]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

To provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, a systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Due to insufficient evidence-based data regarding diagnosis, this portion of the guideline is based on clinical principles and expert opinion statements. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the majority of the treatment portion of the guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Additional treatment information is provided as clinical principles and expert opinion when insufficient evidence existed. See the text and algorithm for definitions and detailed diagnostic management and treatment frameworks.

The evidence-based guideline statements are provided for the diagnosis and overall management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, as well as for various treatments. The panel identified first through sixth-line treatments and developed guideline statements on treatments that should not be offered.

In conclusion, interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is best identified and managed through the use of a logical algorithm.

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international Urogynecological Association research and development-committee opinion [^112P4YK2]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Local estrogen in the treatment of POP: Regarding POP, the role of LET is unclear. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a key constituent of the supportive tissue of the vagina, and alterations in ECM metabolism have been demonstrated in women with POP. Other studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) synthesis and activity were suppressed in the presence of estrogen, leading to decreased collagen degradation in pelvic floor connective tissue. Although estrogen supplementation has not been established as an effective preventive or therapeutic measure for POP, vaginal estrogen is often used to reduce side effects associated with conservative treatments (such as pessaries) and surgically implanted materials.

The only prospective study of 120 postmenopausal women, using pessaries with and without vaginal estrogen, found a trend towards a higher rate of complications among non-users of estrogen. Dessie et al. conducted a retrospective cohort study of 134 women treated with pessaries for at least 3 months. Their results demonstrated that women using vaginal estrogen were less likely to discontinue their pessary (30.6% vs. 58.5%, P < 0.001) or develop vaginal discharge [hazard ratio (HR) 0.31, 95% CI 0.17–0.58], but it was not protective against erosion (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54–1.6) or vaginal bleeding (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36–1.7).

Furthermore, in an RCT by Karp et al, using an estradiol-releasing ring for 12 weeks after pelvic floor repair resulted in improved markers of tissue quality, including slightly reduced urinary tract infections compared with placebo.

### An international urogynecological association (IUGA)/international continence society (ICS) joint report on the terminology for female pelvic floor dysfunction [^113DfuaK]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Next to existing terminology of the lower urinary tract, due to its increasing complexity, the terminology for pelvic floor dysfunction in women may be better updated by a female-specific approach and clinically based consensus report.

- **Methods**: This report combines the input of members of the Standardization and Terminology Committees of two International Organizations, the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) and the International Continence Society (ICS), assisted at intervals by many external referees. Appropriate core clinical categories and a subclassification were developed to give an alphanumeric coding to each definition. An extensive process of 15 rounds of internal and external review was developed to exhaustively examine each definition, with decision-making by collective opinion (consensus).

- **Results**: A terminology report for female pelvic floor dysfunction, encompassing over 250 separate definitions, has been developed. It is clinically based with the six most common diagnoses defined. Clarity and user-friendliness have been key aims to make it interpretable by practitioners and trainees in all the different specialty groups involved in female pelvic floor dysfunction. Female-specific imaging (ultrasound, radiology, and MRI) has been a major addition while appropriate figures have been included to supplement and help clarify the text. Ongoing review is not only anticipated but will be required to keep the document updated and as widely acceptable as possible.

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international urogynecological association research and development-committee opinion [^113QmWjx]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

There is clear evidence of the presence of estradiol receptors (ERs) in the female lower urinary and genital tract. Furthermore, it is a fact that estrogen deficiency after menopause may cause atrophic changes of the urogenital tract as well as various urinary symptoms. Moreover, the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on urinary incontinence (UI) symptoms, as well as pelvic organ prolapse (POP), anal incontinence (AI), and vulvovaginal symptoms (VVS), is still a matter of debate. This committee opinion paper summarizes the best evidence on the influence of sex steroids, as well as hormonal treatment (local and systemic), in postmenopausal women with pelvic floor disorders.

- **Methods**: A working subcommittee from the International Urogynecology Association (IUGA) Research and Development Committee was formed. A thorough literature search was conducted and an opinion statement expressed. The literature regarding hormones and pelvic floor disorders was reviewed independently and summarized by the individual members of the subcommittee.

- **Results**: The majority of studies reported that vaginal estrogen treatment, when compared with placebo, has more beneficial effects on symptoms and signs of vaginal atrophy, including sensation of burning, dyspareunia, and UI symptoms. Definitive evidence on local estrogen application and prolapse treatment or prevention is lacking. A statistically significant increase in the risk of worsening of UI, as well as the development of de novo incontinence, was observed with estrogen-only or combination systemic HRT.

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^116ymRcq]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

The understanding of lower urinary tract (LUT) function has gaps that must be addressed to advance therapeutically viable options. A deeper comprehension of how the bladder and urethra contribute to LUT function is essential. Historically, research has centered on the function of the entire LUT, attributing changes primarily to bladder function, often neglecting the contribution of urethral function. This approach poses challenges in understanding both compartments of the LUT. More often than not, studies have disproportionately focused on bladder function alone. For instance, mechanisms that enable the female urethra to maintain functional competence remain understudied, which result in an insufficient grasp of the pathophysiologies behind outlet obstruction and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. Hence, additional research should prioritize urethral function.

Another significant gap in fundamental knowledge involves bladder sensory signaling. Recent studies indicate that lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) may primarily arise from alterations in sensory processing, including possible disorders in the brain. Additionally, the urothelium, which lines the bladder lumen, may serve not only as a barrier but also function as a sensory transducer during bladder filling. However, this putative role and the mechanisms involved require further exploration. The bladder mucosa and the lamina propria are considered important functional centers of the bladder. Furthermore, while it is suggested that estrogen has a protective role for the urothelium against urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bladder cancer, a complete understanding of these protective mechanisms is yet to be realized.

### Assessment of bladder pressure and discomfort symptoms: How do overactive bladder differ from interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patients [^116ES1ea]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

The most bothersome symptom for over half of IC/BPS patients (51.9%) was pain, pressure, or discomfort localized in the bladder and pubic region, rather than the perineal area in men or vaginal area in women (7.4%). While a small percentage of OAB patients (9.8%) did complain of pain in the bladder and pubic area (and none in the perineal or vaginal area), the most bothersome symptoms were urinary urgency and daytime frequency, with 41.2% for both. Approximately 41.2% of OAB patients reported urgency as their most bothersome symptom, in contrast to ~4% in IC/BPS patients (p 0) pain, pressure, discomfort, or urgency.

One question we asked earlier was: how often did IC/BPS patients report pressure or discomfort without pain? In our IC/BPS cohort, there was no patient who reported any pressure or discomfort without pain. Every single patient reported pain, pressure, and discomfort. Additionally, 26 of 27 (96.3%) IC/BPS patients also reported non-zero urinary urgency or frequency along with pain.

Among OAB patients, 50 of 51 (98%) reported non-zero urinary urgency or frequency.

The role of local estrogens in the treatment of pelvic floor disorders involves several key factors.

- **Local estrogen in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)**: A systematic review of 44 individual clinical studies from 2014 concluded that all available vaginal estrogen preparations reduce LUTS, including urinary urgency, frequency, lower urinary tract pain, urgency urinary incontinence, and voiding dysfunction. Furthermore, some studies reported that local estrogen treatment (LET) improved the overall, subjective, objective, and urodynamic variables in urinary incontinence (UI) and overactive bladder (OAB); also, the mid-urethral closure pressure (MUCP) seemed greatest in patients treated with estrogens compared with pelvic floor exercises or electro-stimulation.

### Healthcare provider knowledge, attitudes, and preferences in management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in the Mid-South [^115JNDpz]. Menopause (2021). Low credibility.

This study explored the clinical management practices of healthcare providers who treat menopausal women in an urban Mid-South area. It specifically examined their knowledge of prescribing and counseling related to the care of women who present with complaints or clinical findings of genitourinary syndrome of menopause.

- **Methods**: An electronic questionnaire was distributed to healthcare providers involved in the care of women undergoing menopausal transition. The survey reached a variety of medical specialties and was distributed through academic program directors, coordinators, and ListServ administrators to targeted respondents. Items included demographic questions, clinical knowledge, management practices, and preferences. Statistical analysis for associations between demographics was performed using Chi-squared tests and between age groups with Kruskal-Wallis tests.

- **Results**: The final sample included 106 healthcare providers who were demographically diverse and encompassed multiple levels of professional training, including attendings, trainees (residents and fellows), as well as advanced practice registered nurses. Significant differences were noted in many areas examined in the questionnaire, including knowledge, management, counseling, and prescribing practices surrounding the treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause when accounting for training level, specialty, and years in practice. Among all respondents, 10.4% reported rarely or never discussing menopausal symptoms with their patients. Most respondents (76.4%) stated

Regarding therapeutic procedures for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to intravesical instillations, the RCOG 2017 guidelines recommend considering the following intravesical instillations if conservative and oral treatments have been unsuccessful. This should be approached using an individualized method, depending on the experience and expertise of the clinical team involved:

- **Lidocaine**: Used for its analgesic properties.
- **Hyaluronic acid**: Known for its potential in relieving bladder pain.
- **Botulinum toxin A**: Utilized for its muscle-relaxing effects.
- **Dimethyl sulfoxide**: Applied for its anti-inflammatory properties.
- **Heparin**: Considered for its potential to repair the bladder lining.
- **Chondroitin sulfate**: Used to help rebuild the bladder lining.

### What determines whether a patient with LUTS seeks treatment? ICI-RS 2011 [^113dLedm]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

To review the known determinants of healthcare-seeking behavior for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and address unmet needs and future research priorities, a comprehensive search of PubMed was conducted. This search focused on identifying factors influencing treatment-seeking behavior for LUTS, overactive bladder (OAB), and incontinence in both men and women.

Results show significant variation in treatment-seeking rates for LUTS across genders, with several biomedical and psychosocial factors identified as influential. Key determinants of seeking treatment include symptom severity, the extent of bother, age, and impact on quality of life. Race and ethnicity also have roles to play. Additional psychosocial determinants include advice from others, media influence, embarrassment, personal health beliefs, and subjective well-being. These factors can significantly affect a patient's decision to pursue medical advice for LUTS.

Future research should prioritize the following:

- **Reassurance versus medical treatment**: The balance between offering reassurance and recommending medical intervention.
- **Referral patterns**: Patterns in various populations regarding referrals for LUTS.
- **Comorbidities**: The role of additional health conditions in influencing healthcare-seeking behavior (HSB).
- **Cultural issues**: Understanding how cultural differences impact HSB.
- **Bother-associated parameters**: Investigating how the level of bother from symptoms affects healthcare-seeking.
- **Psychosocial profiles**: Creating profiles that link psychosocial factors with HSB.
- **Patients' expectations**: Studying patients' healthcare expectations.
- **Health economics**: Analyzing HSB in relation to economic factors.
- **Development of questionnaires**: Creating standardized questionnaires on HSB for both patients and physicians.

Conclusions indicate an increasing research interest in understanding the influence of various factors on HSB for LUTS. There is a pressing need for qualitative research and studies addressing aspects of HSB in subjects, not only those currently attending healthcare providers.

### Management of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms [^1139iWPf]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

Most women worldwide experience menopausal symptoms during the menopause transition or postmenopause. Vasomotor symptoms are most pronounced during the first four to seven years but can persist for more than a decade, and genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive. Although the hallmark symptoms are hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and genitourinary discomfort, other common symptoms and conditions include mood fluctuations, cognitive changes, low sexual desire, bone loss, increase in abdominal fat, and adverse changes in metabolic health. These symptoms and signs can occur in any combination or sequence, and the link to menopause may even be elusive.

Estrogen-based hormonal therapies are the most effective treatments for many of the symptoms and, in the absence of contraindications to treatment, have a generally favorable benefit:risk ratio for women below age 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause. Non-hormonal treatment options are also available. Although a symptom-driven treatment approach with individualized decision-making can improve health and quality of life for midlife women, menopausal symptoms remain substantially undertreated by healthcare providers.

### Perceptions of "urgency" in women with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome or overactive bladder [^114yfb4F]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

To compare urgency symptoms in women with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) and overactive bladder (OAB), women with diagnoses of IC/BPS (n = 194) and OAB (n = 85) were recruited from the clinical practices of urologists (n = 8) and gynecologists (n = 16) with recognized expertise in the diagnosis and management of these conditions. Subjects completed a comprehensive telephone survey about their symptoms, which included 11 questions about urinary urgency. Responses were compared between the two groups.

Urgency was commonly reported as a symptom by women with both conditions (81% IC/BPS and 91% OAB). Compared with IC/BPS, urgency in OAB more often resulted in leakage and was perceived to be more of a problem. In IC/BPS, urgency was primarily reported as due to pain, pressure, or discomfort, while in OAB, urgency was more commonly due to fear of leakage. However, approximately 40% of women with OAB also reported urgency due to pain, pressure, or discomfort. Similar proportions of both groups (approximately 60%) indicated that the urgency occurred "suddenly" instead of more gradually over a period of minutes or hours.

Urgency symptoms differed in women diagnosed with IC/BPS versus those diagnosed with OAB, but there was significant overlap. This suggests that "urgency" is not a well-defined and commonly understood symptom that can be utilized to clearly discriminate between IC/BPS and OAB. These findings reinforce the clinical observation that it is often challenging to differentiate between these conditions.

### Effective prevention of recurrent UTIs with vaginal estrogen: Pearls for a urological approach to genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^113uo2fE]. Urology (2021). High credibility.

To review the available data related to the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) in postmenopausal women with vaginal estrogen preparations and provide the urologic community with the confidence to identify and treat genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), a literature search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was performed. The objective was to identify studies utilizing vaginal estrogen in the treatment of urological conditions related to rUTI and GSM.

In the setting of untreated GSM, the etiology of rUTIs, defined as at least three episodes of UTIs in 12 months or at least two episodes in 6 months, is not fully elucidated. However, estrogen deficiency is a contributing factor. The diagnosis of GSM is primarily clinical, supported by objective findings including a vaginal pH greater than 5, decreased content of superficial cells, and/or increased proportion of parabasal cells on the vaginal maturation index. Local vaginal estrogen, dehydroepiandrosterone (prasterone), and ospemifene are commonly used GSM treatments. Thirty-one trials were identified utilizing estrogen preparations for rUTI in postmenopausal women.

Overall, multiple randomized clinical trials have successfully been completed to demonstrate the efficacy of local estrogen preparations for the treatment of rUTIs. This high-yield review provides a framework for assessing GSM, prescribing recommendations for local vaginal hormone preparations, and a summary of the substantial evidence supporting the new 2019 American Urological Association guidelines.

### Oestrogens and overactive bladder [^111omvDC]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

Estrogens are known to play a major role in the function of the lower urinary tract, although the role of exogenous estrogen replacement therapy in managing women with lower urinary tract dysfunction remains controversial. For many years, systemic and vaginal estrogen therapy were considered beneficial in the treatment of lower urinary and genital tract symptoms; however, this evidence has recently been challenged by large epidemiological studies investigating the use of systemic hormone replacement therapy. Consequently, the role of estrogen in managing postmenopausal women with overactive bladder (OAB) remains uncertain.

Additionally, the evidence regarding the use of exogenous estrogen therapy has changed significantly over the last decade, leading to major changes in clinical practice. The aim of this article is to review the evidence for the role of estrogen therapy in managing OAB, focusing on knowledge regarding both systemic and local estrogen therapy, as well as investigating the emerging role of combination therapy with antimuscarinic agents.

### Do we need to know more about the effects of hormones on lower urinary tract dysfunction? ICI-RS 2014 [^1131Urxb]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2016). Low credibility.

This review article reflects the presentations and subsequent discussions during a think tank at the 5th International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society's annual meeting, held in Bristol, UK (September 22–24, 2014). It reviews the state of knowledge on the role of hormones in lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) and overactive bladder (OAB). The article highlights specific basic research findings from discussion participants, reviews future research topics, and discusses potential new therapeutic opportunities for LUTD and OAB.

- **Role of BK channels**: The role of the large conductance voltage- and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channels, as novel therapeutic targets for OAB, was discussed. Recent studies on human detrusor smooth muscle suggest that estradiol exerts a direct non-genomic activation of the BK channels.

- **Other hormonal roles**: Developments on the roles of sex hormones on diuresis and the roles of melatonin and vitamin D on LUTD were also discussed.

It was concluded that further basic science and translational studies are needed to better understand hormonal regulatory mechanisms of the lower urinary tract and the implications for novel treatment options for LUTD and OAB.

### Prevalence of interstitial cystitis symptoms in a managed care population [^1123TURw]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

We calculated the prevalence of symptoms typically associated with interstitial cystitis (IC) in men and women in a managed care population in the Pacific Northwest.

- **Materials and methods**: International Classification of Diseases-9 based queries of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland, Oregon database were used to identify subjects with IC exclusion criteria, who were excluded from further analysis. A total of 10,000 questionnaires, including 5,000 for women and 5,000 for men, were mailed to subjects with codes indicating bladder symptoms and to those with none of the codes. The questionnaires included questions about the presence of IC symptoms and the O'Leary-Sant interstitial cystitis questionnaire. IC symptoms were defined in two ways: (1) pelvic pain at least 3 months in duration plus urgency or frequency at least 3 months in duration, and (2) the same criteria plus pain increasing as the bladder fills and/or pain relieved by urination.

- **Results**: The prevalence of IC symptoms according to definitions 1 and 2 was 11.2% and 6.2% in women, and 4.6% and 2.3% in men, respectively. Symptoms were long-standing, with a duration greater than 1 year in 80% of cases, and bothersome, with a severity score of 5 or greater in more than 50% of cases. Mean O'Leary-Sant interstitial cystitis questionnaire scores were 15.94 in subjects with definition 1 IC symptoms, 18.97 in those with definition 2 IC symptoms, and 6.69 in those with no IC symptoms (p < 0.001). Symptoms were most common and most severe in subjects previously diagnosed with IC.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of IC symptoms is significant in this managed care population.

### Specialist practices for managing persons living with dementia and urinary incontinence [^116AmYvT]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Low credibility.

A secondary analysis comparing urogynecologists with urologists and gynecologists without URPS training showed similarities in responses among the three groups, with statistically significant differences in responses to only two questions: first, "The fact that the caregiver [husband] is overwhelmed factored into my treatment decision/s" (p = 0.024), and second, "The fact that the husband considered placing the patient in a nursing facility because of her incontinence factored into my treatment decision/s" (p = 0.013).

When considering resources for caring for PLWD with incontinence, 22.8% of urologists and gynecologists supported reviewing relevant research, 16.7% supported participating in topical online training, 14.9% supported attending a topical online conference, and 40.4% supported attending an in-person conference. Five percent of specialists supported being presented with guidelines to inform their management of PLWD with incontinence.

- **Qualitative analysis**: Of the 273 completed questionnaires, 82 respondents provided 111 free-text comments representing urologists (19), gynecologists (65), and geriatricians (27). Thematic saturation was 97.4%.

- **Themes identified**:
	- Medication changes
	- Further work-up
	- Nonmedical care
	- Procedural or invasive interventions

### How can we develop a more clinically useful and robust algorithm for diagnosing and treating nocturia? ICI-RS 2017 [^114EwTsj]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Nocturia, or waking up at night to void, is a highly prevalent and bothersome symptom. Currently, there is a lack of clear and consistent recommendations regarding the evaluation and management of nocturia. The aim of this report is to discuss how to fill the gaps in our knowledge to develop a practical, patient-oriented diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for nocturia.

This paper reports on the presentations and subsequent discussions from a Think Tank session at the annual International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI-RS) in June 2017, Bristol. Further investigations are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of nocturia, allowing for improved diagnosis and optimized treatment by increasing efficacy and reducing adverse events. Patient-oriented practical guidelines on nocturia are needed to help clinicians from different disciplines diagnose and treat nocturia.

### European Association of Urology position statement on the role of the urologist in the management of male hypogonadism and testosterone therapy [^114szMj6]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone is a crucial sex hormone important for the health and development of men of all ages. It plays a role in maintaining the integrity and function of several systems and organs. Testosterone deficiency is linked to a number of signs and symptoms potentially affecting every man in his complexity and masculinity and is, therefore, of strong urological interest. For this reason, urologists should attach importance to the need for knowledge, vocational education, and training in this specific area.

### Effectiveness of hormones in postmenopausal pelvic floor dysfunction-international urogynecological association research and development-committee opinion [^111uRugq]. International Urogynecology Journal (2020). Low credibility.

A wide variety of topical estrogen administration forms and different dosages were used in the reported studies. Furthermore, heterogeneous control groups were used, and LET was compared with placebo, no treatment, or non-hormonal treatment. There were a few RCTs, but they were not adequately powered. Therefore, most of the results have to be interpreted with caution.

Most of the recommendations are evidence level 2C, meaning a low quality of evidence, and there is still a need for additional robust evidence. LET seems to be safe and beneficial in the treatment of VVS compared with placebo. LET improves lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and UI in postmenopausal women. LET also improves the vaginal environment and reduces UTIs at the time of prolapse surgery. However, little evidence exists to support the effect of LET on the quality of surgical repair, prolapse recurrence, etc. Postmenopausal women on systemic hormonal treatment should be counseled regarding the increased risk of worsening of urinary incontinence symptoms or the development of de novo incontinence and possibly fecal incontinence.

Evidence is too sparse to give any recommendations regarding the effectiveness of LET in the treatment or prevention of POP. No evidence and recommendations exist regarding the duration, optimal dosage, long-term effect, and cost-effectiveness of estrogen treatment.

### A survey of primary care physician practices in the diagnosis and management of women with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome [^111njD74]. Urology (2010). Low credibility.

To describe the practice patterns among primary care physicians (PCPs) managing patients with symptoms suggestive of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS), a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: A clinical vignette was developed to describe a woman with typical IC/PBS symptoms. This vignette elicited questions related to etiology, management strategies, and PCPs' familiarity with the syndrome. The questionnaire was mailed to 556 PCPs, including both academicians and community physicians, across Boston, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

- **Results**: A total of 290 completed questionnaires were returned, resulting in a response rate of 52%. Among the respondents, 19% reported they had "never" encountered a patient like the one described in the vignette. Two-thirds of respondents correctly identified bladder pain/pressure as the hallmark symptom of IC/PBS. On the etiology, 90% correctly indicated that IC/PBS was a noninfectious disease, 76% reported it was not caused by a sexually transmitted infection, and 61% indicated it was not caused by a psychiatric illness. Common treatments included antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Referrals were often made to specialists.

- **Conclusions**: Although most PCPs claim familiarity with IC/PBS, they manage the condition infrequently. There are significant knowledge deficits regarding the clinical characteristics of IC/PBS, and PCPs exhibit variable practice patterns in its diagnosis and treatment. Educational efforts aimed at PCPs are likely to improve patient care for those suffering from IC/PBS.

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^1114q96Y]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

After a day of topical presentations and discussions, the entire group discussed the most important research recommendations emerging from the Roundtable. A summary of the discussion specific to each area follows. The specific recommendations are listed in Table 3.

As a whole, the experts agreed that given the demonstrated effectiveness of incontinence treatment, research is needed on methods of increasing healthcare-seeking behavior for women with incontinence, as well as the implementation of successful prevention and treatment strategies that extend the reach of and optimize individual adherence to effective continence promotion programs. However, while many effective treatments are available, there exists a fundamental lack of understanding of the pathophysiology underlying lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction, resulting in nontargeted therapies. Physicians are only able to treat symptoms but cannot correct pathophysiological causes. This shortcoming, combined with the generalized grouping of patients according to symptoms rather than disease mechanisms, results in relatively poor management and ineffective treatment.

Discussions concluded that it is important to understand normal function along with dysfunction to identify the root cause of a problem, with the ultimate goal of preventing disease. Knowledge gaps in research have resulted from inadequate phenotype definitions of urinary dysfunction, insufficient data to determine what is normal and abnormal, and animal models that do not appropriately reflect human disease.

### Do we have the evidence to produce tools to enable the identification and personalization of management of women's pelvic floor health disorders through the perinatal and perimenopausal periods? ICI-RS 2024 [^111vfcxQ]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) encompasses various types, with urgency urinary incontinence more prevalent in Black women and stress urinary incontinence more common in white women. Asian women are more likely to sustain an obstetric anal sphincter injury than white women. In general, PFDs have a prevalence that increases with age, which can be due to multifactorial reasons such as the reduction or cessation of oestrogen production during the perimenopausal period, the ageing process itself, and comorbidities.

Menopause is a critical factor because the genital and lower urinary tract have oestrogen receptors. The lack of oestrogens correlates with histological and functional changes and the onset of genital and urinary symptoms. The term "genitourinary syndrome of menopause" (GSM) has been proposed to describe the multiple changes occurring in the external genitalia, pelvic floor tissues, bladder, urethra, and the sexual sequelae of loss of sexual function and libido, caused by hypoestrogenism during the menopause transition and postmenopause. The prevalence of GSM is 4% during perimenopause, rising to 25% after one year of menopause, and 47% after three years.

The importance of oestrogen depletion in the occurrence of pelvic floor dysfunction has been described by Erekson et al. who showed a correlation of vulvovaginal symptoms with PFD in postmenopausal women.

### Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome: Diagnosis and management [^111wdhYE]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a spectrum of urological symptoms characterized by bladder pain with typical cystoscopic features. Diagnosis and management of this syndrome may be difficult, as there is no evidence-based management approach for the diagnosis or treatment of BPS. The objective of this study was to critically review and summarize the evidence related to the diagnosis and treatment of bladder pain syndrome.

A review of published data on the diagnosis and treatment of BPS was performed, limited to English-language articles on the "diagnosis", "management", or "treatment" of "interstitial cystitis" and the "bladder pain syndrome" in "humans".

Frequency, urgency, and pain on bladder filling are the most common symptoms of BPS, with all urodynamic volumes reduced in patients. Associated conditions include psychological distress, depression, history of sexual assault, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia. Cystoscopy remains the test for definitive diagnosis, with visualization of hemorrhage on cystoreduction.

A multidisciplinary treatment approach is essential in managing this condition. Orally administered amitriptyline is an efficacious medical treatment for BPS. Intravesical hyaluronic acid and local anesthetic, with or without hydrodistension, are among new treatment strategies. Sacral or pudendal neuromodulation is effective, minimally invasive, and safe. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases.

There remains a paucity of evidence for the diagnosis and…

### Prevalence, diagnosis, characterization, and treatment of prostatitis, interstitial cystitis, and epididymitis in outpatient urological practice: the Canadian PIE study [^1133aRZe]. Urology (2005). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence, diagnostic patterns, and management of prostatitis, interstitial cystitis, and epididymitis (PIE) in Canadian urology outpatient practice.

Representative urologists were randomly selected from the Canadian and Quebec Urological Associations. Each patient identified with a PIE diagnosis during a typical two-consecutive-week period from April to July 2004 was requested to complete a corresponding Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (CPSI), O'Leary-Sant Symptom Index (OSSI), or a Chronic Epididymitis Symptom Index (CESI). Daily, the participating urologist completed an outpatient log and a detailed programmed chart review to transcribe demographics, investigations, and treatments associated with each PIE patient.

Sixty-five urologists were invited to participate, with 57 (88%) agreeing and 48 (74%) completing the audit. Among the 8712 patients seen in outpatient practice (average 182 per urologist), 2675 were female and 6037 male. Prostatitis was identified in 2.7% of the men (n = 166; mean age 50 years; mean duration 3.1 years; mean CPSI score 19.7), interstitial cystitis in 2.8% of patients (n = 242; 211 women [7.9%], 26 men [0.4%]; mean age 50.2 years; mean duration 4.5 years; mean OSSI score 11.8), and epididymitis in 0.9% of men (n = 57; mean age 41.1 years; mean duration 2.5 years; mean CESI score 15.5). There was wide variance in investigations and treatments.

This prospective audit indicates that prostatitis might not be as common as frequently believed and that interstitial cystitis is more prevalent than expected.

### Female urinary incontinence evidence-based treatment pathway: An infographic for shared decision-making [^113ezGmy]. Journal of Women's Health (2022). Low credibility.

There is broad international and multidisciplinary agreement on most components of the urinary incontinence (UI) care pathway, including adopting a stepwise approach. Universal consensus for first-line care for stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) includes pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and other behavioral modifications, such as bladder training, dietary changes, and/or fluid titration. PFMT is defined as "exercises for improving pelvic floor muscle strength, endurance, power, and/or relaxation". Level I evidence supports the effectiveness of PFMT and describes this intervention as most effective when performed under the supervision of a skilled healthcare professional (supervised PFMT/sPFMT) for a period of at least 12 weeks.

Recent publications highlight personal and structural barriers to implementing sPFMT for all women with UI. Gross limitations in the health workforce leave too few healthcare professionals (HCPs) with the skills to provide sPFMT compared to the number of women who require it. New care models are being tested and proposed to build capacity within the broader health system to care for women with UI. These include group-based PFMT, unsupervised PFMT, and the use of mobile technologies. Components of first-line care are considered minimal or no risk and may also play a role in multimodal therapy, implemented alongside advanced interventions.

Vaginal estrogen is recommended when vaginal atrophy is present with urinary symptoms. Beyond this and the first-line care described earlier, remaining treatment interventions for UI address either SUI or UUI (or the respective component of MUI).

### Menopause hormone therapy and urinary symptoms: A systematic review [^117Bu6Gt]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Urogenital changes associated with menopause are now classified as genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which includes symptoms of urgency, frequency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) for which estrogen is the recommended treatment. However, the association between menopause and urinary symptoms and the efficacy of hormone therapy for these symptoms remains uncertain.

Our objective was to define the relationship between menopause and urinary symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, recurrent UTIs, and urge and stress incontinence by conducting a systematic review of the effects of hormone therapy (HT) for urinary symptoms in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Eligible studies included randomized control trials with perimenopausal and postmenopausal women with a primary or secondary outcome of the following urinary symptoms: dysuria, frequent UTIs, urgency, frequency, and incontinence. These studies included at least one treatment arm of estrogen therapy and were in English. Excluded studies were animal trials, cancer studies, pharmacokinetic studies, secondary analyses, and conference abstracts. PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until April 2022. Two authors reviewed each article, with discrepancies resolved through whole group consensus. Data extracted included publication date, country, setting, subject number, follow-up duration, age, race/ethnicity, study design, inclusion criteria, and main findings.

### Improving management of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause: evaluation of a health system-based, cluster-randomized intervention [^1115mdRJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Genitourinary symptoms are common in postmenopausal women and adversely affect their quality of life. National surveys and data collected from our healthcare system indicate that postmenopausal women with the genitourinary syndrome of menopause often fail to receive appropriate diagnosis or treatment.

- **Objective**: To promote greater detection and treatment of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, we created and tested a clinician-focused health system intervention that included clinician education sessions and a suite of evidence-based electronic health record tools.

- **Study design**: Using a cluster-randomized design, we allocated 16 primary care and 6 gynecology clinics to the intervention or control group. From September to November 2014, we provided training about the diagnosis and treatment of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause through face-to-face presentations at each intervention clinic and in an online video. We developed clinical decision support tools in the electronic health record that contained an evidence-based, point-of-care knowledge resource, a standardized order set, and a checklist of patient education materials for the patient's after-visit summary.

	- The tools aimed to facilitate accurate diagnostic coding and prescribing (SmartSet, SmartRx) along with relevant patient information (SmartText). Clinicians who only performed visits at control clinics received no training or notification about the tools. Our primary outcome was vulvovaginal diagnoses made at well visits for women aged 55 years and older from November 15, 2014, to November 1.

### Current controversies that adversely affect interstitial cystitis patients [^1168eRG1]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC) remains a diagnosis of exclusion based on the symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and pelvic pain in the absence of other definable causes. Certain areas of controversy in the field of IC research have a significant adverse effect on patients. Many physicians still do not believe that IC exists or else believe that it is a rare postmenopausal condition. This can cause significant delays in diagnosis and treatment.

It is particularly problematic in children, whose symptoms are often diagnosed as "voiding dysfunction" and are thought to be self-limiting. It can also be problematic for men, who are often unsuccessfully treated for prostatitis over the course of many years, and for whom the diagnosis of IC is never entertained. In some cases, when no diagnosis is made, patients are left to live with severe, debilitating symptoms and have nowhere to turn for help.

Resistance to treating severe nonmalignant pain with opioid medication further compounds this problem and has led to suicide in this patient population. The "gold standard" of cystoscopy with hydrodistention is now being questioned, and an overreliance on the potassium test, which has a high false-negative rate, may lead to significant underdiagnosis of IC. New urinary markers hold promise for both diagnostic as well as therapeutic potential but are not yet commercially available.

IC may be an organ-specific disease in some patients and a systemic condition in others. Many patients have multiple disorders and have no physician to manage their overall health.

### Vaginal estrogen for genitourinary syndrome of menopause: A systematic review [^112EXbvC]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to comprehensively review and critically assess the literature on vaginal estrogen and its alternatives for women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause and to provide clinical practice guidelines.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to April 2013. We included randomized controlled trials and prospective comparative studies. Interventions and comparators included all commercially available vaginal estrogen products. Placebo, no treatment, systemic estrogen (all routes), and nonhormonal moisturizers and lubricants were included as comparators.

- **Methods of study selection**: We double-screened 1,805 abstracts, identifying 44 eligible studies. Discrepancies were adjudicated by a third reviewer. Studies were individually and collectively assessed for methodological quality and strength of evidence.

- **Tabulation, integration, and results**: Studies were extracted for participants, intervention, comparator, and outcomes data, including patient-reported atrophy symptoms (e.g. vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, dysuria, urgency, frequency, urinary tract infection [UTI], and urinary incontinence), objective signs of atrophy, urodynamic measures, endometrial effects, serum estradiol changes, and adverse events. Compared with placebo, vaginal estrogens improved dryness, dyspareunia, urinary urgency, frequency, and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). Urinary tract infection rates decreased. The various estrogen preparations had similar efficacy and safety; serum estradiol levels remained within the postmenopausal range.
