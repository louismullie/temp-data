## Question

For an ascending aorta measuring 4.2 cm, when should follow-up be scheduled?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when follow-up should be scheduled for an ascending aorta measuring 4.2 cm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline risk and where 4.2 cm sits relative to surgical thresholds. Then, I should verify the recommended initial imaging interval to establish growth rate. Next, I will examine the optimal imaging modality and measurement technique and ensure consistency across studies. After that, I need to assess how growth rate should alter surveillance cadence. Then, I should consider special etiologies like bicuspid aortic valve and heritable aortopathies that might change the plan. Finally, I will synthesize a practical schedule and double-check that it aligns with major guidelines and contemporary evidence.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk context and thresholds. A 4.2 cm ascending aorta is a moderate-size thoracic aortic aneurysm in a sporadic, non-syndromic patient and remains below the usual elective surgical thresholds of 5.0–5.5 cm, though alternate indexed criteria can identify earlier operative candidacy in select patients, especially women with smaller body size, so I need to keep those indices in mind if the anatomy approaches borderline diameters or if clinical risk increases [^112tfT9f] [^116W2twG].

> Next, I should review the initial surveillance interval to determine patient-specific growth. The ACC/AHA recommends repeat imaging within 6–12 months after identifying thoracic aortic dilation to calculate a growth rate; wait, I almost said 12 months by default, but to be precise the first reassessment should be within 6–12 months, and in a 4.2 cm aorta I prefer 6 months to establish a reliable baseline because early growth behavior is unpredictable and typical growth is slow but variable across individuals [^112tfT9f] [^113h2NTr] [^112cNPD4].

> I need to check the best imaging modality and ensure consistent measurements across serial studies. TTE is acceptable for the aortic root and proximal ascending aorta if visualization is adequate, but hold on, I should verify segment-specific guidance; ESC 2024 advises using CT or MRI rather than TTE for surveillance when the aneurysm is in the distal ascending aorta, arch, or descending thoracic aorta, so if windows are limited or the dilation is distal, cross-sectional imaging is preferred; regardless of modality, use the same modality and the same measurement method each time, measuring perpendicular to flow and using outer-edge to outer-edge on CT/MRI, and leading-edge to leading-edge on echo to minimize interstudy variability [^112tfT9f] [^112EvkFf] [^113zHaAx] [^111y9muD] [^116FJ6G8] [^114NRvBc].

> Now, I will examine growth-rate definitions and how they steer interval adjustments. If the annualized growth is slow, continue routine surveillance; if growth is rapid, intensify follow-up, with a pragmatic "rapid growth" threshold of about 0.5 cm/year for sporadic disease triggering closer intervals and consideration of surgical planning, while acknowledging that measured growth can be confounded by technique and reproducibility issues; hmm, wait a minute, measurement error of 2–5 mm can obscure true growth, so I should double-check that comparisons are like-for-like with the same modality and methodology before declaring "rapid growth" [^112tfT9f] [^111ZeqXm] [^112Uwooi].

> Let me think about the long-term cadence when growth is slow or stable after that first interval. If the 6–12 month reassessment shows no or minimal change, ACC/AHA supports surveillance every 6–24 months based on size and stability; for a 4.2 cm ascending aorta, an annual interval is reasonable initially, and if stability is durable over time, spacing toward 18–24 months can be considered, with the caveat that approaching size milestones should prompt shortening the interval again as risk evolves [^112tfT9f].

> Hold on, I should verify how size milestones should alter frequency. As the diameter approaches 4.5 cm, many clinicians shorten to 6–12 months, and reaching or nearing 5.0 cm typically warrants imaging every 6 months to detect acceleration promptly and to coordinate timely surgical referral if thresholds or indexed criteria are met, aligning with contemporary practice patterns and guideline intent to link surveillance density to risk [^112tfT9f] [^116W2twG].

> Next, I should review modifiers that mandate more aggressive surveillance. Bicuspid aortic valve requires lifelong imaging with the interval determined by size and growth; Marfan syndrome calls for a baseline TTE, repeat at 6 months to establish growth, then annual imaging if stable, using CT/MRI when echo visualization is inadequate; Loeys-Dietz typically warrants at least annual imaging of involved segments and periodic chest-to-pelvis cross-sectional imaging even when proximal diameters are stable; Turner syndrome merits at least annual aortic surveillance when the aortic size index is elevated; family history of dissection and pregnancy planning should also lower the threshold for tighter intervals and advanced imaging [^116UwJua] [^114UcB7e] [^114queV1] [^113RhLUw] [^113XAUR4] [^113K2Efi] [^116B22AA].

> I need to ensure the technical details of measurement are reproducible each time to avoid false growth calls. That means using the same imaging modality whenever feasible, measuring at standard anatomic landmarks, perpendicular to the axis of flow, outer-to-outer on CT/MRI, and leading-edge to leading-edge on echo, because even small inconsistencies can simulate or mask growth; if discrepant numbers appear between studies or modalities, I should verify with repeat imaging using the identical technique before changing management [^113zHaAx] [^111y9muD] [^114NRvBc] [^116FJ6G8] [^111ZeqXm].

> But wait, beyond imaging cadence, I should confirm concurrent risk factor management since it modifies event risk independent of size. Optimize blood pressure control and consider beta-blocker or ARB-based regimens as appropriate, enforce smoking cessation, and manage atherosclerotic risk, all within a shared decision-making framework emphasized by the guidelines for comprehensive aortic care and longitudinal surveillance planning [^117G5oCS].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize a concrete plan for this typical 4.2 cm ascending aneurysm without syndromic features. First follow-up imaging in 6 months to establish growth using the same modality and method; if stable, continue annually, with consideration of extending to 18–24 months only after serial stability is clearly documented, while shortening to 6–12 months as the diameter approaches 4.5 cm and to about every 6 months when nearing 5.0 cm; choose TTE only if the proximal ascending aorta is well visualized, otherwise use ECG-gated CT or MRI, particularly for distal ascending involvement, and keep technique constant for comparability [^112tfT9f] [^112EvkFf] [^113zHaAx] [^111y9muD].

> I should double-check that this aligns with the core guidance and contemporary evidence. The surveillance intervals and emphasis on early reassessment to derive growth rate are concordant with ACC/AHA recommendations, the modality consistency and measurement standards align with EACTS/STS principles, and the caution about TTE's limitations for distal ascending and beyond follows ESC 2024, while the expectation of slow median growth and lack of correlation between baseline diameter and growth support the plan to individualize intervals based on observed behavior rather than size alone [^112tfT9f] [^113zHaAx] [^112EvkFf] [^113h2NTr] [^112cNPD4].

---

For a 4.2 cm ascending aorta, repeat imaging in 12 months [^112tfT9f] is recommended to assess stability and growth. If stable (growth < 0.5 cm/year), continue surveillance every 1–2 years [^112tfT9f]; if growth is ≥ 0.5 cm/year or the diameter reaches 5.0 cm, shorten intervals to every 6 months and refer to a specialist [^112Z2r61] [^113X7dsv]. Use the same imaging modality and measurement technique [^113zHaAx] [^114NRvBc] for consistency, and tailor follow-up to patient-specific risk factors such as bicuspid aortic valve [^116UwJua], connective tissue disorders [^113RhLUw] [^114queV1], or family history [^112GAgcs].

---

## Recommended follow-up intervals

The **2022 ACC/AHA guidelines** provide clear recommendations for **follow-up imaging intervals** based on aortic diameter and growth rate [^117G5oCS]:

- **Initial follow-up imaging**: Obtain follow-up imaging (TTE, CT, or MRI) within 6–12 months [^112tfT9f] after the initial diagnosis to determine the rate of aortic enlargement.

- **Stable aorta**: If the aortic diameter remains stable (growth rate < 0.5 cm/year), surveillance imaging every 1–2 years [^112tfT9f] is appropriate.

- **Rapid growth or larger diameter**: If the aorta grows rapidly (≥ 0.5 cm/year [^112tfT9f]) or reaches 5.0 cm, shorten intervals to every 6 months and refer to a specialist [^112Z2r61].

---

## Imaging modalities and measurement techniques

Consistency in imaging modality and measurement technique is **essential** [^111ZeqXm] for accurate assessment of aortic growth. Imaging modalities include **TTE, CT, or MRI** [^112EvkFf], selected based on patient anatomy and clinical context [^112tfT9f]. Measurement technique entails measuring the aorta **perpendicular to the axis of blood flow** at reproducible anatomical landmarks, using the same modality and method for serial imaging [^114NRvBc] [^113zHaAx].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors influencing follow-up

Several patient-specific factors may necessitate **more frequent follow-up**:

- **Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV)**: Lifelong surveillance imaging of the aortic root and ascending aorta [^111mxEYZ] is recommended, with intervals based on diameter and growth rate [^116UwJua].

- **Connective tissue disorders**: Conditions such as Marfan syndrome [^11558n4x] or Loeys-Dietz syndrome require more frequent surveillance due to higher risk of rapid aortic growth and complications [^113RhLUw] [^114queV1].

- **Family history**: A family history of aortic aneurysm or dissection may warrant closer monitoring [^113vxZgp].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or inadequate follow-up

Delayed or inadequate follow-up can lead to **significant clinical consequences** [^111e41D2], including **increased risk of complications**, because delayed detection of rapid aortic growth or aneurysm formation raises the risk of aortic dissection, rupture, and mortality [^112EvkFf]. It may also result in **missed intervention opportunities**, reducing the chance for timely surgical intervention [^112Z2r61].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended follow-up interval** | **Imaging modality** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial diagnosis of ascending aorta dilation (4.2 cm) | 6–12 months [^112tfT9f] | - TTE <br/> - CT <br/> - Or MRI |
| Stable aorta (growth < 0.5 cm/year) | Every 1–2 years [^112tfT9f] | Same modality as initial |
| Rapid growth (≥ 0.5 cm/year) or diameter ≥ 5.0 cm | Every 6 months [^112Z2r61] | Same modality as initial |
| Bicuspid aortic valve or connective tissue disorder | - Lifelong surveillance <br/> - Interval based on diameter and growth rate [^116UwJua] [^113RhLUw] | - TTE <br/> - CT <br/> - Or MRI [^112EvkFf] |

---

For a 4.2 cm ascending aorta, **repeat imaging in 12 months** [^112tfT9f] is recommended to assess stability and growth. If the aorta remains stable, continue surveillance **every 1–2 years**; if rapid growth occurs or the diameter increases, shorten intervals and refer to a specialist [^112Z2r61].

Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm (aTAA) is a common yet poorly understood disease, with a significant population burden; approximately 3 to 23 million people in the United States alone meet guidelines for imaging surveillance. Thoracic aortic dilation is estimated to affect 3% of people aged over 50 years, with specific patient factors (e.g. bicuspid aortic valve [BAV], hereditary thoracic aortic disease [HTAD]) associated with even higher rates of dilation (over 50%). The prevalence of thoracic aortic dilation is increasing, likely because of increasing population age, which drives increased incidence, and higher rates of incidental detection on computed tomography (CT) scans for other common indications (e.g. lung cancer screening, coronary calcium scoring).

Although typically an asymptomatic and indolent disease, patients with aTAA remain at risk of developing rapid growth and type A aortic dissection (TAAD). Open surgical repair of the ascending aorta is the only effective treatment to prevent the future risk of TAAD, with the maximal diameter of the ascending aorta used as the primary metric to inform risk and surgical candidacy. The revised 2022 American Heart Association guidelines recommend surgical repair of sporadic aTAA once the maximal diameter reaches 50 to 55 mm, depending on patient-specific risk factors and center expertise.

### Follow-up after the Ross procedure, how significant it is, case reports of three patients [^117FLSFE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The 2010 AHA/ACC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with thoracic aortic disease suggested that the follow-up interval after aortic root and ascending aorta procedures should be a baseline transthoracic echocardiographic examination before discharge and then on a yearly basis.

The 2014 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of aortic diseases suggested that for patients undergoing surgical thoracic aortic repair, the first follow-up should be performed one month after treatment, and surveillance should be repeated after 6 months, 12 months, and then yearly. Computer tomography (CT) is the modality of choice, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or transthoracic/transesophageal echocardiography (TTE/TOE) may be used as alternative modalities.

Evangelista A suggested that after surgery, imaging control by TTE/TOE should be performed before discharge and a TTE annually thereafter. In cases with an ascending aorta diameter greater than 45 mm, MRI or CT should be performed every 2–3 years.

In our group of patients, we could not isolate any factors which may justify the diverse outcomes in different patients. It is a small registry, and we cannot draw definite conclusions. Moreover, all the operations were performed with the same surgical technique, all the patients had the same demographic characteristics, and the treatment of a beta-blocker in some patients with a hyperdynamic circulation did not have any influence on the aneurysm growth rate. Recently, in a review, the role of the beta-blocker in the prevention of aortic aneurysms was questioned.

### Low rates of aortic surveillance imaging and clinical follow-up in patients with acute aortic dissection [^117MLdfr]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Patients that survive acute aortic dissection (AD) remain at high risk of morbidity and mortality due to structural changes of the aorta. Aortic surveillance is particularly challenging within a tertiary referral center. This study aimed to identify follow-up imaging and appointment rates, and factors associated with incomplete surveillance in patients with acute AD.

This was a single-center, retrospective study conducted on acute AD patients at a tertiary care center from July 2012 to December 2022 who survived at least one year post-dissection. Complete surveillance was defined as having computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans of the chest and abdomen at one month (± 14 days), six months (± 1.5 months), one year (± 3 months), and annually thereafter. Data were collected from electronic health records. Predictors of absent imaging at the one-year (± 3 months) time point were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.

Of the 272 patients in the study, 63.2% were male and 39.3% were White, with an average age of 60.7 ± 14.7 years. Acute type A AD constituted 47.1% of the cohort, with 91.4% undergoing open repair within one week of presentation. Of the patients with acute type B AD (52.9% of the cohort), 41.7% underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair during the index admission. At the one-year follow-up interval (± 3 months), 26.5% were confirmed to have undergone aortic surveillance imaging, and 27.6% had an appointment with a cardiovascular specialist. Only 9.6% of the cohort was fully compliant with the recommended surveillance imaging in the first year of follow-up.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^113h2NTr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm are recommended to undergo routine imaging surveillance. Although maximal diameter is the primary metric of disease severity, recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of aortic growth in determining surgical candidacy and risk. As diameter increases, it is assumed that aortic growth rate accelerates because of increased wall tension; however, this relationship is poorly studied. We aim to investigate the relationship between ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm diameter and growth rate using vascular deformation mapping, a validated technique for 3-dimensional growth mapping with submillimeter accuracy.

- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified adult patients with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 4.0 cm) and serial gated computed tomography angiograms separated by ≥ 2 years, excluding confirmed heritable thoracic aortic disease. Ascending growth rate was defined as the 90th percentile radial wall deformation by vascular deformation mapping. Maximal diameter measurements were derived from the baseline computed tomography angiogram, and aortic length and body size–adjusted indexes were calculated. Among 258 included patients (63.2% men; age of 63 years [interquartile range, 55–69 years]), mean ± SD baseline diameter was 46.3 ± 3.6 mm, and median growth rate was 0.21 mm/year (interquartile range, 0.13–0.38 mm/year). No correlation was noted between growth rate and baseline diameter (r = 0.02, P = 0.74) or other aortic size metrics. On multivariate analysis, age was identified as a factor.

### Development and validation of a predictive model to identify patients with an ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm [^115zLAd1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The definition of ATAA focuses on the outcome of interest, defined as an ascending thoracic aorta with a diameter of ≥ 4.0 cm. This measurement was obtained using the double oblique technique, where a plane perpendicular to the aorta's long axis was defined in 3D space. The aorta was measured via the average of outer-to-outer wall diameters, measured at 60° intervals. This 4.0 cm threshold was chosen to improve sensitivity in detecting an enlarged aorta for screening, noting that aneurysm definitions vary among studies. Measurements were taken of the aorta segment between the sinotubular junction and the proximal take-off of the innominate artery.

Aortic diameter was not indexed by body size because guidelines for surgical intervention are based on unindexed diameters. Given that scans may include both cardiac-gated and nongated types, only aneurysms in the ascending aorta were considered since the aortic root measurement can be affected by motion artifacts during the cardiac cycle. Measurements were conducted using Visage imaging software by an author trained in cardiac and thoracic imaging. These measurements were compared to those of a radiologist, showing a mean difference of 0.3 mm.

### Final follow-up of the multicentre aneurysm screening study (MASS) randomized trial of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening [^113KN3GZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

To reduce late ruptures in the future, two policies are possible. The first would be to rescreen all men with a normal aortic diameter, for example after 10 years, but this would be costly. The second would be to include those with an aortic diameter in the range of 2.5–2.9 cm in the surveillance program. It would be sufficient to recall these men only after, for example, 5 years in the first instance because the chance of developing an AAA larger than 5.5 cm or having an AAA rupture before that time is very small. Hence, the additional cost to the surveillance program would be modest.

Being based on a population-based sample of UK men, the results from MASS should, in principle, correspond with the expected benefit that will derive from the NHS AAA Screening Programme (NAAASP). However, the prevalence of AAA (diameter at least 3.0 cm) is about 1.7 percent in NAAASP, compared with 4.9 percent in MASS, and the number of ruptured AAAs is currently falling in the UK and elsewhere. The reasons for the lower prevalence are not fully understood but may partly be because NAAASP is targeting a younger age (men aged 65 years, rather than 65–74 years as in MASS). In some NAAASP centers, the ethnic mix is different, and the uptake is lower than in MASS. In addition, there has been a reduction in smoking prevalence and a general reduction in cardiovascular and atherosclerotic diseases over the intervening 15 years, together with an increased use of some drugs (especially statins) and of elective surgery for those aged over 75 years.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^112mvbPp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Our study has some important limitations. First, as a major surgical referral center, there were few patients in our imaging surveillance cohort with a baseline ascending aortic diameter > 55 mm (n = 3, 1.2%) and none > 60 mm, as appreciated in Figure 3. Thus, this study cannot evaluate the diameter‐growth rate relationship above surgical threshold sizes.

Second, although our exclusion of patients with HTAD limits our population to BAV‐associated or sporadic aTAA, these subgroups make up the vast majority of patients with aTAA under surveillance at most centers. Third, as a retrospective study, certain patient characteristics are challenging to accurately determine, such as a comprehensive family history and blood pressure control. However, we feel our detailed collection and analysis of blood pressure readings, with most patients having readings on the same day as their scans, serves as a suitable surrogate.

Additionally, the advantage of our retrospective study design is the availability of longer follow‐up periods to more clearly define slow aortic growth, which is commonly observed in aTAA. Fourth, we analyzed the longest available CTA interval to maximize the magnitude of detectable growth. This means that our measured growth rates represent growth over the entire available interval. Growth in aTAA may, in fact, be variable over time, a phenomenon that we did not assess in this study but will investigate in future studies.

Fifth, the VDM technique can be sensitive to image distortions related to motion or streak artifact, although these issues also affect the findings.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^112Uwooi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Beyond variability in aortic wall biology, our understanding of the relationship between aTAA growth and diameter is limited by practical challenges in accurately measuring growth through medical imaging. Specifically, diameter measurements have poor reproducibility, with interrater and intrarater variability of ± 2 to 5 mm despite best practices, confounding the detection of aTAA growth at typical rates of 0.2–0.4 mm/year. Furthermore, diameter measurements are one-dimensional and performed at fixed locations, potentially missing heterogeneous or eccentric aneurysm growth.

To address the difficulties in accurately assessing aTAA growth, computerized analysis techniques have been recently developed to fully exploit the high‐resolution and volumetric nature of modern CT angiography (CTA) imaging. One such technique, termed vascular deformation mapping (VDM), utilizes deformable image registration to yield comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) maps of aortic growth across the entire thoracic aorta. The VDM technique has been shown in validation studies to have excellent reproducibility, a measurement error of ≤ 1 mm, and to outperform expert manual raters in head‐to‐head comparisons. Furthermore, given its 3D nature, VDM analysis is not susceptible to variability related to measurement plane or location and provides a more comprehensive assessment of growth than is possible with diameter measurements.

The objective of this study was to apply VDM analysis to more precisely examine the relationship between 3D aortic growth and aortic size metrics, including maximal aortic diameter.

### Impact of nondiameter aortic indices on surgical eligibility: Results from the Treatment in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Surgery Versus Surveillance (TITAN: SVS) randomized controlled trial [^116W2twG]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The traditional criterion for intervention on an asymptomatic ascending aortic aneurysm has been a maximal aortic diameter of 5.5 cm or more. The 2022 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association aortic guidelines adopted cross-sectional aortic area/height ratio, aortic size index, and aortic height index as alternate parameters for surgical intervention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of using these newer indices on patient eligibility for surgical intervention in a prospective, multicenter cohort with moderate-sized ascending aortic aneurysms between 5.0 and 5.4 cm.

Patients were enrolled from 2018 to 2023 in the randomization or registry arms of the multicenter trial, Treatment In Thoracic Aortic aNeurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance. Clinical data were captured prospectively in an online database, and imaging data were derived from a core computed laboratory.

Among the 329 included patients, 20% were female. The mean age was 65.0 ± 11.6 years, and the mean maximal aortic diameter was 50.8 ± 3.9 mm. In the one-third of all patients (n = 109) who met any one of the three criteria (i.e. aortic size index ≥ 3.08 cm/m², aortic height index ≥ 3.21 cm/m, or cross-sectional aortic area/height ≥ 10 cm²/m), their mean maximal aortic diameter was 52.5 ± 0.52 mm. Alternate criteria were most commonly met in women compared with men: 20% versus 2% for aortic size index (P < .001), 39% versus 5% for aortic height index (P < .001), and 39% versus 21% for cross-sectional aortic area/height (P = .002), respectively.

### Baseline diameter does not predict growth rate in a presurgical ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm population [^112cNPD4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Patients with ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm are recommended to undergo routine imaging surveillance. Although maximal diameter is the primary metric of disease severity, recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines emphasize the importance of aortic growth in determining surgical candidacy and risk. As the diameter increases, it is assumed that aortic growth rate accelerates because of increased wall tension; however, this relationship is poorly studied. We aim to investigate the relationship between ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm diameter and growth rate using vascular deformation mapping, a validated technique for three-dimensional growth mapping with submillimeter accuracy.

- **Methods and results**: We retrospectively identified adult patients with ascending aortic dilation (≥ 4.0 cm) and serial gated computed tomography angiograms separated by ≥ 2 years, excluding confirmed heritable thoracic aortic disease. Ascending growth rate was defined as the 90th percentile radial wall deformation by vascular deformation mapping. Maximal diameter measurements were derived from the baseline computed tomography angiogram, and aortic length and body size-adjusted indexes were calculated. Among 258 included patients (63.2% men; age of 63 years [interquartile range, 55–69 years]), the mean ± SD baseline diameter was 46.3 ± 3.6 mm, and the median growth rate was 0.21 mm/year (interquartile range, 0.13–0.38 mm/year). No correlation was noted between growth rate and baseline diameter (r = 0.02, P = 0.74) or other aortic size metrics. On multivariate analysis, age was independently associated with growth rate.

### Surveillance of moderate-size aneurysms of the thoracic aorta [^116Rok1g]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Thoracic aortic aneurysms account for almost 50,000 deaths annually in the United States, with death often due to rupture or dissection, which is strongly linked to the size of the aneurysm. Recent guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with thoracic aortic disease represent the efforts of multiple professional societies (ACCF/AHA/AATS/ACR/ASA/SCA/SCAI/SIR/STS/SVM) to develop evidence-based recommendations aimed at improving patient outcomes. These guidelines were prepared following a rigorous and careful review of the evidence by multiple experts in the field, representing cardiologists, radiologists, vascular surgeons, and cardiothoracic/aortic surgeons.

Guidelines recommend surgical intervention for ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms at a size of 5 cm for patients with a genetic predisposition to rupture or dissection, such as the connective tissue disorder Marfan's syndrome, or 5.5 cm for non-Marfan patients. Similarly, the recommendations suggest surgical intervention when a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm reaches 5.5 cm for a Marfan patient or 6 cm for a non-Marfan patient. These recommendations are based on data showing increased mortality for these patients, where the risk of rupture-related complications exceeds the risk of surgery-related complications. Thus, surgery is recommended as the safer strategy for this high-risk patient subgroup. For moderate-size thoracic aortic aneurysms (defined as ≤ 4.9 cm), however, the committee concluded that the evidence is severely lacking to establish…

### Potential benefits and harms of offering ultrasound surveillance to men aged 65 years and older with a subaneurysmal (2.5–2.9 cm) infrarenal aorta [^113ePF9p]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this review was to perform a rapid evidence summary to determine the prevalence of subaneurysmal aortic aneurysms, growth rates, and risk factors that modulate growth in average-risk men aged 65 years and older. Secondary objectives were to evaluate benefits and harms of lifelong ultrasound (US) surveillance and treatment outcomes for any large aneurysms that develop in the screened population.

- **Methods**: We searched multiple databases (e.g. Ovid MEDLINE, Embase Classic and Embase, and the Cochrane Library) on February 16, 2016. Using a liberal accelerated method, two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and subsequently screened full-text studies. General study characteristics (e.g. country, study design, number of participants) and data (e.g. number of men with subaneurysmal aortas, quality of life [QoL], mortality) were extracted. One reviewer performed data extraction and risk of bias assessments, and a second reviewer verified 100% of studies. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus.

- **Results**: The search identified 37 relevant studies ranging in size from 3 to 52,690 participants. Prevalence of subaneurysmal aortas ranged from 1.14% to 8.53%, and 55% to 88% of these men progressed to a 3.0-cm aneurysm by 5 years of follow-up. Risk factors for growth included the infrarenal aortic diameter at age 65 years, having a subaneurysmal aorta at age 65 years, and smoking. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey was the most commonly used tool to measure QoL, and QoL was typically lower in people with abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Guidelines for treating ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (ATAA) are largely based on single-center studies. To understand factors influencing patient selection for surgery vs surveillance, patient and aneurysm characteristics were compared for patients in the randomized and registry arms of a large prospective, multicenter, multinational trial.

- **Methods**: TITAN:SvS (Treatment in Thoracic Aortic aNeurysm: Surgery versus Surveillance) is a large, prospective, multicenter study of patients with ATAA between 5.0 and 5.4 cm, randomizing patients 1:1 to initial surgery vs surveillance. Nonrandomized patients are enrolled in a registry where results of the operative or surveillance strategy can be monitored prospectively. Between 2018 and 2023, 615 patients were enrolled at 22 sites in the United States and Canada. Demographic and aneurysm characteristics were compared between randomized and registry arms.

- **Results**: Compared with randomized and operative registry groups, patients in the surveillance registry were older with more comorbidities. No significant differences were observed in maximal ascending aortic diameter (5.1 cm [interquartile range, 5.0–5.2 cm] vs 5.1 cm [interquartile range, 4.9–5.2 cm], P = .2) or other aneurysm characteristics. Despite similar numbers of enrolling centers in the United States (n = 11) and Canada (n = 12), Canadian patients were more likely to be randomized (58% vs 7%, P < .01) and less likely to be enrolled in the operative (9% vs 42%, P < .01) or surveillance registry (34% vs 51%).

### Early impact of aortic wrapping on patients undergoing aortic valve replacement with mild to moderate ascending aorta dilatation [^111DEftn]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The management of mild to moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta, less than 5 cm, is controversial, particularly when concomitant surgical correction of the aortic valve is required. We investigate the impact of a simple method of aorta reduction using Dacron graft wrapping during aortic valve replacement on the rest of the aorta.

- **Methods**: We studied 14 patients who had ascending aorta dilatation of 4–5 cm before undergoing aortic wrapping during their aortic valve replacement and compared their post-operative imaging within a month.

- **Results**: The diameters of the ascending aorta wrapped with the Dacron graft were significantly reduced within 4 weeks after surgery from 44.7 ± 2.6 to 33.6 ± 3.9 mm (p < 0.001). This was associated with a significant reduction in the diameter of the rest of the ascending aorta: coronary sinuses (from 37.9 ± 4.9 mm to 33.3 ± 6.1 mm; p < 0.001), sinotubular junction (from 33.2 ± 4.7 mm to 30.6 ± 4.4 mm; p = 0.02), and aortic arch (from 34.7 ± 4.3 mm to 32.6 ± 4.1 mm; p = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: Reduction of ascending aortic dilatation by wrapping with a Dacron graft in this preliminary study is associated with favorable early reversed aortic remodeling. This supports the hypothesis that correction of mild to moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta with Dacron wrapping at the time of aortic valve surgery may prevent the progression of the dilatation, although a long-term study on a larger population is needed to confirm its benefits.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm or dissection: Treatment planning and follow-up [^111e41D2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

As the incidence of thoracoabdominal aortic pathology, such as aneurysm and dissection, rises and the complexity of endovascular and surgical treatment options increases, imaging follow-up of patients remains crucial. Patients with thoracoabdominal aortic pathology without intervention should be monitored carefully for changes in aortic size or morphology that could indicate rupture or other complications.

- **Follow-up imaging**: Patients who are post-endovascular or have undergone open surgical aortic repair should undergo follow-up imaging to evaluate for complications, endoleak, or re-pathology. Considering the quality of diagnostic data, CT angiography and MR angiography are the preferred imaging modalities for follow-up of thoracoabdominal aortic pathology for most patients.

- **Imaging requirements**: The extent of thoracoabdominal aortic pathology and its potential complications involve multiple regions of the body, requiring imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in most patients.

- **Evidence-based guidelines**: The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence.

The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Computed tomography follow-up after elective proximal aortic surgery: Less is more [^113Yi54b]. American Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The study objective was to evaluate the added value of computed tomography (CT) follow-up after elective proximal aortic surgery by assessing the incidence of aorta-related complications and reinterventions detected during routine CT follow-up.

- **Methods**: Data on 314 patients undergoing their first-time elective proximal aortic surgery between 2000 and 2015 were collected. The primary study endpoints were aorta-related complications and reinterventions detected during routine CT follow-up. Secondary study endpoints included all aorta-related complications and reinterventions, irrespective of the mode of detection, and survival.

- **Results**: The median CT follow-up time was 6.8 years (IQR 4.1–9.8), during which a total of 1303 routine follow-up CT scans (median 4, IQR 3–5) were performed. During CT follow-up, aorta-related complications were detected in 18 (5.7%) patients, of which 6 (1.6%) underwent reintervention. In total, 28 aorta-related complications were observed in 23 (7.3%) patients, of which 9 led to reintervention. To detect one aorta-related complication leading to reintervention, 218 routine follow-up CT scans were required. The unadjusted and EuroSCORE II adjusted hazard ratios of not undergoing CT follow-up on mortality were 1.260 (95% CI 0.705–2.251) and 0.830 (95% CI 0.430–1.605), respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Following first-time elective proximal aortic surgery, aorta-related complications are uncommon, are not always detected during CT follow-up, and, if detected, often do not result in reintervention. Therefore, a more conservative approach to routine CT follow-up could be considered.

### Natural history of the proximal aorta in patients with descending thoracic aortic disease [^114pUPW9]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This study investigated the growth and behavior of the ascending aorta in patients with descending thoracic aortic disease. We examined 200 patients with descending thoracic aortic disease including acute type B dissection (n = 95), chronic type B dissection (n = 38), intramural hematoma (n = 23), and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (n = 44). Images from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were evaluated after three-dimensional reconstruction to examine the growth rate in those with more than one year of imaging follow-up (n = 108). Survival data were derived from all 200 patients in this study.

Average proximal aortic dimensions at the index image were relatively small, measuring 3.65 ± 0.51 cm in the root, 3.67 ± 0.48 cm in the ascending aorta, and 3.50 ± 0.44 cm in the proximal arch. The average growth rate was low for the aortic root, ascending aorta, and proximal arch at 0.36 ± 0.64 mm/y, 0.26 ± 0.44 mm/y, and 0.25 ± 0.44 mm/y, respectively. There was no difference in baseline proximal aortic dimensions and growth rate between the four subgroups. An index aortic diameter of 4.1 cm or greater grew faster than those less than 4.1 cm at the ascending aorta (P = .028) and proximal arch (P = .019). There was no difference in aortic growth rates at the aortic root (P = .887). After the index scan, five patients underwent six ascending aortic replacement procedures, leading to a 3% ascending aortic intervention rate. Overall median life expectancy was 86.15 years.

### Dilatation of the remaining aorta after aortic valve or aortic root replacement in patients with bicuspid aortic valve: A 5-year follow-up [^1141u3cW]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The natural history and management of ascending aorta (AA) and arch dilatation in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) after aortic valve replacement (AVR) or aortic root replacement (ARR) remain controversial. Our aim is to identify dilatation of the remaining aorta after AVR or ARR in patients with BAV compared with patients with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV).

- **Methods**: Three hundred ninety-five patients who underwent AVR or ARR between 2002 and 2009 were studied. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) and echocardiography were performed in 192 patients with BAV, and the results were compared with those of 203 patients with TAV. An AA diameter of 4.5 cm or greater was regarded as aneurysmal. Postoperative echocardiograms, computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance images were compared with subsequent imaging at a median follow-up of 4.6 years (2.2–9.8 years).

- **Results**: Median ages of patients with BAV and patients with TAV were 57 ± 14 and 65 ± 16 years, respectively (p < 0.05). The preoperative diameter of AA in the BAV group with no aneurysm (3.5 cm; range, 3.0–4.0 cm; n = 143) was significantly higher than in the TAV group (3.3 cm; range, 3.1–3.8 cm; n = 129) (p < 0.001). In both BAV and TAV groups with nonaneurysmal aortas who underwent AVR, there was no significant expansion of the AA and arch at 5 years' follow-up. In patients with aneurysmal aorta (BAV group, n = 49; TAV group, n = 74) who underwent ARR, there was also no significant difference in the growth of the remaining aorta at 3 and 5 years' follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: No significant dilatation of the remaining aorta was observed in patients with BAV or TAV following the procedures.

### Discrepancies in measurement of the thoracic aorta: JACC review topic of the week [^111ZeqXm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Clinicians often encounter discrepant measurements of the ascending aorta that can impede, complicate, and impair appropriate clinical assessment, including key issues of the presence or absence of aortic growth, the rate of growth, and the need for surgical intervention. These discrepancies may arise within a single modality (computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or echocardiography) or between modalities.

The authors explore the origins and significance of these discrepancies, revealing that some "truth" usually underlies all the discrepant measurements, which individually examine the ascending aorta from different perspectives and dimensional definitions.

The authors conclude with a practical "question and answer" section that addresses common specific issues in the interpretation and management of patients in real-world settings.

### Early impact of aortic wrapping on patients undergoing aortic valve replacement with mild to moderate ascending aorta dilatation [^112p5Hbp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The management of mild to moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta of less than 5 cm is controversial, particularly when concomitant surgical correction of the aortic valve is required. We investigate the impact of a simple method of aorta reduction using Dacron graft wrapping during aortic valve replacement on the rest of the aorta.

- **Methods**: We studied 14 patients who had ascending aorta dilatation of 4–5 cm before undergoing aortic wrapping during their aortic valve replacement and compared them with their post-operative imaging within a month.

- **Results**: The diameters of the ascending aorta wrapped with the Dacron graft were significantly reduced within 4 weeks after surgery, from 44.7 ± 2.6 mm to 33.6 ± 3.9 mm (p < 0.001). This was associated with a significant reduction in the diameter of the rest of the ascending aorta: coronary sinuses reduced from 37.9 ± 4.9 mm to 33.3 ± 6.1 mm (p < 0.001), the sinotubular junction from 33.2 ± 4.7 mm to 30.6 ± 4.4 mm (p = 0.02), and the aortic arch from 34.7 ± 4.3 mm to 32.6 ± 4.1 mm (p = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: Reduction of ascending aortic dilatation by wrapping with a Dacron graft in this preliminary study is associated with favorable early reversed aortic remodeling. This supports the hypothesis that correction of mild to moderate dilatation of the ascending aorta with Dacron wrapping at the time of aortic valve surgery may prevent the progression of the dilatation. However, a long-term study on a larger population is needed to confirm its benefits.

### Risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm after ectatic aorta detection from initial screening [^115FVKkA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine ectatic aorta prevalence, AAA development, rupture risk, and risk factor profile in patients with detected ectatic aortas in a AAA screening program.

A retrospective chart review of all patients screened for AAA from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016, within a regional health care system was conducted. Screening criteria were men 65 to 75 years of age who smoked a minimum of 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. An ectatic aorta was defined as a maximum aortic diameter from 2.5 to 2.9 cm, while an AAA was defined as an aortic diameter of 3 cm or greater.

- **Study design**: Patients screened with ectatic aortas who had subsequent follow-up imaging of the aorta with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were analyzed for associated clinical and cardiovascular risk factors. All data were collected through December 3, 2018.

- **Statistical analysis**: A logistic regression of statistically significant variables from univariate and χ² analyses was performed to identify risks associated with the development of AAA from an initially diagnosed ectatic aorta. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess survival data. A P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.

### Screening and surveillance for abdominal aortic aneurysms: who needs it and when [^11783CRq]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Early detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms can potentially save many lives by preventing aneurysm rupture. Screening programs, however, have yet to be proven as an efficient means of accomplishing this goal and improving overall life expectancy. Until more information is available, selective high-risk screening may be the only viable option. Recently, two large prospective studies have better defined the utility of screening programs and have provided guidelines for the safe nonoperative management of small aneurysms. Using ultrasound surveillance, these can be followed up at 3- to 12-month intervals, depending on their size, with operative intervention reserved for aneurysms that enlarge rapidly, become symptomatic, or reach 5.5 cm in diameter.

### Post-stenotic aortic dilatation [^116ZKjAm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Replacement of the ascending aorta at the time of AVR is controversial because the risk of progressive dilatation following AVR is uncertain (Table 5). Andrus et al. set out to determine the natural history of ascending aorta dilatation following AVR. They studied 185 patients undergoing AVR, measuring the ascending aortic diameter 2 cm above the sinotubular ridge, using transthoracic echocardiography before surgery and during the follow-up period. Progressive aortic dilatation was defined as an increase in diameter of > 0.3 cm from the preoperative measurement. This was observed in only 15% of the study population. No patients with baseline aortic dilatation (3.5–5.3 cm) dilated > 5.5 cm during the follow-up period (n = 107, mean 33.6 months). They found no clinical or valvular characteristics that predicted progressive aortic dilatation. Their conclusion was therefore against routine replacement of the ascending aorta at the time of AVR.

Another clinical study by Matsuyama et al. looked at the incidence of aortic complications in 35 patients following AVR, with a preoperative dilated ascending aorta ≥ 4.0 cm, assessed by computed tomography or operative findings. The baseline aortic diameter in the study population ranged from 4.0–5.5 cm. The mean follow-up period was 8.1 ± 3.5 years (range: 2.3–13 years). Aortic events occurred in 5 patients.

Regarding the specific circumstances for thoracic aortic aneurysm, particularly in patients with Marfan syndrome, diagnostic imaging is crucial. The ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) at the time of initial diagnosis to determine the diameters of the aortic root and ascending aorta. Repeat this imaging 6 months thereafter to assess the rate of aortic growth in patients with Marfan syndrome. If the aortic diameters are stable, obtain an annual surveillance TTE. Additionally, obtain a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic aorta if the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both, are not adequately visualized on TTE.

### The nonsyndromic ascending thoracic aorta in a population-based setting: A 5-year prospective cohort study [^113HFwB2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Prospective data on the clinical course of the ascending thoracic aorta are lacking.

- **Objectives**: This study sought to estimate growth rates of the ascending aorta and to evaluate occurrences of adverse aortic events (AAEs), such as thoracic aortic ruptures, type A aortic dissections, and thoracic aortic-related deaths.

- **Methods**: In this prospective cohort study from the population-based, multicenter, randomized DANCAVAS (Danish Cardiovascular Screening trials) I and II, participants underwent cardiovascular risk assessments, including electrocardiogram-gated, noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scans. The clinical database was supplemented with outcome data from Danish health care registries. Exclusion criteria included connective tissue disorders, bicuspid aortic valves, and survivors of a prior AAE. To estimate growth rates, participants with consecutive CT scans were followed from inclusion to the last scan. To evaluate AAEs, the entire cohort was followed from inclusion to AAE; elective ascending aortic surgery; death; or December 31, 2021.

- **Results**: In 2,026 individuals (77.3% men; mean age: 69.2 ± 3.1 years; median follow-up: 4.5 years [Q1-Q3: 3.4–4.7 years]), 4,897 CT scans were obtained. The cohort included 1,374 individuals with baseline ascending aortas of < 40.0 mm (68.3% men), 388 with baseline ascending aortas between 40.0 and 44.9 mm (94.5% men), 188 with baseline ascending aortas between 45.0 and 49.9 mm (98.4% men), and 76 men with baseline ascending aortas of ≥ 50 mm. The mean ascending aortic growth rates in men and women were 0.07 ± 0.5 mm/year and 0.13 ± 0.3 mm/year, respectively.

### Advances in imaging and surveillance of AAA: when, how, how often [^111ztJpU]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Despite rapid technological developments for imaging the aorta, ultrasonography remains the preferred method for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening and surveillance. Randomized trials conducted in the 20th century have provided convincing evidence in favor of screening men at age 65 years or older. However, in the 21st century, the prevalence of aneurysms in 65-year-old men has fallen by more than half, likely due to lower smoking prevalence and improved cardiovascular risk prevention. Thus, screening or rescreening at an older age may be beneficial.

A recent meta-analysis has provided substantial evidence for determining surveillance intervals: the majority of patients with screen-detected aneurysms (up to 4.5 cm in diameter) can be safely managed with 3-year surveillance intervals. Even for larger aneurysms, annual surveillance intervals are considered acceptable. This would reduce the number of surveillance visits by approximately half.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Marfan syndrome, specifically concerning aortic imaging, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining a TTE at the time of initial diagnosis to determine the diameters of the aortic root and ascending aorta. A follow-up TTE should be conducted 6 months later to assess the rate of aortic growth in patients with Marfan Syndrome. If the aortic diameters are stable, an annual surveillance TTE is advised. A CT or MRI of the thoracic aorta should be obtained if the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both, are not adequately visualized on TTE.

### Should the ascending aorta be replaced more frequently in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease [^111nkBzd]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The optimal diameter at which replacement of the ascending aorta should be performed in patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease is not known. We reviewed all patients with bicuspid aortic valves undergoing aortic valve replacement at our institution from 1979 through 1993 (n = 201). Patients undergoing concomitant replacement of the ascending aorta were excluded.

Follow-up was obtained on 98% of patients and lasted 10.3 ± 3.8 years. The average patient age was 56 ± 15 years, and 76% were male. The ascending aorta was normal (5.0 cm) in those who underwent replacement of the ascending aorta, leading to their exclusion. Fifteen-year survival was 67%. During follow-up, 44 patients required reoperation, predominantly for aortic valve prosthesis failure. Twenty-two patients had long-term complications related to the ascending aorta: 18 required an operative procedure to replace the ascending aorta (for aortic aneurysm), 1 had aortic dissection, and 3 experienced sudden cardiac death. Fifteen-year freedom from ascending aorta-related complications was 86%, 81%, and 43% in patients with an aortic diameter of less than 4.0 cm, 4.0 to 4.4 cm, and 4.5 to 4.9 cm, respectively (P < .001).

Patients undergoing operations for bicuspid aortic valve disease should be considered for concomitant replacement of the ascending aorta if the diameter is beyond certain thresholds during surgical assessments.

### Challenges in prompt identification and surgical correction of Marfan syndrome aortic disease in a middle-income country: a case series study [^116mNPj9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The guidelines emphasize monitoring the aortic root and ascending aorta in patients with MFS. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations, elective repair is advised when the diameter reaches 5.0 cm (Class 1, Level C-LD). Nevertheless, key risk factors for aortic complications have been identified. These factors include a family history of aortic dissection, rapid aortic growth (≥ 0.3 cm/year), diffuse dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, and marked vertebral arterial tortuosity. The guidelines suggest elective aortic root surgery after reaching 4.5 cm when these risk factors are present (Class 2, Level B-NR).

Additionally, dilation of other anatomical locations of the aorta is more likely to occur after aortic root replacement or previous dissection. For aneurysms in other aortic segments (arch, descending, or abdominal), operative intervention is considered reasonable when the aortic diameter reaches ≥ 5.0 cm for patients at acceptable operative risk or with a long life expectancy (Level 2a, Class C-EO).

However, optimal surgical timing and surgical outcomes are a concern. These guideline recommendations are based on observational studies and experts' opinions with mainly short-term and mid-term results. Moreover, the literature on the adequate treatment of MFS aortic disease in Latin America is even scarcer and limited.

Therefore, we aim to describe population characteristics, long-term survival, and re-intervention patterns in patients who underwent aortic surgery with a previously confirmed clinical diagnosis of MFS.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection-treatment planning and follow-up: 2024 update [^1129zuZi]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Diseases of the thoracic aorta include two broad categories: aneurysmal dilation involving all three layers of the intact aortic wall, and acute aortic syndromes, wherein at least one layer of the aortic wall is disrupted, such as in aortic dissection. These diseases carry a variable risk of subsequent aortic rupture, which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Imaging is critical in the diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment of this constellation of diseases. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Growth rate of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms in a non-referral-based population [^113t7ZqW]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). High credibility.

We queried 21,325 CT scans performed at our institution between 2013 and 2016 on patients aged 50–85 for a radiologic diagnosis of aortic aneurysm or dilatation. A total of 560 patients were identified to have aortic dilatation greater than 4 cm, of which 207 had follow-up scan intervals greater than 6 months. This comprised our non-referral-based study population.

The double oblique technique was used to measure the maximum transverse diameter of the ascending aorta, from outer-to-outer edge (Visage 7, Visage Imaging, Inc, San Diego, CA). Final measurements were calculated as an average of three diameters measured 60 degrees apart from each other. The linearized annual growth rate was calculated by dividing the change in aortic size by the time interval between CT scans.

- **Double oblique measurement of the ascending thoracic aorta**: The figure shows the measurement of the ascending aorta using the double oblique technique. The maximum transverse diameter was measured on multiplanar reconstruction images in planes perpendicular to the aortic wall, from outer-to-outer edge. Final measurements were calculated as an average of three diameters measured 60 degrees apart from each other.

Patient characteristics were compared between those with faster and slower growth rates using the Wilcoxon ranked sum test for continuous variables and chi-squared tests for categorical variables. Faster growth rates were defined as those in the top 25 percentile of growth rates in our study cohort. Continuous variables were summarized with median and interquartile range (IQR), with statistical significance defined as p.

The "2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Aortic Disease" provides recommendations to guide clinicians in the diagnosis, genetic evaluation, family screening, medical therapy, endovascular and surgical treatment, and long-term surveillance of patients with aortic disease across its multiple clinical presentation subsets (i.e. asymptomatic, stable symptomatic, and acute aortic syndromes).

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from January 2021 to April 2021, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHL Complete, and other selected databases relevant to this guideline. Additional relevant studies, published through June 2022 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee where appropriate.

Recommendations from previously published AHA/ACC guidelines on thoracic aortic disease, peripheral artery disease, and bicuspid aortic valve disease have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. New recommendations addressing comprehensive care for patients with aortic disease have also been developed. There is added emphasis on the role of shared decision-making, especially in the management of patients with aortic disease both before and during pregnancy. There is also an increased emphasis on the importance of institutional interventional volume and multidisciplinary aortic team expertise in the care of patients with aortic disease.

### 2022 ACC/AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: A report of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116UwJua]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for bicuspid aortic valve, the ACC/AHA 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining lifelong surveillance imaging of the aortic root and ascending aorta by TTE, CT, or MRI. The interval for this imaging depends on the aortic diameter and rate of growth in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and a diameter of the aortic root, ascending aorta, or both, of ≥ 40 mm, including patients who have undergone previous aortic valve repair or replacement.
