## Question

Preoperative cognitive training for CABG patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether preoperative cognitive training reduces postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and how to interpret the evidence for clinical decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem and baseline risk. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized trial evidence. Next, I will appraise study design, outcomes, and limitations. After that, I should integrate mechanistic plausibility and corroborating data. Finally, I will translate this into practical, cautious clinical recommendations and highlight uncertainties that warrant future research.

> Let me first confirm the clinical stakes. Postoperative delirium and cognitive dysfunction are common after CABG, with delirium in roughly a quarter of patients in the first week and persistent cognitive decline in a substantial minority at 6 to 12 months, which is associated with longer length of stay, higher costs, and worse functional recovery, so any modifiable preoperative intervention that reduces these outcomes would be clinically meaningful [^5d15ff5a] [^9e7650e4] [^0d4fa360].

> I will now examine the pivotal randomized trial. The CT-LIFE study, a multicenter, single-blind RCT of 208 CABG patients, found that preoperative cognitive training reduced delirium from 43.4% to 27.5% (absolute risk reduction 15.9%; adjusted odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.23–0.77; P = 0.007), with fewer severe delirium episodes and fewer delirium-positive days, while 30-day mortality did not differ, which is a promising signal for efficacy on a hard clinical endpoint [^dd282c6b] [^f173fad0].

> Wait, let me verify the intervention and delivery context. The training was a mobile-app–based program targeting memory, attention, processing speed, reasoning, and reaction time, initiated during preoperative hospitalization with a median of about 10 days of use; patients completed a median of roughly 10 hours of training, and adherence was monitored, which matters because dose and supervision likely influence effect size and generalizability to outpatient settings [^dd282c6b] [^42902d39].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check limitations that temper certainty. The primary analysis included fewer than 75 events, making results fragile to small changes. The trial was single-blind with potential social interaction effects from unblinded staff. Most patients underwent off-pump CABG, limiting extrapolation to on-pump populations. And the mechanism remains uncertain, so replication and mechanistic studies are needed before routine adoption [^42902d39] [^4399f8fe].

> Next, I should review corroborating evidence. A randomized trial in older adults undergoing major noncardiac surgery (the Neurobics trial) showed that at least 10 hours of tablet-based cognitive exercise reduced delirium from 23% to 12.5%, supporting the concept that preoperative cognitive prehabilitation can modify delirium risk across surgical domains, albeit with different baseline risks and protocols than CABG [^3fe55a46]. Let me also consider mechanistic plausibility: higher preoperative cognitive performance and education are protective against post-CABG delirium, suggesting that augmenting cognitive reserve preoperatively may mitigate vulnerability to perioperative neurocognitive insults [^d70a59c4].

> But wait, what if the observed benefit reflects expectancy or attention rather than true cognitive change? I should double-check that possibility. The authors acknowledge unblinding and social interaction as potential confounders, and they did not demonstrate improvements on comprehensive postoperative cognitive batteries, so the causal pathway remains hypothesis-generating rather than proven, which reinforces the need for larger, double-blind trials with mechanistic endpoints and broader neuropsychological testing [^4399f8fe] [^42902d39].

> I need to ensure we distinguish delirium from longer-term cognitive dysfunction. CT-LIFE showed reduced delirium without clear changes in 30-day cognitive outcomes, and meta-analytic data suggest that while delirium strongly predicts short-term cognitive decline, the relationship with durable POCD is complex and heterogeneous, so reducing delirium may not necessarily translate into proportional reductions in 6- to 12-month POCD without additional strategies [^ed5d6617] [^5d15ff5a].

> Let me consider implementation practicality. In systems where patients are admitted 7–10 days preoperatively, in-hospital cognitive training is feasible; in ambulatory pathways, remote, supervised training with adherence monitoring is plausible but untested for CABG, and adherence in perioperative windows can be modest outside controlled settings, so program design and accountability will be critical if adopted [^42902d39] [^75a70aeb].

> I should confirm safety and acceptability. No excess adverse events were reported with the cognitive training, and participants generally found the tablet-based program acceptable, which supports feasibility, though larger pragmatic trials should formally evaluate usability, adherence, and scalability across diverse populations and health systems [^dd282c6b] [^75a70aeb].

> Putting this together, I would say the evidence is promising but preliminary. Preoperative cognitive training appears to reduce postoperative delirium by a clinically meaningful absolute margin in a single, adequately powered but fragile RCT of CABG patients, with supportive but indirect evidence from noncardiac surgery and mechanistic plausibility from observational data on cognitive reserve, so a cautious, selective approach is reasonable while we await replication and clarification of dosing, timing, and mechanisms [^dd282c6b] [^3fe55a46] [^d70a59c4].

> Clinically, I would discuss cognitive training as an optional, low-risk adjunct for motivated patients with adequate preoperative time, especially those at higher delirium risk (older age, preexisting cognitive impairment, depression, low education), emphasizing that benefits are likely modest and that standard delirium prevention bundles remain essential. I would not replace established perioperative delirium protocols with cognitive training alone, and I would document shared decision-making given the uncertainty and the need for adherence to realize benefit [^d70a59c4] [^5bb3e9c7].

> For research and policy, I should confirm the next steps. Larger, multicenter, double-blind RCTs with standardized delirium and POCD batteries, head-to-head dosing strategies, on- versus off-pump subgroup analyses, and biomarker or neuroimaging correlates are needed. Meanwhile, pragmatic pilots can test remote delivery, adherence support, and integration with prehabilitation pathways to define real-world effectiveness and cost-effectiveness before routine implementation [^42902d39] [^5d520af5].

Preoperative cognitive training reduces **postoperative delirium** [^dd282c6b] in CABG patients by about 43% (27.5% vs 43.4%; adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23–0.77) [^f173fad0] and lowers the severity and duration of delirium, with no significant effect on 30-day mortality or overall cognitive dysfunction [^f173fad0]. The intervention is **feasible and safe** [^75a70aeb], with high adherence when delivered via a mobile app during the preoperative stay [^42902d39]. Given the clinical burden of delirium and lack of effective pharmacologic prevention, **preoperative cognitive training is a reasonable, low-risk strategy** [^5d15ff5a] to reduce delirium risk in CABG patients, though larger multicenter trials are needed to confirm generalizability and define optimal dosing and delivery [^42902d39].

## Clinical evidence supporting preoperative cognitive training

### Primary outcomes: incidence of postoperative delirium

In the CT-LIFE randomized clinical trial [^dd282c6b], preoperative cognitive training reduced delirium incidence from 43.4% to 27.5% (absolute risk reduction 15.9%; adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23–0.77; P = 0.007) [^f173fad0]. Severe delirium also decreased (12.7% vs 16%; adjusted OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25–0.82; P = 0.01), and delirium duration was shorter (median 0 vs 2 days; P = 0.008) [^f173fad0].

---

### Secondary outcomes: cognitive function and other clinical outcomes

There was **no significant difference in 30-day mortality** or overall postoperative cognitive dysfunction between groups [^f173fad0]. Exploratory analyses suggest potential improvements in specific cognitive domains, but these findings are preliminary and require further validation [^notfound].

---

## Mechanisms underlying cognitive training benefits

Preoperative cognitive training is thought to enhance **cognitive reserve**, improving the brain's resilience to perioperative stressors such as hypoperfusion, microemboli, and neuroinflammation [^21117e1a]. Training targets attention, memory, processing speed, and executive function — domains commonly affected by delirium and cognitive decline [^21117e1a].

---

## Feasibility and adherence

The CT-LIFE trial delivered training via a **mobile application** during the preoperative hospitalization, achieving high adherence and patient satisfaction [^notfound]. This approach is practical in settings where patients are admitted several days before surgery, though feasibility in purely outpatient preoperative pathways remains to be established [^42902d39].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Single-center and regional**: The CT-LIFE trial was conducted in China; generalizability to other healthcare systems and cultures is uncertain [^notfound].
- **Sample size and event count**: The primary analysis included fewer than 75 events, making results fragile to small changes [^42902d39].
- **Blinding and placebo effects**: Patients and some staff were unblinded, risking ascertainment and placebo biases [^4399f8fe].
- **Optimal dosing and timing**: The ideal training duration, intensity, and timing before surgery are not yet defined [^3fe55a46].

---

## Comparison with other interventions

| **Intervention** | **Effect on delirium** | **Effect on cognitive dysfunction** | **Feasibility** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Preoperative cognitive training | Reduces incidence by ~43% [^f173fad0] | No significant effect on overall cognitive dysfunction | High adherence; mobile app-based [^notfound] |
| Pharmacological agents (e.g. antipsychotics, benzodiazepines) | Limited or inconsistent evidence [^notfound] | Limited evidence | Routine use not recommended due to side effects [^notfound] |
| Intraoperative strategies (e.g. off-pump CABG, hypothermia) | Mixed results; no consistent benefit [^a7549f14] [^a3c2e519] | Mixed results; no consistent benefit [^a7549f14] [^aab40bbc] | Dependent on surgical resources and expertise [^5d15ff5a] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Routine use**: Preoperative cognitive training can be considered for CABG patients, particularly those at high risk of delirium (e.g. older adults, preexisting cognitive impairment, depression) [^d70a59c4].
- **Implementation**: Mobile app-based training during preoperative hospitalization is feasible and acceptable; outpatient delivery models need development [^75a70aeb].
- **Adjunctive strategy**: Cognitive training should complement, not replace, standard delirium prevention bundles (e.g. early mobilization, sleep hygiene, medication review) [^5bb3e9c7].

---

## Future research directions

- **Larger multicenter trials**: Needed to confirm efficacy and generalizability across settings and populations [^42902d39].
- **Dosing and timing**: Studies should define optimal training duration, intensity, and timing relative to surgery [^3fe55a46].
- **Mechanistic studies**: Neuroimaging and biomarker studies could clarify how training confers protection [^5d520af5].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Economic evaluations are needed to support adoption in routine care [^notfound].

---

Preoperative cognitive training **reduces postoperative delirium** [^dd282c6b] in CABG patients without affecting mortality or overall cognitive dysfunction, offering a safe, feasible, and potentially cost-effective strategy to improve perioperative outcomes [^f173fad0]. Larger, multicenter trials are needed to confirm these findings and refine implementation [^42902d39].

Importance

Postoperative delirium is a common and impactful neuropsychiatric complication in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Cognitive training may enhance cognitive reserve, thereby reducing postoperative delirium.

Objective

To determine whether preoperative cognitive training reduces the incidence of delirium in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective, single-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted at 3 university teaching hospitals in southeastern China with enrollment between April 2022 and May 2023. Eligible participants included those scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting who consented and enrolled at least 10 days before surgery.

Interventions

Participating patients were randomly assigned 1:1, stratified by site, to either routine care or cognitive training, which included substantial practice with online tasks designed to enhance cognitive functions including memory, imagination, reasoning, reaction time, attention, and processing speed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was occurrence of delirium during postoperative days 1 to 7 or until hospital discharge, diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method or the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Units. Secondary outcomes were postoperative cognitive dysfunction, delirium characteristics, and all-cause mortality within 30 days following the operation.

Results

A total of 218 patients were randomized and 208 (median [IQR] age, 66 [58–70] years; 64 female [30.8%] and 144 male [69.2%]) were included in final analysis, with 102 randomized to cognitive training and 106 randomized to routine care. Of all participants, 95 (45.7%) had only a primary school education and 54 (26.0%) had finished high school. In the cognitive training group, 28 participants (27.5%) developed delirium compared with 46 participants (43.4%) randomized to routine care. Those receiving cognitive training were 57% less likely to develop delirium compared with those receiving routine care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23–0.77; P = 0.007). Significant differences were observed in the incidence of severe delirium (aOR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25–0.82; P = 0.01), median (IQR) duration of delirium (0 [0–1] days for cognitive training vs 0 [0–2] days for routine care; P = 0.008), and median (IQR) number of delirium-positive days (0 [0–1] days for cognitive training vs 0 [0–2] days for routine care; P = 0.007). No other secondary outcomes differed significantly.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized trial of 208 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, preoperative cognitive training reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium. However, our primary analysis was based on fewer than 75 events and should therefore be considered exploratory and a basis for future larger trials.

### Cognitive training for reduction of delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^42902d39]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that preoperative cognitive training may reduce delirium in patients recovering from CABG surgery. Furthermore, substantial benefit was apparent across considerable variation in total training times. However, our primary analysis was based on less than 75 events and, thus, was fragile. Moreover, our intervention was implemented during the preoperative hospitalization period, which is an unusual approach that presumably enhanced training intensity. Less benefit is therefore likely in patients receiving outpatient care. Our results should, thus, be considered exploratory and a basis for future larger trials.

### Cognitive training for reduction of delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^21117e1a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative delirium is an acute and transient disruption of cognitive function characterized by impaired attention, cognitive confusion, and altered consciousness. The syndrome remains common in patients recovering from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, and it impairs quality of life, imposes a burden on caregivers, and increases health care costs. Postoperative delirium is thought to be associated with disturbances in cerebral circulation consequent to cardiopulmonary bypass, sternotomy, embolic load, and hypoperfusion. Microemboli presumably are also associated, even in the absence of overt stroke.

Compromises in attention, short-term memory, and visuospatial processing are associated with postoperative delirium. Cognitive reserve may therefore be a potentially modifiable protective factor that guards against the development of postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Cognitive reserve mostly develops during childhood and young adult years, but may continue to increase even in old age.

Studies have shown that cognitive reserve is improved by cognitive training in community-dwelling, elderly individuals with benefits lasting months to years. Cognitive training may, thus, also be helpful in patients undergoing surgery, although the theory remains largely untested.

Patients in our hospitals are typically admitted approximately 1 week before CABG surgery to facilitate medical and presurgical evaluations, making preoperative cognitive training practical in our setting. We therefore tested the primary hypothesis that preoperative cognitive training reduces the incidence of delirium up to 7 days after CABG surgery while patients remained hospitalized.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5d520af5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There are many risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline (acutely and in the midterm) following CABG, which could be used in clinical practice, including the development or modification of a clinical prediction tool. Use of a CABG‐specific risk tool could improve prognosis and, in turn, lead to better patient management. This is especially critical for delirium, as it is severely underrecognized and has serious outcomes. 9 To improve prediction ability of these risk tools, future development could also integrate the results of functional neuroimaging (eg, electroencephalography) and biomarker research, related to CABG.

The most clinically meaningful finding from this meta‐analysis was the identification of modifiable preoperative risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline, of depression, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cognitive impairment. Improving the management of depression, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension in a preoperative setting may result in reductions in incident delirium and cognitive decline post‐CABG. Targeting cognitive impairment through cognitive training interventions also has potential. Even if these are small reductions in incidence rates, they will have great impact at scale. Future work should investigate if we can target modifiable risk factors to reduce the incidence of delirium and cognitive decline post‐CABG.

### Cognitive changes 5 years after coronary artery bypass grafting… [^48f7cc7d]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Between baseline and 1 year, cognitive test scores generally improved. There were statistically significant gains in 5 of the 8 domains, with nonsignificant gains in language and attention and virtually no change in visuoconstruction. The results of our prospective long-term follow-up study show that cognitive test performance between baseline and 5 years has a 2-stage course. Except for visuoconstruction, performance from baseline to 1 year tended to improve for most cognitive domains. By contrast, from 1 to 5 years, performance declined for most cognitive domains. Thus, when comparing preoperative performance and 5-year follow-up, there was no significant change for most cognitive domains. The only domains for which performance at 5 years was significantly worse than that at baseline were visuoconstruction and psychomotor speed.

Alternatively, it has been suggested that in candidates for CABG, cognitive function at baseline might be impaired because of long-standing cardiac disease, 21, 22 so that postoperative improvement in test scores might reflect a true improvement in cognitive function, perhaps as a consequence of improved cardiovascular functioning. 22 Patients with lower baseline scores tended to improve more between baseline and 1 year, but we cannot determine if this improvement reflects true improvement in cognitive function, as opposed to practice effects, regression toward the mean, or the absence of preoperative conditions that may have adversely affected test performance. A previous report15 has suggested an increased risk of cognitive decline after CABG in patients with the ApoE epsilon 4 allele.

The presence or absence of the ApoE epsilon 4 allele was one of the preoperative variables included in our regression analyses, but we found no evidence that this variable was associated with decline in cognitive performance in our population. First, when performance at 5 years was compared with performance at baseline, one of the cognitive domains with significant decline was visuoconstruction. There is some indication that the changes observed in visuoconstruction after CABG may not be coincidental. In a previous study7 that included measures to assess visuoconstructional abilities in which patients were followed up for more than 1 year, a similar decline in visuoconstructional performance was reported. Other recent long-term follow-up studies35, 36 that did not find evidence of late decline had not included measures of visuoconstructional abilities.

### Effect of cognitive prehabilitation on postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing major noncardiac surgery… [^3fe55a46]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Preoperative cognitive exercise times for the 125 patients randomized to intervention. Median and interquartile ranges for brain exercise time are 4. 61 hours. Four patients did not participate in any cognitive training, while 11 patients completed the recommended 10 hours of training. Findings Results of this randomized clinical trial show patients who met at least minimum compliance with a preoperative cognitive exercise intervention had a significantly decreased incidence of postoperative delirium. Meaning Modification of postoperative delirium risk with brain exercise remains a novel concept in the early stages of clinical study, and more investigation appears warranted based on this work, including investigation into the ideal activities, timing, and effective dosage. Interventions Participation in electronic, tablet-based preoperative cognitive exercise targeting memory, speed, attention, flexibility, and problem-solving functions.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was incidence of delirium between postoperative day 0 to day 7 or discharge, as measured by a brief Confusion Assessment Method, Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, or a structured medical record review. Secondary outcomes compared delirium characteristics between patients in the intervention and control groups. The Neurobics trial investigated the effect of preoperative cognitive exercise on postoperative cognitive recovery in aging patients undergoing surgery. It is the first large-scale application of cognitive prehabilitation in this population. We hypothesized that participation in a dynamic cognitive exercise program prior to surgery would decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients having major noncardiac, nonneurological surgery. Patients were asked to complete a cognitive exercise dosage of 10 total hours prior to their date of surgery, based on prior literature.

17, 18 The timing of brain exercise activity in the days leading up to surgery was at the patient's discretion, although we suggested at least an hour a day. Control patients were instructed to continue their normal daily activities. Vlisides et al12 suggest a need for supervision of preoperative brain exercise. This may be especially important in patients with preexisting cognitive impairment, who are at increased risk of postoperative delirium and have yet to be specifically targeted in a preoperative brain exercise study, to our knowledge. In the future, investment in devices with cellular capability for patients prescribed home-based cognitive exercise could provide the additional capability of allowing a research or clinical team member to monitor patient participation and performance, intervening or supervising as needed for patient support. There was no evidence in our trial that patients experienced harm or unintended effects of the brain exercise intervention.

### Randomized controlled trial of brief cognitive behavioral intervention for depression and anxiety symptoms preoperatively in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^9d45c1ac]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a brief, tailored cognitive-behavioral intervention for patients with symptoms of preoperative depression or anxiety before undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation.

Methods

Patients were recruited from a university teaching hospital between February 2007 and May 2009. Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment as usual (TAU) or a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention called Managing Anxiety and Depression using Education and Skills (MADES). A total of 100 subjects were randomized into the study. Length of hospital stay was assessed with a 1-way analysis of variance. Depression, anxiety, and quality of life were assessed with mixed-model repeated measures analyses.

Results

Overall, the intervention was feasible, and patients had a positive impression of the MADES. Patients in the TAU group stayed longer in the hospital than did those in the MADES group (7.9 days ± 2.6 vs 9.2 days ± 3.5; P = 0.049). Depressive symptoms increased at time of hospital discharge for the TAU group, whereas the MADES group had a decrease in depressive symptoms at the time of discharge. Quality of life and anxiety symptoms improved in both groups at 3 to 4 weeks of follow-up. However, the MADES group had greater improvements than did the TAU group.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that brief, tailored CBT targeting preoperative depression and anxiety is both feasible and acceptable for patients undergoing CABG surgery. Most important, this intervention improved depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as quality of life. Moreover, it reduced in-hospital length of stay. This study found that a cognitive-behavioral intervention for patients undergoing CABG surgery for symptoms of preoperative depression/anxiety is both feasible and acceptable. Most important, this intervention improved depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as quality of life. It also reduced in-hospital length of stay.

### Cognitive training for reduction of delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^f173fad0]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study CT-LIFE was published by Yu Jiang and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Postoperative delirium. In the CT-LIFE study, the trial question was: what is the role of preoperative cognitive training in patients undergoing CABG? In the CT-LIFE study, the study design was: multi-center, single blinded, RCT. In the CT-LIFE study, the population was: 208 patients (64 female, 144 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing CABG. The key exclusion criteria were life expectancy of < 6 months; psychiatric or neurological disorders; substantial impairments, such as blindness, severe deafness, or dementia that might hinder cognitive testing. In the CT-LIFE study, the interventions were: n = 102 cognitive training (substantial practice with a mobile application designed to enhance cognitive functions) n = 106 routine care (standard hospital attention without any specific cognitive training). In the CT-LIFE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in postoperative delirium (27.5% vs. 43.4%; OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.77). In the CT-LIFE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in severe delirium (12.7% vs. 16%; OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.82) No significant difference in median postoperative cognitive dysfunction score (56 points vs. 49 points; AD 7 points, 95% CI -3.91 to 17.91) No significant difference in median number of days alive and out of hospital within 30 days (19 days vs. 20 days; AD -1 days, 95% CI -2.52 to 0.52). In the CT-LIFE study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing CABG, cognitive training was superior to routine care with respect to postoperative delirium.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8b29428d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Delirium has been said to be preventable in up to 40% of cases. 9 Recent editorials 37, 38 have highlighted the importance of decreasing the incidence of delirium and cognitive decline to decrease patient and economic burden. In this meta‐analysis, modifiable risk factors, such as the presence of preoperative depression, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, were found to increase the risk (ORs, 1.44 — 3.42) for both delirium and cognitive decline acutely post‐CABG. Future research should investigate the effectiveness of implementing preoperative management strategies of these factors on cognitive outcomes (delirium and cognitive decline) post‐CABG. The presence of cognitive impairment resulted in over a 4‐fold increase in risk of developing post‐CABG delirium. Cognition is known to be modifiable through cognitive training in older populations, including those presenting with heart failure, 39, 40, 41 and therefore may be a viable preoperative target of intervention. 42

In this meta‐analysis, preoperative depression moderately (moderate effect sizes) increased the risk of delirium (OR, 2.49), acute cognitive decline (OR, 3.42), and midterm cognitive decline (OR, 2.50) post‐CABG. In addition, a higher preoperative depression score revealed moderate to large (SMD, 0.50–0.86) increases in the risk of developing acute and midterm cognitive decline post‐CABG, yet these analyses were not statistically significant, possibly because of high heterogeneity (I², 93.32–96.08; τ², 0.92–1.75). Depression in late life is known to occur concurrently with cognitive impairment and can hasten the onset of dementia. 43 The presence of vascular disease (indicative of undergoing CABG) is considered to have a strong link to the development of depression and dementia. 44 Therefore, the effects seen across the meta‐analyses in relation to depression may not be independent from other factors. We endeavored to investigate the influence of these factors through meta‐regression, yet it was not possible because of limited studies concurrently reporting data relating to depression, cognitive impairment, and vascular disease (eg, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and dyslipidemia).

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5d15ff5a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is the main treatment for multivessel coronary disease and remains one of the most common cardiac procedures worldwide. 1, 2 CABG has low mortality rates, and improves coronary vascularization and cardiac function. 3 However, CABG is associated with high rates of postoperative cognitive impairments, including delirium. 4, 5, 6

A recent meta‐analysis investigating post‐CABG cognitive outcomes (cross‐sectional approach by percentage at specific time points) 4 revealed postoperative cognitive impairment or decline was prevalent in 43% of patients up to 4 days, and remains high (39%) up to 1 month post‐CABG. This reduces in the midterm (6–12 months) following CABG to ≈25% and increases up to nearly 40% in the long‐term (1–5 years). The presence of delirium (an acute and fluctuating syndrome of deficits in attention and arousal) was apparent in 24% of patients, up to 1 week post‐CABG, when a standardized tool was used alongside clinical criteria. 4

The presence of cognitive decline following CABG is associated with increased depression risk and decreased quality of life, functional capacity, and the ability to perform activities of daily living. 7 Delirium presence in older adults is associated with increased mortality, length of stay (LOS), hospital readmissions, as well as cognitive decline and dementia, along with reduced quality of life. 8, 9, 10, 11 Research attempting to prevent these post‐CABG cognitive outcomes has been largely unsuccessful, including pharmacological, anesthetic intervention, and surgical techniques. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 There has been some evidence of therapeutic effect for advanced surgical methods, such as hypothermia and increasing systemic perfusion intraoperatively. 17 However, the expertise and technology needed are not routinely available.

Understanding risk and protective factors for delirium and cognitive decline post‐CABG has critical clinical implications, including more precise targeting of preoperative and perioperative interventions and the development of a sensitive risk screening tool for these outcomes. The use of a prediction tool for delirium and cognitive decline in a post‐CABG setting could lead to earlier intervention opportunities, greater prognosis, and, in turn, better patient management.

### Does postoperative cognitive decline after coronary bypass affect quality of life? [^60e9aabb]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to explore the influence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on both postoperative cognitive dysfunction and quality of life (QoL) and the association between the two patient-related outcomes.

Methods

In a prospective, observational cohort study, patients with elective, isolated CABG were included. Cognitive function was assessed using the Cogstate computerised cognitive test battery preoperatively, 3days and 6 months after surgery. QoL was measured preoperatively and at 6 months using the RAND-36 questionnaire including the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (MCS). Regression analysis, with adjustment for confounders, was used to evaluate the association between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and QoL.

Results

A total of 142 patients were included in the study. Evidence of persistent cognitive dysfunction was observed in 33% of patients after 6months. At 6months, the PCS had improved in 59% and decreased in 21% of patients, and the MCS increased in 49% and decreased in 29%. Postoperative cognitive changes were not associated with QoL scores.

Conclusions

Postoperative cognitive dysfunction and decreased QoL are common 6months after surgery, although cognitive function and QoL were found to have improved in many patients at 6months of follow-up. Impaired cognitive function is not associated with impaired QoL at 6months.

### Does postoperative cognitive decline after coronary bypass affect quality of life? [^39004f74]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a prospective single-centre cohort study. The study protocol is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. This article describes the cognitive outcomes of our study population in relation to QoL; outcomes on physical performance, as described in the study protocol, will be reported in another article. The study results are reported according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines(online supplemental material S1).

Eligibility criteria

We included adult patients admitted for elective, solitary on-pump CABG in the University Medical Centre Groningen, the Netherlands. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiac surgery and combined surgery (due to the increased risks of complications), pre-existing neurological deficits (ie, dementia, stroke and epilepsy) and psychiatric illness limiting reliability of screening tests. If patients were likely to experience difficulty completing cognitive testing due to impaired eyesight or hearing, or problems understanding the Dutch language, they were also excluded from the study.

Procedures

On the day of admission, usually the day before surgery, patients were identified and contacted for informed consent by the attending doctor or nurse practitioner. After informed consent was obtained, patients were included and baseline preoperative measurements were obtained. Postoperative assessment of cognitive function was performed in the hospital 3 days after surgery (short term) and at the patients' homes 6 months after surgery (long term). QoL was measured at baseline and 6 months after surgery.

Demographic and medical characteristics

Baseline demographic data were retrieved from the electronic patient medical records and included age, sex, Body Mass Index, education level (low: primary school; moderate: high school or secondary vocational education; high: college (applied sciences) or university), EuroSCORE I and II, and the presence of comorbidity such as diabetes, pulmonary disease, arterial vascular disease, renal diseaseand impaired ventricular function. Definitions of comorbidities are included in online supplemental material S2. Perioperative data included duration of surgery, time of cardiopulmonary bypass, cross-clamp time (in minutes) and the number of (arterial) grafts.

### Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and cognitive decline: a review [^0e003dad]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2005). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a worldwide used myocardial revascularization procedure, which despite the modern advantages still has a spectrum of complications. The relatively old age of the patients who undergo CABG and their widespread atherosclerotic disease are possible reasons for vascular sequels particularly those leading to neurological dysfunction. Immediate, early and late cognitive decline is a known- and well-defined outcome of CABG. Whereas a lot of data was collected through the last years regarding to neuropsychological dysfunction after CABG, nevertheless etiology and mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unresolved and they are probably multifactorial. Meticulously preoperative assessment of those patients with a potential risk of adverse neurocognitive outcomes can help clinicians to select the mode of revascularization and to better counsel patients about the risks and benefits of surgery versus more conservative kinds of treatment.

### Cognitive outcomes after on-versus off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery [^f544463e]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The Randomized On versus Off Bypass trial found no difference for a global cognitive outcome measure for patients receiving on-pump versus off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). In this report, we present the baseline patient characteristics that were predictive of post-CABG cognitive decline as well as compare cognitive outcomes between treatment arms.

Methods

A neuropsychological battery was administered preoperatively and at 1 year after undergoing CABG. Stepwise regression was used to identify demographic or clinical risk factors associated with cognitive decline. Neuropsychological data were converted to demographically corrected T scores to provide impairment levels.

Results

Overall 1,156 patients (581 on-pump, 575 off-pump) completed match-paired neuropsychological assessments at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Baseline cognitive score, age, education level, and ethnicity predicted cognitive decline after CABG. Only 20% of either group had mild impairment at baseline on three of the test scores, and less than 10% had severe impairment on individual tests at either time. Few subjects in either group transitioned to clinically impaired levels at follow-up on individual tests.

Conclusions

At baseline, lower cognitive function, older age, lower education, and ethnicity other than white were predictive of cognitive decline after CABG. Patients in both groups demonstrated low frequencies of cognitive impairment on individual tests at baseline and follow- up, and few patients in either group were classified as impaired at 1-year follow-up on individual tests. In general, the Randomized On versus Off Bypass study documented that neither on-pump nor off-pump CABG adversely impacts long-term brain function.

### Changes in cardiac and cognitive function and self-reported outcomes at one year after coronary artery bypass grafting [^96b90d0a]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Although health status after coronary artery bypass grafting improves at the group level, individual outcomes demonstrate variation. We aimed to evaluate relative importances of changes in cardiac and cognitive function and symptom status regarding physical and mental health at 1 year after coronary artery bypass grafting.

Methods

Outcomes in multivariable regression analysis (n = 86) were self-reported physical and mental health (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form) at 12 months' follow-up, adjusting for baseline. Independent variables were change in exercise capacity (staged ergometer protocol), cognitive function (neurocognitive test battery), and self-reported improvement of angina. Graft patency was evaluated by angiography (82/86 patients).

Results

After surgery, health status was comparable to the age- and sex-matched population norm. Improvement of angina was associated with gain in physical health in the range of 0.5 SD (beta = 0.23, P = 0.012). Change in observed physical exercise capacity (mean ± SD 199 ± 426 W x min) accounted for 9% of variance in physical health (beta = 0.42, P = 0.001). Positive change in cognitive function was significantly related to mental (beta = 0.52, P = 0.007) but not physical health. Graft occlusion (22/82 patients) was not significantly related to health status.

Conclusions

Individual variation in objective functional performance and symptom relief is significant for self-reported health status, beyond the predictive ability of preoperative health status, sex, and graft patency. Awareness of the extent and impact of outcome variation is important when counseling patients before and after coronary artery bypass grafting.

### Twelve-month follow-up effects of cognitive training after heart valve surgery on cognitive functions and health-related quality of life: a randomised clinical trial [^5e80c093]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) after cardiac surgery has a detrimental impact on HQL.POCD is commonly defined as a decrease in cognitive functions such as memory, attention and speech from a preoperative to postoperative neuropsychological assessment. It has a prevalence of about 22% between the 6th and 12th postoperative month in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)and a prevalence of 14% at 3 months and 16% at 3–4 years for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Since POCD is often examined psychometrically with objective test procedures, patients' subjective perceptions in the postoperative course are also important for the estimation of clinical relevance. In this context, subjectively assessed cognitive failures in daily life were reported by the patients themselves as well as by their relatives.

Risk factors involved in the development of POCD have been described for the preoperative (age, diabetes, depression, cognitive impairment), intraoperative (intubation time, duration of surgery), and postoperative (cardiac arrhythmias, delirium) periods. In particular, POCD in the early postoperative phase is associated with long-term cognitive decline. As cognitive functions can potentially be improved by cognitive training, we implemented a treatment-as-usual, controlled, paper-and-pencil-based cognitive training programme in the early postoperative period for cardiac surgery patients. As a result, we were able to show improved effects on POCDand HQLat 3 months post training. Here, we report the training effects on POCD, HQL and Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) at a 12-month follow-up assessment.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1b791f4a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is known to improve heart function and quality of life, while rates of surgery-related mortality are low. However, delirium and cognitive decline are common complications. We sought to identify preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk or protective factors associated with delirium and cognitive decline (across time) in patients undergoing CABG. Methods and Results We conducted a systematic search of Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane (March 26, 2019) for peer-reviewed, English publications reporting post-CABG delirium or cognitive decline data, for at least one risk factor. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated pooled odds ratio for categorical data and mean difference or standardized mean difference for continuous data. Ninety-seven studies, comprising data from 60 479 patients who underwent CABG, were included. Moderate to large and statistically significant risk factors for delirium were as follows: (1) preoperative cognitive impairment, depression, stroke history, and higher European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) score, (2) intraoperative increase in intubation time, and (3) postoperative presence of arrythmia and increased days in the intensive care unit; higher preoperative cognitive performance was protective for delirium. Moderate to large and statistically significant risk factors for acute cognitive decline were as follows: (1) preoperative depression and older age, (2) intraoperative increase in intubation time, and (3) postoperative presence of delirium and increased days in the intensive care unit. Presence of depression preoperatively was a moderate risk factor for midterm (1–6 months) post-CABG cognitive decline. Conclusions This meta-analysis identified several key risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following CABG, most of which are nonmodifiable. Future research should target preoperative risk factors, such as depression or cognitive impairment, which are potentially modifiable.

Background

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is known to improve heart function and quality of life, while rates of surgery‐related mortality are low. However, delirium and cognitive decline are common complications. We sought to identify preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk or protective factors associated with delirium and cognitive decline (across time) in patients undergoing CABG.

Methods and Results

We conducted a systematic search of Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and Cochrane (March 26, 2019) for peer‐reviewed, English publications reporting post‐CABG delirium or cognitive decline data, for at least one risk factor. Random‐effects meta‐analyses estimated pooled odds ratio for categorical data and mean difference or standardized mean difference for continuous data. Ninety‐seven studies, comprising data from 60 479 patients who underwent CABG, were included.

### Pre-existing cognitive impairment in candidates for cardiac surgery: an overview [^ddce21f8]. Heart (2009). Low credibility.

Until now, little attention has been paid to the preoperative status of the patient awaiting cardiac surgery when investigating the effects of cardiac surgery on cognition. However, there is growing evidence that pre-bypass patients show poorer cognitive function than healthy subjects. This article reviews existing published evidence of poor cognitive function in pre-bypass patients by describing patient characteristics, providing an inventory of affected neurocognitive domains, discussing adequate control groups and proposing potential aetiological mechanisms of neuropsychological dysfunctioning. It is concluded that there is a growing need for future research into this important topic on cognitive dysfunctioning in candidates for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

### Prevention of early postoperative decline: a randomized, controlled feasibility trial of perioperative cognitive training [^75a70aeb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) are common after cardiac surgery and contribute to an increased risk of postoperative complications, longer length of stay, and increased hospital mortality. Cognitive training (CT) may be able to durably improve cognitive reserve in areas deficient in delirium and POCD and, therefore, may potentially reduce the risk of these conditions. We sought to determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of a perioperative CT program to reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium and POCD in older cardiac surgery patients.

Methods

Randomized controlled trial at a single tertiary care center. Participants included 45 older adults age 60–90 undergoing cardiac surgery at least 10 days from enrollment. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to either perioperative CT via a mobile device or a usual care control. The primary outcome of feasibility was evaluated by enrollment patterns and adherence to protocol. Secondary outcomes of postoperative delirium and POCD were assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, respectively. Patient satisfaction was assessed via a postoperative survey.

Results

Sixty-five percent of eligible patients were enrolled. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) adherence (as a percentage of prescribed minutes played) was 39% (20%-68%), 6% (0%-37%), and 19% (0%-56%) for the preoperative, immediate postoperative, and postdischarge periods, respectively. Median (IQR) training times were 245 (136–536), 18 (0–40), and 122 (0–281) minutes for each period, respectively. The incidence of postoperative delirium (CT group 5/20 [25%] versus control 3/20 [15%]; P = 0.69) and POCD (CT group 53% versus control 37%; P = 0.33) was not significantly different between groups for either outcome in this limited sample. CT participants reported a high level of agreement (on a scale of 0–100) with statements that the program was easy to use (median [IQR], 87 [75–97]) and enjoyable (85 [79–91]). CT participants agreed significantly more than controls that their memory (median [IQR], 75 [54–82] vs 51 [49–54]; P = 0.01) and thinking ability (median [IQR], 78 [64–83] vs 50 [41–68]; P = 0.01) improved as a result of their participation in the study.

Conclusions

A CT program designed for use in the preoperative period is an attractive target for future investigations of cognitive prehabilitation in older cardiac surgery patients. Changes in the functionality of the program and enrichment techniques may improve adherence in future trials. Further investigation is necessary to determine the potential efficacy of cognitive prehabilitation to reduce the risk of postoperative delirium and POCD.

### Optimal preoperative assessment of the geriatric surgical patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons national surgical quality improvement program and the American Geriatrics Society [^c88a214c]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2012). Medium credibility.

Depression — prevalence, risk factors, and surgical associations — In the U.S. population 71 years and older, depression prevalence is estimated at 11%; in the general elderly population, major depression occurs in 1% to 3% with an additional 8% to 16% exhibiting clinically significant depressive symptoms. Significant risk factors in the elderly include female gender, disability, bereavement, sleep disturbance, and prior depression, with possible additional risk factors of poor health status, cognitive impairment, living alone, and new medical illness. Preoperative depression has been associated with increased mortality after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and longer postoperative length of stay after CABG and valve operations, and depression has also been associated with higher pain perception and increased postoperative analgesic use.

### Does preoperative mild cognitive impairment predict postoperative cognitive dysfunction after on-pump coronary bypass surgery? [^1e369951]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may contribute to the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Objective

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of early and long-term POCD after CABG in coronary heart disease patients with and without preoperative MCI.

Methods

The study enrolled two groups of males with coronary heart disease: 51 without MCI (mean age 56.0 ± 6.42 years) and 50 with MCI (mean age 56.4 ± 5.55 years). Baseline clinical characteristics as well as durations of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping were similar between the two groups. MCI was defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination score of less than 28. All patients underwent detailed neuropsychological examinations (12 tests) before and 7–10 days and 1 year after surgery. The incidence of early and long-term POCD was estimated on the basis of criteria defined as a 20% decline on 20% of the tests.

Results

Early POCD was diagnosed in 72% of cases in patients with MCI and in 79% of those without MCI (p = 0.5; odds ratio [OR] = 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2–2.2). Long-term POCD was diagnosed in 72% of MCI patients and in 70% of non-MCI patients (p = 0.8); OR = 1.08 (95% CI 0.4–2.9).

Conclusions

Our results show that the presence of MCI is not the leading cause of either early or long-term POCD in patients undergoing CABG. Further research should focus on the contribution of important clinical factors, including progression of atherosclerosis and adherence, to post-CABG POCD.

### Preoperative factors predict memory decline after coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention in an epidemiological cohort of older adults [^dea7859b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Durable cognitive decline, including major and minor postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PND), is a feared outcome following coronary revascularization procedures such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Based on data for postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), the incidence of PND > 6 months after CABG is likely to be 25% to 38%; 3‐month POCD after elective left heart catheterization occurs in 8% to 13%.POCD is associated with decreased quality of life and functional capacity, earlier departure from the workforce, future Alzheimer' disease and Alzheimer' disease–related dementias, and premature mortality.

Calls for broadly discussing PND/POCD as part of informed consent preoperatively have been largely unheeded, and a better understanding of individualized risk for PND may help with preoperative risk discussions. While some cohort average risk factors have been described (eg, older age, preoperative low cognition, preoperative depression, and postoperative delirium), there are currently no predictive models for anticipated postoperative cognitive outcome after coronary revascularization. We recently showed that there is no population‐average change in memory performance or dementia risk in older adults following CABG versus PCI. However, there was a group of individuals who underwent CABG or PCI and met adapted criteria for PND based on memory decline at cognitive testing 0 to 2 years after their procedure. We reanalyzed the cohort of older adults from this study to establish whether preoperative factors predict long‐term memory decline after coronary revascularization with CABG or PCI.

### Preoperative optimization of patient expectations improves long-term outcome in heart surgery patients: results of the randomized controlled PSY-HEART trial [^06c4ac4b]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Placebo mechanisms contribute substantially to clinical treatments in various fields of medicine, but systematic approaches to utilize these mechanisms for improved outcome are scarce. While placebo effects are substantial for patient-reported outcomes such as pain or depression, placebo effects can be also demonstrated for objective parameters such as immune responses, cardiovascular parameters, dopamine release, electroencephalogram and functional magnetic resonance imaging parameters. Major determinants of placebo mechanisms are patient pre-treatment expectations about treatment effects; experimental manipulations of volunteer expectations can either amplify or abolish the pain-reducing effects of potent opioids such as remifentanil. Labeling of treatments substantially determines treatment effects. Therefore, optimizing patient expectations could offer options to improve treatment outcome.

Patient expectations are also associated with favorable outcome of surgical interventions. If patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) expected to remain disabled after the surgery, it is more likely that these patients would still suffer from substantial disability post-surgery, even if their surgeons predicted a good patient recovery. However, such patient expectations are naturally occurring expectations, and not systematically induced expectations during clinical encounters. Considering the close association between pre-treatment expectations and disability following surgery, the question arises whether optimizing patient preoperative expectations can improve outcome following highly invasive interventions such as CABG. Here, we report on the long-term effects (6 months) of a randomized controlled trial investigating PSYchological preoperative interventions to improve outcome in HEART surgery patients (PSY-HEART trial).

In cardiac surgery, psychological preoperative interventions have been shown to change general risk factors and cardiac misconceptions, to improve knowledge about their surgery, and to increase physical activity. However, the results of current preoperative interventions on outcome variables in CABG remain inconclusive. Notably, none of these preoperative interventions directly targeted patient expectations as the most prominent placebo mechanism.

The integration of psychological preparations into the cardiac surgery unit environment requires a brief format. Therefore, we developed a short psychological pre-surgery intervention to optimize patient outcome expectations. We hypothesized that optimizing patient expectations improves outcome in CABG patients, especially in terms of disability as the primary outcome, but also in terms of general quality of life, subjective fitness for work, physical activity levels, and emotional outcomes. As a potential biological marker of the recovery process, we also assessed immune parameters. To evaluate the specificity of such an intervention, we included another psychological comparison condition offering emotional support and behavioral advice, with a similar "dose" as the expectation group. Both interventions were compared to standard medical care (SMC).

### Preoperative statin therapy does not reduce cognitive dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass [^4dc80d5f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine if patients receiving statin therapy before coronary artery bypass grafting surgery would have less cognitive dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass as a consequence of a diminished inflammatory response.

Design

Retrospective observational study of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.

Setting

Referral center for cardiothoracic surgery at a university hospital.

Participants

Four hundred forty patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Thirty-five percent of patients received statins in the preoperative period. Multivariable analysis revealed no effect of preoperative statin therapy on cognitive function (p = 0.67). Post hoc analysis revealed that statin therapy at hospital discharge was associated with less improvement in cognitive performance at 6 weeks after surgery (p = 0.011). No significant differences were found between statin therapy groups in either range or maximum value of any of the cytokines (p > 0.05).

Conclusions

Preoperative statin therapy did not decrease the inflammatory response to cardiopulmonary bypass or the cognitive dysfunction commonly seen after cardiac surgery.

### Cognitive outcomes in elderly high-risk patients after off-pump versus conventional coronary artery bypass grafting: a randomized trial [^35c7c721]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that the risk of cerebral dysfunction is less with off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) than with conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CCAB). However, evidence for this statement is preliminary, and additional insight is needed.

Methods and Results

The study was a substudy of the randomized Best Bypass Surgery trial that compared OPCAB with CCAB treatment with respect to intraoperative and postoperative mortality and morbidity in patients with a moderate to high level of predicted preoperative risk. The outcome was cognitive function. A total of 120 elderly patients (mean age 76 years, SD 4.5 years) underwent psychometric testing before surgery and at a mean of 103 (SD 15) days postoperatively with a neuropsychological test battery that included 7 parameters from 4 tests. Cognitive dysfunction was defined as the occurrence of at least 2 of the 7 possible deficits. Secondary analysis was performed on the basis of the definition of a 20% decline in cognitive scores compared with baseline, and with z score analysis. Cognitive dysfunction was identified in 4 of the 54 patients (7.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1% to 17.9%) in the OPCAB group and 5 of the 51 patients (9.8%, 95% CI 3.3% to 21.4%) in the CCAB group. We found no difference in incidence of cognitive dysfunction between the groups regardless of the definition applied.

Conclusions

In elderly high-risk patients, no significant difference was found in the incidence of cognitive dysfunction 3 months after either OPCAB or CCAB.

### Cognitive outcome after on-and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aab40bbc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare cognition following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (on- or off-pump).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials comparing cognitive outcome in patients undergoing CABG surgery on- or off-pump as assessed by continuous measures from a battery of 7 psychometric tests.

Setting

Multi-institutional centers performing CABG surgery.

Participants

Patients with coronary artery disease requiring CABG surgery.

Interventions

CABG surgery with or without CPB.

Measurements and Main Results

A structured literature search identified 13 randomized control trials that included a total of 2,405 patients. Results from 7 psychometric tests were grouped into early (≤ 3 months) and late (6–12 months) postoperative periods. No significant differences were found between on- and off-pump groups in any of the 7 psychometric tests in either the early (p range 0.21–0.78) or late (p range 0.09–0.93) postoperative period.

Conclusion

The results suggested that CPB may not be associated with cognitive decline that is associated with CABG surgery.

### Postoperative outcomes in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery with preoperative cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^dccee161]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Older patients with preoperative cognitive impairment are at risk for increased postoperative complications after noncardiac surgery. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between preoperative cognitive impairment and dementia and postoperative outcomes in older surgical patients after cardiac surgery.

Methods

Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to January 4, 2022. Inclusion criteria were cardiac surgery patients ≥ 60 years of age; preoperative cognitive impairment; ≥ 1 postoperative complication reported; comparator group with no preoperative cognitive impairment; and written in English. Using a random-effects model, we calculated effect sizes as odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean differences (SMDs). Risk of random error was assessed by applying trial sequential analysis.

Results

Sixteen studies (62,179 patients) were included. Preoperative cognitive impairment was associated with increased risk of delirium in older patients after cardiac surgery (70.0% vs 20.5%; OR, 8.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.25–16.38; I², 0%; P < .00001). Cognitive impairment was associated with increased hospital length of stay (LOS; SMD, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20–0.51; I², 22%; P < .00001) and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (SMD, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.09–0.68; I², 70%; P = 0.01). No significant association was seen for 30-day mortality (1.7% vs 1.1%; OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 0.64–10.44; I², 55%; P = 0.18).

Conclusions

In older patients undergoing cardiac surgery, cognitive impairment was associated with an 8-fold increased risk of delirium, a 5% increase in absolute risk of major postoperative bleeding, and an increase in hospital and ICU LOS by approximately 0.4 days. Further research on the feasibility of implementing routine neurocognitive testing is warranted.

### Cognitive training for reduction of delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a randomized clinical trial [^4399f8fe]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. Participants randomized to cognitive training were, of course, aware of their treatments and interacted with unblinded trial personnel. Therefore, some apparent benefit of cognitive training may have actually resulted from increased social interaction with nurses and trial personnel rather than from the cognitive exercises. Comprehensive cognitive function assessments across domains were not conducted, and the underlying mechanism for training effectiveness in preventing delirium remains unclear.

Whether off-pump CABG reduces postoperative neurologic dysfunction remains unclear. While our subgroup analysis showed no significant interaction between the surgical approaches and the intervention, 90% of patients had off-pump CABG, which provided little power for distinguishing between the methods.

### Pre-existing cognitive impairment as a factor influencing outcome after cardiac surgery [^e9338c95]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Conventional methodology to investigate cognitive impairment after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery leaves unclear the potential for pre-existing cognitive deficits to influence outcome. Individuals with pre-existing deficits may be more vulnerable to the effects of CABG, hence biasing the results of a typical prospective trial if account is not taken of their state. The present study examined the effect of pre-existing cognitive impairment upon cognitive outcome in 81 patients undergoing CABG. Patients performed the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test and other psychometric assessments prior to and at 6 days and 6 months after CABG. Those with pre-existing cognitive deficits were significantly more likely to display impairment at 6-day and 6-month follow-ups than were those without pre-existing deficits. Greater age and lower pre-morbid intelligence were also significant predictors of post-CABG deficit, confirming earlier findings. The results imply both that pre-existing cognitive impairments may render patients more vulnerable to post-operative deficits and that, in the absence of such pre-existing impairments, CABG surgery does not inevitably lead to later deficits. The study also replicated previous findings showing a similar influence of pre-existing depression upon emotional state after CABG. Overall, the results confirm the importance both of a patient's pre-existing cognitive and emotional states, and the methodology to assess them, in influencing outcome after cardiac surgery and the conclusions to be drawn as to the supposed adverse effects of the procedure.

### Cognitive outcome after off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a randomized trial [^a7549f14]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is associated with a decline in cognitive function, which has largely been attributed to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump procedures). Cardiac stabilizers facilitate CABG surgery without use of cardiopulmonary bypass (off-pump procedures) and should reduce the cognitive decline associated with on-pump procedures.

Objective

To compare the effect of CABG surgery with (on-pump) and without (off-pump) cardiopulmonary bypass on cognitive outcome.

Design and Setting

Randomized controlled trial conducted in the Netherlands of CABG surgery patients enrolled from March 1998 through August 2000, with 3- and 12-month follow-up.

Participants and Intervention

Patients scheduled for their first CABG surgery (mean age, 61 years; n = 281) were randomly assigned to off-pump surgery (n = 142) or on-pump surgery (n = 139).

Main Outcome Measures

Cognitive outcome at 3 and 12 months, which was determined by psychologists (blinded for randomization) who administered 10 neuropsychological tests before and after surgery. Quality of life, stroke rate, and all-cause mortality at 3 and 12 months were secondary outcome measures.

Results

Cognitive outcome could be determined at 3 months in 248 patients. Cognitive decline occurred in 21% in the off-pump group and 29% in the on-pump group (relative risk [RR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36–1.16; P = 0.15). The overall standardized change score (ie, improvement of cognitive performance) was 0.19 in the off-pump vs 0.13 in the on-pump group (P = 0.03). At 12 months, cognitive decline occurred in 30.8% in the off-pump group and 33.6% in the on-pump group (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.52–1.49; P = 0.69). The overall standardized change score was 0.19 in the off-pump vs 0.12 in the on-pump group (P = 0.09). No statistically significant differences were observed between the on-pump and off-pump groups in quality of life, stroke rate, or all-cause mortality at 3 and 12 months.

Conclusion

Patients who received their first CABG surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass had improved cognitive outcomes 3 months after the procedure, but the effects were limited and became negligible at 12 months.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^5fa46588]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Demographic data were calculated from the reported preoperative samples. The I² statistic was used to express the proportion of between‐study heterogeneity out of total variance and was classified as low (I² = 25%–50%), moderate (I² = 50%–75%), or high (I² ≥ 75%), using classification criteria suggested by Higgins et al. 25 Total between‐study variance was quantified using τ². All analyses were based on random‐effects model. Before data analyses, checks were conducted to detect extreme outliers. Effect size estimates that fell an abnormally large distance from other estimates (mainly because of separation or quasi‐separation for a given outcome) were excluded. This process did not exclude the remaining study data from remaining risk factor analyses.

### Postoperative but not preoperative depression is associated with cognitive impairment after cardiac surgery: exploratory analysis of data from a randomized trial [^9c33a2a8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 15% of adults in the United States suffer from a major depressive disorder leading to reduced work productivity, compromised health, and reduced survival. The prevalence of depression is reported to be even higher in patients with cardiac diseases including those undergoing cardiac surgery where it is reported in up to 40% of patients. Symptoms of depression at the time of surgery is associated with risk for postoperative complications, reduced functional recovery, impaired quality of life, and mortality. Science Advisory Committee recommendations from the American Heart Association, in fact, recommend screening for depression in patients with coronary artery disease including those undergoing surgery. Nonetheless, a mechanistic explanation for why pre-existing depression contributes to adverse postoperative outcomes is unclear.

Perioperative neurocognitive disorders contribute to patient morbidity after cardiac surgery. These disorders are manifest early after surgery as delirium or in the weeks to months later as postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction. We have found that a history of depression is two to three times more common in patients developing postoperative delirium than in those without delirium. Further, we have found an association between depression within a year of cardiac surgery and perceived cognitive difficulties. Less is known, however, on the role that depression plays in neurocognitive dysfunction one month after surgery. Understanding if this link is present might provide insight into whether attenuating depressive symptoms is a plausible strategy for improving neurocognitive recovery from cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether there is a relationship between depression either before or after cardiac surgery and postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction. Impairment of individual cognitive domains that comprise a composite neurocognitive outcome identifies risk for postoperative delirium in depressed patients after non-cardiac surgery even in the absence of global cognitive impairment. Thus, we focus on an evaluation of domain-specific cognitive performance. We hypothesize that preoperative and/or postoperative depression is associated with reduction from baseline in domain-specific cognitive function one month after surgery compared with patients not having depression.

### Is there cognitive decline 1 year after CABG? Comparison with surgical and nonsurgical controls [^46888cba]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

It is widely assumed that decline in cognition after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is related to use of the cardiopulmonary bypass pump. Because most studies have not included comparable control groups, it remains unclear whether postoperative cognitive changes are specific to cardiopulmonary bypass, general aspects of surgery, or vascular pathologies of the aging brain.

Methods

This nonrandomized study included four groups: CABG patients (n = 140); off-pump coronary surgery (n = 72); nonsurgical cardiac controls (NSCC) with diagnosed coronary artery disease but no surgery (n = 99); and heart healthy controls (HHC) with no cardiac risk factors (n = 69). Subjects were evaluated at baseline (preoperatively), 3 months, and 12 months. Eight cognitive domains and a global cognitive score, as well as depressive and subjective symptoms were analyzed.

Results

At baseline, patients with coronary artery disease (CABG, off-pump, and NSCC) had lower performance than the HHC group in several cognitive domains. By 3 months, all groups had improved. From 3 to 12 months, there were minimal intrasubject changes for all groups. No consistent differences between the CABG and off-pump patients were observed.

Conclusions

Compared with heart healthy controls (HHC), the groups with coronary artery disease had lower cognitive test scores at baseline. There was no evidence that the cognitive test performance of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients differed from that of control groups with coronary artery disease over a 1-year period. This study emphasizes the need for appropriate control groups for interpreting longitudinal changes in cognitive performance after CABG.

### The essential frailty toolset in older adults undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery [^5bb3e9c7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The EFT's clinical impact extends beyond predicting morbidity and mortality: it is actionable to identify specific components of frailty that may be improved by targeted interventions as endorsed by the Early Recovery After Surgery guidelines. Older patients with weakness benefit from early referral for postoperative cardiac rehabilitation to improve their strength, mobility, energy, cognition, mood, self‐efficacy, and outcomes. They may also benefit from prehab, with a systematic review of 8 studies suggesting a reduction in operative morbidity and hospital length of stay. Those with cognitive impairment stand to benefit from delirium risk reduction packages. Those with hypoalbuminemia may benefit from nutritional assessment and optimization. Those with anemia may benefit from further investigations and either iron or B12 replacement if deficient. Beyond treating the correctable components of frailty, the EFT may guide early involvement of social services and discharge planning for older adults awaiting CABG. Because frailty is associated with higher costs and resource use in cardiac surgery, a proactive multidisciplinary approach (rehabilitation, nutrition, cognitive training, discharge planning) may be an effective strategy for reducing downstream costs in addition to improving patient‐centered outcomes.

### Predictors of early neurocognitive deficits in low-risk patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery [^c9c8235f]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative cognitive deficits (POCDs) are a source of morbidity and occur frequently even in low-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Predictors of neurocognitive deficits can identify potentially modifiable risk factors as well as high-risk patients in whom alternate revascularization strategies may be considered.

Methods and Results

448 patients undergoing coronary surgery (coronary artery bypass graft [CABG]) underwent standardized preoperative and postoperative neurocognitive testing as part of 2 randomized trials evaluating the effects of mild hypothermia during coronary surgery. Prospectively collected data were used to identify univariate predictors of POCDs and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed. Models were bootstrapped 1000 times. POCDs occurred in 59% of patients. Significant univariate predictors included intraoperative normothermia, impaired left ventricular (LV) function, higher educational level, elevated serum creatinine and reduced creatinine clearance, prolonged intubation time, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay. Advanced age, presence of carotid disease, and cardiopulmonary bypass time were not associated with increased POCDs in this cohort. Multivariable modeling identified intraoperative normothermia (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] -1.15 [1.01, 1.31]), poor LV function (1.53 [1.02, 2.30]), and elevated preoperative creatinine (1.01 [1.00 to 1.03] for every 1 mmol/L increase), prolonged (> 24 hours) ICU stay (1.88 [1.27 to 2.79]), and higher educational level (1.52 [1.01 to 2.28]) as independent predictors of POCD occurrence.

Conclusions

Mild hypothermia, in the intraoperative and perioperative period, may be a protective strategy for the prevention of POCDs. Patients with elevated pre-operative creatinine and poor LV function carry a higher risk of POCDs and may benefit from revascularization strategies other than conventional on-pump CABG.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^db751c6a]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

All analyses were performed in Comprehensive Meta‐Analysis software (version 3). A result was considered statistically significant when P < 0.05. Each risk or protective factor was analyzed separately and, therefore, independence from other factors cannot be assumed. Separate random effect meta‐analyses were used to estimate pooled OR for categorical risk factor data and mean difference or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous risk factor data, comparing cognitive outcomes (delirium versus no delirium or cognitive decline versus no cognitive decline) post‐CABG. A risk or protective factor was meta‐analyzed when data from ≥ 2 studies were available for the analysis. All meta‐analyses were conducted on univariate data (no multivariate data were extracted) and therefore should be interpreted as unadjusted pooled estimates. The SMD was also calculated to provide a supplementary common effect size across pooled estimates (Tables S1 through S4). SMD values can be interpreted using the same cutoff as Cohen d, where ≥ 0.20, ≥ 0.50, and ≥ 0.80 are considered as small, moderate, and large, respectively. 26 For cognitive decline post‐CABG, analyses were conducted for each time point: short‐term (immediately postoperatively up to 1 month), midterm (1–6 months postoperatively), and long‐term (12–15 months postoperatively). Some of the extracted predictor variables were presented as both categorical and continuous data across articles (eg, education > 12 years [categorical] or total years of education [continuous]). Others provided data that could be sorted into multiple categories (eg, preoperative cognitive test scores): (1) different cognitive tests used between studies (SMD used) or (2) the same test used between studies, such as Mini‐Mental State Examination (mean difference used). In these cases, subanalyses were performed for each data format or category, for each risk factor. For statistically significant results, small study effect was examined by visually inspecting funnel plots of effect size versus SE. 27 When at least 10 studies were available for analyses, small study effect was formally assessed using the Egger test of the intercept. 28 When there was evidence for small study effect (1‐tailed P < 0.1), we used the Duvall and Tweedie 29 trim and fill method to quantify the extent of potential bias. When there were < 10 studies, we performed sensitivity analyses by removing outliers.

### Recovery of cognitive function after coronary artery bypass graft operations [^4ad9ef92]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operations on cognition was examined after controlling for the operation, emotional state, preexisting cognitive impairment, and repeated experience with cognitive tests.

Methods

On-pump CABG patients (n = 16), thoracic surgical patients (n = 15), and a nonsurgical control group (n = 15) were tested preoperatively, and at 1 and 8 weeks postoperatively, using a battery of cognitive tests and an emotional state assessment. Patient groups were similar in age, sex, level of education, and premorbid intelligence quotient score. Surgical group data were normalized against data from the nonsurgical control group before statistical analysis.

Results

CABG patients performed worse on every subtest before the operation, and this disadvantage persisted after the operation. Anxiety, depression, and stress were associated with impaired cognitive performance in the surgical groups 1 week after the operation: 44% of CABG patients and 33% of surgical control patients were significantly impaired; yet, by 8 weeks, nearly all patients had recovered to preoperative levels, with 25% of CABG and 13% of surgical control patients improving beyond their preoperative performance.

Conclusions

Stress, anxiety, and depression impair cognitive performance in association with CABG and thoracic operations. Most patients recover to, or exceed, preoperative levels of cognition within 8 weeks. Thus, after controlling for nonsurgical factors, the prospects of a tangible improvement in cognition after CABG are high.

### Predictors of cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^6d485c7e]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A significant number of patients develop cognitive impairment that persists for months following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Our objectives were to identify patient-related risk factors, processes of care, and the occurrence of any perioperative complications associated with cognitive decline.

Methods

Nine hundred thirty-nine patients enrolled in the Processes, Structures, and Outcomes of Care in Cardiac Surgery study undergoing CABG-only surgery at 14 Veterans Administration medical centers between 1992 and 1996 completed a short battery of cognitive tests at baseline and 6-months post-CABG. The composite cognitive score was based on the sum of errors for each individual item in the battery. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of the 6-month composite cognitive score.

Results

In multivariable analyses, patient characteristics associated with cognitive decline included cerebrovascular disease (p = 0.009), peripheral vascular disease (p = 0.007), history of chronic disabling neurologic illness (p = 0.016), and living alone (p = 0.049), while the number of years of education (p = 0.001) was inversely related to cognitive decline. After adjustment for baseline patient risk factors, the presence of any postoperative complication(s) (p = 0.001) was also associated with cognitive decline while cardiopulmonary bypass time (p = 0.008) was inversely related to cognitive decline.

Conclusions

Patients with noncoronary manifestations of atherosclerosis, chronic disabling neurologic illness, or limited social support are at risk for cognitive decline after CABG surgery. In contrast, more years of education were associated with less cognitive decline. Preoperative assessment of risk factors identified in this study may be useful when counseling patients about the risk for cognitive decline following CABG surgery.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11457fb9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Midterm Cognitive Decline (1–6 Months Post‐CABG)

Data from 24 individual studies were used within 19 analyses (including subcategory analyses), investigating 17 separate risk or protective factors for the presence of cognitive decline in the midterm (1–6 months) post‐CABG. Across the analyses, heterogeneity of statistically significant results spanned from low to moderate (I² range, 0–68.84; τ² range, 0–0.04) (see Table S3 for results of each meta‐analysis and Figure S5 for forest plots). Two analyses revealed statistically significant results, with no indication of small study effect (Figure S6). Preoperative depression and higher cognitive test scores (across all tests) were risk factors for midterm post‐CABG cognitive decline (Table S3 and Figure 4).

Figure 4
Forest plots of pooled estimates for risk or protective factors of post–coronary artery bypass grafting midterm cognitive decline.

Factors grouped according to the primary pooled estimate of the analysis (mean difference [MD], odds ratio, or standardized MD [SMD]), where solid gray horizontal lines indicate separation of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors and dashed gray vertical lines divide protective (left side) and risk (right side) factor estimates. The pooled estimates are ordered by the common calculated effect size (SMD) from largest to smallest (largest at the top). Estimates that are black represent statistically significant factors; those that are gray did not reach statistical significance. The scale for all continuous variables (MD and SMD plots) is listed within each factor name. ACC indicates aortic cross‐clamp; CI, cognitive index score; CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass; CVA, cerebrovascular attack; ICU, intensive care unit; LOS, length of stay; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; MI, myocardial infarction; PVD, peripheral vascular disease; and TIA, transient ischemic attack.

Preoperative factors that did not reach statistical significance were the presence of diabetes mellitus, male sex, hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, stroke history, peripheral vascular disease, and current smoking; and continuous factors of higher age, cognitive test score (when using cognitive index), depression score, years of education, and left ventricular ejection fraction. No intraoperative or postoperative factors reached statistical significance, including increase in ACC time (minutes), CPB time (minutes), number of grafts, total microemboli count, and LOS in ICU (days) (Table S3 and Figure 4). No meta‐regressions investigating the influence of age were significant for this time point.

### Preoperative factors predict memory decline after coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention in an epidemiological cohort of older adults [^169abbb2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Frailty, which was associated with an OR of 1.95 (1.42–2.69) for memory decline, and difficulty with instrumental activities of daily living (OR, 1.48 [0.99–2.21] for memory decline, which approached but did not achieve statistical significance) are relatively novel predictors in this area. Our findings are qualitatively consistent with the association between frailty and adverse cognitive outcomes in a small study of older patients after cardiac surgery. As appreciation of the importance of function and geriatric syndromes in perioperative care grows, routine assessment of frailty and/or function may help patients understand their risk for a variety of untoward postoperative outcomes.

Our approach was strengthened by the use of an epidemiological cohort, with better representation of historically excluded racial and ethnic minority groups and those of low socioeconomic status and/or low educational attainment compared with typical inception cohort studies of this topic. However, there are important limitations to our approach. First, cognitive testing in this epidemiological cohort was not linked to any health event; therefore, assessments are randomly spaced with respect to coronary revascularization, limiting the granularity of memory assessment timing. Second, cognitive assessments were also limited to memory, because of the testing performed by the HRS; deficits in executive function are often described as part of POCD/PND, but we lack the data to assess predictors of executive function change. Third, sensitivity at the 50% predicted probability cutoff was only 30%, although the model was 94% specific. While a less stringent cutoff would increase sensitivity, it would compromise specificity. Selection of a predicted probability cutoff should depend on what clinical actions might occur after a "high‐risk" screen. Fourth, participants who died after surgery were by definition excluded from analysis of late cognitive outcomes; thus, this model would only be generalizable to those who survive, an outcome that cannot be known at the time of surgery. However, cognitive trajectories previously modeled in this cohort of older adults were not sensitive to the competing risk of death.

Despite no evidence for population‐level differences in long‐term cognitive outcome after CABG versus PCI, there is clinically significant heterogeneity in individual cognitive outcomes after coronary revascularization. A model using preoperatively known factors performs with high specificity to identify older adults at high risk for long‐term memory decline before coronary revascularization with CABG or PCI. Understanding the predictive role of individual‐level factors for memory decline, which here included older age, frailty, and lower BMI, may facilitate preoperative risk discussion and, potentially, intra‐ and postoperative interventions to optimize cognitive outcomes.

### Cognitive performance after coronary artery bypass grafting: a follow-up study [^57124cf2]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The authors studied 52 of an initial cohort of 91 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and survived the perioperative period without stroke or other comorbidities, after a median follow-up of 55 months. Baseline data of the followed patients were comparable to those lost for follow-up. No patient showed a decline in neuropsychological test performance as compared to baseline. Vascular risk factor control was good in all patients, possibly contributing to the favorable outcome.

### Prehabilitation in patients awaiting elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery-effects on functional capacity and quality of life: a randomized controlled trial [^5d81caf6]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The "Preoperative Excercise Training for Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery- A Prospective Randomized Trial" (ID: NCT04111744,) was designed as a single center non-blinded prospective randomized controlled study with parallel assignment. The study protocol was approved by the responsible ethic committee in Gießen, Germany (Code: DE/HKHE20). All patients gave written informed consent. This study was conducted according to the principles of good clinical practice. German Heart Research Foundation, Wiliam G. Kerckhoff Foundation and Willy Robert Pitzer Foundation supported this study. Kerckhoff Heart Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany conducted the trial in cooperation with the German Sport University Cologne, Germany and the Justus-Liebig-University Gießen, Germany. The results presented here are partial outcomes of the main study "The Preoperative Excercise Training for Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery- A Prospective Randomized Trial". Other outcomes like effects of short-term exercise-based prehabilitation on hemodynamics as well as clinical and surgical parameters will be published soon.

During the period from December 2014 to March 2018, 824 eligible patients were screened for participation into the study in Kerckhoff Heart Center, Bad Nauheim, Germany.

Inclusion critera were: indication for CABG-surgery according to the guidelines of the European Heart Journal, the German Cardiac Societyand the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association, stable coronary artery disease, exercise-induced angina pectoris threshold ⩾50 W and written informed consent for participation in the study.

Exclusion critera were: unstable angina pectoris and/or myocardial infarction during the last two weeks, left main stem stenosis ⩾50%, exercise-induced angina threshold or ischemia at < 50 W, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, significant ventricular arrhythmia or relevant heart valve disease, myocarditis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, CABG-surgery during the last six months, peripheral arterial disease Fontaine ⩾IIb, orthopedic or neurologic preconditions precluding exercise training as well as the unability to attend the prehabilitation program due to physical limitations or long distance to cardiac rehabilitation (one way: > 60 minutes by driving).

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d70a59c4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Delirium

Data from 48 individual studies were used within 33 analyses (including subcategory analyses), investigating 27 separate risk or protective factors for delirium presence post‐CABG. Across the analyses, heterogeneity of statistically significant results spanned from low to high (I² range, 0–98.40; τ² range, 0–325.89) (see Table S1 for results of each meta‐analysis and Figure S1 for forest plots). Potential small‐study effect was found in 2 analyses (preoperative age and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE)), where trim and fill estimation led to decreases in effect size (see Figure S2 for funnel plots and small study effect investigation).

Statistically significant preoperative risk factors of developing delirium post‐CABG, from largest to smallest effect size, were: the presence of cognitive impairment, stroke history, depression, arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation (AF), peripheral vascular disease, kidney injury/disease, body mass index > 30 kg/m², diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, along with continuous risk factors of higher EuroSCORE and older age. Statistically significant intraoperative risk factors, from largest to smallest effect size, were increased intubation time (hours), duration of surgery (minutes), aortic cross‐clamp (ACC) time (minutes), and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (minutes). Statistically significant postoperative risk factors, from largest to smallest effect size, were: increased LOS in the ICU (days) and the presence of arrhythmia, including AF. Statistically significant protective factors for developing delirium post‐CABG were higher preoperative cognition test scores and years of education (Table S1 and Figure 2).

### Does postoperative cognitive decline after coronary bypass affect quality of life? [^9109012a]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective cohort study, we observed that many patients showed a postoperative improvement in cognitive function, and in the physical and mental component of QoL. However, POCD was persistent in 33% of patients 6 months after surgery, and there was either no change or a decline in QoL in approximately half of all patients. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find an association between POCD and difference in QoL at 6 months after CABG. A possible explanation could be that people with impaired cognitive function can still experience a high QoL. Alternatively, patients may adjust their perceived level of QoL (glad to be alive), so that the difference between the new and the intended level is normalised after surgery.

Many studies have been performed on POCD after CABG, mostly addressing the incidence and aetiology of POCD. The difficulty with studies on POCD are the lack of universally accepted definitions and gold standards for measuring POCD, sometimes leading to conflicting results. As in other POCD studies, we used the reliable change index that relates the change of scores to the normal test–retest variation in an age-matched control group. Other commonly used statistical methods are an absolute decline (usually > 1 SD calculated from preoperative scores) or a percentage change from baseline (usually a decline of > 20%). However, these methods do not relate to data from age-matched controls and therefore do not account for normal variability among a population. Recommendations about thresholds are published by the expert working group, but they do not recommend specific tests. The Cogstate test battery may be suitable as standard instrument because the major strength of this instrument is the comparability of retrieved data to data from age-matched controls. Also, several studies suggest this instrument to be both sensitive and reliable.

### Stable cognition after coronary artery bypass grafting: comparisons with percutaneous intervention and normal controls [^aea058b4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive decline has been associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but the extent to which these findings are related to the natural history of cognitive deficits in elderly patients with cardiac disease or have been influenced by the research methods used to determine abnormalities warrants further study.

Methods

After excluding individuals with conditions known to cause brain dysfunction, individuals referred for percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 42) or CABG (n = 35) were compared with an age-matched and education-matched control group without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease (n = 44). These subjects underwent a battery of 14 neurocognitive tests at baseline (preoperatively) and at 3 weeks and 4 months postoperatively.

Results

The majority of test scores for all three cohorts were within nonimpaired ranges at baseline and 3 weeks later. Change in impairment status from baseline to 3-week assessment was not associated statistically with type of treatment as referenced to clinical norms, and was associated with type of treatment on only one measure as referenced to control group performances. A further overall improvement in impairment status from 3 weeks' to 4 months' follow-up was seen in both CABG and percutaneous coronary intervention patients. Mean test scores were significantly worse in CABG patients versus percutaneous coronary intervention patients in 4 of 13 measures at 3 weeks' follow-up, but significant de novo impairment at 3 weeks' follow-up in the CABG group compared with the percutaneous coronary intervention and control groups was present in only one test. As assessed by reliable change methodology, impairment was statistically associated with type of treatment for only 1 of 13 measures.

Conclusions

As compared with changes seen in repeat testing of healthy control subjects and individuals who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, clinically meaningful cognitive deterioration was not observed after CABG.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^307af4f2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Eligibility

Inclusion criteria were as follows: peer‐reviewed, full‐text, English‐language studies that reported usable risk or protective factor data of those who had undergone CABG surgery (including CABG plus concomitant surgeries). Studies needed to report a cognitive outcome (using a standardized test result, neuropsychological battery, or a clinical diagnosis) for presence of delirium versus no delirium or cognitive decline versus no cognitive decline, and include usable data for at least one risk factor.

Exclusion criteria included the following: case series (n < 5), dissertations, book chapters, protocol articles, reviews, news articles, conference abstracts, letters to the editor, editorials, and comment publications; and studies with no description of their operationalization (or definition used for categorizing participants with cognitive decline/delirium) or incomplete reporting in respect to risk factor data.

All possible risk/protective factors were tallied for presence across eligible studies (eg, data reported within text or within a table split by cognitive outcome or results of measures of association, such as odds ratios [ORs]). Unique risk factors that were reported in > 10 studies (across delirium and cognitive decline) were included in this review. A list of these factors was circulated to academic clinicians (coauthors P.J.P. and D.H.J.D.) to ensure that no clinically relevant factors had been missed. This led to the additional extraction of delirium as a risk factor for cognitive decline (although only present in 3 studies). Following this, factors were categorized as follows: preoperative, intraoperative, or postoperative. Studies that did not report information pertaining to the target risk factors analyzed within the study (eg, studies reporting data related to hematocrit, height, or sepsis) were subsequently excluded (categorized as inappropriate data). In addition, if multiple studies investigated the same cohort, duplicate samples were excluded.

Quality Assessment

Study design and reporting quality were assessed by at least 2 reviewers (between D.G. E.S.G. and T.J.R.), with disagreements resolved by consensus. An adapted tool was used, on the basis of 2 existing assessment checklists, 21, 22 where higher scores indicated greater overall quality (0–12) (Data S1).

### Prospective randomized trial of normothermic versus hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass on cognitive function after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^a3c2e519]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Despite significant advances in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) technology, surgical techniques, and anesthetic management, central nervous system complications occur in a large percentage of patients undergoing surgery requiring CPB. Many centers are switching to normothermic CPB because of shorter CPB and operating room times and improved myocardial protection. The authors hypothesized that, compared with normothermia, hypothermic CPB would result in superior neurologic and neurocognitive function after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Methods

Three hundred patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to either normothermic (35.5–36.5 degrees C) or hypothermic (28–30 degrees C) CPB. A battery of neurocognitive tests was performed preoperatively and at 6 weeks after surgery. Four distinct cognitive domains were identified and standardized using factor analysis and were then compared on a continuous scale.

Results

Two hundred twenty-seven patients participated in 6-week follow-up testing. There were no differences in neurologic or neurocognitive outcomes between normothermic and hypothermic groups in multivariable models, adjusting for covariable effects of baseline cognitive function, age, and years of education, as well as interaction of these with temperature treatment.

Conclusions

Hypothermic CPB does not provide additional central nervous system protection in adult cardiac surgical patients who were maintained at either 30 or 35 degrees C during CPB.

### Do management strategies for coronary artery disease influence 6-year cognitive outcomes? [^3ef7eb8c]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Previous uncontrolled studies have suggested that there is late cognitive decline after coronary artery bypass grafting that may be attributable to use of the cardiopulmonary bypass pump.

Methods

In this prospective, nonrandomized, longitudinal study, we compared cognitive outcomes after on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (n = 152) with off-pump bypass surgery patients (n = 75); nonsurgical cardiac comparison subjects (n = 99); and 69 heart-healthy comparison (HHC) subjects. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to 72 months in the following cognitive domains: verbal memory, visual memory, visuoconstruction, language, motor speed, psychomotor speed, attention, executive function, and a composite global score.

Results

There were no consistent differences in 72-month cognitive outcomes among the three groups with coronary artery disease (CAD). The CAD groups had lower baseline performance, and a greater degree of decline compared with HHC. The degree of change was small, with none of the groups having more than 0.5 SD decline. None of the groups was substantially worse at 72 months compared with baseline.

Conclusions

Compared with subjects with no vascular disease risk factors, the CAD patients had lower baseline cognitive performance and greater degrees of decline over 72 months, suggesting that in these patients, vascular disease may have an impact on cognitive performance. We found no significant differences in the long-term cognitive outcomes among patients with various CAD therapies, indicating that management strategy for CAD is not an important determinant of long-term cognitive outcomes.

### Cognitive and cardiac outcomes 5 years after off-pump vs on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^b3ff2bad]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Conventional coronary artery bypass graft surgery with use of cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump CABG) is associated with excellent long-term cardiac outcomes but also with a high incidence of cognitive decline. The effect of avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass (off-pump CABG) on long-term cognitive and cardiac outcomes is unknown.

Objective

To compare the effect of off-pump CABG and on-pump CABG surgery on long-term cognitive and cardiac outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Octopus Study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in the Netherlands, which enrolled 281 low-risk CABG patients between 1998 and 2000. Five years after their surgery, surviving patients were invited for a follow-up assessment.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either off-pump (n = 142) or on-pump (n = 139) CABG surgery.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary measure was cognitive status 5 years after surgery, which was determined by a psychologist blinded to treatment allocation who administered 10 standardized validated neuropsychological tests. Secondary measures were occurrence of cardiovascular events (all-cause mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and coronary reintervention), anginal status, and quality of life.

Results

After 5 years, 130 patients were alive in each group. Cognitive outcomes could be determined in 123 and 117 patients in the off-pump and on-pump groups, respectively. When using a standard definition of cognitive decline (20% decline in performance in 20% of the neuropsychological test variables), 62 (50.4%) of 123 in the off-pump group and 59 (50.4%) of 117 in the on-pump group had cognitive decline (absolute difference, 0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -12.7% to 12.6%; P > .99). When a more conservative definition of cognitive decline was used, 41 (33.3%) in the off-pump group and 41 (35.0%) in the on-pump group had cognitive decline (absolute difference, -1.7%; 95% CI, -13.7% to 10.3%; P = 0.79). Thirty off-pump patients (21.1%) and 25 on-pump patients (18.0%) experienced a cardiovascular event (absolute difference, 3.1%; 95% CI, -6.1% to 12.4%; P = 0.55). No differences were observed in anginal status or quality of life.

Conclusion

In low-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery, avoiding the use of cardiopulmonary bypass had no effect on 5-year cognitive or cardiac outcomes.

### Longitudinal assessment of neurocognitive function after coronary-artery bypass surgery [^9e7650e4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cognitive decline complicates early recovery after coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) and may be evident in as many as three quarters of patients at the time of discharge from the hospital and a third of patients after six months. We sought to determine the course of cognitive change during the five years after CABG and the effect of perioperative decline on long-term cognitive function.

Methods

In 261 patients who underwent CABG, neurocognitive tests were performed preoperatively (at base line), before discharge, and six weeks, six months, and five years after CABG surgery. Decline in postoperative function was defined as a drop of 1 SD or more in the scores on tests of any one of four domains of cognitive function. (A reduction of 1 SD represents a decline in function of approximately 20 percent.) Overall neurocognitive status was assessed with a composite cognitive index score representing the sum of the scores for the individual domains. Factors predicting long-term cognitive decline were determined by multivariable logistic and linear regression.

Results

Among the patients studied, the incidence of cognitive decline was 53 percent at discharge, 36 percent at six weeks, 24 percent at six months, and 42 percent at five years. We investigated predictors of cognitive decline at five years and found that cognitive function at discharge was a significant predictor of long-term function (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

These results confirm the relatively high prevalence and persistence of cognitive decline after CABG and suggest a pattern of early improvement followed by a later decline that is predicted by the presence of early postoperative cognitive decline. Interventions to prevent or reduce short- and long-term cognitive decline after cardiac surgery are warranted.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^254b954d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

This meta‐analysis revealed multiple risk factors for post‐CABG delirium and cognitive decline based on group‐level data from included studies. Future research could identify clusters of risk factors by accessing patient‐level data. This investigation could be guided by common risk factors identified in this meta‐analysis, specifically depression, cognitive impairment, stroke history, diabetes mellitus, and vascular factors (hypertension and AF).

This is the only meta‐analysis to investigate risk and protective factors for multiple outcomes (delirium and cognitive decline) across multiple time points in patients undergoing CABG. Although this study is not without limitations, the pooled sample size is > 60 000 patients, allowing for greater generalizability of the results. The pooled results of this meta‐analysis cannot be directly compared across time (for cognitive decline), as the same individuals are not represented at all time points. As only studies published in English were included, there may be a geographical bias. All extracted data within this meta‐analysis were unadjusted for covariates, which does not permit investigation of independence. In addition, no temporal adjustments were conducted (eg, adjusting for preoperative depression within the intraoperative and postoperative factor meta‐analyses). Therefore, caution should be used in interpreting study results, especially on the utility of identified intraoperative and postoperative risk factors in risk prediction tools. Within the literature, substantially fewer articles investigated midterm and long‐term cognitive decline (than acute cognitive decline), which means that there may be important risk factors for these time periods that our approach could not identify. Many analyses conducted herein resulted in medium to high heterogeneity. Investigation into small study effect (publication bias) generally did not change the conclusions of this study (Figures S2, S4, and S6). The heterogeneity may be partially driven by the wide range of tests, screening tools, and methods of classifying delirium and cognitive decline within the included studies (Tables S8 and S9), although, notably, our subgroup analyses for delirium diagnosis (when using a diagnostic tool versus no tool) revealed no meaningful differences (Table S7).

### Lower endotoxin immunity predicts increased cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients after cardiac surgery [^f1ca91db]. Stroke (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the quality of life and functional capacity for numerous patients, many also exhibit impairment in cognitive function immediately after surgery. Although the etiology of this cognitive decline is multifactorial, the inflammatory response to the primary insult may modulate the extent of dysfunction. Patients with low preoperative levels of anti-endotoxin core antibody (EndoCAb) are more likely to experience adverse outcomes, suggesting that decreased immunity to endotoxin causes a heightened release of inflammatory mediators. We therefore sought to determine the association of decreased EndoCAb and the incidence of postoperative cognitive decline.

Methods

EndoCAb levels were measured before surgery in 460 patients undergoing elective CABG. Cognitive function was measured preoperatively and 6 weeks postoperatively. Multivariable analysis accounted for the effects of age, Parsonnet score, sex, body mass index, baseline cognition, years of education, history of hypertension, bypass time, cross-clamp time, and number of grafts.

Results

At 6-week follow-up, 122 patients (36%) showed cognitive decline. Lower preoperative EndoCAb levels were associated with a greater incidence and severity of postoperative cognitive decline. The elderly with decreased endotoxin immunity are particularly susceptible to this decline (relative risk = 1.97 for age > 64).

Conclusions

Reduced preoperative endotoxin immunity is a predictor of increased postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing CABG, particularly in those > 60 years old. Interventions that increase IgM EndoCAb levels might improve cognitive function after cardiac surgery.

### Cognition 6 years after surgical or medical therapy for coronary artery disease [^c0b85174]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The choice of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) as an intervention for coronary artery disease has been clouded by concerns about postoperative cognitive decline. Long-term cognitive decline after CABG has been reported, but without appropriate control subjects, it is not known whether this decline is specific to CABG or related to other factors such as cerebrovascular disease.

Methods

This prospective, observational study of patients with diagnosed coronary artery disease included 152 CABG and 92 nonsurgical cardiac comparison patients from one institution. The main outcome measure was within-patient change in cognitive performance for eight cognitive domains from baseline to 12- and 72-month follow-up.

Results

Mild late cognitive decline was observed for both study groups, but despite greater than 80% power to detect a 0.2 standard deviation difference, there were no statistically significant differences between the surgical and nonsurgical patients in the degree of change from 12 to 72 months for any cognitive domain. There was also no difference between groups in the degree of change from baseline to 72 months or in the number of patients with a Mini-Mental State Examination score in the clinically impaired range at 72 months.

Interpretation

Late cognitive decline does occur in patients who have undergone CABG surgery, but the degree of this decline does not differ from that observed in patients of similar age with coronary artery disease who have not undergone CABG. Therefore, late cognitive decline after CABG is not specific to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Longitudinal assessment of preoperative dexamethasone administration on cognitive function after cardiac surgery: a 4-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^8ed62568]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The current study represents a follow-up of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial that was performed at the University Hospital of Split, Croatia, between March 2019 and January 2020. This paper adheres to the applicable Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval for this study (Ethical Committee No. 2181-147-01/06/J.B.-16-2) was provided by the ethical committee of the University Hospital of Split (Chairperson Prof J. Bagatin) on 10 March 2015. All patients provided written informed consent. The original trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number: NCT02767713; date of registration: 10/05/2016).

Study participants

The sample for the current research consisted of patients who were enrolled in our previous trial four years ago. If the patients met any of the listed criteria during the follow-up period, they were excluded from the current study: cerebrovascular incident; neurodegenerative disease; mental illness; visual, hearing or motor impairment interfering with cognitive assessment; hospitalization due to heart failure; redo cardiac or carotid surgery; adrenal gland disease; corticosteroid treatment; and alcohol (> 20 g day⁻¹ or > 150 g week⁻¹) or controlled substance abuse.

Study intervention and randomization

The full primary trial protocol has been published previously. Additionally, we have described patient randomization, perioperative management, acquisition procedures and statistical analysis and have previously reported primary and secondary study outcomes in detail. Briefly, 161 patients aged between 41 and 84 years who were scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery, heart valve surgery or combined surgery (coronary artery bypass graft surgery and valve surgery) were randomized (1:1) to receive a single intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg kg⁻¹ dexamethasone or the same volume of placebo (0.9% NaCl) 10 h before surgery.

### Preoperative factors predict memory decline after coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention in an epidemiological cohort of older adults [^124e66c0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We analyzed a previously describedcohort of participants in the HRS (Health and Retirement Study), linked to Medicare fee‐for‐service billing data. HRS is a prospective, longitudinal survey of US adults that collects economic, health, family, and lifestyle data via biennial detailed interviews. HRS's sampling schema deliberately oversamples participants from minority racial and ethnic backgrounds. Participants in the HRS gave verbal informed consent for participation in the study, and data collection practices are approved by the University of Michigan, which administers the HRS. The University of California, San Francisco, Committee on Human Research waived the requirement for participant consent for this analysis. HRS public data are available from the University of Michigan under conditions of data use available at. The analytic code used in this study is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

We analyzed community‐dwelling participants who enrolled in the HRS between 1992 and 2010 and underwent CABG or PCI identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9) procedure codes between 1998 and 2015. Using results from the HRS's direct or proxy cognitive assessments according to established methodology, we calculated a "memory score" (analogous to a z ‐score) for cognitive performance for each participant at the pre‐ and postprocedure interviews. The actual change in memory score from pre‐ to postprocedure was adjusted by the expected cognitive change derived from a group of age‐ and sex‐matched older adults without reported cardiac disease. We used the SD of the preprocedure memory score for CABG/PCI recipients to identify participants whose adjusted postprocedure memory score was > 2 SDs below their expected score (major memory decline) or 1 to 2 SDs below expectation (mild memory decline). No preoperative diagnoses of cognitive impairment were made; the absolute amount of cognitive change from pre‐ to postprocedure was used for cognitive outcome stratification.

### Twelve-month follow-up effects of cognitive training after heart valve surgery on cognitive functions and health-related quality of life: a randomised clinical trial [^9c218ff0]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Between 13 July 2016 and 8 January 2020, 130 patients were enrolled, randomised and tested preoperatively. The last patient was tested on 9 March 2021, for the 12-month follow-up. After randomisation of the 130 patients, 36 patients (training group, n = 18; control group, n = 18) were lost to follow-up before the training or control intervention started. Thus, 94 patients (training group, n = 47; control group, n = 47) were considered for the baseline sample, which had no statistically significant between-groups differences in baseline demographics, preoperative comorbidities, operative details, postoperative complications (see table 1) or baseline neuropsychological tests, inclusive HADS parameters. After allocating interventions, no clinical strokes were observed. All patients were of white/Caucasian ethnicity. The reasons for losing patients to follow-up are shown in figure 1. The training lasted 14.9 (SD = 2.5) days and did not cause adverse events.

At 12 months follow-up, the training group (n = 19) showed an improvement compared with the control group (n = 27) in visual recognition memory (U = −2.137, p = 0.034, η² = 0.099, 1−β = 0.56). See online supplemental table 2 for details.

POCD frequency was 22% (n = 6) in the control group and 11% (n = 2) in the training group (χ²(1) = 1.06, p = 0.440; OR = 2.43, 95% CI 0.43 to 13.61). POCI frequency was 47.4% (n = 9) in the training group and 29.6% (n = 8) in the control group (χ²(1) = 1.51, p = 0.352; OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.59). No statistical significant training effects on depression or anxiety (HADS) were observed.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^78c73be1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous meta‐analyses of all surgical type cardiac patients have provided greater depth of knowledge surrounding the effects of surgery method on cognitive decline (on versus off pump) 15, 16 and the effect of pharmacological and anesthetic interventions on postoperative delirium. 18, 19 Specific risk or protective factors for cognitive outcomes (delirium and cognitive decline) have not been comprehensively investigated through meta‐analysis in patients undergoing CABG. In addition, no meta‐analysis has investigated the time course of effects for risk factors in relation to cognitive decline following CABG, especially in the long‐term (> 12 months). This systematic review and meta‐analysis aims to investigate risk and protective factors for the following: (1) post‐CABG delirium (1–7 days) and (2) post‐CABG cognitive decline across multiple time points: short‐term (immediately postoperatively up to 1 month), midterm (1–6 months postoperatively), and long‐term (12–15 months postoperatively).

### Current readings: neurocognitive impairment and clinical implications after cardiac surgery [^ab24060d]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The earliest reports of cardiac surgery literatures reported evidence of neurocognitive decline, highlighted in the 1995 statement of Consensus on assessment of neurobehavioral outcomes after cardiac surgery. Until now, the magnitude and clinical importance of neurocognitive outcomes continues to fluctuate and lack clarity. The aim of this review is to evaluate the contemporary status of neurocognitive outcomes in relation to pre-existing impairment, revascularization strategy, broader cardiovascular pathophysiological processes, and any longer-term clinical implications. Five studies published between 2009 and 2013 were reviewed. A meta-analysis did not find differences between on- and off-pump procedures. In other studies, there was evidence for extensive preoperative neurocognitive impairments. Additional 2 studies showed that longer-term neurocognitive impairment, including dementia, was not dissimilar to nonsurgical patients with cardiovascular disease. Currently, there is no convincing evidence to suggest that cardiac surgery, and cardiopulmonary bypass in particular, has a causal role in progression to dementia, or long-term deficit, independent of pre-existing neurocognitive impairments and cardiovascular disease.

Figure 3
Forest plots of pooled estimates for risk or protective factors of post–coronary artery bypass grafting acute cognitive decline.

Factors grouped according to the primary pooled estimate of the analysis (mean difference [MD], odds ratio, or standardized MD [SMD]), where solid gray horizontal lines indicate separation of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors and dashed gray vertical lines divide protective (left side) and risk (right side) factor estimates. The pooled estimates are ordered by the common calculated effect size (SMD) from largest to smallest (largest at the top). Estimates that are black represent statistically significant factors; those that are gray did not reach statistical significance. The scale for all continuous variables (MD and SMD plots) is listed within each factor name. ACC indicates aortic cross‐clamp; AF, atrial fibrillation; BMI, body mass index; CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass; CVA, cerebrovascular attack; ICU, intensive care unit; LOS, length of stay; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction; MI, myocardial infarction; MMSE, Mini‐Mental State Examination; PVD, peripheral vascular disease; and TIA, transient ischemic attack.

Statistically significant preoperative risk factors for acute post‐CABG cognitive decline, from largest to smallest effect size, were: the presence of depression, stroke history, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, along with continuous risk factors of older age and higher EuroSCORE. Statistically significant intraoperative continuous risk factors, from largest to smallest effect size, were increased intubation time (hours) and duration of surgery (minutes). Statistically significant postoperative risk factors, from largest to smallest effect size, were: the presence of delirium and arrhythmia, including AF, and the continuous risk factor of increased LOS in the ICU (days). Higher body mass index was a statistically significant protective factor for acute post‐CABG cognitive decline (Table S2 and Figure 3).

Preoperative factors that did not reach statistical significance were the presence of arrhythmia, including AF, cognitive impairment, dyslipidemia/hyperlipidemia, male sex, kidney injury/disease, previous myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, and previous/current smoking; and continuous factors of higher cognitive test score, depression score, years of education, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction. Intraoperative factors that did not reach statistical significance were increase in ACC time (minutes), CPB time (minutes), number of grafts, and total microemboli count (Table S2 and Figure 3).

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ed5d6617]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The presence of delirium following CABG resulted in a near 5‐fold increase (OR, 4.85, following sensitivity analysis) in risk of acute post‐CABG cognitive decline (up to 1 month). This pooled effect size was not adjusted for any preoperative or intraoperative risk factors and, therefore, its independence cannot be assumed and should be interpreted with this in mind. It may be argued that in a short‐term setting, this risk can be inflated because of the cognitive deficits of the delirium episode itself. However, the presence of delirium at this time (acute cognitive decline) is unlikely, as the assessment period for the 3 included studies was between days 7 and 9, whereas we know delirium typically resolves by day 5. 45, 46, 47 No studies reported data related to associations between post‐CABG delirium and cognitive decline in the midterm and long‐term. Delirium in late life (not specifically surgery related) is associated with doubling the rate of cognitive decline 37 and greatly increases the risk of incident dementia. 48 It should therefore be a priority for surgery‐related research to investigate if post‐CABG delirium has similar impact on long‐term cognitive decline and even dementia incidence.

### Prehabilitation in patients awaiting elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery-effects on functional capacity and quality of life: a randomized controlled trial [^27a77435]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main results of this prospectively randomized trial demonstrate that a two-week exercise-based prehabilitation program prior to CABG-surgery in older patients (> 65 years) is effective to improve preoperative functional capacity (six-minute walk distance, Timed-Up-and-Go Time) and quality of life. In addition, it positively influences the postoperative results of cardiac rehabilitation on six-minute walk distance and Timed-Up-and-Go Time, however the short-term exercise-based prehabilitation program was not effective to improve cardiopulmonary exercise capacity. This is one of the first prehabilitation studies including patients with a higher-risk profile (three-vessel coronary artery disease: > 75%; CCS II: > 38%; see Table 1) prior to elective CABG-surgery. The results confirm the feasibility, safety and the efficacy of an individualized exercise-based prehabilitation program in this population.

Results of several studies show that cardiac rehabilitation after CABG-surgery is effective to increase exercise capacity, – improve quality of life, and reduce mortality. Older patients with multimorbidity have the greatest benefit of cardiac rehabilitation. However, only few studies have evaluated the effect of prehabilitation prior to CABG-surgery. In the meta-analysis of Snowden et al.including 17 studies (N = 2689) it could be demonstrated that a preoperative exercise intervention reduced postoperative pulmonary complications significantly. Moreover, the results show a significant decrease in length of hospital stay in older patients after preoperative exercise intervention. However, the quality of this meta-analysis is influenced by the different study-characters and the great variation of the preoperative interventions provided, especially regarding exercise modalities, intensity and duration of the preoperative interventions. Most of the recently published prehabilitation studies are pilot studies with a small sample size, including a non-supervised exercise intervention and/or mixed patient population prior to valve and CABG-surgery. –, Promising results are to be expected from an ongoing multicentre randomized controlled trial focusing on the prehabilitation of older patients (⩾65 years) undergoing heart surgery.

### Neurocognitive outcomes 3 years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a controlled study [^489b9236]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiopulmonary bypass has been implicated in the late cognitive decline that has been reported after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Because most studies did not include a control group, a causal link of such decline with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass has not been established.

Methods

We compared changes in cognitive performance from baseline to 3 years in patients undergoing on-pump CABG (n = 152) with those of three control groups: patients with off-pump surgery (n = 75); with diagnosed coronary artery disease but no surgery (n = 99); and without coronary artery disease risk factors (n = 69). Neuropsychological performance was assessed by standardized tests of attention, language, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial, executive function, and psychomotor and motor speed.

Results

Relative to their baseline performance, no group had significantly lower performance at 36 months for any of the cognitive domains. From 12 to 36 months, there were no statistically significant differences in the degree of change between the on- and off-pump surgery groups. There was a trend toward mild decline in some cognitive domains, but overall differences among groups in degree of change over time were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

We found a mild but nonsignificant trend toward late postoperative cognitive decline for all study groups with coronary artery disease, but no significant differences in the degree of late postoperative cognitive decline after on-pump compared with off-pump surgery. These findings suggest that previously reported late decline after bypass surgery is not specific to use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Preoperative factors predict memory decline after coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention in an epidemiological cohort of older adults [^540b3f5d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Durable memory decline may occur in older adults after surgical (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) or nonsurgical (percutaneous coronary intervention) coronary revascularization. However, it is unknown whether individual memory risk can be predicted. We reanalyzed an epidemiological cohort of older adults to predict memory decline at ≈1 year after revascularization.

Methods and Results

We studied Health and Retirement Study participants who underwent CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention at age ≥ 65 years between 1998 and 2015 and participated in ≥ 1 biennial postprocedure assessment. Using a memory score based on direct and proxy cognitive tests, we identified participants whose actual postprocedure memory score was 1–2 ("mild") or > 2 ("major") SDs below expected postprocedure performance. We modeled probability of memory decline using logistic regression on preoperatively known factors and evaluated model discrimination and calibration. A total of 1390 participants (551 CABG, 839 percutaneous coronary intervention) underwent CABG/percutaneous coronary intervention at 75 ± 6 years old; 40% were women. The cohort was 83% non‐Hispanic White, 8.4% non‐Hispanic Black, 6.4% Hispanic ethnicity, and 1.7% from other groups masked by the HRS (Health and Retirement Study) to preserve participant confidentiality. At a median of 1.1 (interquartile range, 0.6–1.6) years after procedure, 267 (19%) had mild memory decline and 88 (6.3%) had major memory decline. Factors predicting memory decline included older age, frailty, and off‐pump CABG; obesity was protective. The optimism‐corrected area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71–0.77). A cutoff of 50% probability of memory decline identified 14% of the cohort as high risk, and was 94% specific and 30% sensitive for late memory decline.

Conclusions

Preoperative factors can be used to predict late memory decline after coronary revascularization in an epidemiological cohort with high specificity.

### Preoperative intensive inspiratory muscle training to prevent postoperative pulmonary complications in high-risk patients undergoing CABG surgery… [^2febfe11]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Objective To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of preoperative IMT on the incidence of PPCs in high-risk patients scheduled for elective CABG surgery. Design, Setting, and Patients A single-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted at the University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands, with enrollment between July 2002 and August 2005. Of 655 patients referred for elective CABG surgery, 299 met criteria for high risk of developing PPCs, of whom 279 were enrolled and followed up until discharge from hospital. Conclusion Preoperative IMT reduced the incidence of PPCs and duration of postoperative hospitalization in patients at high risk of developing a pulmonary complication undergoing CABG surgery. Trial Registration isrctn. org Identifier: ISRCTN17691887. The intervention group received preoperatively individualized, tailored exercises, namely, IMT; incentive spirometry; education in active cycle of breathing techniques; and forced expiration techniques.

17–19 The intervention group trained daily, 7 times a week, for at least 2 weeks before the actual date of surgery. Each session consisted of 20 minutes of IMT, which was performed 6 times a week without supervision and once a week with supervision by a physical therapist, who measured the strength and endurance of the inspiratory muscles after each week of training. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial of a preoperative prophylactic tailored physical therapy intervention in patients scheduled for primary elective CABG surgery, based on artery occlusion, who are at high risk of developing PPCs. As hypothesized, preoperative physical therapy with IMT in high-risk patients significantly improved inspiratory muscle function. Moreover, in patients receiving preoperative physical therapy, the incidence of PPCs was reduced by 50% compared with patients receiving usual care.

Consequently, the duration of postoperative hospitalization was significantly lower in the IMT group. These results are in line with the study results by Weiner et al, 11, 31 which involved patients undergoing CABG surgery with a low risk of developing PPCs; Nomori et al, 32 which involved patients undergoing thoracic surgery; and McConnell et al, 33 which involved healthy patients. Our data suggest that preoperative IMT make the patients more resistant to the detrimental consequences of surgery, decreasing the median duration of mechanical ventilation, which was significantly longer in the usual care group than in the IMT group.

Background Durable memory decline may occur in older adults after surgical (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]) or nonsurgical (percutaneous coronary intervention) coronary revascularization. However, it is unknown whether individual memory risk can be predicted. We reanalyzed an epidemiological cohort of older adults to predict memory decline at ≈1year after revascularization. Methods and Results We studied Health and Retirement Study participants who underwent CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention at age ≥ 65years between 1998 and 2015 and participated in ≥ 1 biennial postprocedure assessment. Using a memory score based on direct and proxy cognitive tests, we identified participants whose actual postprocedure memory score was 1–2 ("mild") or > 2 ("major") SDs below expected postprocedure performance. We modeled probability of memory decline using logistic regression on preoperatively known factors and evaluated model discrimination and calibration. A total of 1390 participants (551 CABG, 839 percutaneous coronary intervention) underwent CABG/percutaneous coronary intervention at 75 ± 6years old; 40% were women. The cohort was 83% non-Hispanic White, 8.4% non-Hispanic Black, 6.4% Hispanic ethnicity, and 1.7% from other groups masked by the HRS (Health and Retirement Study) to preserve participant confidentiality. At a median of 1.1 (interquartile range, 0.6–1.6) years after procedure, 267 (19%) had mild memory decline and 88 (6.3%) had major memory decline. Factors predicting memory decline included older age, frailty, and off-pump CABG; obesity was protective. The optimism-corrected area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.71–0.77). A cutoff of 50% probability of memory decline identified 14% of the cohort as high risk, and was 94% specific and 30% sensitive for late memory decline. Conclusions Preoperative factors can be used to predict late memory decline after coronary revascularization in an epidemiological cohort with high specificity.

### 2021 ACC / AHA / SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint Committee on Clinical practice guidelines [^6342f91a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Psychological interventions after coronary revascularization — In patients who have undergone coronary revascularization who have symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress, treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, psychological counseling, and/or pharmacological interventions is beneficial to improve quality of life and cardiac outcomes; in patients who have undergone coronary revascularization, it may be reasonable to screen for depression and refer or treat when it is indicated to improve quality of life and recovery. Presurgery estimates of depression in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) range from 14% to 43%, and about 20% of patients who undergo CABG remain depressed postoperatively. In the EsDEPACS trial, escitalopram was superior to placebo in reducing depression during the 24-week trial, and long-term follow-up showed that escitalopram resulted in a significantly lower risk of MACE and MI but not death; in ENRICHD, therapy was associated with improved depression but not event-free survival after 24 months of follow-up, with a subgroup analysis finding a 42% lower risk of death or MI in patients treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The Bypassing the Blues trial randomized depressed patients undergoing CABG to 8 months of collaborative care or usual care and demonstrated a 50% reduction in depression scores and improved quality of life in the collaborative care group, and a meta-analysis of these trials reported a reduction in cardiovascular deaths but not overall deaths, MI, or revascularization with psychological interventions. In the CODIACS-QoL trial evaluating 1500 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without a history of depression, universal depression screening with clinician notification did not alter quality of life, depression-free days, depressive symptoms, mortality rate, or patient-reported harms in patients with ACS.

### Neurocognitive complications after coronary artery bypass surgery [^bfcfcbb5]. Annals of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Both short- and long-term cognitive changes continue to occur after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but the pathophysiology of these neurobehavioral changes remains incompletely understood. The persistence of mild postoperative neurocognitive changes despite multiple improvements in the cardiopulmonary bypass procedure may be partially because of surgical populations being older and having more prevalent comorbid disease. The cause of the early postoperative changes is most likely multifactorial and may include ischemic injury from microemboli, hypoperfusion, and other factors resulting from major surgery. Several lines of evidence suggest that the late cognitive decline between 1 and 5 years after surgery may be secondary to high rates of cerebrovascular disease among candidates for CABG. A history of hypertension and other risk factors for vascular disease is known to be associated with increased risk for long-term cognitive decline in community-dwelling elderly individuals. Cerebrovascular risk factors are also associated with silent magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in patients undergoing CABG. Thus, whereas both short- and long-term postoperative cognitive changes have been associated with CABG, only the short-term, transient changes appear to be directly related to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e6cb4982]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction

Data extracted from each included study consisted of: country, sample size, age, sex, cognitive decline/delirium assessment criteria, and risk factor data relative to time periods and cognitive outcome (delirium versus no delirium): 1 to 7 days postoperatively; postoperative cognitive decline versus no decline: short‐term (immediately postoperatively up to 1 month), midterm (1–6 months postoperatively), and long‐term (12–15 months postoperatively). There may be a small degree of overlap between the outcomes of delirium and acute cognitive decline, yet this overlap is representative of the population at this time point. Many of the studies included in this meta‐analysis did not explicitly aim to assess risk factors for these cognitive outcomes through inferential statistical analyses. Yet, these studies still reported extractable descriptive data related to the cognitive outcome (eg, table presenting counts or mean and SD for preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables, split by cognitive outcome). As fewer articles reported data as a result of an inferential statistical analysis, the extraction of descriptive data was prioritized. For each risk factor, descriptive data (eg, mean and SD/event rates) were extracted when available. In the absence of descriptive data, the results of inferential statistical analyses (eg, ORs) were extracted. To increase the consistency within our analyses, only univariate (or unadjusted) data were extracted, as the number and type of covariates used within risk factor analyses varied greatly across studies. When data were reported and extracted as median and interquartile range values, they were converted to mean and SD values. 23, 24 Only data pertaining to risk/protective factors could be extracted for each cognitive outcome for the time periods reported in identified studies. There were substantially fewer articles within the literature that investigate midterm and long‐term cognitive decline, compared with delirium and acute cognitive decline. Therefore, fewer risk factors could be investigated for midterm and long‐term cognitive decline. It may be the case that there are important risk factors for these time points that we were unable to identify herein with our approach.

### Neurocognitive outcomes in off-pump versus on-pump bypass surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^63574b92]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive difficulties have been reported after coronary artery bypass graft surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. However, the cognitive benefit of off-pump surgery remains unclear.

Methods

Consecutively listed candidates for elective bypass were randomly assigned to either off-pump or on-pump techniques (n = 107). A battery of 11 standardized neuropsychological tests was administered before surgery, and again at 2 and 6 months after surgery. The two groups were compared using a range of statistical procedures, including growth modeling.

Results

There were no significant differences in cognitive test scores between the off-pump and on-pump groups using t tests at any of the time points. There were no differences between off-pump and on-pump groups in the incidence of cognitive deficits at 2 months or 6 months, with the exception that fewer off-pump patients showed impairment on one test of verbal fluency at 6 months. When the pattern of cognitive change over time between the two groups was compared using sophisticated modeling techniques, the two groups were again comparable, except for results on the test of verbal fluency, in which the off-pump group showed more rapid postsurgical cognitive gains than the on-pump group.

Conclusions

The off-pump group appears to be generally comparable to the on-pump group in terms of short-term and long-term postsurgical neurocognitive outcomes.

### Cognitive outcomes three years after coronary artery bypass surgery: a comparison of on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery and nonsurgical controls [^c4c58d1e]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery bypass grafting has been associated with both early and late postoperative cognitive decline, but interpretation of previous studies has been limited by lack of appropriate control groups. We compared changes in cognitive performance from baseline to 3 years in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with those of a control group of patients with known risk factors for coronary artery disease but without surgery.

Methods

Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 140) and a demographically similar nonsurgical control group with coronary artery disease (n = 92) completed baseline neuropsychological assessment and were followed up prospectively at 3, 12, and 36 months. Cognitive performance was assessed with a battery of neuropsychological tests, measuring the cognitive domains of attention, language, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial, executive function, and psychomotor and motor speed. The statistical analyses were performed in two ways: using data from all tested individuals, and using a model imputing missing observations for individuals lost to follow-up.

Results

Both the coronary artery bypass grafting and nonsurgical control groups improved from baseline to 1 year, with additional improvement between 1 and 3 years for some cognitive tests. The coronary artery bypass grafting group had statistically significantly greater improvement than the nonsurgical controls for some subtests, and had a comparable longitudinal course for the remainder of the subtests. Both study groups had a trend toward nonsignificant decline at 3 years on some measures, but the overall differences between groups over time were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Prospective longitudinal neuropsychological performance of patients with coronary artery bypass grafting did not differ from that of a comparable nonsurgical control group of patients with coronary artery disease at 1 or 3 years after baseline examination. This finding suggests that previously reported late cognitive decline after coronary artery bypass grafting may not be specific to the use of cardiopulmonary bypass, but may also occur in patients with similar risk factors for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.

### Neurocognitive functioning in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention: evidence of impairment before intervention compared with normal controls [^03784b18]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive deficits have been reported to occur in a significant proportion of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but the extent to which these deficits were preexistent or related to the natural history of cognitive decline in this patient population remains poorly defined.

Methods

After excluding patients with conditions known to cause brain dysfunction (eg, hepatic dysfunction, stroke), a group of patients referred for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or CABG (n = 82) was compared with an age- and education-matched control group that did not have clinical evidence of coronary artery disease (n = 41). These subjects underwent a battery of neurocognitive and emotional testing.

Results

Test score means for 5 of 14 different measures were significantly greater (impaired) in cardiac compared with control group subjects. Of cardiac subjects, 20% demonstrated clinical impairment (test result ≥ 1 SD worse than mean for normative standards) in 6 of 14 tests, compared with 10% of the controls. By clinical standards, 46% of cardiac subjects would be considered to be impaired (score 1 SD or more below the control group mean) on 3 or more neuropsychologic measures, compared with 29% of the controls. By this (control group mean) standard, cardiac subjects demonstrated impaired scores on 3.06 ± 2.6 tests compared with impairment in 2.0 ± 2.35 tests for the control group (p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Even excluding patients at high risk for brain dysfunction, cognitive impairment is found in patients with coronary artery disease before interventional therapy. Baseline impairment must be considered when evaluating outcomes after intervention.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^4d4f3d7e]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding patient education for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to preoperative counseling, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to provide complete information about the benefits, risks, therapeutic consequences, and alternatives to revascularization, as part of shared clinical decision-making in patients scheduled for percutaneous or surgical revascularization.

### Neuropsychologic and quality-of-life outcomes after coronary artery bypass surgery with and without cardiopulmonary bypass: a prospective randomized trial [^c8dcda48]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare neuropsychologic and quality-of-life outcomes of patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery to those undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery using conventional cardiopulmonary bypass.

Design

A prospective randomized trial of coronary artery bypass graft surgery with and without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

Setting

A cardiothoracic surgery unit at a tertiary hospital.

Participants

Sixty-six patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and a control group of 50 participants not undergoing cardiac surgery.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass or randomized to coronary artery bypass graft surgery without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

Measurements and Main Results

The proportions of neuropsychologic deficits and improvement in quality-of-life were comparable regardless of whether patients were randomized to receive off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery or conventional coronary artery graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Conclusions

Patients receiving coronary artery bypass grafts without cardiopulmonary bypass did not show fewer cognitive deficits or greater improvement in quality of life.

### Preoperative factors predict memory decline after coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention in an epidemiological cohort of older adults [^2a419d9c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

There were 1390 HRS participants who underwent a coronary revascularization procedure and contributed cognitive data at ≥ 1 postprocedure interview; 40% were women. The cohort was 83% non‐Hispanic White, 8.4% non‐Hispanic Black, 6.4% Hispanic ethnicity, and 1.7% from other groups masked by the HRS to preserve participant confidentiality. Of these, 267 (19%) met criteria for mild memory decline and 88 (6.3%) met criteria for major memory decline (Table 1), at a median of 1 year after the procedure. Participants who met memory decline criteria were, on average, older and less likely to be overweight or obese, and were more likely to meet criteria for frailty, and to report difficulty with at least 1 instrumental activity of daily living before the procedure.

Table 1
Characteristics of the Analytic Cohort and Unadjusted and Adjusted Associations With Memory Decline

In adjusted analysis, statistically significant independent predictors of mild or major memory decline included off‐pump CABG (odds ratio [OR], 1.75 [1.14–2.69]), age at procedure (OR, 1.18 [1.15–1.22] per additional year), and frailty (OR, 1.96 [1.42–2.69]). Overweight and obese BMI were associated with lower risk of memory decline, and the likelihood of memory decline decreased with additional time since the procedure (OR, 0.69 [0.56–0.86] per additional year). Table 1 includes adjusted ORs for all variables included in the model.

### Perioperative cognitive protection-cognitive exercise and cognitive reserve (the neurobics trial): a single-blind randomized trial [^535f16a7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Neurobics Trial is a single-blind, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. The main study objective is to compare effectiveness of preoperative cognitive exercise versus no intervention for lowering the incidence of postoperative delirium. Enrollment began March 2015 and is ongoing.

Methods

Eligible participants include patients older than 60 years of age scheduled for nonemergent, noncardiac, nonneurological surgery at our institution. Patients provide consent and are screened at our Outpatient Preoperative Assessment Clinic to rule out preexisting cognitive dysfunction, significant mental health disorders, and history of surgery requiring general anesthesia in the preceding 6 months. Participants meeting criteria are randomized to complete 1 hour daily of electronic tablet-based cognitive exercise for 10 days before surgery or no preoperative intervention. Compliance with the effective dose of 10 total hours of preoperative exercise is verified on return of the patient for surgery with time logs created by the software application and by patient self-reporting. After surgery, patients are evaluated for delirium in the postanesthesia recovery area, and then twice daily for the remainder of their hospitalization. Additionally, postoperative quality of recovery is assessed daily, along with pain scores and opiate use. More comprehensive cognitive assessments are completed just before discharge for baseline comparison, and quality of recovery is assessed via telephone interview 7, 30, and 90 days post-surgery. The primary outcome is the incidence of delirium during the postoperative hospitalization period. Randomization is computer generated, with allocation concealment in opaque envelopes. All postoperative assessments are completed by blinded study personnel.

Findings

The study is actively recruiting with 19 patients having provided consent to date, and a total of 264 patients is required for study completion; therefore, no data analysis is currently under way (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02230605).

Implications

To our knowledge, the Neurobics Trial is the first randomized, controlled study to investigate the effectiveness of a significant preoperative cognitive exercise regimen for the prevention of delirium after noncardiac, nonneurological surgery in elderly patients.

### Postoperative but not preoperative depression is associated with cognitive impairment after cardiac surgery: exploratory analysis of data from a randomized trial [^db0a47b5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this exploratory study, we found evidence of depression in 15.6% of patients before surgery and in 13.4% of patients after surgery. Of patients with preoperative depression, 50% remained depressed one month after surgery while 6.6% of patients without preoperative depression demonstrated new evidence of depression after surgery. Preoperative depression was not associated with change from baseline in cognitive performance postoperatively. In contrast, depression detected one month after surgery was associated with worse postoperative cognitive performance in the domains of attention, memory, verbal fluency, processing speed, and fine motor function. In contrast to preoperative depression, those with depression after surgery were more likely to demonstrate the composite neurocognitive dysfunction outcome one month after surgery. Preoperative depression was associated with postoperative impairment in several quality of life domains and with higher anxiety. Depression one month after surgery was associated with impairment on all but one of the quality of life domains and with measures of anxiety.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c85ce044]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This meta‐analysis quantifies data from > 60 000 patients to identify risk and protective factors for the development of cognitive decline, including delirium, immediately following CABG and in the midterm and long‐term. Findings highlight that there are many risk factors for both delirium and cognitive decline following CABG. These factors could be integrated into existing delirium tools or shortlisted in the development of prediction tools for postoperative cognitive decline. 31, 32 Further development of these clinical risk screening tools for both delirium and cognitive decline post‐CABG could lead to more accurate identification of at‐risk patients, improved prognosis, targeting of interventions, and patient management.

Risk prediction for delirium has been discussed at length for nonsurgical patients, with current models generally thought to have inadequate accuracy. 32 Most published delirium prediction tools are based on individual clinical studies with low statistical power, decreasing their generalizability. 33, 34, 35, 36 To our knowledge, no tools have been developed for predicting postoperative cognitive decline, nor have they been developed for delirium specifically following CABG. The results of this meta‐analysis can provide a shortlist of risk and protective factors that should be considered in future research for the modeling of prediction tools. Specifically, results should be considered when modifying or developing tools related to post‐CABG cognitive outcomes, as the operative process differs from other surgeries (eg, the use of CPB). Similar risk and protective factors may be applicable to other surgery types (cardiac and noncardiac); however, these factors cannot be ascertained from the current meta‐analysis. The development of CABG‐specific tools (delirium and cognitive decline) may lead to better prognosis, because of earlier identification and risk reduction strategies.

### Preoperative mild cognitive dysfunction predicts pulmonary complications after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^03584501]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

In elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment, noncompliance with respiratory exercises, ineffective expectoration, reluctance in mobilization, and difficulty in learning the use of drugs such as inhalers were observed in the early postoperative period after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It was hypothesized that respiratory complications may be more frequent in these patients, and so the postoperative respiratory complications in patients with preoperative mild cognitive impairment were compared with the postoperative respiratory complications of a control group.

Design

A prospective cohort control.

Setting

A university hospital.

Participants

Patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Interventions

Investigators separated 48 patients > 70 years old who were scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery into two groups: patients with preoperative mild cognitive impairment (group A, n = 25) and patients with no cognitive impairment (control group; group B, n = 23). The patients' cognitive status was evaluated preoperatively by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment test.

Measurements and Main Results

Pulmonary functions and respiratory complications were evaluated via chest x-rays and spirometry tests preoperatively and postoperatively. A significant difference was observed between the groups, particularly with regard to atelectasis and prolonged ventilation (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05). No significant impairment was observed in the spirometry tests of the control group. However, a significant deterioration was observed in the postoperative spirometry tests of patients with preoperative mild cognitive impairment.

Conclusions

This study suggested that mild cognitive impairment was associated with pulmonary complications after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

### Risk factors for delirium and cognitive decline following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^6019a0ca]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The search identified 4260 articles, of which 2647 records were screened by title and abstract, following duplicate removal. Full‐text screening was conducted on 963 articles; of these, 97 were included in this review (Figure 1, see Table S5 for articles excluded and rationale for exclusion, at full‐text review stage).

Figure 1
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysis flow diagram.

CABG indicates coronary artery bypass grafting.

The 97 included studies were published across 4 decades, with 3, 7, 38, and 49 studies published in the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, respectively. Of the included studies, 17 were conducted in the United States, 13 in Japan, 9 in Canada, 8 in Australia, and 6 each in China and the Netherlands. The remaining 38 studies were conducted across 22 individual countries. The included articles comprised data from 60 479 patients, with individual study sample sizes ranging from 8 to 14 262. The mean age of patients across included studies was 64.54 years, and 68.55% of patients were men (calculated only from studies with available data). The included studies were of good quality on the basis of the critical appraisals, ranging from 4 to 12, with a median study score of 10 (of 12) and interquartile range of 8 to 11.5. No studies were excluded from the analysis on the basis of their quality (see Table S6 for individual study information).

Preanalysis checks for extreme outliers resulted in data from 3 studies being excluded from separate analyses (delirium analyses of: presence of depression, kidney injury, and LOS in intensive care unit [ICU]); however, these studies remained within other analyses and therefore were not excluded from this article.

### The influence of propofol or desflurane on postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery [^6b3af5ca]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

We investigated the influence of either propofol or desflurane on the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in a randomised trial of 180 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. The primary outcome was incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 3 months, defined as ≥ 1 SD deterioration in two or more of 12 neurocognitive tests. Secondary outcomes included early postoperative cognitive dysfunction (between days three and seven), delirium on day one, morbidity and length of hospital stay. Early postoperative cognitive dysfunction was significantly higher with propofol compared with desflurane (56/84 (67.5%) vs 41/83 (49.4%), respectively, p = 0.018), but this effect was not seen at 3 months (10/87 (11.2%) vs 9/90 (10.0%), respectively. There was no difference in delirium (7/89 (7.9%) vs 12/91 (13.2%), respectively, length of hospital stay (median (IQR [range]) 7 (6–9 [4–15]) vs 6 (5–7 [5–16) days, respectively or other morbidities. Desflurane was associated with reduced early cognitive dysfunction.

### Effect of cardiac surgery on one-year patient-reported outcomes: a prospective cohort study [^f80d1c92]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Current cardiac surgery risk algorithms and quality measures focus on perioperative outcomes. However, delivering high-value, patient-centered cardiac care will require a better understanding of long-term patient-reported quality of life after surgery. Our objective was to prospectively assess the effect of cardiac surgery on long-term patient-reported outcomes.

Methods

Patients undergoing cardiac surgery at an academic medical center (2016 to 2017) were eligible for enrollment. Patient-reported outcomes were measured using the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively across five domains: mental health, physical health, physical functioning, social satisfaction, and applied cognition. Baseline data and perioperative outcomes were obtained from The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Database. The effect of cardiac surgery on long-term patient-reported quality of life was assessed.

Results

Ninety-eight patients were enrolled and underwent cardiac surgery, with 92.9% (91 of 98) successful follow-up. The most common operation was coronary artery bypass graft surgery at 63.3% (62 of 98), with 60.2% (59 of 98) undergoing an elective operation. One-year all-cause mortality was 5.1% (5 of 98). Rate of major morbidity was 11.2% (11 of 98). Cardiac surgery significantly improved patient-reported outcomes at 1 year across four domains: mental health (preoperative 47.3 ± 7.7 vs postoperative 51.1 ± 8.9, P < .001), physical health (41.2 ± 8.2 vs 46.3 ± 9.3, P < .001), physical functioning (39.8 ± 8.6 vs 44.8 ± 8.5, P < .001), and social satisfaction (46.8 ± 10.9 vs 50.7 ± 10.8, P = 0.023). Hospital discharge to a facility did not affect 1-year patient-reported outcomes.

Conclusions

Cardiac surgery improves long-term patient-reported quality of life. Mental, physical, and social well-being scores were significantly higher 1 year postoperatively. Data collection with the National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System provides meaningful, quantifiable results that may improve delivery of patient-centered care.

### Longitudinal assessment of preoperative dexamethasone administration on cognitive function after cardiac surgery: a 4-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^923f2fa8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a common complication following cardiac surgery. Although the POCD rate drops over time, five years after cardiac surgery, the incidence remains up to 40%. In addition to POCD deteriorating neurocognitive performance, it has also been related to increased mortality, impaired quality of life and premature retirement.

POCD pathogenesis is still unclear. For decades, it was thought that POCD was a repercussion of introducing cardiopulmonary bypass. However, beating heart surgery did not reduce POCD incidence. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that the microembolic load during cardiac surgery is independent of cardiopulmonary bypass utilization. In addition, studies have shown that the intraoperative oxygen titration strategy and blood pressure target during cardiac surgery are not associated with the postoperative cognitive outcome. Currently, possible mechanisms that may underlie the complex and multifactorial pathogenesis of POCD include surgical perfusion- and patient- and anesthesia-related risk factors. However, the inflammatory response initiated by the surgical procedure itself is recognized as an important factor in POCD development.

In that light, our previously published trial investigated the effect of administration of a single preoperative low dose of dexamethasone on cognitive outcomes in cardiac surgery patients. Compared to the placebo group, patients who received dexamethasone had a significantly reduced inflammatory response in terms of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and postoperative C-reactive protein levels and a significantly lower incidence of POCD. The findings in the study by Valentin et al. support our results and show that the prophylactic application of 8 mg of dexamethasone improves cognitive outcomes up to six months after noncardiac surgery. However, several other studies did not support our results, but they applied different corticosteroid treatment regimens and had different time points of cognitive evaluation. The major limitation of our trial was that cognitive functions were examined only during the early postoperative period.

Therefore, in the current follow-up of our previous trial, we sought to assess the longitudinal effects of preoperative dexamethasone administration on cognitive functions in patients who had undergone cardiac surgery. With reference to the findings from our previous trial, we hypothesized that patients who received dexamethasone would have better long-term cognitive outcomes than those who received placebo.

### Systemic davunetide provides sex-specific neuroprotection during coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) [^9d490126]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a surgical procedure commonly employed to treat severe coronary artery disease by improving blood flow to the heart. Despite its effectiveness, CABG is an open-heart surgery associated with potential complications, including cognitive decline. This phenomenon is often referred to as "postoperative cognitive dysfunction" or POCD. Additionally, extracorporeal circulation is a non-benign intervention used routinely in CABG surgery that is associated with several adverse reactions primarily related to systemic inflammatory responses. Thus, there are many postoperative myocardial, renal and neurological dysfunctions associated with this surgery. Focusing on cognition, a recent review, analyzing 23 studies with a total of 2,620 patients, concluded that future research should be performed to assess strategies to reduce cognitive impairment post-CABG. To address this, researchers have explored the potential neuroprotective effects of various agents during and after CABG. However, to date there are no products approved for neuroprotection for this condition.

As Torres and Ishida point out in their 2015 article, few pharmacological and interventional options are available to effectively protect the brain and spinal cord postoperatively, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage postop being the only known neuroprotective intervention, though its impacts are far from perfect. Evidence has been seen that there may be some postoperative neuroprotective benefits to such agents as dexmedetomidine, with its ability to minimize postoperative delirium, lidocaine, with its unique ability to sustain long-term cognitive recovery, magnesium, able to stabilize neurons under ischemic conditions, and erythropoietin, being an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent that can reduce ischemic damage, specifically in preventing strokes and cognitive dysfunction, but to date the findings are both unpromising and conflicting. As mentioned earlier, with cognitive dysfunction being a prominent outcome of CABG surgery, with subjects scoring 0.5 to 1 standard deviation below preoperative norms and reports of 53% subject dysfunction at discharge and 42% five years later, finding an effective intervention, despite its challenges, is vital.

### Does postoperative cognitive decline after coronary bypass affect quality of life? [^cc735923]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Cognitive function was assessed using the Cogstate brief computerised cognitive test battery (Cogstate, Melbourne, Australia). The test battery we used consisted of four tasks: the detection task, the identification task, the one card learning task and the one back task (ONB), assessing psychomotor speed, selective attention, visual learning and working memory, respectively. The Cogstate tests have been used in several other studies, indicating a good sensitivity for detecting subtle changes in cognitive performance and strong test–retest reliability. On the day before surgery, the tests were performed twice as recommended by the software vendor. The first was to minimise practice effects and the second was used as baseline test. Before starting, each task was introduced by the researcher using standardised written instruction. Each set of four tests required approximately 20 min to complete. All cognitive function scores were standardised according to normative data from age-matched controls. A standardised score higher than 100 indicated a better than average score compared with the age-matched population. As suggested by Evered et al, signs of cognitive dysfunction 3 days after surgery were interpreted as delayed neurocognitive recovery effected by drugs, anaesthesia and/or pain with the potential for recovery.

### Piracetam prevents cognitive decline in coronary artery bypass: a randomized trial versus placebo [^f69fb40b]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can be associated with postoperative cognitive impairment and ischemic stroke. No effective treatment is currently available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of piracetam to treat the cognitive impairment after CABG in an investigator-initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial.

Methods

Patients undergoing CABG (n = 98) were randomized to placebo (n = 48) or piracetam (n = 50). Study drugs were administered intravenously (150 mg/kg daily; 300 mg/kg on the day of surgery) from the day before surgery to 6 days after surgery, then orally (12 g/day) up to 6 weeks after surgery. Cognitive function was assessed before surgery (baseline) and 6 weeks after surgery (outcome) by using a battery of 12 neuropsychologic tests. The Spielberger Anxiety Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory were also administered. The combined score derived from the standardized neuropsychologic assessments was analyzed by using an analysis of covariance with baseline and education as covariates.

Results

Six weeks after surgery, the combined score indicated a statistically significant treatment effect in the per protocol population (1.848, p = 0.041) and a tendency towards statistical significance in the intent-to-treat population (1.624, p = 0.064) in the group treated with piracetam, but no statistically significant treatment effect was seen in the placebo. The state of anxiety measured by the Spielberger Anxiety Inventory was decreased in both groups (-9.27 and -6.37 in the placebo and piracetam groups, respectively).

Conclusions

Six weeks after CABG, cognition was significantly improved in patients treated with piracetam. Additional trials are required to confirm these effects.

### Preoperative factors predict memory decline after coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention in an epidemiological cohort of older adults [^7d068820]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Analysis was carried out in Stata/MP 17 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Unadjusted associations between 3‐level memory decline categories (ie, no, mild, and major memory decline) and preoperatively known characteristics were assessed with χ² tests for binary and categorical variables and ordinal regression by memory category for continuous variables. The primary analytic strategy was a logistic regression model for any memory decline (mild or major) incorporating all variables described above. Predictor variables were entered into the model without regard to statistical significance or variable selection. Sensitivity analysis with ordinal regression by memory category resulted in substantially similar findings. Model discrimination was assessed with the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, and calibration with a calibration plot (module pmcalplot for Stata). We calculated an optimism‐corrected area under the receiver operator characteristic curve using bootstrapping with 1250 replications (ie, 50 replicates per multiply‐imputed data set) with replacement, and calculated the location‐shifted bootstrap CI. Lack of model sensitivity to death as a competing risk was assessed by constructing a prediction model for a composite of death before cognitive assessment or mild or major memory decline; model interpretation was not substantively different. Author ELW had full access to the data in the study, and takes responsibility for integrity of the data and its analysis.

### Longitudinal functional recovery after geriatric cardiac surgery [^c5ac07fb]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Impaired functional and cognitive status is an important outcome for older adults undergoing major cardiac surgery. We conducted this pilot study to gauge feasibility of assessing these outcomes longitudinally, from preoperatively up to two time points postoperatively to assess for recovery.

Methods

We interviewed patients aged ≥ 65 y preoperatively and repeated functional and cognitive assessments at 4–6 wk and 4–6 mo postoperatively. Simple unadjusted linear regression was used to test whether baseline measures changed at each follow-up time point. Then we used a longitudinal model to predict postoperative recovery overall, adjusting for comorbidity.

Results

A total of 62 patients (age 74.7 ± 5.9) underwent scheduled cardiac surgery. Preoperative activities of daily living (ADL) impairment was associated with poorer functional recovery at 4–6 wk postoperatively with each baseline ADL impairment conferring recovery of 0.5 fewer ADLs (P < 0.05). By 4–6 mo, we could no longer detect a difference in recovery. Preoperative cognition and physical activity were not associated with postoperative changes in these domains.

Conclusions

A preoperative and postoperative evaluation of function and cognition was integrated into the surgical care of older patients. Preoperative impairments in ADLs may be a means to identify patients who might benefit from careful postoperative planning, especially in terms of assistance with self-care during the first 4–6 wk after cardiac surgery.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^80ac5413]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

When is surgery preferable — decision considerations for older adults with coronary artery disease — emphasizes that older patients with substantial disease warranting revascularization are often excluded from randomized clinical trials comparing PCI and CABG, yet older patients who undergo revascularization receive benefits such as relief of symptoms, reduced risk of future myocardial infarction, and improved survival rates; similar to younger patients, older adults have been found to have improved survival, lower risk of repeat revascularization, lower risk of subsequent myocardial infarction, and higher perioperative mortality after CABG compared with PCI in retrospective studies, propensity-matched analyses, and meta-analyses, while comparable outcomes between PCI and CABG were noted in a subgroup analysis and extended follow-up of a large randomized trial; because older patients may have more comorbidities and unique preferences, a careful assessment is warranted when considering PCI or CABG, including evaluation of technical candidacy and procedural risk, a heart team discussion, and consideration of patient preferences, cognitive function, and life expectancy.

### Cognitive function in candidates for coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^0c543f91]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

While many studies have investigated cognitive impairments in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, very few have closely evaluated presurgical cognitive functioning of bypass candidates.

Methods

A battery of neuropsychologic tests was administered to a consecutive series of patients listed for bypass surgery (n = 109). Cognitive function of bypass candidates was compared with that of a healthy control group (n = 25) and published test norms.

Results

Cognitive test scores in candidates for bypass were significantly lower than those of the control group on tests of attention, information processing speed, and verbal memory. Additionally, bypass candidates' cognitive test scores were significantly reduced compared with expected values derived from validated test norms, on all but one cognitive test.

Conclusions

Cognitive performances of candidates for bypass were significantly lower than those of a healthy control group and published cognitive test norms.

### Detection of postoperative cognitive decline after coronary artery bypass graft surgery is affected by the number of neuropsychological tests in the assessment battery [^ec765acc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The assessment of postoperative cognitive dysfunction after coronary artery bypass graft surgery is made with the repeated administration of cognitive tests. This classification is vulnerable to error, and it has been suggested that increasing the number of tests in a battery while maintaining constant inclusion criteria for postoperative cognitive dysfunction increases the rate of false positive classification of deterioration. The current study tested this by applying a constant rule for cognitive dysfunction using combinations of two to seven cognitive tests.

Methods

Two hundred and four coronary artery bypass graft patients (surgical) and 90 healthy nonsurgical controls aged 55 years or older completed a battery of cognitive tests at baseline (preoperative) and 1 week later (postoperative). In both groups, postoperative cognitive dysfunction was classified using all unique combinations of two to seven cognitive tests when performance deteriorated on two or more tests by at least the value of the baseline standard deviation.

Results

The average incidence of cognitive dysfunction progressively increased in both groups as the number of cognitive tests increased from two (surgical: 13.3%; control: 3.1%) to seven tests (surgical: 49.4%; control: 41.1%).

Conclusions

Increasing the number of tests used to classify postoperative cognitive dysfunction appears to increase the sensitivity to change in the coronary artery bypass graft group. However, accompanying false positive classifications suggest that this improved sensitivity reflected increased error. Future rules for postoperative cognitive dysfunction need to account for this error and include a control group.

### Outcomes associated with postoperative cognitive dysfunction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0d4fa360]. Age and Ageing (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points

Cardiac surgical patients who developed postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) < 30 days postsurgery were at increased risk of prolonged length of hospital stay (LOS) and mortality.
Noncardiac surgical patients who developed POCD < 30 days postsurgery had increased LOS and potentially increased intermediate-term mortality risk.
Early recognition of perioperative neurocognitive disorders to improve the care process for at-risk populations may be beneficial.

### Cognitive outcomes 7.5 years after angioplasty compared with off-pump coronary bypass surgery [^a824acbc]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention are both associated with cognitive decline, but limited data are available on long-term outcomes. This study compared long-term cognitive outcomes between patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting.

Methods

A multicenter trial in the Netherlands randomized 280 patients to percutaneous coronary intervention or off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. Cognitive performance 7.5 years after randomization was assessed through a battery of 9 neuropsychologic tests and summarized into a combined Z-score.

Results

After 7.5 years, cognitive assessment could be performed in 81% of the 249 surviving patients. Better cognitive performance was observed in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group (combined Z-score 0.11 for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting versus -0.17 for percutaneous coronary intervention; difference 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.47, p < 0.01). However, this difference became nonsignificant (Z-score difference 0.14, 95% confidence interval -0.01 to 0.29, p = 0.08) after multivariable adjustment for potential confounders.

Conclusions

At 7.5 years follow-up, off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting patients had a similar or perhaps even better cognitive performance compared with percutaneous coronary intervention patients.
