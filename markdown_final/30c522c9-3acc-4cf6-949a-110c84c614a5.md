## Question

ppi in liver cirrhosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in liver cirrhosis, including their indications, risks, guideline positions, and a practical decision framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why PPIs are commonly used in cirrhosis. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend and where they align or conflict. Next, I will examine the evidence for benefits versus harms across different scenarios, including post–variceal band ligation, acute variceal bleeding, and non-variceal indications. After that, I need to check for confounding by indication and reconcile conflicting studies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and a deprescribing plan with monitoring, making sure I double-check each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the scope of the problem. Patients with cirrhosis frequently receive PPIs for dyspepsia, reflux, ulcer prophylaxis, and after variceal interventions, yet overuse is common and often lacks a valid indication, with reports of 40–60% of PPI prescriptions in cirrhosis being inappropriate and frequently continued long term without reassessment, which raises concern for infection risk and disease progression [^11365gxo] [^113y2sdi].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor the framework. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check multiple societies. The ACG/Canadian periendoscopic guideline advises avoiding PPIs in cirrhosis unless there is a clear indication such as symptomatic GERD, erosive esophagitis, or ulcer healing, due to increased infection risk, which is a conditional recommendation based on very low-quality evidence but reflects consistent signals across studies [^115KGyoH]. EASL decompensated cirrhosis guidance similarly recommends restricting PPIs to patients with a clear indication because of a possible increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), especially after prior SBP, again reflecting observational risk signals rather than randomized data [^1116Sdbm]. BSG variceal hemorrhage guidance advises against PPIs for primary or secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding and against their routine use in acute variceal hemorrhage unless there is a separate acid-related indication, underscoring that acid suppression does not address portal hypertensive pathophysiology [^111geD9N] [^114PiPYW] [^114hVor5]. AASLD critical care guidance advises minimizing PPIs in hospitalized cirrhosis and stopping them when no indication exists, particularly to reduce nosocomial infections, which aligns with infection-prevention strategies in ACLF [^113KYxRN] [^115izFV7].

> I will now examine the evidence for potential benefits, especially after endoscopic variceal band ligation (EVL). Wait, let me verify the magnitude and quality of data. Observational cohorts suggest that PPI use after EVL may reduce short-term rebleeding and mortality, with one study showing lower 30-day bleeding and death among inpatients discharged on PPIs after EVL, but these are retrospective and vulnerable to confounding by indication and severity [^113ve3fs]. A 2025 meta-analysis pooling RCTs and observational studies found unadjusted reductions in post-EBL bleeding and mortality with PPIs, but adjusted observational data and RCT data showed no significant benefit, and trial sequential analysis indicated underpowered RCT evidence, so routine post-EBL PPIs cannot be endorsed based on current data [^116H9VTM]. Earlier systematic reviews suggested short-course PPIs may reduce post-ligation ulcer size, but the clinical relevance of ulcer size reduction without hard outcomes remains uncertain, reinforcing caution about prolonged therapy [^114JERvP].

> Now, I should review the risks, and I need to ensure I separate signal from noise. Multiple observational datasets link PPI exposure in cirrhosis to higher risks of SBP, with pooled estimates around a 2-fold increase, and this persists after adjusting for gastrointestinal bleeding in several large cohorts, though causality cannot be established from retrospective designs [^1136scoC] [^111zG4qE] [^112nYyAF]. PPI use is also associated with higher risks of pneumonia, with meta-analytic risk ratios near 1.36, and with Clostridioides difficile infection, both of which carry substantial morbidity in cirrhosis [^1145sj6i] [^116AUPoB]. Mechanistically, PPIs may promote small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, oralization of the gut microbiome, and bacterial translocation, which plausibly increase SBP and encephalopathy risk, and withdrawal of PPIs reduces oral-origin taxa in decompensated cirrhosis, supporting a biologically coherent harm pathway [^113e5ruP] [^112kWVH9]. I should also confirm hepatic encephalopathy data; observational cohorts link PPI use to minimal and overt encephalopathy and worse survival, again with confounding concerns but consistent across studies [^114uGApm] [^1149zDdA]. Finally, long-term PPI use is associated with hypomagnesemia, which can aggravate arrhythmias and neuromuscular complications in cirrhosis, warranting periodic monitoring when PPIs are necessary [^113wUasy] [^115zw24j].

> But wait, what if the apparent harm is just confounding by sicker patients getting PPIs? I should double-check this. The ATTIRE post hoc analysis illustrates profound confounding by indication, where PPI users had fundamentally different phenotypes and far higher severity, precluding valid propensity matching and highlighting why observational associations must be interpreted cautiously; importantly, baseline PPI use was not associated with infection or mortality after adjustment attempts, though IV PPI correlated with severe encephalopathy and high mortality, likely reflecting indication bias rather than a direct causal effect of the drug itself [^112ZiRTG]. Conversely, a large VA time-updating analysis found that cumulative PPI exposure was associated with more infections and decompensation and higher liver-related mortality in patients without recent GIB, whereas PPI use was associated with lower all-cause mortality in those hospitalized for GIB, again suggesting that indication and timing drive much of the observed association [^115gsEYy]. Let me reconsider the microbiome literature as well; while PPIs alter the gut microbiome and oralization correlates with adverse outcomes, some work suggests PPI status does not fundamentally change cirrhosis microbiome signatures, indicating that disease severity and other medications may be the dominant drivers in many cohorts [^116eTvVB] [^112pXqrv].

> Next, I should review the acute variceal bleeding context and make sure I don't conflate nonvariceal with variceal care. Guidelines prioritize vasoactive agents, antibiotics, and timely endoscopic therapy for acute variceal bleeding. Routine pre-endoscopy PPIs do not improve mortality or rebleeding and are not recommended by NICE, whereas PPIs remain central for nonvariceal peptic ulcer bleeding, where high-dose acid suppression reduces rebleeding and need for intervention [^111GTgkQ]. In critically ill ACLF patients with portal hypertensive bleeding, some ICU guidance issues a strong recommendation for PPIs based on meta-analyses showing reduced rebleeding without mortality benefit, but this is low-quality evidence and should be contextualized within ICU stress ulcer prophylaxis practices and individualized risk assessment [^114UhA4F]. I should confirm that deprescribing initiatives in cirrhosis show fewer ascites and encephalopathy events after PPI cessation, supporting a policy of minimizing exposure when no valid indication exists, albeit with high restart rates necessitating symptom-control strategies [^117BA27n].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach, and I will verify each branch against guidelines. For patients with clear acid-related indications such as symptomatic GERD, erosive esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, or need for ulcer prophylaxis with antithrombotics, PPIs are appropriate, but I should prefer the lowest effective dose, reassess frequently, and consider H2 receptor antagonists as alternatives when feasible, especially for dyspeptic symptoms or GERD maintenance after initial PPI control [^115KGyoH] [^112xR2qe]. For primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding, I need to ensure we avoid PPIs and instead use nonselective beta-blockers or EVL as indicated, since acid suppression does not modify portal hemodynamics or prevent variceal rupture [^111geD9N]. For secondary prophylaxis after variceal hemorrhage, the cornerstone remains NSBB plus EVL; if PPIs are considered after EVL, any use should be short and tied to a specific acid-related indication rather than routine prophylaxis, given the absence of robust RCT benefit and potential harms [^114PiPYW] [^116H9VTM]. In acute variceal bleeding, I should prioritize vasoactives, antibiotics, and endoscopy and avoid reflex PPI initiation unless there is concurrent nonvariceal ulcer disease or a separate acid-related indication, aligning with BSG and NICE positions [^114PiPYW] [^111GTgkQ]. In decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF, I should actively deprescribe PPIs without a current indication to reduce infection risk and document the rationale clearly in the chart [^113KYxRN] [^115izFV7].

> I should confirm a deprescribing protocol and follow-up plan. Per AGA guidance, I will assess the ongoing indication at every visit, consider tapering or abrupt discontinuation based on symptom profile, and avoid stopping PPIs when there are compelling indications such as severe erosive esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, esophageal stricture, or eosinophilic esophagitis, while offering H2RAs or on-demand therapy for residual symptoms and documenting the indication and date of reassessment [^116mRu8j] [^111niNyf] [^114t5fhj]. Let me verify the monitoring: when PPIs are continued, I should check for hypomagnesemia periodically and remain vigilant for infection, encephalopathy, and C. difficile, especially in decompensated patients, adjusting therapy promptly if these emerge [^113wUasy] [^116AUPoB]. I need to ensure the care team addresses symptom drivers of inappropriate PPI use, such as functional dyspepsia and anxiety, with nonpharmacologic and non-PPI pharmacologic strategies to reduce unnecessary acid suppression [^notfound].

> Finally, I should state the bottom line and make sure it aligns with the weight of evidence. Routine or prophylactic PPI use in cirrhosis is not supported and may be harmful. Reserve PPIs for clear acid-related indications, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, avoid use for variceal bleeding prophylaxis or as part of standard AVB management, and implement systematic deprescribing with close follow-up, recognizing that much of the harm signal is observational and confounded but biologically plausible and consistent enough to warrant caution in this high-risk population [^115KGyoH] [^1116Sdbm] [^111geD9N] [^114PiPYW] [^115gsEYy].

---

PPIs in cirrhosis should be used only for **clear indications** (active peptic ulcer disease, severe GERD, or short-term post-EBL ulcer healing) and avoided for routine use because of increased risks of SBP, C. difficile, pneumonia, and hepatic encephalopathy [^1116Sdbm] [^115KGyoH] [^114uGApm]. They do not prevent variceal bleeding and are not recommended for primary or secondary prophylaxis [^111geD9N] [^114hVor5]. If a PPI is needed, use the **lowest effective dose and duration**, monitor for infections and electrolyte disturbances, and consider H2RAs or on-demand therapy when appropriate [^112xR2qe] [^113wUasy] [^115Snmg4].

---

## Indications for PPI use in cirrhosis

PPIs are indicated in cirrhosis **only for clear, evidence-based reasons**:

- **Active peptic ulcer disease**: PPIs are indicated for healing peptic ulcers, including NSAID-associated ulcers [^notfound].

- **Severe GERD or erosive esophagitis**: PPIs are indicated for severe GERD or erosive esophagitis, particularly when H2RAs are ineffective [^115KGyoH].

- **Short-term use post-EBL**: Short-term PPIs (≤ 10 days) may be used after esophageal variceal band ligation to promote ulcer healing, though evidence is limited and mixed [^114JERvP] [^116H9VTM].

---

## Risks associated with PPI use in cirrhosis

PPI use in cirrhosis is associated with **significant risks**:

| **Risk** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|
| Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) | Multiple studies and meta-analyses show a 2–3-fold increased risk of SBP with PPI use [^1155S9N7] [^1136scoC] [^111zG4qE] |
| Clostridioides difficile infection | PPIs increase the risk of C. difficile infection, which carries high morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis [^116AUPoB] [^116fewTT] |
| Pneumonia | PPIs are associated with a 1.3–1.4-fold increased risk of pneumonia in cirrhosis [^113nbcjv] [^112Cjh63] |
| Hepatic encephalopathy | PPIs are linked to increased risk of overt and minimal hepatic encephalopathy, likely via bacterial overgrowth and translocation [^114uGApm] [^1149zDdA] |
| Electrolyte disturbances | Long-term PPI use can cause hypomagnesemia and other electrolyte abnormalities, which are common in cirrhosis [^113wUasy] [^115zw24j] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **advise against routine PPI use** in cirrhosis:

- **Primary prophylaxis**: PPIs are not recommended for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^111geD9N].

- **Secondary prophylaxis**: PPIs are not recommended for secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding [^114hVor5].

- **Acute variceal bleeding**: PPIs are not recommended for acute variceal bleeding unless there is a clear acid-related indication [^114PiPYW].

- **General use**: PPIs should be restricted to patients with clear indications, as they increase infection risk [^1116Sdbm] [^113izzaL].

---

## Clinical scenarios where PPIs may be beneficial

PPIs may be beneficial in specific, **limited scenarios**:

- **Short-term use post-EBL**: Short-term PPIs may aid ulcer healing after band ligation, though evidence is mixed and not definitive [^114JERvP] [^116H9VTM].

- **Severe GERD or peptic ulcer disease**: PPIs are effective for severe GERD or peptic ulcer disease when H2RAs are inadequate [^115KGyoH] [^111niNyf].

---

## Alternative therapies and strategies

To minimize PPI-related risks, **consider alternatives**:

- **H2 receptor antagonists**: H2RAs are effective for mild GERD and dyspepsia and have fewer infection risks than PPIs [^1136zuYf].

- **On-demand therapy**: Use PPIs only as needed for symptomatic relief, not continuous therapy [^115Snmg4].

- **Deprescribing**: Regularly reassess and discontinue unnecessary PPIs to reduce complications [^116mRu8j] [^117BA27n].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

When PPIs are necessary, **use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration**, monitor for infections (SBP, pneumonia, C. difficile), and check magnesium and other electrolytes with long-term use. Educate patients on risks and the importance of adherence to minimize complications [^113wUasy] [^115iFx3W].

---

PPIs in cirrhosis should be used only for **clear indications**, with careful monitoring and deprescribing to reduce infection, encephalopathy, and electrolyte risks.

AASLD practice guidance — Diagnosis and management of infection/sepsis in patients with cirrhosis/acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) outlines an algorithm beginning with immediate infection workup, including 2 sets of blood cultures, urinalysis, urine culture, chest x-ray, and paracentesis with bedside inoculation and cell count/differential; give the first dose of antibiotics immediately in the emergency room (ER) if there is concern for active infection or gastrointestinal bleed. Antibiotics are based on infection type and severity, local resistance patterns, and mode of acquisition, and to decrease nosocomial infections (diagnosed > 48 hours after admission) avoid proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use when possible and avoid Foley catheter use. A history of procedure, hospitalization, dialysis, or inpatient rehabilitation within last 90 days directs antibiotics tailored to healthcare associated infection; otherwise tailor to community acquired infection. Reassess for clinical improvement in 48 hours; if improved, de-escalate antibiotics when culture results return and complete the recommended treatment course, and if not improved, broaden antibiotics to cover multi-drug resistant organisms and reconsider fungal infections. A separate branch notes no infection with Rx other causes.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) safety — randomized trial outcomes: In a large placebo-controlled trial, "17,598 patients aged 65 years or older" with vascular disease were randomized to pantoprazole "(40 mg daily, n = 8,791) or placebo (n = 8,807)", with data collected "at 6-month intervals over a period of 3 years" to assess predefined adverse events. Investigators "found no significant differences between the PPI and placebo groups" for potential side effects "except for enteric infections (1.4% vs 1.0% in the PPI and placebo groups, respectively; OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01–1.75)", and "Pantoprazole for 3 years was not associated with any adverse event other than a modestly increased risk of developing enteric infections".

Objective

To evaluate the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) when they are used in patients with cirrhosis and ascites.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1966-May 2012) and Web of Science (1990-May 2012) with the terms proton pump inhibitor, antisecretory therapy, cirrhosis, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and Clostridium difficile. The search was restricted to articles published in English on the use of PPIs in humans. Reference citations from identified published articles were reviewed for relevant information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All articles in English identified from the data sources were evaluated for inclusion. One case series, 8 retrospective case-control trials, and 1 meta-analysis were identified.

Data Synthesis

Cirrhosis may cause complications such as portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and ascites. Patients may be prescribed PPIs without clear indications or because of their propensity to develop upper gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding. However, gastric acidity is a major nonspecific defense mechanism and there is insufficient evidence on the need for chronic acid suppression in patients with cirrhosis. It is postulated that the portal hypertensive environment in cirrhosis and the acid suppression from PPIs can increase the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and C. difficile infection in patients with cirrhosis with ascites. Several retrospective studies and 1 meta-analysis have confirmed this association.

Conclusions

Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should be monitored carefully while on PPIs for a possible increased risk of infection from spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and C. difficile. Prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm this association. Clinicians should be aware of this lesser known adverse effect of PPIs.

### Editorial: Clostridium difficile infection: yet another predictor of poor outcome in cirrhosis [^116AUPoB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The development of Clostridium difficile infection in cirrhosis is predictive of death, independent of severity of liver disease. The main risk factors are the use of antibiotics and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). This is further evidence that supports the wise and cautious use of antibiotics in cirrhosis and suggests avoiding the use of PPIs in these patients except for indications of proven benefit.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1145sj6i]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed for cirrhotic patients. However, the use of PPIs in these patients may increase the risk of bacterial infection. The current study aimed to investigate the risk of developing pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPIs.

Methods

A literature search was independently conducted by 2 investigators using the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to September 2019. To be eligible, a study had to be an observational (cohort, case-control or cross-sectional) study that included one group of cirrhotic patients with PPI use and another group of cirrhotic patients without PPI use. Effect estimates of the association between PPI use and pneumonia had to be reported. Point estimates and standard errors from each eligible study were combined together using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.

Results

Of 1947 articles identified from the 2 databases, 3 cohort and 5 cross-sectional studies with 40,295 participants met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis found that cirrhotic patients with a history of PPI use had a significantly higher risk of developing pneumonia than those without PPI use, with a pooled risk ratio of 1.36 (95% confidence interval 1.00–1.85; I 2 47%).

Conclusion

A significantly increased risk of pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPIs was demonstrated in this study.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^1116Sdbm]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of SBP, medications to avoid, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to restrict the use of PPIs to patients with a clear indication, since they may increase the risk of SBP in patients with prior SBP.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^114xdFS9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

To date, this is the largest cohort to examine the prevalence of SBP among cirrhotic patients in the US. PPI use and hepatic encephalopathy were associated with the highest risks for developing SBP independently of GIB. The results of this study are in line with previous ones and can prepare the ground for implementing judicious PPI use in future recommendations for cirrhotic patients.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Decompensation of liver disease is a distinct characteristic of cirrhosis
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a widely-used class of medication, as about 50 million people in the United Stated (US) are on PPIs
Scattered evidence in the literature suggests a potentially higher risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients on PPIs, compared to those not on PPIs

What the new findings are:

The use of PPIs in the US is highly prevalent, reaching 12.00% in our cohort
In the US, the incidence of SBP in patients on PPIs is 2500 per 100,000 individuals
The use of PPIs is an independent risk factor for the development of SBP in cirrhotic patients

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of variceal hemorrhage, TIPS, AASLD 2017 guidelines recommend to perform TIPS placement as the treatment of choice in the control of bleeding from cardiofundal varices (type 2 gastroesophageal varices or type 1 isolated gastric varices).

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^115Ux9xP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the fact that PPIs are an over-the-counter medication, they are easily prescribed and dispensed, commonly used and very well marketed, especially in the US. Analyses from the database showed that 12.5% of the US population recruited over the last 20 years were on PPIs. Misuse of PPIs is particularly common in cirrhotic patients, with 47% taking PPIs without any formal indication. The prevalence of PPI use among SBP patients was 77.86%, in line with previous results. However, the calculated 1-year incidence of developing SBP in cirrhotic patients on PPIs was 2.5%. This is an alarmingly high number compared to the incidence of developing SBP among cirrhotic patients. A national study in Taiwan defined the 1-year incidence of SBP to be around 0.1% (124.8/100,000).

### Does long-term use of proton pump inhibitors cause hypomagnesaemia in Japanese outpatients? [^113wUasy]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2014). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PPIs are frequently used in everyday medical practice. PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia may be life threatening in some patients. Some patients with PPI-induced hypomagnesaemia are asymptomatic, and this may be overlooked because of lack of information. Thus, we recommend that serum magnesium concentrations be measured periodically in outpatients receiving long-term PPI treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show an association between long-term PPI treatment and hypomagnesaemia in patients with cirrhosis. It is necessary to recognise the possibility of hypomagnesaemia when treating cirrhosis patients with PPIs.

Table 3
Serum magnesium concentrations in patients receiving three types of PPIs

Linear regression analysis for each patient characteristic, with use or non-use of a PPI as an explanatory variable and serum magnesium concentration as a response variable, showed that the latter differed significantly in patients with and without liver cirrhosis and with and without PPI use (table 4). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that both of these factors were significantly predictive of magnesium concentration (table 5). Serum magnesium concentration was significantly lower in patients with and without cirrhosis (1.82 ± 0.22 vs 1.91 ± 0.19 mg/dL, p < 0.01; figure 2). Among patients with cirrhosis, long-term PPI users had significantly lower serum magnesium level than PPI non-users (1.78 ± 0.22 vs 1.87 ± 0.22 mg/dL, p = 0.03). Although among the non-cirrhosis patients, long-term PPI users did not have significantly lower serum magnesium levels than PPI non-users (1.89 ± 0.20 vs 1.92 ± 0.18 mg/dL).

### An emulated clinical trial of deprescribing proton pump inhibitors in patients with cirrhosis [^117BA27n]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are overused and carry harms in cirrhosis. Deprescribing is advocated but has not been trialed.

Methods and Findings

We emulated a clinical trial using Medicare data. All patients were receiving chronic PPI therapy before a compensated cirrhosis diagnosis. We compared the risk death/decompensation over 3 years between continuous users and deprescribers. We find that PPI deprescription is associated with less ascites and that cumulative PPI use is associated with more ascites and encephalopathy. Ultimately, 71% of deprescribers restart PPIs.

Discussion

PPI deprescribing has benefits but requires ongoing support and alternative therapies for gastrointestinal symptoms.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Cirrhosis — proton pump inhibitors (PPI): In patients with cirrhosis, we suggest avoiding PPI unless there is a clear indication, such as symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux or healing of erosive esophagitis or an ulcer, because PPI use increases the risk of infection (very low quality, conditional recommendation). PPIs have been shown to increase the rate of infections in patients with cirrhosis.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Table 1 — Recommendations on medications and prophylaxis for infection in cirrhosis state that in patients with cirrhosis with a history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), we suggest use of antibiotics for secondary SBP prophylaxis to prevent recurrent SBP. In patients with cirrhosis in need of primary SBP prophylaxis, we suggest daily prophylactic antibiotics, although no one specific regimen is superior to another, to prevent SBP. In patients with cirrhosis, we suggest avoiding proton pump inhibitor (PPI) unless there is a clear indication because PPI increases the risk of infection.

### Proton pump inhibitors are associated with minimal and overt hepatic encephalopathy and increased mortality in patients with cirrhosis [^114uGApm]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a subclinical cognitive impairment frequently observable in patients with cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can contribute to small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, but no study has investigated the link between PPIs and MHE. We investigated the relationship between MHE and PPI use as well as the role of PPI use in the development of overt HE and survival. Consecutive patients with cirrhosis (n = 310) were included in the study and followed up for 14.1 ± 12.3 months. At entry, MHE was diagnosed when the Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score was ≤ -4. Data were analyzed by logistic regression for the factors associated with MHE and by time-related models for overt HE development and survival. At inclusion, 131 out of 310 patients with cirrhosis (42%) were affected by MHE. One hundred and twenty-five patients (40%) were using PPIs. The variables independently associated with the presence of MHE were PPI use, previous overt HE, low albumin, low sodium, and age. During follow-up, the development of overt HE was higher (64% versus 25%, P < 0.001) and overall survival lower (41% versus 81%, P < 0.001) in PPI users than in nonusers. Variables independently associated with the development of overt HE were PPIs, history of overt HE, low albumin, MHE, and age, while variables independently associated with mortality were PPIs, development of overt HE, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, low sodium, and age. Conclusion: The study identifies a potentially removable factor associated with the presence of MHE and related to the development of overt HE and survival in patients with liver cirrhosis.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^116NZUNR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In light of our findings and since the safety profile of PPIs still needs to be clearly defined, close surveillance for PPI use should be warranted in clinical practice settings. Current recommendations should lean towards limiting the prescription of PPIs unless medically indicated. This recommendation applies to the general population and to cirrhotic patients in particular, given their higher risk of decompensating to SBP.

This study had several limitations, starting with its retrospective nature. Prospective studies with prolonged patient follow up allow the establishment of a higher level of evidence. In addition, although the database used is longitudinal, our study looked at the use of PPIs as a whole, without assessing their time-sensitive nature (such as the date of initiation and duration of the course), or their cumulative effect. These limitations could affect the outcome measured and should be taken into consideration to help further understand and quantify the association between PPI use and the emergence of SBP, as clearly displayed in the study by Chang et al. Another significant limitation is the lack of information in the database about the Child-Pugh and model for end-stage liver disease scores of the patients in the population included. Since the risk of SBP is higher in individuals with severe liver disease, it would be interesting for further prospective studies to stratify the population at risk of developing SBP according to their liver disease severity. Moreover, the database used does not offer any information regarding previous episodes of SBP, and a previous history of the latter is a significant risk factor in the development of a subsequent SBP episode. Despite all these limitations, the strength of this study lies within the database itself. This cohort is the largest to assess the association between PPI use and SBP occurrence in the US and worldwide. Since it is a population-based study, it provides comprehensive coverage of hospital admissions, and thus its results can be generalized to cirrhotic patients overall in the US. Additionally, the large sample size allowed us to better account for all possible confounders and to perform many subgroup analyses.

### Deprescribing proton pump inhibitors: evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^115Snmg4]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de Famille Canadien (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for deprescribing proton pump inhibitors, more specifically with respect to considerations for discontinuation, CFPC 2017 guidelines recommend to decrease the daily dose or discontinue PPIs and change to on-demand (as needed) use in adult patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms completed a minimum 4-week course of PPI treatment, resulting in resolution of upper gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Proton-pump inhibitor vs. H2-receptor blocker use and overall risk of CKD progression [^111oawsk]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Association between PPI use and all-cause mortality is difficult to interpret due to the large variance in patients studied to date. PPI use has been associated with increased mortality in cancer patients, liver cirrhotics, and those requiring artificial nutrition. However, these patient cohorts are dissimilar to the CKD population, and thus of limited use in determining true risk. Of the studies that more closely resemble our patient cohort, there are some that also suggest increased mortality in patients using PPIs. Xie and colleagues showed a small excess of cause specific mortality due to cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney, disease, and upper gastrointestinal cancer in patients taking PPIs. In addition, another cohort study determined increased risk of overall mortality with PPI use in kidney transplant recipients with average eGFR of 52. These findings are in contrast with the results from Grant's study which looked at the CKD population specifically and found no association between PPI use and increased mortality. Overall, the reports to date have major limitations including the observational nature of the studies and the degree of illness in the cohorts analyzed. Our study could find no association between PPI use and overall mortality when assessing patients with pre-established CKD.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^113aLcz4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Based on the previous literature, old age, female sex, hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and variceal bleeding are already established risk factors for SBP. These risk factors were accounted for in our univariate multivariate analyses. As previously higlighted in the literature, the use of β-blockers is protective against the devlopment of SBP. However, the results obtained from our statistical analysis were not consistent with the literature. Since we did not incoporate liver disease severity in our model, this association was probably due to the fact that patients on β-blockers already had more advanced cirrhosis than those not on the medication and thus were naturally more prone to develop SBP later on.

Documented side-effects of long-term use of PPIs include Clostridioides difficile infection, and nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia. Recently, there has been a growing body of evidence regarding the use of PPIs and its association with the development of SBP in cirrhotic patients. Going back to the physiopathology of cirrhosis and SBP, PPIs and liver dysfunction share a similar mechanism regarding immune dysfunction. Previous research has shown that PPI use can inhibit phagocytosis, impair oxidative burst and promote bacterial translocation, leading to higher risks of bacterial infections including SBP; however, clinical findings on this topic remain controversial. This not only hampers the possibility of establishing clear recommendations, but also highlights the need for larger, population-based studies to confirm this association. On the one hand, some previous studies found no association between the use of PPIs and the development of SBP. However, these studies were conducted on smaller samples, defined exposures and outcomes differently, or did not consider appropriate confounders. On the other hand, an increasing number of publications have identified a positive association, with most of these publications displaying higher levels of evidence. All these studies reported an approximate 2-fold risk of developing SBP, similar to our results. Mandorfer et al showed that variceal bleeding is much more frequent among PPI users. In our model, to address possible confounding bias, we accounted for GIB when comparing SBP by PPI use, and the results obtained were still significant after this adjustment (OR 1.81, 95% CI = 1.72–1.90; P < 0.001). Correcting for appropriate confounders strengthens the validity of our results.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^112Cfjev]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

AASLD — nausea and vomiting management in cirrhosis outlines nonpharmacological and pharmacological options. Nonpharmacological approaches can include behavioral avoidance, removal of triggering medications, treatment of underlying physiological causes, use of ginger, guided imagery or relaxation techniques, and acupuncture. First-line pharmacotherapy for nausea and vomiting in patients with cirrhosis may include a trial of a histamine H2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor in patients with suspected reflux-associated nausea. Ondansetron can be used in patients with liver impairment at a dose of up to 8 mg/d, with monitoring for constipation and QT prolongation. In a small RCT in cirrhosis with mild encephalopathy, metoclopramide (up to 60 mg daily) versus placebo was studied over a period of 2 weeks; although metoclopramide reduced nausea and heartburn, extrapyramidal side effects limit long-term use and a 50% dose reduction is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Other options include olanzapine, haloperidol, or prochlorperazine, but prochlorperazine should be avoided in jaundice given case reports of cholestatic liver injury.

### Sepsis in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation: new trends and management [^114C9Pno]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Bacterial infections are more frequent and severe in patients with advanced liver disease and, therefore, in liver transplant candidates. The increased risk of infection in these patients parallels the severity of the immune dysfunction associated with cirrhosis, which is related to systemic inflammation and progressive immunodeficiency. Other factors contribute to this risk, such as genetic polymorphisms, proton pump inhibitor overuse, the numerous invasive procedures and hospitalizations these patients go through, or the immunosuppressive effects of malnutrition or alcohol abuse. Bacterial infections have a great impact on disease progression and significantly increase mortality rates before and after liver transplantation. Mechanisms leading to organ failure in sepsis are associated not only with the hemodynamic derangement but also with an excessive inflammatory response triggered by infection. Furthermore, prophylactic and empirical antibiotic treatment strategies in patients with cirrhosis are being modified according to the growing prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the past decade. Also, new criteria have been introduced for the diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock. These new definitions have been validated in patients with cirrhosis and show a better accuracy to predict in-hospital mortality than previous criteria based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Accurate prophylaxis and early identification and treatment of bacterial infections are key to reducing the burden of sepsis in patients with cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation.

### Reevaluating the role of proton pump inhibitors after endoscopic band ligation of esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116H9VTM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The benefit of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in improving outcomes after endoscopic band ligation (EBL) of esophageal varices in cirrhosis remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate whether PPI use reduces bleeding and mortality after EBL compared to non-use.

Methods

Major databases were systematically searched until January 2025. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing PPI use versus non-use following EBL of esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis were included. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Relative risks (RRs), odds ratios (ORs), or standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for outcomes.

Results

Eleven studies (4 RCTs and 7 observational) comprising 7,459 patients with cirrhosis undergoing EBL were included. In pooled unadjusted analyses, PPI use was associated with reduced post-EBL bleeding (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.92; I2 = 29.6%) and all-cause mortality (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24–0.97; I2 = 0.0%). More rigorous analyses showed no benefit: adjusted observational data for post-EBL bleeding and RCT data for post-EBL bleeding and all-cause mortality were not significant (p > 0.05). Similarly, for the mechanistic outcome of post-EBL ulcer bleeding, RCT data showed no statistically significant effect (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.25–1.16; I2 = 0.0%). Trial Sequential Analysis confirmed the cumulative RCT evidence for bleeding is underpowered.

Discussion

Current evidence is insufficient to support routine PPI use after EBL. RCT data remains underpowered and inconclusive, emphasizing the need for adequately powered trials.

### Bleeding' downhill'esophageal varices associated with benign superior vena cava obstruction: case report and literature review [^1144G7DL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Providers should be vigilant for bleeding "downhill" varices in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and clinical evidence of SVC obstruction because the pathophysiology of this disorder mandates a unique management compared to esophageal varices occurring in the usual setting of portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Though data is lacking, traditional medical management would be unlikely to be of benefit in this population. Octreotide, as a splanchnic dilator would not decrease the pressure in "downhill" varices as they do not communicate directly with the portal system. Proton pump inhibitors would be unlikely to play a role as the upper esophagus is less likely to be influenced by gastric pH. The current literature only provides guidance for therapy by means of case reports and while firm recommendations cannot be made as to ideal therapy in this patient population, several methods of temporization seem to have been successful in halting bleeding until definitive decompression of the affected vessels can be performed. Further investigation is required to determine why benign, as opposed to malignant, causes of SVC obstruction result in bleeding from downhill varices at such a high rate, despite being a less common etiology of SVC obstruction in the general population.

### Bacterial load and cytokine profile in patients with cirrhosis following therapy with proton pump inhibitors: a prospective cohort study [^111QTxMx]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis is associated with a type of immune dysfunction referred to as cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction syndrome. Altered small bowel motility, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal permeability lead to increased bacterial translocation and gut-related infections. Bacterial infections influence hemodynamics and coagulation status and represent one of the most important reasons for the progression of liver failure, development of liver-related complications and mortality in patients with cirrhosis.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used in patients with cirrhosis because of the frequently observed mucosal abnormalities following screening endoscopy and their use as prophylaxis for bleeding from post-banding esophageal ulcers. Although there are data to suggest that PPIs increase the risk of infection, this positive association is not universal. In a study of 607 consecutive patients with cirrhosis undergoing their first paracentesis at a tertiary center, the authors observed no association between PPIs and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) or other infections, or mortality, suggesting that the severity of liver disease and other factors, rather than PPI treatment per se, may predispose to infectious complications. Lastly, in a recent large, multicenter, prospective study, which included 519 patients with decompensated cirrhosis, PPI therapy was not found to be associated with a higher risk of SBP.

The interpretation of the published data is difficult because most of the studies were retrospective, the use of PPIs was inappropriate in up to half of the patients, and the details about the duration of their administration before the diagnosis of the infection were unknown in many cases. We conducted this prospective study, in which we included patients with cirrhosis, with or without ascites, who underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and received "appropriate" treatment with PPIs, and we investigated the effect of PPIs on bacterial load and inflammatory cytokine production.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1155S9N7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI use in cirrhosis

Summary of the current evidence

PPI use in patients with liver cirrhosis must be very cautious since there is no evidence of benefit except for downgrading esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy or banding of esophageal varices. There is also some evidence that their use could be associated with development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

In clinical practice, PPI therapy is often used in cirrhotic patients, in the absence of acid-related disease, to prevent bleeding from hypertensive gastropathy. This approach is not evidence-based and therefore not justified, also taking into account that acid secretion is markedly reduced in these patients.

A systematic review, performed in 2008, was unable to find any randomized clinical trials on acid-lowering drugs in the prevention of esophago-gastric variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients. It is therefore not possible to establish whether these drugs are beneficial or harmful in this setting. It is worth mentioning, however, that PPI use is associated with a microbiota shift and functional changes in the distal gut of patients with compensated cirrhosis, an effect that could drive or aggravate the pre-existing small intestine bacterial overgrowth.

The only indication of PPIs, which is by the way weakly evidence-based, is the prevention and/or treatment of esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy or variceal band ligation. The best available evidence supports the short-term use (maximum 10 days) of PPIs to reduce ulcer size, provided spontaneous ulcer healing is a concern. Practices such as high dose infusion and prolonged use should be discouraged until evidence of benefit becomes available.

When prescribing PPIs to cirrhotics, the benefit-to-harm ratio must be carefully evaluated. Indeed, PPI therapy seems to be a risk factor for the onset of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. A meta-analysis showed that, compared to cirrhotic patients not receiving PPIs, those taking these drugs had an increased risk (N = 3815; OR = 3.15; 95% confidence interval, 2.09 − 4.74) of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, an effect more evident in case–control studies than in cohort studies. Another systematic review also found an increased overall risk of bacterial infections (OR = 1.98). A more recent case–control study discovered that PPI use in cirrhotic patients increases the risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy in a dose-dependent fashion. All these analyses were mainly based on retrospective studies. The only large, multicenter, prospective trial with PPIs dealt with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and found acid suppression not associated with an increased risk. Further studies are therefore needed to better clarify these clinically relevant issues.

### End-stage liver disease complications [^116KbAvV]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic liver disease causes significant morbidity and mortality because of any number of complications including hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH).

Recent Findings

Predictors of response to lactulose, probiotics, and L-ornithine-L-aspartate therapy in minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) have been reported. Although rifaximin was slightly more effective than lactulose in the maintenance of remission and decreased re-admission in patients with MHE, it was not as cost-effective as lactulose. Beta-blockade has been associated with paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction. Those who respond to nonselective beta-blockers have a predictable overall lower probability of developing ascites and HRS. Noradrenaline was as effective as terlipressin for the treatment of type 1 HRS and was less costly. Hemorrhagic ascites, defined as an ascitic fluid red blood cell (RBC) count of at least 10000/μl, appeared to be a marker for poor outcome in patients with cirrhosis. In patients with acute EVH, band ligation, pharmacologic vasoconstrictors, and antibiotics are effective; notably, intravenous proton pump inhibitor therapy in lieu of vasoconstrictors achieved similar hemostatic effects with fewer side-effects.

Summary

Refinement in the clinical management strategies for patients with cirrhosis and its complications appear to continue to contribute to improved patient outcomes.

### Proton pump inhibitor initiation and withdrawal affects gut microbiota and readmission risk in cirrhosis [^113e5ruP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Cirrhosis is associated with gut microbial dysbiosis, high readmissions and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) overuse, which could be inter-linked. Our aim was to determine the effect of PPI use, initiation and withdrawl on gut microbiota and readmissions in cirrhosis.

Methods

Four cohorts were enrolled. Readmissions study: Cirrhotic inpatients were followed throughout the hospitalization and 30/90-days post-discharge. PPI initiation, withdrawal/continuation patterns were analyzed between those with/without readmissions. Cross-sectional microbiota study: Cirrhotic outpatients and controls underwent stool microbiota analysis. Beneficial autochthonous and oral-origin taxa analysis vis-à-vis PPI use was performed. Longitudinal studies: Two cohorts of decompensated cirrhotic outpatients were enrolled. Patients on chronic unindicated PPI use were withdrawn for 14 days. Patients not on PPI were started on omeprazole for 14 days. Microbial analysis for oral-origin taxa was performed pre/post-intervention.

Results

Readmissions study: 343 inpatients (151 on admission PPI) were enrolled. 21 were withdrawn and 45 were initiated on PPI resulting in a PPI use increase of 21%. PPIs were associated with higher 30 (p = 0.002) and 90-day readmissions (p = 0.008) independent of comorbidities, medications, MELD and age. Cross-sectional microbiota: 137 cirrhotics (59 on PPI) and 45 controls (17 on PPI) were included. PPI users regardless of cirrhosis had higher oral-origin microbiota while cirrhotics on PPI had lower autochthonous taxa compared to the rest. Longitudinal studies: Fifteen decompensated cirrhotics tolerated omeprazole initiation with an increase in oral-origin microbial taxa compared to baseline. PPIs were withdrawn from an additional 15 outpatients, which resulted in a significant reduction of oral-origin taxa compared to baseline.

Conclusions

PPIs modulate readmission risk and microbiota composition in cirrhosis, which responds to withdrawal. The systematic withdrawal and judicious use of PPIs is needed from a clinical and microbiological perspective in decompensated cirrhosis.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^113qugjm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study identified apparent clinical and demographic factors independently associated with the development of SBP in cirrhotic patients. In particular, PPI use was associated with a significantly higher risk of progression to SBP. To our knowledge, this is the largest multicenter cohort ever to examine the association between PPI use and the development of SBP throughout the US and worldwide. The results of this study are generalizable and can be incorporated into future management guidelines for SBP patients.

Infection is a leading cause of mortality among cirrhotic patients, increasing it 4-fold. According to a recent study by Arvaniti et al, the occurrence of infection, even after its resolution, is indicative of the subsequent prognosis stage and must therefore be taken into consideration when classifying cirrhosis. SBP is the most frequently encountered infection in cirrhotic patients and is always associated with a poor prognosis. In terms of prevalence, the number varies with time and with the population in question. However, the numbers have plateaued within a range hovering around 10–30% for the past 2 decades, with the most recent systematic review pointing to a pooled prevalence of 17.12%. The prevalence in our population-based study fits within this range (18.36%), further validating the generalizability of the results. The first episode of SBP has a survival rate of 40%, with a recurrence rate reaching 70%, accounting for 4% of emergency department visits in the cirrhotic population. Acute kidney injury has been reported in about 33–50% of patients with SBP. Management strategies of SBP include prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotic use, intravenous albumin infusion, and control of the significant risk factors.

### Microbiota changes and intestinal microbiota transplantation in liver diseases and cirrhosis [^112kWVH9]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis demonstrate a global mucosal immune impairment, which is associated with altered gut microbiota composition and functionality. These changes progress along with the advancing degree of cirrhosis and can be linked with hepatic encephalopathy, infections and even prognostication independent of clinical biomarkers. Along with compositional changes, functional alterations to the microbiota, related to short-chain fatty acids, bioenergetics and bile acid metabolism, are also associated with cirrhosis progression and outcomes. Altering the functional and structural profile of the microbiota is partly achieved by medications used in patients with cirrhosis such as rifaximin, lactulose, proton pump inhibitors and other antibiotics. However, the role of faecal or intestinal microbiota transplantation is increasingly being recognised. Herein, we review the challenges, opportunities and road ahead for the appropriate and safe use of intestinal microbiota transplantation in liver disease.

### Nutritional consequences of long-term acid suppression; are they clinically important? [^112kiSgM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As acid suppression therapies with proton pump inhibitors are an extremely common practice for common acid-related diseases, there has been increased scrutiny on the safety of this class of therapy.

Recent Findings

There have been increasing reports of allegation of harm with the sustained use of proton pump inhibitors, in particular with potential adverse effects on vitamin and mineral absorption. This has prompted a number of product label changes directed by the US Food and Drug Administration, raising concerns for ongoing continued use among clinicians and patients.

Summary

This review highlights the most recent information around these controversies and provides evidence summaries to help guide care providers in their care plans as well as discussions with patients.

Risk of pneumonia among cirrhotic patients exposed to PPI

Cirrhotic patients with a history of PPI use had a significantly higher risk of developing pneumonia than those without PPI use, with a pooled RR of 1.36 (95%CI 1.00–1.85). The statistical heterogeneity was low, with an I 2 of 47%.

Subgroup analysis by study design showed an increased risk in both cohort and cross-sectional study subgroups, although the number of included studies was not large enough to demonstrate statistical significance (pooled RR 1.26, 95%CI 0.80–1.99, I 2 57%, for cohort studies; pooled RR 1.49, 95%CI 0.98–2.26, I 2 22%, for cross-sectional studies).

### Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1169R4eH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis accounts for approximately 1 million deaths annually. Common complications of liver cirrhosis include variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). In addition, cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk and poorer prognosis of several other types of bacterial infection, such as bacteremia, enterocolitis, skin and soft tissue infection, urinary tract infection, meningitis, and infective endocarditis. Cirrhosis-associated immune dysfunction is thought to be the key player in this increased risk.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are commonly prescribed for cirrhotic patients, although studies have shown that over half of PPI use was without valid indications, which may lead to an unnecessary increased incidence of several complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy, Clostridium difficile infection and SBP. The possible explanation for the increased likelihood of developing SBP among PPI users is that acid suppression facilitates bacterial overgrowth and translocation. The use of PPI may also lead to an increased risk of other types of organ-specific bacterial infection. In fact, studies have suggested an increased risk of bacterial pneumonia among cirrhotic patients who use PPIs, although the results are inconsistent. The current study aimed to further investigate this risk by identifying all available studies and summarizing their results together.

### The clinician's guide to proton-pump inhibitor discontinuation [^1131cXSG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is increasing concern among patients and health care providers about the associations between PPI use and a multitude of potential adverse outcomes. Therefore, clinicians need to have a rational approach both to identifying PPI users who may not have an ongoing indication for their use and on how to encourage discontinuation of unnecessary PPI use. In this paper, we will provide a detailed review of the specific indications where the benefits of ongoing PPI use is of questionable value and will review the evidence on how to maximize the likelihood of being able to successfully discontinue PPI use while minimizing symptom recurrence.

### Combining endoscopic variceal ligation and omeprazole sodium in treating upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage combined with liver cirrhosis [^116FaiZz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The etiology of cirrhosis is complex and varied. Hepatocytes undergo chronic diffuse necrosis in response to different pathogenic factors, which is replaced by pseudolobule formation and exhibits hepatic function impairment and portal hypertension. Esophageal and gastric varices can be caused by portal hypertension, which is a potentially life-threatening clinical symptom that requires rapid and effective treatment. Esophageal variceal hemorrhage is a common fatal complication in patients with cirrhosis. Despite advances in treatment, the mortality rate of patients with first esophageal variceal hemorrhage is still as high as 10–20%. If secondary prevention is not taken after the first bleeding, the risk of rebleeding within 1 year is as high as 60%, and the mortality rate of rebleeding is as high as 33%.

EVL represents the predominant endoscopic intervention for cirrhotic esophagogastric fundal varices. EVL is recognized for its safety and efficacy in achieving hemostasis due to its targeted action, swift hemostatic response, and minimal tissue trauma. Furthermore, it preserves hepatic function and has a negligible effect on hemodynamics, making it the preferred treatment modality for hemorrhagic variceal rupture in the esophagogastric fundus. EVL is not only a highly effective endoscopic therapy for the treatment of esophagogastric fundal varices in cirrhosis, but also a standard treatment modality for ruptured esophagogastric variceal bleeding. Despite the effective hemostatic properties of EVL, it merely occludes the blood flow of the ruptured varicose vein and fails to ameliorate perivenous submucosal collateral circulation and portal venous pressure. The perivenous and submucosal collateral vessels often compromise the ligated varicose vein, leading to recurrent hemorrhage and consequently a poor prognosis. Thus, adjunctive pharmacotherapy with EVL can enhance hemostatic efficacy, improve patient outcomes, and lower the incidence of post-EVL rebleeding. Previous meta-analyses have reported that EVL combined with medication can significantly improve the control of bleeding within 48 h in patients with esophageal and gastric varices rupture bleeding (OR = 2.94, P = 0.0008). Omeprazole is a lipid-soluble, weakly alkaline proton pump blocker that inhibits H+-K+-ATPase by binding to H + at the secretory tubules of gastric wall cells under highly acidic conditions. In addition, omeprazole specifically inhibited the secretory microtubules formed by the apical membrane of gastric wall cells, thus significantly raising the intragastric PH to above 6.0 in a short period of time. In the present study, the drug we used in combination with EVL was omeprazole sodium. The omeprazole group had significantly lower blood transfusion volume, hospitalization time, hemostasis time, and rebleeding rate compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Although the 24-h hemostasis rate was higher in the observation group than in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). We hypothesize that the reason for the lack of a statistical difference in 24-hour hemostasis rates between the two groups is that endoscopic variceal ligation alone already has relatively good hemostatic efficacy for esophageal variceal hemorrhage, and the sample size included in this study was not large enough to statistically demonstrate a difference between the two intervention groups.

### Inadequate use of proton-pump inhibitors in patients with liver cirrhosis [^11365gxo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Patients with liver cirrhosis have a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms. The use of antiacid therapy (AAT) in these patients is unexplored. We aimed to assess the use of AAT in cirrhotic patients.

Methods

A total of 128 consecutive cirrhotic patients were evaluated for the use of and indications for acid-suppressive agents. Upper endoscopy findings and concomitant medications were registered. A validated questionnaire was used to measure the gastrointestinal symptom burden. Adequate indications for AAT were those strongly supported by the medical literature.

Results

Forty percent (n = 51) of patients with cirrhosis were on AAT. Thirty-seven percent (n = 19) of these had adequate and 63% (n = 32) inadequate indications for AAT. The major inadequate indication was previous variceal bleeding (34%). Patients with inadequate indications for AAT had increased severity of symptoms of indigestion compared with patients without AAT (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that inadequate use of AAT was independently related only to previous variceal bleeding and the number of concomitant medications.

Conclusion

AAT is used by a large proportion of patients with cirrhosis. In the majority, therapy is based on inadequate indications, mainly continuous long-term therapy after previous variceal bleeding. Patients with an inadequate indication for acid-suppressive medications have increased severity of symptoms of indigestion, indicating that gastrointestinal symptoms might be a factor contributing to proton-pump inhibitor consumption in these patients.

### Deprescribing proton pump inhibitors: evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^112xR2qe]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de Famille Canadien (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for deprescribing proton pump inhibitors, more specifically with respect to considerations for discontinuation, CFPC 2017 guidelines recommend to consider prescribing an H2RA as an alternative to PPIs in adult patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms completed a minimum 4-week course of PPI treatment, resulting in resolution of upper gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Inappropriate use of proton pump inhibitors in patients with liver cirrhosis: a cross-sectional study [^113y2sdi]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed for acid-related disorders; however, concerns have emerged regarding their misuse, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to assess the appropriateness of PPI prescriptions in patients with cirrhosis and to identify factors contributing to their overutilization in this patient population.

Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 1000 patients with cirrhosis receiving PPIs were enrolled. Data on demographics, clinical parameters, and endoscopic findings were collected, and indications for PPI therapy were assessed according to established guidelines.

Results

Among patients with cirrhosis, 60.5% were prescribed PPIs, with pantoprazole being the most prescribed (55.7%). Inappropriate PPI use was observed in 53.6% of the patients, mainly because of lacking an approved indication (78.54%) or exceeding the recommended treatment duration (21.46%). Causes contributing to misuse included prolonged PPI use postendoscopic band ligation (29.1%), extended treatment for functional dyspepsia (21.46%), failure to discontinue PPIs upon hospital discharge (17.54%), using PPIs for preventing portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG) or variceal bleeding (16.42%), and stress ulcer prophylaxis in non-ICU patients (15.86%). Multivariate analysis identified independent predictors of inappropriate PPI use, including Child classification C, Mayo End-Stage Liver Disease score greater than 18, hepatocellular carcinoma, and previous variceal bleeding, whereas hematemesis was identified as an independent predictor of appropriate use.

Conclusion

This study underscores the prevalent inappropriate prescription of PPIs in patients with liver cirrhosis, particularly in those with advanced liver disease or a history of variceal bleeding. Enhancing prescribing practices and adhering to evidence-based guidelines are essential to mitigate the risks associated with PPI misuse in patients with cirrhosis.

### Bacterial load and cytokine profile in patients with cirrhosis following therapy with proton pump inhibitors: a prospective cohort study [^112cv1Dj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The non-randomized design and the small sample size are limitations of this study. However, we prospectively followed our patients with or without ascites and we extensively investigated the presence of either an overt or a subclinical infection.

In conclusion, in this cohort, short-term PPI administration had no effect either on cytokine concentrations or bacterial load in patients with cirrhosis, suggesting that the "appropriate use" of PPIs is safe in this setting. However, larger studies with longer follow up are needed to confirm the safety of the long-term use of PPIs, especially in patients with advanced liver disease.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Bacterial infections influence hemodynamics and coagulation status and constitute one of the most important reasons for the progression of liver failure, development of liver-related complications and mortality in patients with cirrhosis
There are data suggesting that the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is associated with bacterial infections in patients with liver cirrhosis

What the new findings are:

There is a positive correlation between Model for End-stage Liver Disease score and baseline lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) levels in patients with liver cirrhosis
Short-term PPI administration does not affect the concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin -1, -6, -8 and -12p70, or the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β, or the levels of endotoxin, LBP and nitric oxide
Short-term PPI administration has no effect on the bacterial load of cirrhotic patients
There is no association between "appropriate" PPI treatment and the development of subclinical infection in cirrhotic patients

### Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Cjh63]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The current study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, publication bias was present in this systematic review and meta-analysis, as evidenced by the asymmetric funnel plot and positive Egger's regression test. Second, more than half of the studies included were cross-sectional in nature. Therefore, the causality of the observed association cannot be reliably established. Third, the majority of studies included in this meta-analysis did not adjust their results for potential confounders. Therefore, the observed association could be a result of a confounding effect rather than a true association. Fourth, none of the included studies specifically aimed to investigate the relationship between PPI use and the occurrence of pneumonia. Their primary objective was to investigate the relationship between PPI use and the occurrence of either SBP or overall infection. Therefore, the number of patients with pneumonia was relatively small. Finally, the dosing of PPIs varied considerably across the included studies, especially among cross-sectional studies.

In conclusion, the present systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated a significantly increased risk of pneumonia among cirrhotic patients with PPI use, although some limitations that may jeopardize the validity of the results were noted.

Summary Box

What is already known:

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed for cirrhotic patients
However, over half of PPI regimens are prescribed without valid indications
This increases the risk of several complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy, Clostridium difficile infection and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis

What the new findings are:

The pooled analysis found that cirrhotic patients with a history of PPI use had a significantly higher risk of developing pneumonia than those without PPI use
Based on the pooled analysis of 8 eligible studies, the risk was increased by 1.36 times
Possible mechanisms included decreased gastric acidity and intestinal bacterial overgrowth

### Use of proton pump inhibitors in the management of gastroesophageal varices: a systematic review [^114JERvP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in gastroesophageal varices (GEVs).

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1946 to September 2014), EMBASE (1974 to September 2014), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to September 2014), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1991 to September 2014), Google, and Google Scholar were searched using the following terms: esophageal varices, gastroesophageal varices, variceal hemorrhage, variceal bleeding, banding ligation, endoscopic variceal ligation, sclerotherapy, proton pump inhibitor, PPI, omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole, and esomeprazole.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Published and unpublished studies evaluating the clinical outcomes of PPI use for GEVs were included regardless of study design. Non-English and nonhuman studies were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Of 1156 studies, 20 were included after assessment. There was wide methodological heterogeneity and moderately high risk of bias among studies. Level I evidence suggests that PPIs reduce esophageal ulcer size post-elective esophageal ligation; the clinical importance of such findings is not known given the self-limiting nature of esophageal ulcer. Available evidence does not support a role of PPIs for long-term prophylaxis of portal hypertension-related bleeding and high-dose infusion for acute management of GEV hemorrhage. Retrospective data demonstrate a potential increase in the incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis receiving PPIs.

Conclusions

The best available evidence supports the use of short-course (10 days) PPI post-endoscopic variceal ligation to reduce ulcer size if ulcer healing is a concern. Practices such as high-dose infusion and prolonged use should be discouraged until evidence of benefit becomes available.

### Management of the major complications of cirrhosis: beyond guidelines [^111bSgeR]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Along with a growing understanding of the pathophysiology of cirrhosis and its complications, new therapies and management strategies have emerged in recent years. Many of these advances have helped inform the current EASL clinical practice guidelines 1 on the management of some of the key complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, variceal bleeding and infection. However, there are still some aspects of management where the evidence base is less clear, and/or where opinions amongst practitioners remain divided. Some of these more controversial areas are explored in this section, wherein we present evidence culminating in a suggested management approach based on expert opinion and extending beyond the current guidelines.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^112Vj7Py]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary prophylaxis

In patients who survive an episode of SBP, the cumulative recurrence rate at 1 year is approximately 70%. Probability of survival at 1 year after an episode of SBP is 30–50% and falls to 25–30% at 2 years. There is only one randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of norfloxacin (400 mg/day) in patients who had a previous episode of SBP; treatment reduced the probability of recurrence of SBP from 68% to 20%. A recent systematic review with meta-analysis concluded that rifaximin may be effective for both primary and secondary SBP prophylaxis compared with systemically absorbed antibiotics and compared with no intervention. However, additional prospective studies are required before a change in clinical practice can be recommended. It has been suggested that proton pump inhibitor use may increase the risk for the development of SBP and indications for long-term use should be carefully assessed.

We therefore recommend norfloxacin 400 mg once a day as secondary prophylaxis, although in view of limited availability in the UK, many centres use once daily ciprofloxacin 500 mg once a day as an alternative.

### Practice guidance for the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications [^116coG1v]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Guidance Statement 2. Terlipressin should be considered for the management of acute gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with liver cirrhosis before endoscopy, if gastroesophageal variceal rupture is suspected as the major source of bleeding.

Non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhotic patients is mainly secondary to peptic ulcer and gastric and duodenal mucosal erosion, and so on. Endoscopy is the golden diagnostic approach for the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. However, in real-world clinical practice, not all patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding can undergo emergency endoscopy, especially in primary hospitals lacking endoscopy equipment and experienced endoscopists. Real-world studies also showed that 60–80% of patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding could undergo endoscopy. Accordingly, the source of gastrointestinal bleeding was unclear in about 20% of patients. The first-line treatment for acute non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding is high-dose proton pump inhibitors, – but clinicians also immediately prescribe vasoactive drugs when the source of acute gastrointestinal bleeding is unknown in cirrhotic patients and then adjust their treatment strategy after endoscopy. This is primarily because the source of gastrointestinal bleeding is variceal in a majority of cirrhotic patients. In fact, in several well-designed clinical trials, vasoactive drugs were given before endoscopy in cirrhotic patients with acute gastrointestinal bleeding. – Taken together, terlipressin can be considered for the management of acute gastrointestinal bleeding when the source of bleeding is unknown or before endoscopy.

Materials and methods

Information sources and search strategy

A systematic literature review based on the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases was performed independently by 2 investigators (WW and NC) from inception to September 2019 to identify all published studies that examined the risk or association between pneumonia and PPI use in cirrhotic patients. The search strategy, which included the terms "proton pump inhibitors" and "cirrhosis", is available as. In addition, we manually reviewed the references of the eligible studies to identify any additional potential articles. This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.

Selection criteria

To be eligible, a study had to be an observational study (cohort, case-control or cross-sectional study) that included one group of cirrhotic patients with PPI use and another group of cirrhotic patients without PPI use.

Eligible cohort studies started with recruitment of cirrhotic patients who used and did not use PPIs and followed them for incident pneumonia. Relative risk (RR), incidence rate ratio (IRR), hazard risk ratio (HR) or standardized incidence ratio (SIR) with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) comparing the incidence of pneumonia between cirrhotic patients with and without PPI use had to be provided.
Eligible case-control studies started with recruitment of cases of cirrhotic patients with pneumonia and controls who were cirrhotic patients without pneumonia and explored their history of PPI use. Odds ratio (OR) with associated 95%CI comparing the prevalence of PPI use between cases versus controls had to be reported.
Eligible cross-sectional studies recruited cirrhotic patients and explored the history of PPI use and pneumonia at the same time. OR with associated 95%CI of this association had to be reported. No language limitation was applied during the systematic review.

Data extraction

We used a standardized data collection form to extract the following information: last name of the first author, country where the study was conducted, study design, year of publication, number of participants, recruitment of participants, how the diagnosis of pneumonia and ascertainment of PPI use were justified, follow-up period and duration (for cohort studies), baseline characteristics of participants, confounders adjusted in multivariate analysis and adjusted effect estimates with corresponding 95%CI. We appraised the quality of the included cohort and case-control studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. The modified version of this scale was used for cross-sectional studies.

### Proton pump inhibitors: the good, bad, and ugly [^112gFx5y]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) continue to be the medication of choice for treatment of acid-related disease, with few if any overt side effects seen with daily use. They are often prescribed empirically, often in high doses and with many patients being treated with multiple PPIs without an objective diagnosis. Therefore, they are believed to be overprescribed and used without indication. In this article we discuss the appropriate clinical indications for PPIs, review in detail the major associated adverse events, and put in perspective key issues in balancing benefits and risk of this exceptional (and safe) class of drug.

### Proton pump inhibitor therapy and its association with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis incidence and mortality: a meta-analysis [^1136scoC]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Previous meta-analyses reported proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is associated with increased incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in cirrhotic patients. However, this conclusion was based on case-control studies. Moreover, the association between PPI use and mortality of SBP has not yet been confirmed.

Aims

To evaluate the association between PPI use and SBP incidence and mortality using case-control and cohort studies.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Knowledge for relevant articles published up to January 2015. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

A total of 10 case-control and six cohort studies involving 8145 patients were analyzed. The overall analysis indicated that PPI use was associated with SBP (OR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.46–3.06). The association was limited in case-control studies (OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 2.06–4.26) but not in cohort studies (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.99–1.14). PPI therapy was not associated with mortality during hospitalization or within 30 days after SBP (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.92–2.59).

Conclusions

We could not establish causality that PPI use increases the incidence or mortality of SBP.

### Octreotide added to a proton pump inhibitor versus a proton pump inhibitor alone in nonvariceal upper-gastrointestinal bleeds [^115BaWxM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Literature indicating clinically relevant benefits of an adjunctive somatostatin analog to standard therapies in nonvariceal upper-gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB) is lacking. Objective: The primary objective of this study was to find the association between outcomes in patients with NVUGIB treated with octreotide and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI; combination group) compared with those treated with a PPI alone. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults admitted within a 5-hospital health care system with a NVUGIB treated with a PPI continuous infusion with or without an octreotide infusion. Notable exclusion criteria included varices, history of cirrhosis without endoscopy, or active gastrointestinal cancer. The primary outcome was association of combination treatment versus PPI alone with hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: A total of 180 patients were included (combination group: n = 90; PPI: n = 90). In univariate analyses, the median hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS in the combination group versus PPI was 6.1 versus 4.9 days (P = 0.25) and 2.3 versus 1.9 days (P = 0.24), and rebleeding and mortality occurred in 9% versus 12% (P = 0.63) and 6.7% versus 5.6% (P = 1.00) of patients. Median units of packed red blood cells in the combination therapy versus PPI group was 3 vs 2 units (P = 0.43). After propensity score adjustment in multivariable analyses, hospital and ICU LOS, rebleeding, and mortality all remained nonsignificant. Conclusion and Relevance: Our study observed no difference in clinical end points. This suggests that octreotide provides no additional major clinical benefit in NVUGIB, and PPI therapy alone may be sufficient.

### Evidence based probiotic therapy of proton pump inhibitor induced dysbiosis (EBP) [^111rAN39]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Overview With the emergence of high throughput sequencing techniques, researchers obtained the necessary tools to launch in-depth investigations into the structure and function of the intestinal microbiome. For the first time, it was possible to describe the influence of genetics, environment, nutrition and diseases on the microbiome and identify major determinants. One of the most prominent influencing factors on the composition of the microbiome is the use of proton pump inhibitors, in the general population as well as in chronic diseases, such as liver cirrhosis. In addition, PPI use creates less favorable conditions for typical gut commensals and reduces the microbial diversity in the intestine. These alterations in the microbiome can be linked to PPI side effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms and an increased risk for enteral infections.

In patients with liver cirrhosis, PPI-induced changes in the microbiome, namely Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella parvula
- two oral bacteria, are linked to intestinal inflammation and gut permeability and predict a higher risk of complications and a higher three-year liver related mortality. These are considerable risks that need to be weighed against the benefits of the therapy. Reduction of PPI use to cases with a clear indication is one important measure to reduce potential harm of the treatment. However, many patients require long-term treatment, e.g. for gastroesophageal reflux disease or to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding when drugs with a high risk of bleeding are used. Therefore, strategies to reduce oralization and thereby symptoms and negative consequences of PPI are necessary. However, this product was not able to efficiently reverse oralization.

Therefore, the investigators conducted a series of experiments, including direct and indirect pathogen inhibition tests to identify probiotic strains that are capable of inhibiting the growth of Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella parvula in vitro to design an evidence based probiotic mixture. The investigators screened 43 QPS certified probiotic strains and identified 5 strains as potential therapeutic agents to prevent/treat PPI induced oralization.
- **Received any of the following products/medication prior to screening**: systemic antibiotics, prokinetics, prebiotic supplements, probiotic supplements within 4 weeks prior to screening;
- Concomitant diseases or other circumstances that suggest that the patients are not eligible for participation in the study.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite PPIs carrying – like any other classes of drugs – some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some (if not all) safety concerns in order to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this Position Paper, we have reviewed the current available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. Summaries of the current evidence) and in Table 3.

Table 3
Current indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They do, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances. Despite guidelines being developed to improve quality of care received by patients, they have been criticized for recommending too little or too much, and even for providing reasons for national health systems or insurance payers to deny coverage. Guidelines are often inflexible and can actually harm by leaving insufficient room for clinicians to tailor care to individual patient circumstances and medical history. What is best for patients overall, as recommended by guidelines, may be inappropriate for individuals. Only evidence-based recommendations, which consider the balance between benefits and harms, and weigh these considerations using patient (rather than expert and societal) value, should be followed in everyday clinical practice. Taking these considerations into account, we have tried to distill the current evidence and provide physicians with clear patient-oriented recommendations, beyond cost and reimbursement issues. Medicine is a rapidly evolving field, however, and the validity of guidelines will not necessarily stand the test of time: indeed, today's assumptions may no longer be valid tomorrow. Healthcare providers should therefore stay tuned and constantly update their knowledge.

### Combining endoscopic variceal ligation and omeprazole sodium in treating upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage combined with liver cirrhosis [^111F49tW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The adjunctive use of PPIs in our protocol aligns with the findings of Hidaka et al. who demonstrated that long-term PPI administration significantly reduces rebleeding risk post-EVL by mitigating mucosal injury at non-ligation sites. PPIs may improve portal hemodynamics indirectly by (1) attenuating acid-induced mucosal inflammation, thereby reducing nitric oxide-mediated splanchnic vasodilation, and (2) enhancing mucosal repair to prevent collateral vessel formation, as evidenced in preclinical models. These mechanisms suggest that PPIs could stabilize microcirculatory networks, indirectly lowering portal pressure even in the absence of active bleeding.

Importantly, the hypothesis that PPIs alone might improve portal blood flow in non-bleeding cirrhotic patients warrants exploration. Preclinical data indicate that acid suppression reduces gut-derived endotoxin translocation, a driver of portal inflammation and fibrosis, potentially decelerating portal hypertension progression. However, clinical evidence remains limited. A 2010 retrospective study found no association between PPI use and reduced portal hypertension-related bleeding, while an ongoing randomized trial (STOPPIT) aims to evaluate the impact of PPI withdrawal on clinical outcomes in cirrhosis. Further studies are needed to delineate the context-dependent efficacy of PPIs in modulating portal flow.

### Use of proton pump inhibitors is associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in cirrhotic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118LNmo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

We utilized Review Manager 5.3 software from the Cochrane Collaboration (London, United Kingdom) to analyze all data. Point estimates and standard errors from each study were pooled together using the generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird, which assigns the weight of the study in reverse to its variance. A random-effect model, rather than a fixed-effect model, was used, as the assumption of the fixed-effect model that every study should give rise to the same result is not justified under almost all circumstances, especially in a meta-analysis of observational studies. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran's Q test, complimented by the I 2 statistic. This I 2 statistic quantifies the proportion of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. A value of I 2 of 0–25% represents insignificant heterogeneity, 26–50% represents low heterogeneity, 51–75% represents moderate heterogeneity, and 76% or higher represents high heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias was assessed by visualization of a funnel plot along with Egger's regression test. Egger's regression test was conducted using Comprehensive Meta-analysis 3.0 software (Englewood, New Jersey, United States).

### U.K. guidelines on the management of variceal haemorrhage in cirrhotic patients [^116fewTT]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors

A placebo-controlled randomised trial reported reduced bleeding and mortality with rabeprazole after eradication of varices. However, the study had a heterogeneous population with VBL performed for both primary and secondary prophylaxis and small numbers (n = 43), limiting the validity of the conclusions. Furthermore, there was no arm comparing proton pump inhibitors with NSBB. The use of proton pump inhibitors in patients with cirrhosis and ascites was associated with increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in a large retrospective study. This was not confirmed in a larger prospective non-randomised study. However, a recent prospective observational study has shown proton pump use to be associated with increased mortality in cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors are also associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection. There remains continuing concern about proton pump inhibitors in patients with cirrhosis, therefore caution should be used.

VBL has been compared with NSBB in 19 trials in a recent Cochrane meta-analysis of 1504 patients. Despite reduced bleeding (RR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.98) with VBL, there was no difference in overall mortality and bleeding-related mortality. The difference in bleeding was not seen when only trials with low selection or attrition bias were included. Banding can have serious complications. The risk of fatal banding-induced bleeding was highlighted in a meta-analysis showing reduced fatal adverse events with NSBB (OR = 0.14, 95% 0.02 to 0.99). The optimal timing of banding intervals is discussed in the section 'Secondary prophylaxis of variceal haemorrhage'. A randomised trial of 96 patients who underwent endoscopic surveillance at 6 or 3 months after eradication of varices with VBL did not demonstrate a difference in bleeding on mortality. However, the trial had a heterogeneous study group of patients who underwent VBL both for primary (65%) and secondary prevention (35%).

### The association between proton pump inhibitor exposure and key liver-related outcomes in patients with cirrhosis: a veterans affairs cohort study [^115gsEYy]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The impact of proton pump inhibitory (PPI) medications on adverse outcomes in cirrhosis remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the association between PPI exposure and all-cause mortality, infection, and decompensation in a large national cohort.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of patients with cirrhosis in the Veterans Health Administration. PPI exposure was classified as a time-updating variable from the index time of the cirrhosis diagnosis. Inverse probability treatment weighting-adjusted Cox regression was performed with additional adjustment for key time-varying covariates, including cardiovascular comorbidities, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and statin exposure.

Results

The study included 76,251 patients, 23,628 of whom were on a PPI at baseline. In adjusted models, binary (yes/no) PPI exposure was associated with reduced hazard of all-cause mortality in patients with hospitalization for GIB (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–0.91; P < .001) but had no significant association in all others (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.97–1.02; p = 0.58). However, cumulative PPI exposure was associated with increased mortality in patients without hospitalization for GIB (HR, 1.07 per 320 mg-months [omeprazole equivalents]; 95% CI, 1.06–1.08; P < .001). PPI exposure was significantly associated with severe infection (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.18–1.24; P < .001) and decompensation (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.61–1.68; P < .001). In a cause-specific mortality analysis, PPI exposure was associated with increased liver-related mortality (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19–1.28) but with decreased nonliver-related mortality (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85–0.91).

Conclusions

PPI exposure is associated with increased risk of infection and decompensation in cirrhosis, which may mediate liver-related mortality. However, PPI use was associated with reduced all-cause mortality in those with prior GIB, suggesting benefit in the presence of an appropriate indication.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^112nYyAF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent findings suggest that cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are at a higher risk for developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) than non-PPI users. We aimed to identify whether PPI use is an independent risk factor for the development of SBP among cirrhotic patients in the United States (US).

Methods

We enrolled a retrospective cohort using a validated multicenter database. Patients with a SNOMED-CT diagnosis of "cirrhosis" between 1999 and 2022 were identified. All patients below 18 years of age were excluded. We calculated the prevalence of individuals using PPIs in the total US population and in cirrhotic patients from 1999 to date, and the incidence of SBP in the past year. Finally, we constructed a multivariate regression model, controlling for multiple covariates.

Results

The final analysis included 377,420 patients. The 20-year-period prevalence of SBP in patients with cirrhosis was 3.54% and the prevalence of patients using PPIs in the US population was 12,000 per 100,000 people (12.00%). The 1-year incidence of SBP in cirrhotic patients using PPIs was 2500 per 100,000 people. After accounting for confounders, the risk of SBP was higher among males, patients with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, and those using β-blockers and PPIs.

Conclusions

To date, this is the largest cohort used to examine the prevalence of SBP among cirrhotic patients in the US. PPI use and hepatic encephalopathy offered the highest risk for the development of SBP, independently of gastrointestinal bleeding. Focusing on judicious PPI use should be encouraged among cirrhotic patients.

### Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding [^111GTgkQ]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors

Use of proton pump inhibitors before endoscopy might reduce the need for endoscopic treatment at index endoscopy, but does not improve more clinically relevant endpoints, therefore, use in this situation is not advocated by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. This advice is based on a meta-analysis of six studies comprising 2223 patients, which showed no significant reduction in mortality (odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.73), rebleeding (0.81, 0.61 to 1.09), or need for surgery (0.96, 0.68 to 1.35). Despite this guidance, the 2015 UK National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death report found that 150 (73%) of 206 patients had acid suppression started before definitive diagnosis, which was thought likely owing to clinicians' desires to start a specific treatment when managing a haemorrhage. European, Asian-Pacific, International, and US guidelines are not consistent on the use of proton pump inhibitors, with some suggesting that these compounds could have a role in the context of delayed endoscopy in consideration of relative costs of proton pump inhibitors and endotherapy.

### Bacterial load and cytokine profile in patients with cirrhosis following therapy with proton pump inhibitors: a prospective cohort study [^1147gfTD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis was diagnosed based upon histological findings, clinical evaluation, laboratory data or imaging findings compatible with a diagnosis of cirrhosis. The severity of liver disease was assessed by the Child-Pugh classification and the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) at baseline. In addition, routine clinical, biochemical and radiological analyses (abdominal ultrasound and/or computed tomography) were performed. The patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were abstinent for at least three months before their inclusion in this study. After baseline examination, patients were followed in the hepatology clinic at regular intervals according to current guidelines. The presence of bacterial DNA in serum and the levels of endotoxin, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL) -1β, -6, -8, -10, and -12p70, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and nitric oxide (NOx) were assessed at baseline (time 1) and at the end (time 2) of treatment with PPIs.

### Deleterious effect of proton pump inhibitors on the disease course of cirrhosis [^116wAGyo]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Proton pump inhibitors(PPIs) are widely prescribed to patients with liver cirrhosis. We hypothesized that long-standing PPI use is associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis(SBP) and accelerated development of disease-specific complications and liver-related death.

Methods

A 5-year follow-up observational cohort study assessed the impact of long-standing PPI use on the clinical course of cirrhosis in a large referral patient cohort. Three hundred fifty patients with cirrhosis (alcohol:69.1%, Child-Pugh stage A/B/C:206/108/36) were assigned to two groups: regular PPI users (n = 196) and nonusers (n = 154). Occurrence of SBP, decompensation events (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and variceal bleeding), and liver-related death were assessed.

Results

Regular PPI use was associated with an increased cumulative probability of SBP compared to nonusers [55% vs. 24.8%, hazard ratio(HR):4.25; P = 0.05], in patients without previous SBP episode (n = 84). A similar association was found between regular PPI use and decompensation events. The risk of the development of a first decompensation was higher in regular PPI users compared with nonusers, in patients with compensated clinical stage at enrollment (HR: 2.81, P = 0.008, n = 146). The risk of liver-related death was also significantly increased among regular PPI users (P < 0.001). In multivariate Cox-regression analysis, regular PPI use (HR:2.81, P = 0.003) and MELD score (HR:1.21, P < 0.001) was an independent predictor of mortality.

Conclusion

In the present follow-up cohort study, long-term PPI use was associated with the development of SBP and a progressive disease course in patients with cirrhosis that may have been caused by enhanced pathologic bacterial translocation, accelerated development of bacterial translocation-dependent disease-specific complications, and liver-related death.

### Combining endoscopic variceal ligation and omeprazole sodium in treating upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage combined with liver cirrhosis [^113zvSVK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current international guidelines, including the Baveno VII consensus, emphasize EVL combined with vasoactive agents and antibiotic prophylaxis as first-line therapy for acute variceal bleeding in cirrhosis, aiming to achieve rapid hemostasis and prevent rebleeding. Recent studies further highlight the role of adjuvant acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in reducing mucosal injury and improving portal hemodynamics, aligning with evolving strategies to optimize patient outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate whether the combination of EVL and omeprazole offers superior efficacy compared to EVL monotherapy in the treatment of esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.

### Authors' reply [^112Kctti]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

We thank Tziatzios et al for their interest in our study. While it would be ideal to include only studies that investigate the risk of pneumonia among proton pump inhibitor (PPI) users vs. non-users as the primary outcome with comprehensive adjustment into our meta-analysis, such data do not exist. As Voltaire once said, "the perfect is the enemy of the good"; we would rather have some data, albeit imperfect, to help guide clinical care than none.

We agree that between-study heterogeneity could theoretically be a concern in a meta-analysis of observational studies. However, for the current meta-analysis, all the included studies but one demonstrated a positive association between PPI use and risk of pneumonia, although most of them did not reach statistical significance, probably because of the small sample sizes. The results indicate that there is no major disagreement between studies, allowing for some differences in their methodology.

We believe that our systematic review was sufficiently comprehensive, as we followed the guidance from the Cochrane Collaboration that Medline and EMBASE databases should be searched. It should be noted that several major conference proceedings are indexed in EMBASE. Therefore, a high number of conference abstracts, a major kind of "gray" literature, are searchable from this database. In fact, 2 included studies were published as conference abstracts.

The P-value of less than or "equal" to 0.05 is conventionally considered significant and we stand by our interpretation. Nonetheless, we believe that clinical importance (i.e. effect size) should be the focus of the interpretation, not just statistical significance. The fact that PPI use is associated with a 36% increase in the risk of pneumonia among patients with cirrhosis should be worrisome enough for clinicians only to prescribe them when it is clinically indicated.

### Cirrhotic patients on proton pump inhibitors are at a twofold risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis independently of gastrointestinal bleeding: a population-based retrospective study [^115feZNS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cirrhosis is a well-known and prevalent chronic liver condition that has recently attracted interest from scientists seeking to research its economic and physical burden, as well as its mechanistic properties. Liver dysfunction in cirrhosis alters the immune system's humoral and cellular components and promotes bacterial translocations, making cirrhotic patients much more susceptible to infections and subsequently to decompensation. Bacterial infections are not only the most common complications seen among cirrhotic patients, but also the deadliest. The most renowned complications seen are spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and bacteremia. SBP refers to the infection of the peritoneal fluid (or ascites) in the absence of an apparent source of intra-abdominal infection. SBP increases the morbidity and mortality burden associated with the disease. Cirrhotic patients with SBP are more likely to progress to sepsis, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and hepatic encephalopathy.

The 1-year mortality rate of cirrhotic patients after infections has not changed significantly over the past decades, despite the tremendous advances in diagnosis and treatment. This underlines the need to find additional risk factors and implement better preventative strategies, rather than solely focusing on its treatment. Important known risk factors for SBP include upper GIB (prevented with β-blockers), previous episodes of SBP, a low concentration of ascitic protein (< 1.5 g/dL), alcohol consumption, and hepatitis B and C. Targeting these factors and looking for others remain key and cost-effective elements in controlling the disease progression.

On the same note, recent studies have suggested that patients with cirrhosis who use proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are at a higher risk for developing SBP than non-PPI users. However, many of these results are conflicting and lack generalizability. It is essential to tackle this subject, as PPI drugs are widely used among patient populations, particularly among cirrhotic patients. In this study, we aimed to identify whether PPI use is an independent risk factor for developing SBP among cirrhotic patients in the United States (US).

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114oVcxn]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment – as any kind of drug therapy – is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential risks in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to an effective and safe PPI therapy.

### Timing of endoscopy in patients with acute variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ejEHw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Another strength of our study is its detailed presentation of medication use in AVB patients from admission to endoscopic treatment, particularly the use of vasoactive drugs and prophylactic antibiotics. Most existing guidelines recommend the early administration of vasoactive drugs and prophylactic antibiotics upon admission for AVB patients. A meta-analysis by Rahman et al. which included 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 598 patients, demonstrated that the infusion of erythromycin prior to endoscopy improved visualization, reduced the need for a second endoscopy, and shortened hospital stay. Additionally, 3 RCTs showed that the use of vasoactive drugs significantly improved the management of active bleeding in patients. Therefore, pharmacological treatment plays a crucial role in the outcomes of AVB patients. Fortunately, two-thirds of the studies included in our analysis provided comprehensive coverage of vasoactive drugs and antibiotics for all AVB patients. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are essential for hemostasis in non-variceal bleeding; however, for variceal bleeding patients, it is recommended to discontinue their use after endoscopy. Unfortunately, relevant data regarding the use of proton pump inhibitors could not be extracted from several studies.

Our meta-analysis has several limitations. First, all included studies were retrospective and not randomized, which may introduce selection bias. Second, there was variability in the decisions regarding the timing of endoscopy, the reporting time of primary outcomes, and the management protocols across different studies, which may have affected the quality of the data. Although we attempted to reduce bias through subgroup analyses and comparisons of study characteristics, it could not be fully eliminated. Third, inferring the optimal timing of endoscopy solely based on the outcomes of AVB patients is challenging. Factors such as the use of non-selective β-blockers (NSBBs) after endoscopy when hemodynamic stability was achieved, the patient's nutritional status, lifestyle, and regular endoscopic variceal ligation (often recommended 2–4 weeks after the first endoscopic variceal therapy) may all influence prognosis. Notably, only the study by Chen et al. provided prophylactic protocols subsequent to initial endoscopic hemostasis. Consequently, future studies should emphasize standardized prophylactic protocols after hemodynamic stability was achieved. Finally, most of the samples in this study were drawn from the Asia-Pacific region, where the majority of patients have hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis, which may limit the generalizability of the results to patients with cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^116kYzv9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We investigated risk stratification for the 15 identified diseases that were associated with PPI use in the primary results. This analysis was carried out in the UK Biobank since it collected the most compressive baseline and outcome data. The prediction models for evaluating baseline risk were described in Supplementary Data 1. For individual outcomes, we found that the RDs were consistently increased with the baseline predicted risk by ~3–26 times from quartile 1 to quartile 4 (Fig. 4), suggesting prevention of PPI-related risk should focus on the participants with high baseline risk.

Fig. 4
Risk stratification for PPI-related adverse events.

The analysis was carried out for the 15 high-burden diseases that were associated with PPI use in the primary analysis based on the UK Biobank (N = 501,109). The baseline risk was evaluated with newly established models (lower respiratory infections, falls, diarrheal diseases, cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases, asthma) or previously reported prediction models (Supplementary Data 1). We evaluated the HRs of PPI use as compared with no-PPI use in each quartile group, then translated to absolute effects (risk differences, RDs) associated with PPI use at one year by the method described by Altman. The squares denote the RD, and the vertical lines represent the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1136zuYf]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

H 2 RAs have also been found effective in preventing CIB and are the preferred acid lowering drugs in some ICUs despite the efficacy of PPIs being significantly better. Over recent years, all meta-analyses except one confirmed the superior efficacy of this class of drugs. No studies showed a statistically significant difference in the rate of severe complications, such as nosocomial pneumonia, since these associations were not reported outcomes in any of the RCTs assessed. A recent observational study found that PPI treatment for SUP in critically ill patients is associated with a risk of C. difficile infection higher than that observed with H 2 RAs (6.7% vs. 1.8%).

SUP should be withheld in the majority of hospitalized patients, unless they have multiple risk factors. Indeed, as outlined by current practice guidelines, any risk factor different from those mentioned above does not independently predispose a patient to stress ulcer bleeding. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis suggests that patients receiving enteral nutrition may not require SUP. On the other hand, its implementation might be associated with an increased risk of infectious complications, such as nosocomial pneumonia and C. difficile -associated diarrhea. Patients with liver cirrhosis may actually have an increased mortality rate if treated with PPIs.

Nevertheless, several studies demonstrate that, in many non-ICU patients lacking an indication for SUP, acid suppressive therapy is started upon hospital admission. A recent study, while confirming that PPI use for SUP has spread inappropriately to low-risk patients, found that more than 50% of admitted PPI users were inadvertently prescribed a PPI at discharge, without a real medical need for acid suppression.

In summary, PPIs represent the drugs of choice for acid suppression in SUP. However, routine prophylaxis is not justified by current evidence. Only patients at risk of CIB are likely to benefit from preventive strategies. Educating clinicians to follow SUP guidelines can improve the cost effectiveness of PPI use in this clinical setting.

### Proton pump inhibitor therapy is associated with reduced survival following first-time transarterial chemoembolization in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [^114zsuiL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Several studies have reported associations of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment with the incidence of complications and even increased mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis. Up to now, there are no studies on the impact of PPI treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the prognostic effects of PPI treatment in a cohort of patients with HCC treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).

Methods

Three hundred fifty-eight patients with HCC that received first-time TACE were included in a retrospective analysis. We explored effects of PPI treatment using uni- and multivariable regression models.

Results

One hundred sixty-seven of the 358 patients (46.6%) received PPI treatment. Median transplant-free survival after TACE was significantly lower in patients treated with PPIs compared to patients without PPI treatment [16.0 (10.7–21.3) months vs. 26 (22.2–29.8) months, P = 0.006]. Importantly, PPI treatment remained a significant prognostic factor for reduced survival after adjustment for patient demographics, tumor stadium and liver function [hazard ratio (HR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09–1.78, P = 0.005]. We observed a dose-dependent association of PPI treatment with survival: A higher daily PPI dose was an independent prognostic factor for reduced survival (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.14–1.54, P < 0.001). Notably, 58.1% of patients receiving PPIs had no clear indication therefor.

Conclusion

PPI treatment is associated with reduced survival in patients with HCC in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, indication for PPI treatment should be evaluated attentively in these patients. Further, prospective studies are needed to validate the findings of this study.

### Proton-pump-inhibitor use associated with lower short-term rebleeding and mortality in patients receiving esophageal variceal band ligation: a retrospective cohort study [^113ve3fs]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The impact of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy on subsequent hemorrhage and mortality after variceal hemorrhage is unclear.

Aim

Evaluate the associations of PPI use with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and death within 30days of undergoing esophageal variceal band ligation (EBL) separately in inpatient and outpatient settings.

Methods

Retrospective review of cirrhotic patients with variceal hemorrhage who underwent EBL between 2005 and 2018. Endoscopic findings, PPI use at admission (inpatients only), PPI use at discharge (inpatients and outpatients), and adverse outcomes data (liver transplant, UGIB, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and death within 30days of discharge or death during hospitalization) were reviewed.

Results

A total of 446 patients (164 inpatients, 282 outpatients) were included. The most commonly observed outcomes were death within 30days of discharge in inpatients (12.8%), UGIB within 30days of discharge in inpatients (21.3%), and UGIB within 30days of discharge in outpatients (8.5%). For inpatients, prescription of PPI at discharge was associated with a lower risk of bleeding within 30days (odds ratio: 0.30, P = 0.025) and death within 30days (odds ratio = 0.16, P = 0.002). No other significant associations of PPI with death or UGIB were reported.

Conclusion

Post-EBL PPI therapy is associated with reduced risk of bleeding and death within 30days after variceal hemorrhage in hospitalized patients.

Risk and predictors of SBP in patients with cirrhosis using multivariate regression analysis

We used a multivariate regression model in order to adjust for age greater than 65 years, male sex, Caucasian ethnicity, and use of PPIs and β-blockers. Cirrhotic patients with SBP had a higher risk of being male (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.25–1.35), and using β-blockers (OR 1.26, 95%CI 1.21–1.31) or PPIs (OR 2.31, 95%CI 2.21–2.42) (Table 3).

Table 3
Risk of developing SBP in patients with cirrhosis using multivariate regression analysis model before controlling for gastrointestinal bleeding

To further investigate the risk of SBP in cirrhotic patients who use PPIs, we controlled for GIB in addition to controlling for the covariates used previously in the multivariate logistic regression model. The risk of SBP was higher in male patients (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.25–1.34), patients with a diagnosis of GIB (OR 1.70, 95%CI 1.64–1.76), and those using β-blockers (OR 1.22, 95%CI 1.17–1.27) or PPIs (OR 2.13, 95%CI 2.03–2.23) (Fig. 1).

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^111FrojA]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Use of PPIs

Coincident with PPI usage, the literature surrounding PPI safety and efficacy is growing exponentially, making it difficult to delineate an evidence-based guideline on their use. In the study by Scarpignato et al. committees on behalf of three Italian scientific societies collaborated with impressive panels of expert international reviewers to address 13 clinical scenarios in which uncertainty exists about how to prescribe PPIs and where drug misuse is common. They performed a systematic literature review inclusive of almost 500 papers and present a narrative review of the safety and appropriateness of PPI therapy in each scenario. Table 1 summarizes the key messages regarding appropriate PPI use in the 13 scenarios, organized into those appropriate for long-term or short-term PPI use, or not at all. Examining this compendium, one is immediately struck by the fact that the table includes many usages for which there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications. Apparently, the world literature provides ample evidence for the efficacy of PPIs outside of FDA indications.

### Proton pump inhibitors as a risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis with ascites [^1149zDdA]. Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be a risk factor for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in patients with cirrhosis, possibly through translocation of gut bacteria, which can also lead to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We examined the associations between PPIs and development of HE or SBP in patients with cirrhosis with ascites. We used data from three 1-year trials of satavaptan for ascites control. We used Cox regression to compare HE and SBP rates between users and nonusers of PPIs. At inclusion, 39% of the 865 patients with cirrhosis with ascites used PPIs, 52% used them at some point during the follow-up, and the proportion of current users was always in the 30%-39% range. There were 189 first-time HE episodes during the follow-up, and the cumulative 1-year risk was 31% for those who used PPIs at baseline versus 25% for those who did not. The confounder-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of HE for current PPI use versus current nonuse was 1.36 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.84). The HR for overt HE was higher (adjusted HR = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.21–1.91). During the follow-up, 86 patients developed SBP. The adjusted HR of SBP for current PPI users versus nonusers was 1.72 (95% CI, 1.10–2.69).

Conclusion

PPIs were used by 52% of this international cirrhosis cohort during a 1-year period and was a risk factor for developing HE and SBP. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that PPIs may increase translocation of gut bacteria. (Hepatology 2016;64:1265–1272).

### Investigating potential confounding by indication when considering the association between proton pump inhibitor use, infection, hepatic encephalopathy and mortality in hospitalised decompensated cirrhosis: a post-hoc analysis of the ATTIRE trial [^112ZiRTG]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed to prevent and treat upper gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Studies have identified increased incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in cirrhosis patients taking PPIs. However, results are conflicting, and as PPIs are prescribed for variceal bleeding, a major risk factor for infection and HE, it is challenging to discern whether these associations are causal.

Methods

In this post-hoc analysis of the ATTIRE trial, we pooled all patient data to investigate the effects of PPI use on clinical outcomes. ATTIRE was a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial of targeted 20% human albumin solution (HAS) daily infusions versus standard care involving 777 adults with decompensated cirrhosis hospitalised with acute complications and albumin < 30 g/L. Study recruitment was between Jan 25, 2016, and June 28, 2019, at 35 hospitals across England, Scotland, and Wales. Key exclusion criteria were advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with life expectancy < 8 weeks and patients receiving palliative care. In ATTIRE, patients were grouped by PPI use at trial entry. We studied infection and HE at baseline and incidence of hospital acquired infection, new onset HE, renal dysfunction and mortality. We attempted with propensity score matching to account for differences in disease severity.

Findings

Overall PPI use at baseline was not associated with increased incidence of infection, renal dysfunction or mortality, but was associated with significantly increased incidence of grade III/IV HE during hospital stay (P = 0.011). This was only significant for those taking intravenous PPIs and these patients had > 10 times the incidence of variceal bleeding and near double the 28-day mortality compared to non-PPI patients. However, propensity score matching was not possible as there was such a strong selection of patients for PPI use, that we could not find sufficient non-PPI patients to match to. We found no impact of PPI use on plasma markers of bacterial translocation, infection or systemic inflammation.

Interpretations

Our real-world data from a completed randomised trial show that PPIs are widely prescribed in the UK and judicious use appears safe in patients hospitalised with decompensated cirrhosis. However, patients prescribed PPIs had fundamentally different phenotypes to those not prescribed PPIs, a form of confounding by indication, which should be strongly considered when interpreting studies and making recommendations about their use.

Discussion

The current study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively identify all observational studies that evaluated the risk of pneumonia associated with PPI use among patients with cirrhosis. The pooled analysis from over 40,000 patients found an approximately 1.4-fold higher risk of pneumonia among cirrhotic patients with exposure to PPI. An increased risk of pneumonia among PPI-users has also been observed in the general population, as demonstrated by a recent meta-analysis. In fact, the magnitude of the increased risk in the general population studies, 1.49-fold, is comparable to this study. The mechanisms accounting for the increased risk of pneumonia have not been clearly elucidated, but there are several possible explanations.

The first possible mechanism is that PPI use decreases gastric acidity, thus facilitating the proliferation of Streptococcus spp. and Lactobacillus spp. in the stomach. Aspiration of colonized gastric fluid may have a higher tendency to cause pneumonia than aspiration of relatively sterile gastric fluid. In fact, a study by Viasus et al identified an increased proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae as a causative organism of community-acquired pneumonia in patients with cirrhosis compared with the general population.

The second possible mechanism is related to intestinal bacterial overgrowth and translocation. PPIs, as acid suppressors, are known to induce intestinal dysbiosis and subsequent development of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. The complication of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is more problematic among patients with cirrhosis than in healthy individuals, as they tend to have some degree of immunodeficiency through several mechanisms, including loss of Kupffer in the hepatic reticuloendothelial system, imbalance of cytokines causing immune cell dysfunction, and decreased hepatic synthesis of complements and acute phase reactants. In addition, a significant portion of patients with cirrhosis develop portal hypertension with portal-system shunting that would bypass the normal process of hepatic bacterial clearance. All of these factors may predispose cirrhotic patients to a higher likelihood of intestinal bacterial translocation and bacteremia that would ultimately lead to organ-specific infection, including pneumonia.
