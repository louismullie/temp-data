## Question

What is the diagnosis and treatment for hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose and treat hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical context and scope. Then, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds and the role of out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Next, I will review the initial evaluation and when to suspect secondary causes. After that, I need to check risk stratification and how it informs treatment thresholds. Then, I will examine lifestyle therapy as first-line. Next, I should review pharmacologic treatment choices, including when to start, whether to use monotherapy or combination therapy, and what targets to aim for. I will then consider special populations and resistant hypertension. Finally, I should confirm follow-up cadence, implementation strategies, and summarize the key takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't conflate systemic arterial hypertension with pulmonary hypertension or gestational hypertension, which have different diagnostic criteria and management pathways; here, I will focus on adult systemic arterial hypertension unless otherwise specified, and I will anchor to major guidelines and high-quality reviews to ensure consistency and accuracy [^115DxLHQ] [^113u9ZD3] [^1131p9Vs].

> I need to verify diagnostic thresholds across measurement modalities because misclassification is common if I rely on office readings alone; office hypertension is generally defined as sustained blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg, while home averages ≥ 135/85 mmHg or ambulatory thresholds of ≥ 130/80 mmHg over 24 hours, ≥ 135/85 mmHg daytime, or ≥ 120/70 mmHg nighttime support the diagnosis and better reflect cardiovascular risk, so I should confirm with out-of-office measurements whenever feasible [^115DxLHQ] [^111tqVq5] [^1172hwAR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single elevated reading; I should double-check that diagnosis requires multiple measurements over time, typically 2–3 office visits over 1–4 weeks unless the initial reading is severely elevated or there is evidence of target organ damage, and I must ensure proper technique with validated devices and appropriate cuff sizes to avoid misdiagnosis [^111tqVq5].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation to establish baseline risk and screen for secondary causes; I need to check for cardiovascular risk factors, assess for hypertension-mediated organ damage, and order basic labs including electrolytes, renal function, fasting glucose, lipids, and urinalysis, while reserving secondary workup for those with young onset, severe or resistant hypertension, or suggestive features, because early identification of secondary causes can change management and sometimes be curative [^114ku6PE] [^1119XhEU] [^111tqVq5].

> I will now examine risk stratification because it shapes treatment thresholds; I should confirm that most contemporary guidelines integrate blood pressure level with global cardiovascular risk, often using 10-year ASCVD risk, to decide when to initiate pharmacotherapy, with earlier drug therapy favored at lower BP thresholds in higher-risk patients, while lower-risk patients may have more room for initial lifestyle-only management [^111jm1hx] [^114a4kHy] [^115XM7jZ].

> Let me consider lifestyle therapy as foundational first-line treatment; I need to ensure counseling on sodium restriction, weight loss if overweight or obese, increased physical activity, moderation of alcohol, smoking cessation, and adoption of dietary patterns such as DASH, because these interventions lower blood pressure and improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes even when medications are ultimately required [^115DxLHQ] [^112YjBDp].

> Now, I should confirm when to start pharmacologic therapy; for most adults with confirmed hypertension, especially at or above 140/90 mmHg, medication is indicated in addition to lifestyle therapy, with earlier initiation at lower thresholds for those with high cardiovascular risk or existing cardiovascular disease, and I should remember that delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation are associated with worse outcomes, so timely action matters [^115eWtok] [^1136R9Go] [^116oVMXc].

> Wait, let me verify the choice of initial agents; first-line classes include ACE inhibitors or ARBs, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, with beta-blockers reserved for compelling indications such as coronary disease, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or arrhythmias, and I should confirm that these choices are supported by outcome data and guideline consensus [^113u9ZD3] [^116P5MKi] [^115DxLHQ].

> I should double-check the monotherapy versus combination therapy question; although I initially thought monotherapy is sufficient for most, hold on, I should verify current guidance favoring initial two-drug combinations in most patients to achieve faster and more reliable control, typically pairing a renin–angiotensin system blocker with a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic, while reserving monotherapy for select low-risk or frail patients or when BP is only modestly elevated [^111rJjTU] [^116nKqcH] [^116v5PnZ].

> Let me review treatment targets and make sure I align with the most recent evidence; a universal target of less than 130/80 mmHg is favored by several contemporary guidelines when tolerated, with some societies advocating an "as low as reasonably achievable" approach without unacceptable side effects, whereas older or frail patients may warrant individualized, higher targets based on tolerance and clinical judgment [^1136R9Go].

> Next, I should review special populations and adjustments; in older adults, I need to ensure careful titration to avoid hypotension and falls, in chronic kidney disease I should prefer ACE inhibitors or ARBs with close monitoring of potassium and renal function, in diabetes I should generally target less than 130/80 mmHg if tolerated, and in pregnancy I must avoid ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and direct renin inhibitors, using labetalol, nifedipine, or methyldopa instead [^112gDYYh] [^111JGZUb].

> I will now examine resistant hypertension; I should confirm the definition as uncontrolled BP despite three agents of different classes including a diuretic at maximally tolerated doses or control requiring four agents, then I need to check for pseudo-resistance from nonadherence, improper measurement, or white-coat effect, screen for secondary causes such as primary aldosteronism, obstructive sleep apnea, and renal artery stenosis, and consider adding spironolactone or eplerenone as the fourth agent, with renal denervation as a validated option in truly resistant cases after optimal medical therapy [^1172vRSa] [^116Xpjfg] [^115DxLHQ].

> Let me verify follow-up cadence and monitoring; after initiating or changing therapy, I should reassess within 4–12 weeks to confirm control and adherence, then extend intervals to 3–6 months once stable, and I should incorporate home blood pressure monitoring to improve detection of white-coat or masked hypertension and to guide titration, because out-of-office data better correlate with cardiovascular risk [^115eWtok] [^115DxLHQ] [^1172hwAR].

> But wait, what if control remains suboptimal despite good adherence; I need to ensure I address therapeutic inertia by proactively intensifying therapy when targets are not met, consider single-pill combinations to improve adherence, and leverage team-based care with pharmacists, nurses, and dietitians, as well as digital health tools, because implementation science shows these strategies meaningfully improve control rates [^112YjBDp] [^115DxLHQ] [^113Vg6gv].

> In summary, I should confirm that diagnosis relies on standardized measurement with out-of-office confirmation when possible, evaluation integrates risk and organ damage assessment, lifestyle therapy is universal, pharmacotherapy is initiated based on BP level and risk with a preference for initial two-drug combinations targeting less than 130/80 mmHg when tolerated, and persistent uncontrolled cases warrant a structured resistant hypertension workup and escalation strategy, all aligned with contemporary European and American guidelines and high-quality reviews [^113u9ZD3] [^1131p9Vs] [^115DxLHQ].

---

Hypertension is diagnosed by **office BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg** [^111tqVq5] confirmed by **out-of-office measurements** (home or ambulatory) to exclude white-coat or masked hypertension [^115DxLHQ] [^1172hwAR]. Treatment starts with **lifestyle changes** (sodium restriction, weight loss, exercise, alcohol moderation, smoking cessation) [^115DxLHQ] and, if BP remains uncontrolled, **initiate pharmacotherapy** with a two-drug combination (ACEi/ARB + CCB or thiazide) [^111rJjTU] in most patients, targeting < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated [^1136R9Go]. Monotherapy is reserved for frail or very elderly patients [^116v5PnZ]; **add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist** for resistant hypertension [^1172vRSa] and evaluate for secondary causes if BP remains uncontrolled [^116Xpjfg].

## Diagnosis of hypertension

### Blood pressure measurement

- **Office BP measurement**: ≥ 140/90 mmHg on at least two separate occasions [^111tqVq5].
- **Home BP monitoring (HBPM)**: ≥ 135/85 mmHg on multiple readings [^111tqVq5] [^1136R9Go].
- **Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM)**: 24-hour average ≥ 130/80 mmHg, daytime ≥ 135/85 mmHg, or nighttime ≥ 120/70 mmHg [^111tqVq5] [^1136R9Go].

---

### Classification of hypertension

| **Category** | **Systolic bp (mmhg)** | **Diastolic bp (mmhg)** |
|-|-|-|
| Normal | < 120 | < 80 |
| Elevated | 120–129 | < 80 |
| Hypertension stage 1 | 130–139 | 80–89 |
| Hypertension stage 2 | ≥ 140 | ≥ 90 |

---

### Evaluation of hypertension

Evaluation includes a **history and physical examination** to identify risk factors, comorbidities, and hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) [^114ku6PE]. Laboratory tests commonly include CBC, renal function, electrolytes, fasting glucose, lipid profile, and urinalysis [^notfound]. Secondary causes should be considered in young patients, those with resistant hypertension, or when clinical clues suggest an underlying disorder [^1119XhEU].

---

## Treatment of hypertension

### Lifestyle modifications (first-line therapy)

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: < 2 g/day.
- **Weight loss**: BMI target 18.5–24.9 kg/m².
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.
- **Alcohol moderation**: ≤ 1 drink/day (women), ≤ 2 drinks/day (men).
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^notfound].

---

### Pharmacological therapy

#### Indications

Pharmacotherapy is indicated for persistent **BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg despite lifestyle measures** or for high cardiovascular risk requiring earlier initiation [^116nKqcH] [^116v5PnZ].

---

#### First-line antihypertensive agents

- **ACE inhibitors (ACEis)**: Effective in reducing cardiovascular events, especially in diabetes or CKD [^113u9ZD3].
- **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: Alternative to ACEis, particularly if ACEi-related cough occurs [^notfound].
- **Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**: Effective in older adults and black patients [^notfound].
- **Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics**: Chlorthalidone or indapamide preferred [^notfound].

---

#### Combination therapy

Most patients should start with a **two-drug combination** (ACEi/ARB + CCB or thiazide) for faster BP control and improved adherence [^111rJjTU] [^116nKqcH]. Monotherapy is reserved for frail or very elderly patients [^116v5PnZ].

---

#### Treatment targets

The general target is **< 130/80 mmHg** when tolerated, with individualized targets for frail or elderly patients [^1136R9Go].

---

#### Resistant hypertension

For resistant hypertension, **add a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist** (spironolactone) and evaluate for secondary causes (e.g. primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis) [^1172vRSa] [^116Xpjfg].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include reassessment **every 3–6 months** after BP control and more frequent visits initially or if BP remains uncontrolled. Continued home BP monitoring improves adherence and control [^notfound].

---

Hypertension is diagnosed by **confirmed office or out-of-office BP thresholds**, with evaluation for risk factors and secondary causes. Treatment centers on lifestyle change, with pharmacotherapy using **combination therapy** to achieve < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated, and resistant cases require MRAs and secondary cause evaluation.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^115eWtok]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, < 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mm Hg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach. In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. Strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the tradeoffs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient's values, resource considerations and cost-effectiveness; health equity; acceptability, and feasibility consideration of different treatment options. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate standard approaches to pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, if widely implemented, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide.

### Hypertension diagnosis, treatment, and control in India [^111J1rpW]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the gaps in the hypertension care continuum (diagnosis, treatment, and control), and how do they vary by state, district, and sociodemographic groups in India?

Findings

In this 2019–2021 national survey study of 1.7 million respondents, 28.1% had hypertension, of whom 36.9% received a diagnosis; 44.7% of those who received a diagnosis (17.7% of the total with hypertension) reported taking medication, and 52.5% of those treated (8.5% of the total with hypertension) achieved blood pressure control. Most of the variability in the hypertension care continuum was observed within, not between, states.

Meaning

This study suggests that differences between states and between districts in states indicate the need for targeted, decentralized solutions to improve the hypertension care continuum in India.

Discussion

The prevalence, treatment, and control of hypertension vary substantially between different countries with the greatest burden of disease due to hypertension and the lowest proportions of treated and controlled hypertension being in low- and middle-income countries. Hypertension has been repeatedly demonstrated as the most important single modifiable risk factor responsible for CVD burden of disease and all-cause mortality and hypertension is a significant global public health issue by the WHO. The global burden of hypertension has been growing over time, driven by changes in lifestyle, population growth, inadequate treatment, and aging. Long-term sequelae of untreated/uncontrolled hypertension include increased CVD events, end organ damage, and mortality. High BP is also closely related to other adverse outcomes including CKD and cognitive impairment/dementia. A wide array of effective hypertension treatment options exists, ranging from lifestyle modifications to various forms of antihypertension medications. Alarmingly, SBP/DBP is controlled to < 140/90 mm Hg in < 14% of adults worldwide and < 8% on low- and middle-income countries. In the guidelines summarized in Figure 3, the WHO provides the most current and relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle counseling. The guidelines provide recommendations for a BP threshold to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers during treatment of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for monotherapy, dual therapy, treatment with single-pill combinations, and the use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. The recommendations are guided by the quality of the underlying evidence, the balance between expected beneficial and undesirable effects, resource requirements and cost-effectiveness, health equity, acceptability, patient values and preferences, and feasibility of the treatment.

### European guidelines for hypertension in 2024: a comparison of key recommendations for clinical practice [^113vwMGX]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality globally. Suboptimal control of elevated blood pressure places a substantial burden on health-care systems worldwide. Several factors contribute to this suboptimal control, such as limited awareness of hypertension, lack of appropriate diagnosis and poor control of blood pressure among those with a diagnosis. These factors can be due to patient non-adherence to treatment, inertia among health-care professionals and low uptake and implementation of clinical guideline recommendations. From 2003 to 2018, the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology jointly published four sets of guidelines on hypertension. However, the two societies released separate guidelines on hypertension in 2023 and 2024, respectively. These two sets of European guidelines agree on most recommendations, but some differences have been identified. In this Expert Recommendation, we highlight the key consensus recommendations from the two guidelines; compare differing approaches to the definition, classification, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension; and aim to help health-care professionals in their decision-making to improve the management of hypertension and to reduce the burden of hypertension-associated outcomes and premature deaths.

### ACOG practice bulletin. chronic hypertension in pregnancy. ACOG committee on practice bulletins [^111JGZUb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic hypertension occurs in up to 5% of pregnant women; rates vary according to the population studied and the criteria used for confirming the diagnosis (1,2). This complication may result in significant maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There has been confusion over the terminology and criteria used to diagnose this complication, as well as the benefit and potential harm of treatment during pregnancy. The purpose of this document is to review the effects of chronic hypertension on pregnancy, to clarify the terminology and criteria used to define and diagnose it during pregnancy, and to review the available evidence for treatment options.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guideline [^112gDYYh]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and reduction of elevated blood pressure (BP) remains an important intervention for slowing kidney disease progression. Over the past decade, the most appropriate BP target for initiation and titration of BP-lowering medications has been an area of intense research and debate within the clinical community. In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in conjunction with several other professional societies released new hypertension guidelines based on data from a systematic review of clinical trials and observational data. While many of the recommendations in the ACC/AHA hypertension guideline are relevant to nephrology practice, BP targets and management strategies for patients receiving dialysis are not discussed. This Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) commentary focuses largely on recommendations from the ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines that are pertinent to individuals at risk of chronic kidney disease or with non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease. This KDOQI commentary also includes a brief discussion of the consensus statement regarding hypertension diagnosis and management for adults receiving maintenance dialysis published by the European Renal and Cardiovascular Medicine Working Group of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) and the Hypertension and the Kidney working group of the European Society of Hypertension. Overall, we support the vast majority of the ACC/AHA recommendations and highlight select areas in which best diagnosis and treatment options remain controversial.

### 2015 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension: the joint task force for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS): endorsed by: Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC), International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) [^111W1kyJ]. European Heart Journal (2016). Medium credibility.

Transplantation for pulmonary arterial hypertension — referral timing, outcomes, and prioritization are stated as follows: The long-term outcomes of medically treated patients remain uncertain and transplantation should continue to be an important option for those who fail on such therapy and remain in WHO-FC III or IV. The overall 5-year survival following transplantation for PAH was considered to be 45–50%, and more recent data show survival increased to 75% at 5 years and to 45–66% at 10 years at some centres. Considering these data, it seems reasonable to consider eligibility for lung transplantation after an inadequate clinical response to the initial monotherapy and to refer the patient after an inadequate clinical response is confirmed on maximal combination therapy. Prognosis varies by aetiology: PAH associated with CTD has a worse prognosis than IPAH, while PAH associated with CHD has a better survival, and the poorest prognosis is seen in patients with PVOD and PCH; these patients should be listed for transplantation at diagnosis.

### Hypertension [^1153xnL8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines on diagnosis and management of high blood pressure (BP) include substantial changes and several new concepts compared with previous guidelines. These are reviewed and their clinical implications are discussed in this article. The goal is to provide a practical reference to assist clinicians with up-to-date management of patients with high BP. Important issues include new diagnostic thresholds, out-of-office BP monitoring, intensified treatment goals, and a different approach to resistant hypertension. Finally, differences among guidelines, the persistent controversies that have led to them, and their implications for clinical practice are discussed.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension: the task force for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), endorsed by the international society of heart and lung transplantation (ISHLT) [^1149ya9n]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — transplantation is positioned as an option for treatment failure and high-risk phenotypes: studies indicate that up to 25% of patients with IPAH may fail to improve on disease-specific therapy and the prognosis of patients who remain in WHO-FC III or IV is poor; the prognosis varies by aetiology, with PAH associated with CTD having a worse prognosis than IPAH and the worst prognosis seen in PVOD and pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis, for which those patients should be listed for transplantation at diagnosis; in any case, patients with features identifying a worse prognosis profile despite maximal medical therapy should be referred for transplant listing, and international guidelines on referral and listing have been published.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: an evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021. Topics covered include blood pressure measurement, patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy, lifestyle and pharmacological management, treatment target blood pressure goal, management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and optimization of care using patient, provider, and health system approaches. Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^112M8ivC]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, a group of primary care practices in the United States developed an algorithm for identifying patients at risk of hypertension from their electronic records. The innovation was successful and has now been implemented in these practices. It is easy to see how this type of innovation could be used in calculating rescreening intervals for patients and also follow-up times after BP treatment intensification.

### Pulmonary hypertension: diagnosis and treatment [^117YUKud]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary hypertension is a common, complex group of disorders that result from different pathophysiologic mechanisms but are all defined by a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 25 mm Hg or greater. Patients often initially present to family physicians; however, because the symptoms are typically nonspecific or easily attributable to comorbid conditions, diagnosis can be challenging and requires a stepwise evaluation. There is limited evidence to support screening of asymptomatic individuals. Echocardiography is recommended as the initial step in the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension. A definitive diagnosis cannot be made on echocardiographic abnormalities alone, and some patients require invasive evaluation by right heart catheterization. For certain categories of pulmonary hypertension, particularly pulmonary arterial hypertension, treatment options are rapidly evolving, and early diagnosis and prompt referral to an expert center are critical to ensure the best prognosis. There are no directed therapies for many other categories of pulmonary hypertension; therefore, family physicians have a central role in managing contributing comorbidities. Other important considerations for patients with pulmonary hypertension include influenza and pneumonia immunizations, contraception counseling, preoperative assessment, and mental health.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^115PhMLy]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the 2 guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the 2 guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension, worldwide.

### Delayed hypertension diagnosis and its association with cardiovascular treatment and outcomes [^116oVMXc]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How is the timing of clinical hypertension diagnosis associated with antihypertensive treatment initiation and long-term cardiovascular outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 311 743 patients who met blood pressure–based criteria for hypertension as recorded in the electronic health record, 14.6% received a diagnosis after the second elevated blood pressure reading. Delayed diagnosis was associated with lower antihypertensive medication prescription rates and a higher risk of cardiovascular events over 5 years, with hazard ratios of 1.04 for delays of 1 to 90 days, 1.11 for delays of 91 to 365 days, and 1.29 for delays over 365 days.

Meaning

This study suggests that delayed hypertension diagnosis is common and is associated with lower treatment rates and higher long-term cardiovascular risk, underscoring the need for earlier identification and intervention.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^114B8PeJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study identified 48 national and international guidelines for the management of hypertension. BP thresholds for the diagnosis and staging of hypertension, as well as BP target recommendations, were largely consistent across guidelines and across income settings. However, recommendations on antihypertensive drug therapy at each treatment step differed greatly, with guidelines from higher-income settings offering greater clinician autonomy in choice of antihypertensive drugs and dual-combination therapies, in contrast to lower-income settings, which may reflect drug costs or availability. The variation seen may represent the lack of a robust evidence base on management, particularly for lower-income settings, given research is focused on higher-income countries. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for such divergence in guidelines to better inform those involved in their creation and the clinicians using them.

### Executive summary. expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric pulmonary hypertension. the European paediatric pulmonary vascular disease network, endorsed by ISHLT and DGPK [^116FRcyY]. Heart (2016). Medium credibility.

Paediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) key messages and conclusions describe PH in neonates, infants, children and adolescents as a complex condition that may be associated with diverse cardiac, pulmonary and systemic diseases and contributes to significant morbidity and mortality, and note that current approaches have been limited by the lack of consensus recommendations; the European Paediatric Pulmonary Vascular Disease (PVD) Network is identified as a registered, non-profit organisation striving to define and develop effective, innovative diagnostic tools and treatment options in all forms of paediatric pulmonary hypertensive vascular diseases (PHVD), and this multiparter expert consensus statement provides — for the first time — a specific, evidence based but practical framework for the optimal clinical care of children with PH/PHVD, with conclusions emphasising that it provides a specific, comprehensive, detailed but practical framework and that additional patient registries and prospective, controlled and randomised studies in the diagnosis and treatment of PH in children are urgently needed to move on from frequently experience-based towards mostly evidence-based recommendations.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^111gnkci]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite its recognition as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, the awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure (BP) have plateaued if not modestly declined. In the United States alone, for example, more than half of individuals with hypertension — representing > 29 million people — are estimated to have BP exceeding professional society and guideline-recommended treatment goals. As the most commonly diagnosed condition and largest contributor to mortality in industrialized countries, hypertension is present in > 1 in 3 individuals, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality doubles for every 20 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increase in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. With population growth and aging, the global prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse outcomes are expected to continue to escalate.

Irrespective of baseline hypertension severity, even moderate reductions in BP translate into clinically meaningful reductions in cardiac, renal, and cerebral vascular-related adverse events. Recent large randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated the clinical benefits of more intensive BP reduction, leading to revision of guideline-directed treatment goals to further lower SBP and DBP standards. Countering evidence-based efforts to improve BP with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical therapies are routine challenges in clinical practice that include patient intolerance of medication-related adverse effects, general nonadherence with prescribed therapy, and physician inertia for treatment of an illness that remains largely silent until onset of clinically irreversible conditions.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — genetic counselling and reproductive planning: Genetic counselling should be offered to selected PAH patients, and because of the psychological impact of results, genetic testing and counselling should be provided according to local regulations in the setting of a multidisciplinary team. Affected individuals and at‑risk family members may want to know their mutation status for family planning purposes, and current reproductive options for couples with a BMPR2 mutation carrier include remaining childless, no genetic prenatal testing, prenatal or pre‑implantation genetic diagnosis, gamete donation or adoption.

Treatment of children with pulmonary hypertension — therapeutic options include that pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-specific medications approved for adults target three major pathways (endothelin, nitric oxide, prostacyclin), and some PH centres may use off-label drugs for compassionate use. After a systematic literature search and analysis of the published data, the authors developed treatment strategies and algorithms that can guide goal-oriented PH therapy, and they discuss early combination therapy (double, triple) in patients with PAH in functional class II–IV and in those with inadequate response to the initial pharmacotherapy. First follow-up data indicate that Potts shunt (left pulmonary artery to descending aorta anastomosis) may be an alternative destination therapy, or bridge to bilateral lung transplantation, in end-stage paediatric PAH.

### Management of stage 1 hypertension in adults with a low 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease: filling a guidance gap: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114jixjA]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading cause of worldwide cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Patients and clinicians dealing with hypertension have benefited from the evidence of event-based randomized controlled clinical trials. One result from those trials has been the development of evidence-based guidelines. The commitment to using evidence from these event-based randomized trials has been a cornerstone in the development of guideline treatment recommendations. However, in some situations, evidence from event-based trials is not available to guideline writers or clinicians for assistance in treatment decision making. Such is the case for the management of many patients with stage 1 hypertension. The purpose of this scientific statement is to provide information complementary to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines for the patient with untreated stage 1 hypertension (systolic BP/diastolic BP, 130–139/80–89 mmHg) with a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease < 10% who fails to meet the systolic BP/diastolic goal (< 130/80 mmHg) after 6 months of guideline-recommended lifestyle therapy. This statement provides evidence from sources other than event-based randomized controlled clinical trials and offers therapy options for consideration by clinicians.

### Arterial hypertension [^115DxLHQ]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Arterial hypertension is the most important contributor to the global burden of disease; however, disease control remains poor. Although the diagnosis of hypertension is still based on office blood pressure, confirmation with out-of-office blood pressure measurements (ie, ambulatory or home monitoring) is strongly recommended. The definition of hypertension differs throughout various guidelines, but the indications for antihypertensive therapy are relatively similar. Lifestyle adaptation is absolutely key in non-pharmacological treatment. Pharmacologically, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics are the first-line agents, with advice for the use of single-pill combination therapy by most guidelines. As a fourth-line agent, spironolactone should be considered. The rapidly evolving field of device-based therapy, especially renal denervation, will further broaden therapeutic options. Despite being a largely controllable condition, the actual rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension are disappointingly low. Further improvements throughout the process of patient screening, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up need to be urgently addressed.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension — mechanical complications: Mechanical complications in PAH are related to progressive dilatation of the pulmonary artery (PA) and include PA aneurysms, rupture and dissection and compression of intrathoracic structures such as the left main coronary artery, pulmonary veins, main bronchi and the recurrent laryngeal nerve; symptoms and signs are not specific and include chest pain, dyspnoea, regional lung oedema and sudden death. Contrast-enhanced and high-resolution CT scan represent the best imaging option to detect mechanical complications; treatment options are not well established in PA aneurysms, pseudo-aneurysms and dissection, and in patients with left main coronary artery compression, a percutaneous stenting procedure should be performed.

EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF HYPERTENSION GUIDELINES

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' Committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the XX century, updated versions of the guidelines document have been prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies. The first guideline document prepared by European Societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH together with the European Society of Cardiology jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013 and 2018, the latter being as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in the worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering to the readers elements of novelties. These include, for example, the thresholds and targets of the blood pressure-lowering intervention, the relevance of out-of-office blood pressure measurements, the modern quantification of cardiovascular risk, the greater use of organ damage measures, the upgrading of beta-blocking drugs to the level of major antihypertensive agents and the wider choice of drug combination between major drugs, with confirmation of their strategic role as first-line and subsequent treatment in the majority of patients. Finally, emphasis has been given to the treatment strategies based on renal denervation, particularly but not exclusively in drug-resistant hypertension, and to the patient's follow-up modalities, including the careful assessment of nonadherence as a fundamental barrier to the long-term blood pressure control.

Finally, given the importance of primary care providers in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the hypertensive state, ESH has decided to provide a novel concise format of the guidelines, the so called '2024 Clinical Practice Guidelines', for implementation into current clinical practice. The four pillars of these practice guidelines include the accurate diagnostic approach, the assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk profile, the careful selection of the treatment strategy and the long-term evaluation of the blood pressure response.

### Call to action: British and Irish hypertension society position statement on blood pressure treatment thresholds and targets [^1136R9Go]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

BP threshold for treatment

Following a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension (sustained BP ≥ 135/85 mmHg based on 7-day average HBPM or day-time average ABPM despite diet and lifestyle advice) starting BP-lowering treatment with pharmacological therapy on top of diet and lifestyle interventions is recommended irrespective of CVD risk. We recommend the BIHS algorithm in " Adult Hypertension Referral Pathway and Therapeutic Management: British and Irish Hypertension Society Position Statement " for a titration protocol and exemplar therapeutic options within the NICE treatment pathway.

On-treatment BP target

On treatment BP target < 130/80 mmHg (measured by 7-day average HBPM or day-time average ABPM or office BP*) or ALARA without causing unacceptable side-effects, and within 6-months of initiating treatment, for all adults. Possible subgroups to whom this may not apply are those who are frail and/or have limited life expectancy where higher targets may be appropriate based on clinical judgement and the individuals' tolerance to treatment.

* Among people with diagnosed white-coat hypertension out-of-office measurements should always be used to evaluate treatment.

The BIHS believe that this simple 2-step approach will facilitate practitioners deliver evidence-based best practice, discourage therapeutic inertia around BP lowering and improve health outcomes for all adults living with high BP.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension: an update on diagnosis and treatment [^113m1eZJ]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension is defined as a mean pulmonary arterial pressure greater than 25 mm Hg at rest or 30 mm Hg during physical activity. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is classified into subgroups, including idiopathic, heritable, and pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with other conditions. A detailed history, thorough physical examination, and most importantly, a high index of suspicion are essential to diagnosis. Evaluation includes echocardiography and exclusion of other causes of symptoms. Targeted laboratory testing can help identify the subgroup of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Right heart catheterization is required to confirm the diagnosis. Standard treatment options include oral anticoagulation, diuretics, oxygen supplementation, and for a small percentage of patients, calcium channel blockers. Newer treatments include prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Combination therapy has been shown to improve pulmonary arterial pressure, but more research is needed. Interventional procedures for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension include balloon atrial septostomy and lung transplantation.

Conclusions

PAH is a complex disease with high mortality and disability. Over the past several decades, there has been significant progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology, genetics, diagnosis and treatment of PAH. However, there is no effective treatment for PAH. Therefore, the severity and risk of PAH patients should be evaluated to develop effective treatment strategies. In addition, patients also need regular structured follow-up, accurate assessment of the patient's condition, and timely detection of disease changes to adjust the treatment strategy.

Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease/pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis (PVOD/PCH) — therapy has no established medical option; vasodilators and, in particular, i.v. epoprostenol must be used with great caution because of the high risk of severe drug-induced pulmonary oedema; therapy for PVOD/PCH should be undertaken only at centres with extensive experience in the management of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and patients should be fully informed about the risks; the only curative therapy is lung transplantation, and eligible patients should be referred to a transplant centre for evaluation as soon as the diagnosis is established.

We suggest offering nurse-led interventions as an option for patients treated for hypertension. We suggest offering registered dietitian-led nutrition interventions as an option for patients with hypertension who are or are not on medication. We suggest technology-based interventions (e.g., e-counseling, electronic transmission of data, telemonitoring, mobile applications) for improving control of hypertension. We suggest advising patients with hypertension and overweight/obesity to lose weight to improve blood pressure. For patients with hypertension and overweight/obesity, we suggest offering a diet directed at weight loss for the treatment of hypertension.

Hypertension remains the most common risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Its incidence is rising in both ageing and obese populations, but its control remains inadequate worldwide. We address several persisting controversies that may interfere with appropriate management of hypertension. They include: the reasons behind the increasing incidence of hypertension and the possible ways to slow the process, especially by lifestyle changes; the need for overall cardiovascular risk assessment; the major issues in the decision to institute drug therapy and the choice of drugs; and the importance of screening for various identifiable causes. We provide the background for these controversies, followed by some opinions on how to guide practitioners to offer more effective management of hypertension.

### Revisiting the diagnosis of' resistant hypertension': what should we do nowadays' [^115T1EbA]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is one of the leading causes of death globally. Despite the widespread use of antihypertensive drugs and treatment strategies, many patients with hypertension fail to achieve target blood pressure (BP) control, a condition called resistant hypertension (RH). RH is a major clinical problem as it is associated with a high risk of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD), including chronic kidney disease (CKD), and premature cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Therefore, early identification and effective management strategies have the potential to improve hypertension treatment and lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of the hypertensives population, especially RH.

Recent guidelines propose better strategies to define, detect, and manage RH (American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA), International Society of Hypertension (ISH), the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)).

### Options for the diagnosis of high blood pressure in primary care: a systematic review and economic model [^1172hwAR]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The 2011 NICE hypertension guideline (CG127) undertook a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of different blood pressure (BP) assessment methods to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. The guideline also undertook a cost–utility analysis exploring the cost-effectiveness of the monitoring methods. A new systematic review was undertaken as part of the 2019 NICE hypertension guideline update (NG136). BP monitoring methods compared included Ambulatory BP, Clinic BP and Home BP. Ambulatory BP was the reference standard. The economic model from the 2011 guideline was updated with this new accuracy data. Home BP was more sensitive and specific than Clinic BP. Specificity improved more than sensitivity since the 2011 review. A higher specificity translates into fewer people requiring unnecessary treatment. A key interest was to compare Home BP and Ambulatory BP, and whether any improvement in Home BP accuracy would change the model results. Ambulatory BP remained the most cost-effective option in all age and sex subgroups. In all subgroups, Ambulatory BP was associated with lower costs than Clinic BP and Home BP. In all except one subgroup (females aged 40), Ambulatory BP was dominant. However, Ambulatory BP remained the most cost-effective option in 40-year-old females as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for Home BP versus Ambulatory BP was above the NICE £20,000 threshold. The new systematic review showed that the accuracy of both Clinic BP and Home BP has increased. However, Ambulatory BP remains the most cost-effective option to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension in all subgroups evaluated.

Hypertension is common, difficult to diagnose, and poorly controlled among patients with ESRD. However, controversy surrounds the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Here, we describe the diagnosis, epidemiology, and management of hypertension in dialysis patients, and examine the data sparking debate over appropriate methods for diagnosing and treating hypertension. Furthermore, we consider the issues uniquely related to hypertension in pediatric dialysis patients. Future clinical trials designed to clarify the controversial results discussed here should lead to the implementation of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques that improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ESRD.

### Uncertainties in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension [^115B57Zq]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

The availability of new treatments for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension has increased awareness and interest in the medical community for pulmonary vascular diseases in general. Many uncertainties exist, however, regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension that are particularly pertinent for the management of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with underlying diseases. This review highlights controversial issues around the definition and diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, the interpretation of hemodynamic variables, and the interpretation of clinical responsiveness to chronic therapies. In addition, we propose guidelines applicable to the conduct of new therapeutic trials in pulmonary arterial hypertension, which aim to provide greater confidence in the efficacy and safety of new treatments currently under development.

Hypertension remains the leading international risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature death but, despite effective treatments, hypertension remains significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated. In the present review paper, we provide a selected update on recent developments of interest in the management of hypertension. We focus on summarizing four topics that we believe are worth highlighting to a clinical audience: (1) the evidence and strong motivation for new lower systolic BP treatment targets; (2) new studies reporting on the efficacy of renal denervation in the management of hypertension; (3) interesting new data to inform the great salt debate; and (4), perhaps most importantly, pioneering new work highlighting the huge potential of multi-disciplinary care in the management of hypertension.

### Hypertension in women: evaluation and management [^111xpSiY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most commonly encountered chronic medical condition in primary care and one of the most significant modifiable cardiovascular risk factors for women and men. Timely diagnosis and evidence-based management offer an important opportunity to reduce the risk of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, including cardiovascular events, end-stage renal disease, and heart failure. Clinical trials have shown significant improvements in patient-oriented outcomes when hypertension is well-controlled, yet many hypertensive patients remain undiagnosed, uncontrolled, or managed with inappropriate pharmacotherapy. This article discusses the initial diagnosis, evaluation, and management of hypertension in nonpregnant women, with topics for obstetrician-gynecologists and women's health providers.

### Diagnosis and treatment of arterial hypertension 2021 [^112WfqhF]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

In the last 4 years, several evidence-based, national, and international guidelines on the management of arterial hypertension have been published, mostly with concordant recommendations, but in some aspects with discordant opinions. This in-depth review takes these guidelines into account but also addresses several new data of interest. Although being somewhat obvious and simple, accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement with validated devices is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of hypertension, but out-of-office BP measurements are of crucial importance as well. Simplified antihypertensive drug treatment such as single-pill combinations enhances the adherence to medication and speeds up the process of getting into the BP target range, a goal not so far adequately respected. Recommended (single-pill) combination therapy includes diuretics as part of the first step of antihypertensive therapy, and updated analysis does not provide evidence to exclude diuretics from this first step because of the recently discussed potential risk of increasing cancer incidence. Target BP goals need to be individualized, according to comorbidities, hypertension-mediated organ damage, coexistence of cardiovascular risk factors (including age), frailty in older patients, and individual tolerability. There are also concordant recommendations in the guidelines that an office BP between 120 and 140 mm Hg systolic and between 70 and 80 mm Hg diastolic should be achieved. The BP target of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes for hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease are not applicable for clinical practice because they heavily rely on 1 study that used a study-specific, nontransferable BP measurement technique and excluded the most common cause of chronic kidney disease, namely, diabetic nephropathy. Actual data even from a prospective trial on chronotherapy have to be disregarded, and antihypertensive medication should not be routinely dosed at bedtime. Rigorously conducted trials justify the revival of renal denervation for treatment of (at least, but not only) uncontrolled and treatment-resistant hypertension.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^1137xiH3]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Systemic hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in adulthood. High blood pressure (HBP) and repeated measures of HBP, hypertension (HTN), begin in youth. Knowledge of how best to diagnose, manage, and treat systemic HTN in children and adolescents is important for primary and subspecialty care providers.

Objectives

To provide a technical summary of the methodology used to generate the 2017 "Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents", an update to the 2004 "Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents".

Data Sources

Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Excerpta Medica Database references published between January 2003 and July 2015 followed by an additional search between August 2015 and July 2016.

Study Selection

English-language observational studies and randomized trials.

Methods

Key action statements (KASs) and additional recommendations regarding the diagnosis, management, and treatment of HBP in youth were the product of a detailed systematic review of the literature. A content outline establishing the breadth and depth was followed by the generation of 4 patient, intervention, comparison, outcome, time questions. Key questions addressed: (1) diagnosis of systemic HTN, (2) recommended work-up of systemic HTN, (3) optimal blood pressure (BP) goals, and (4) impact of high BP on indirect markers of cardiovascular disease in youth. Once selected, references were subjected to a 2-person review of the abstract and title followed by a separate 2-person full-text review. Full citation information, population data, findings, benefits and harms of the findings, as well as other key reference information were archived. Selected primary references were then used for KAS generation. Level of evidence (LOE) scoring was assigned for each reference and then in aggregate. Appropriate language was used to generate each KAS based on the LOE and the balance of benefit versus harm of the findings. Topics that could not be researched via the stated approach were (1) definition of HTN in youth, and (2) definition of left ventricular hypertrophy. KASs related to these stated topics were generated via expert opinion.

Results

Nearly 15000 references were identified during an initial literature search. After a deduplication process, 14382 references were available for title and abstract review, and 1379 underwent full text review. One hundred twenty-four experimental and observational studies published between 2003 and 2016 were selected as primary references for KAS generation, followed by an additional 269 primary references selected between August 2015 and July 2016. The LOE for the majority of references was C. In total, 30 KASs and 27 additional recommendations were generated; 12 were related to the diagnosis of HTN, 13 were related to management and additional diagnostic testing, 3 to treatment goals, and 2 to treatment options. Finally, special additions to the clinical practice guideline included creation of new BP tables based on BP values obtained solely from children with normal weight, creation of a simplified table to enhance screening and recognition of abnormal BP, and a revision of the criteria for diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy.

Conclusions

An extensive and detailed systematic approach was used to generate evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and treatment of youth with systemic HTN.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^117GgAjo]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA guideline provides 106 formal recommendations and the ESC/ESH provides 122. In both guidelines, each recommendation is characterized by a class of recommendation that specifies the strength or importance of the recommendation and by a level-of-evidence designation. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guideline committees voted on the wording and grading of each recommendation. Both guidelines provide comprehensive advice for prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high BP/hypertension. As a result, the 2 full reports are relatively long (103 pages for the ACC/AHA and 84 pages for the ESC/ESH). For ease of reading, however, the documents are divided into sections and subsections that use a similar presentation format. In addition, a variety of shorter executive summaries and brief synopses have been published. Guideline authors have published articles that expand on individual guideline topics, provide perspective for the evidence underpinning selected recommendations, and furnish quantitative estimates of potential impact based on universal application of guideline recommendations in their target populations. Last, both guidelines are complemented by publicly available slide sets, CVD risk estimation calculators, and other educational tools.

### Consistency of recommendations for evaluation and management of hypertension [^113UamHE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Box.
Criteria for Classification of Recommendations

We found inconsistent guidance for a disconcertingly high proportion of reference recommendations. This suggests that clinicians evaluating and treating hypertension are often faced with impossible expectations, in that following one guideline's recommendations would mean going against recommendations from another guideline.

Regardless of measures taken to improve CPG development, a high degree of consistency and strong guidance may be unrealistic in hypertension management. The direct evidence for precise actions is often limited, the thresholds for action are often more continuous than binary, and the relative importance of benefits and harms is sensitive to an individual patient's values and preferences.

### Pulmonary hypertension survival effects and treatment options in cystic fibrosis [^111gqY9B]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses the current impact of pulmonary hypertension on the outcome and treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF).

Recent Findings

Pulmonary hypertension is commonly encountered in advanced lung diseases such as CF. The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in CF patients varies based on disease severity and methodology used for diagnosis. Chronic alveolar hypoxia is the most likely cause. The majority of recent studies have shown worse survival in CF patients who develop pulmonary hypertension. The impact of pulmonary hypertension-specific therapies on symptomatology and outcomes in CF patients has not been well studied.

Summary

Pulmonary hypertension is common in patients with CF and it occurs largely because of hypoxemia. The presence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with CF is likely associated with worse outcome; however, it remains unknown whether treatment with pulmonary hypertension-specific therapies would be beneficial.

### Editors' commentary on the 2023 ESH management of arterial hypertension guidelines [^111HNZQC]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines are ideally suited to the provision of advice on the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure (BP). The recently published European Society of Hypertension (ESH) 2023 ESH Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension is the latest in a long series of high BP clinical practice guidelines. It closely resembles the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/ESH guidelines, with incremental rather than major changes. Although the ESH guidelines are primarily written for European clinicians and public health workers, there is a high degree of concordance between its recommendations and those in the other major BP guidelines. Despite the large number of national and international BP guidelines around the world, general population surveys demonstrate that BP guidelines are not being well implemented in any part of the world. The level of BP, which is the basis for diagnosis and management, continues to be poorly measured in routine clinical practice and control of hypertension remains suboptimal, even to a conservative BP target such as a systolic/diastolic BP < 140/90 mmHg. BP guidelines need to focus much more on implementation of recommendations for accurate diagnosis and strategies for improved control in those being treated for hypertension. An evolving body of implementation science can assist in meeting this goal. Given the enormous health, social, and financial burden of high BP, better diagnosis and management should be an imperative for clinicians, government, and others responsible for the provision of health care services. Hopefully, the 2023 ESH will help enable this.

### Novel pharmacological approaches to lowering blood pressure and managing hypertension [^11377raU]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the leading cause of death globally, primarily due to its strong association with cardiovascular disease. The global prevalence of hypertension has surged over the past three decades, driven by rising rates of diabetes mellitus and obesity. Despite current antihypertensive therapies, only a small proportion of patients with hypertension achieve adequate blood pressure control, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. In this Review we explore the challenges and emerging opportunities in hypertension management. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, is the first agent from a novel class of antihypertensive drug to be licensed since 2007 and exemplifies innovative treatments on the horizon. Here we also address the complex factors contributing to poor hypertension control, including genetic influences, lifestyle factors, therapeutic inertia and poor patient adherence. We discuss the limitations of existing therapies and highlight promising new pharmacological approaches to hypertension management. Integrating these novel treatments alongside current pharmaceuticals combined with improved diagnostic and management strategies could substantially reduce the global burden of hypertension and associated cardiovascular disease.

### Hypertensive emergencies: diagnosis and management [^111KBgwn]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of hypertension is preventive medicine. This principle applies in the emergency room as well as the clinic. However, there are crucial contrasts between these two care settings related to specific goals of management for real emergencies and nonemergency conditions. In the emergency room, rapid triage is necessary to separate those who can safely be sent home for future clinic assessment from those who require immediate interventions including short stays in 24-hour observation units or hospitalization for more serious problems. This review focuses on decisions related to hypertension management in the emergency room and over brief periods of observation and treatment. Strategy is supported by evidence-based considerations whenever possible. Where outcome studies are not available, we rely on the rationale derived from relevant clinical research.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^112FXV7A]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

The benefits of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy accrue rapidly in primary care and clinical trials. When better blood pressure (BP, mm Hg) control is achieved during the first 3 to 6 months of treatment, fewer cardiovascular events occur during this time interval. – Standard hypertension control metrics typically exclude patients during the first 6 months following diagnosis, after which time they are included. Thus, for both clinical outcomes and care quality metrics, controlling hypertension within the first 6 months after diagnosis is important.

Prompt initiation of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy is a key to realizing the time-sensitive benefits of BP reduction. Antihypertensive monotherapy is the norm for treatment initiation in clinical practice, despite evidence that monotherapy is insufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Furthermore, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association high BP guideline recommends treatment initiation with 2 different antihypertensive medications when BP is ≥ 20/ ≥ 10 mm Hg above target. Previous research indicates that not only are most adults with hypertension initiated on antihypertensive monotherapy, but also that most of them remain on monotherapy at 3 years. Moreover, half of adults with uncontrolled hypertension were on monotherapy after 8 years.

Given the evidence, our study was designed to determine if initiating treatment with antihypertensive monotherapy (TI) during the first month after the diagnosis of hypertension that was uncontrolled led to more prompt and better BP control over time than when TI did not occur in the first month. A secondary objective was to identify factors associated with the decision to initiate treatment during the first month following diagnosis of hypertension than later time points.

INTRODUCTION

The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) published several guidelines (GLs) for the management of arterial hypertension in recent years to help physicians and patients make decisions in particular disease conditions. The last one was published in 2023, the ESH 2023 guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.

The year 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the hypertension guidelines of the ESH, which were published for the first time in 2003. It is evident that guidelines – based on past collected knowledge – are important regarding diagnosis and treatment, to prevent or delay the adverse effects of hypertension.

Several studies conducted in the past few decades have shown that clinical practice guidelines, for the management of cardiovascular diseases, include a small percentage, less than 15%, of the recommendations which are supported by Level A evidence, meaning that multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses providing the highest level of evidence are not present. Furthermore, these studies also have demonstrated a steady temporal trend or small increase in Level A evidence. Based on a recent study comparing 50 clinical practice guidelines from 2011 to 2022, 16% of the recommendations were supported by the highest quality of evidence, Level A, at the same time, there was a slight global increase in Level A in recent years.

There are no systematic methods to measure quantitatively the helpfulness or quality of GLs, that is, how much help they provide to the physicians. Moreover, previous assessments/methods also pose several questions. Whether the previous analysis could provide an objective 'result' on the helpfulness of a GL, for example, based on: the frequency of recommendations and evidence, the frequency of evidence at each class of recommendation (Level by Class), or vice versa the frequency of recommendations in each level of evidence (Class by Level)? These questions underline the need to further develop the methods of assessing GLs, which can be improved by including implementation advice and translating scientific Evidence into Recommendations.

The ESH 2023 guideline was a further development of the 2018 guideline, in terms of structure and function, covering more than 40 new aspects in detail. In addition, several new clinical trials were completed in recent years, thus we have hypothesized that the 2023 guideline will provide greater help to clinicians in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. We also hypothesized that our method provides an objective assessment of the usefulness of a guideline, as a kind of 'quality control', and allows comparison of various medical guidelines.

### Case-based applications of the 2025 AHA / ACC / multispecialty high blood pressure guideline [^111Uraa4]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects nearly half of all adults in the United States and is the leading, preventable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and 11 other professional organizations recently published an updated 2025 guideline to reflect the latest advances in the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure. To bridge the gap between this guideline update and individualized patient care, this Special Article presents 4 hypothetical cases of high blood pressure, focusing on management in the outpatient setting. These cases illustrate how to apply a risk-based approach to high blood pressure management that incorporates blood pressure levels, cardiovascular disease risk factors and the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events cardiovascular disease equations. They also highlight notable updates in the 2025 guideline such as recommendations for lifestyle approaches, initiation of medications, blood pressure goals, primary aldosteronism screening, and management of high blood pressure before, during and after pregnancy. By contextualizing the 2025 guideline within these hypothetical case scenarios, this Special Article provides practical guidance to health care teams to offer the most up-to-date, evidence-based care of high blood pressure.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low-renin hypertension [^115Rnv37]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Plasma renin levels can be used to classify hypertension. A significant proportion of hypertensive individuals display a low-renin profile and thus low-renin hypertension (LRH) requires appropriate diagnosis and treatment. LRH includes essential, secondary and genetic forms, the most common of which are low-renin essential hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Several studies have investigated the relationship between PRA status and clinical response to different antihypertensive therapies. The present review will discuss the differential diagnosis of LRH subtypes and the most appropriate treatment options based on the pathophysiological background of this condition.

This assessment "includes evaluation of the duration of therapy, the expected response to the therapy, the observed response to the therapy, and the patient's severity of illness and pace of decline", and "symptomatic limitation of desired physical activities usually guides these decisions".

CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES

Thus far, investigative efforts and hypertension guidelines, with the notable exception of the 2017 AHA Hypertension Guidelines, have devoted most attention to phenotypic characterization, that is to the measurement of BP and confirming the diagnosis of hypertension, and to provide recommendation or suggestions for drug treatment. Quite weird, in a time when the hot topic in Medicine is a precision approach, little focus has been put on the search for ascertaining the patophysiology and the causes of human arterial hypertension. Therefore, the time has come, in the field of clinical research in arterial hypertension, to move from a phenotypic/observational approach to mechanistic investigation. From the research standpoint, this means moving resources towards investigation to identify novel molecular targets, with the goal of developing strategies for a tailored individual management approach with use of mRNA technology, as recently done. This could eventually allow long-term cure of high BP, better outcome for patients and substantial savings of the financial resources that are currently devoted to life-long pharmacological treatment of hypertension. From the practical standpoint, this implies undertaking a systematic search for the cause(s) of hypertension and, therefore, identification of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. Discovering secondary hypertension is the premise for instituting a targeted treatment, which is usually more effective and, in several instances, curative as shown for primary aldosteronism.

### Blood pressure measurement and treatment decisions [^116xZsFU]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

White-coat and masked hypertension are important hypertension phenotypes. Out-of-office blood pressure measurement is essential for the accurate diagnosis and monitoring of these conditions. This review summarizes literature related to the detection and diagnosis, prevalence, epidemiology, prognosis, and treatment of white-coat and masked hypertension. Cardiovascular risk in white-coat hypertension appears to be dependent on the presence of coexisting risk factors, whereas patients with masked hypertension are at increased risk of target organ damage and cardiovascular events. There is an unmet need for robust data to support recommendations around the use of antihypertensive treatment for the management of white-coat and masked hypertension.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^115XM7jZ]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, the ACC/AHA categorization is simpler and captures more of the BP-related risk for CVD. However, it results in a larger challenge for health care professionals compared with the ESC/ESH or preceding Joint National Committee 7 Report because (1) it designates hypertension in a higher percentage of adults and (2) there is need to assess underlying atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk for treatment decisions, especially in adults with ACC/AHA stage 1 hypertension (outlined in the CVD risk assessment section). The ESC/ESH classification system has more BP categories but provides a simpler approach to decisions for the administration of antihypertensive drug therapy, unchanged from the previous European guideline recommendations.

Convergence of Guidelines

The thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension established in guidelines are benchmarks for distinguishing health from disease. Most guidelines still recommend 140/90 mm Hg as the threshold for diagnosis and goal of treatment. The evidence that these values can be lower than 140/90 mm Hg, such as 130/80 mm Hg, proposed by the 2017 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines, is progressively more robust. The predicted benefit size of BP reduction corresponds closely to the observed benefit demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, providing mathematical (Cartesian) evidence of causality.

The convergence of guidelines in establishing simplified and lower thresholds for diagnosis and treatment can reduce BP globally. The recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines moved a bit in the direction of the values of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines and withdrew the additional classification of BP in patients with hypertension. The numbers, however, became more complex, with 120/70 mm Hg as the limit of normal and abnormal, 140/90 mm Hg for the diagnosis, and 130/80 or 140/90 mm Hg as the goals for treatment, depending on the cardiovascular risk of patients.

Patients have a dichotomic view of health and disease. For > 60 years, doctors have been convincing asymptomatic individuals that they are sick on the basis of 2 numbers that they barely understand. Lowering BP levels for the diagnosis of hypertension would increase the proportion of patients with uncontrolled BP. However, the mean BP of populations would become lower, reducing the burden of high BP.

Another simplification in the diagnosis could be to consider using only systolic BP for the diagnosis and goal of treatment. Until the publication of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, the diagnosis of hypertension was based only on the values of diastolic BP. Maintaining a diastolic criterion for the diagnosis considers increasing diastolic BP before increasing systolic BP. If a stricter criterion for the diagnosis is based on systolic BP, say 120 mm Hg (or 100 mm Hg in the future), the corresponding diastolic BP would also be lower.

The global use of lower BP goals and only systolic BP for diagnosis may not influence personal adherence to treatment. Still, doctors and patients would be involved in more intensive treatment of high BP, making it easier for patients to understand the diagnosis. The left shift of the BP distribution curve would increase the number of individuals with controlled BP values.

### 2022 ESC / ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^111GDaua]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Congenital heart disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) — therapy in other anatomical contexts and transplant options are qualified. The effect of PAH therapies in patients with prevalent systemic-to-pulmonary shunts is less well established, but patients with small/coincidental defects should be treated with PAH medication. Patients with PAH after defect correction have increased mortality compared with those with Eisenmenger syndrome and should be evaluated based on comprehensive risk assessment. The role of PAH therapies in segmental pulmonary hypertension remains a matter of debate, and Fontan circulation results are conflicting, with further studies awaited. Heart–lung transplantation or lung transplantation with heart surgery is an option in highly selected cases not responsive to medical treatment; this approach is limited by organ availability and lesion complexity, and mortality is high during the first year after surgery, especially after heart–lung transplantation, although it remains relatively low thereafter.

### Hypertension care cascades and reducing inequities in cardiovascular disease in low-and middle-income countries [^113Vg6gv]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Improving hypertension control in low- and middle-income countries has uncertain implications across socioeconomic groups. In this study, we simulated improvements in the hypertension care cascade and evaluated the distributional benefits across wealth quintiles in 44 low- and middle-income countries using individual-level data from nationally representative, cross-sectional surveys. We raised diagnosis (diagnosis scenario) and treatment (treatment scenario) levels for all wealth quintiles to match the best-performing country quintile and estimated the change in 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk of individuals initiated on treatment. We observed greater health benefits among bottom wealth quintiles in middle-income countries and in countries with larger baseline disparities in hypertension management. Lower-middle-income countries would see the greatest absolute benefits among the bottom quintiles under the treatment scenario (29.1 CVD cases averted per 1,000 people living with hypertension in the bottom quintile (Q1) versus 17.2 in the top quintile (Q5)), and the proportion of total CVD cases averted would be largest among the lowest quintiles in upper-middle-income countries under both diagnosis (32.0% of averted cases in Q1 versus 11.9% in Q5) and treatment (29.7% of averted cases in Q1 versus 14.0% in Q5) scenarios. Targeted improvements in hypertension diagnosis and treatment could substantially reduce socioeconomic-based inequalities in CVD burden in low- and middle-income countries.

### The practical challenges of diagnosis and treatment options in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn: a developing country's perspective [^1172EzE5]. American Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a complication of several respiratory diseases characterized by an elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance with resultant right-to-left shunting of blood and severe hypoxemia in the neonatal period. PPHN carries a high rate of morbidity and mortality, particularly in limited-resource settings (low-income and/or developing country). Echocardiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis of PPHN. Modern therapies such as inhaled nitric oxide, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and/or other pulmonary vasodilators agents can reduce the mortality rate of PPHN. Unfortunately, echocardiography and the use of these modern therapies are often difficult for a medical institution to provide for patients in developing countries, even when a timely diagnosis of PPHN has been made. In this review, the practical challenges of timely diagnosis of PPHN and efficient use of available treatment options faced by pediatricians or neonatologists in limited-resource settings are discussed.

Introduction

Hypertension affects > 1 billion people globally and is the number one risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although many different classes of antihypertensive drug are available, side effects of drugs resulting in variable patient adherence are problematic. Additional drug therapies are therefore needed with excellent tolerability profiles in addition to proven safety and efficacy. Moreover, for those patients who either do not wish to take drugs lifelong or who experience disabling adverse effects from drug therapy, non-pharmacological measures over and above lifestyle modification are urgently required. We consider the newly emerging field of interventional procedures for hypertension and also what is on the horizon for novel pharmacological approaches to improve BP control.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^116hGNTt]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

Adults with untreated and uncontrolled hypertension are more likely to achieve BP control to < 140/ < 90 in the first 6 months after diagnosis when antihypertensive monotherapy is initiated during the first month of diagnosis than at later time points. Moreover, improved control was sustained for 30 months following diagnosis in this initially treated group compared with the group that was not treated in the first month after diagnosis. While patients initiated on monotherapy during the first month following diagnosis of hypertension achieved higher control rates than individuals initiated at later time points, > 30% remained uncontrolled at 3 years, indicating a need for more frequent treatment intensification. Confirming an uncontrolled BP during the visit was associated with a greater probability of treatment initiation. Importantly, hypertension control during the first 6 months after diagnosis provides greater cardiovascular protection than delayed control.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^115JkN71]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review and discuss the clinical presentation and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Discussion

Visual alterations and headache are the two main symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, although additional features including cranial nerve palsies, cognitive deficits, olfactory deficits and tinnitus are not uncommon. The headache associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension frequently has a migrainous phenotype. The underlying cause of the disorder has not yet been elucidated. Several hypotheses have been postulated but none of them can explain the full clinical picture. Therapeutic options remain limited, focusing mainly on reduction in body weight and the reduction of CSF production with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

Conclusion

The accurate diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is essential as visual deterioration due to papilledema may be irreversible. Given its phenotypic similarity and frequent overlap with chronic migraine it is essential to consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the diagnostic workup of chronic headache; in particular, when considering its increasing prevalence. Understanding in detail the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the associated headache would also allow study of current and future therapeutic options in a structured way.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension: the task force for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), endorsed by the international society of heart and lung transplantation (ISHLT) [^114Tbabo]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) investigational strategies — emerging compounds and cellular approaches — span multiple pathways and phases. Phase II and III studies are currently being performed with the following compounds: NO-independent stimulators and activators of cGMP, inhaled vaso-active intestinal peptide, non-prostanoid prostacyclin receptor agonists, tissue dual ERA-, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (platelet-derived growth factor inhibitors), and serotonin antagonists. Earlier development targets include rho-kinase inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors, angiopoietin-1 inhibitors, and elastase inhibitors. Gene therapy strategies have been tested in animal models, and stem cell therapy has proven to be effective in the monocrotaline rat model and is currently being tested in proof-of-concept and dose-finding studies in PAH patients.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116nKqcH]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to choice of antihypertensives, initial therapy, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to initiate combination BP-lowering treatment in most patients with confirmed HTN (BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg) as initial therapy. Prefer combining a renin-angiotensin system blocker (either an ACEi or an ARB) with a dihydropyridine CCB or diuretic. Avoid initiating combination treatment in patients aged ≥ 85 years, and patients with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, moderate-to-severe frailty, or elevated BP (SBP 120–139 mmHg or DBP 70–89 mmHg) with a concomitant indication for treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension [^1172vRSa]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains above the therapeutic goal despite concurrent use of at least three antihypertensive agents of different classes, including a diuretic, with all agents administered at maximum or maximally tolerated doses. Resistant hypertension is also diagnosed if blood pressure control requires four or more antihypertensive drugs. Assessment requires the exclusion of apparent treatment resistant hypertension, which is most often the result of non-adherence to treatment. Resistant hypertension is associated with major cardiovascular events in the short and long term, including heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and renal failure. Guidelines from several professional organizations recommend lifestyle modification and antihypertensive drugs. Medications typically include an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a long acting thiazide-type/like diuretic; if a fourth drug is needed, evidence supports addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. After a long pause since 2007 when the last antihypertensive class was approved, several novel agents are now under active development. Some of these may provide potent blood pressure lowering in broad groups of patients, such as aldosterone synthase inhibitors and dual endothelin receptor antagonists, whereas others may provide benefit by allowing treatment of resistant hypertension in special populations, such as non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with chronic kidney disease. Several device based approaches have been tested, with renal denervation being the best supported and only approved interventional device treatment for resistant hypertension.

### Hypertension: new guidelines from the international… [^111tqVq5]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Use an average threshold of 140/90 mm Hg for office diagnosis of hypertension, but 135/85 mm Hg for home and 130/80 mm Hg for 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.
- Initial assessment in a patient who is hypertensive should evaluate for cardiovascular risk and any hypertension-mediated organ damage. Diagnosis Because blood pressure readings vary by measurement technique, diagnostic criteria are specific to the technique. In health care settings that include the physician's office, hypertension is diagnosed when BP is 140/90 mm Hg or greater, ideally using an electronic device and following standard protocols for measurement, including repeat measurements. The ISH recommends categorizing grade 1 hypertension for BP levels less than 160/100 mm Hg and grade 2 hypertension for any higher BP levels.

Hypertension should only be diagnosed from a single BP reading if the measurement is 180/110 mm Hg or higher with evidence of cardiovascular disease requiring immediate treatment. Otherwise, the patient should be reassessed every one to four weeks to confirm BP elevations. When BP is measured at home, hypertension is diagnosed if readings are consistently 135/85 mm Hg or greater. With 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, hypertension is diagnosed based on one of three criteria: 24-hour average BP of 130/80 mm Hg or greater, daytime average BP of 135/85 mm Hg or greater, or nighttime average BP of 120/70 mm Hg or greater. Assessment After diagnosing hypertension, further assessment is recommended to identify cardiovascular risk factors and signs of hypertension-mediated organ damage. The cardiovascular risk factors of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, or nicotine use affect one-half of people with hypertension.

In addition to history and physical examination, a cost-effective assessment includes serum chemistry levels, fasting glucose level, fasting lipid panel, urinalysis, and electrocardiography. The ISH guidelines, which were assembled using reviews of the ACC/AHA guidelines and six other international guidelines, overcome this conflict by providing separate diagnostic thresholds based on measurement techniques. Treatment targets are 140/90 mm Hg for the initial months of treatment and for older adults, reflecting concerns noted by the AAFP. The AAFP will not endorse the ISH guidelines because of their summary nature, but the ISH guidelines provide family physicians with a concise guide for treating hypertension that aligns well with our clinical practice. — Michael J.

### Pulmonary hypertension: diagnosis and treatment… [^113AyMPr]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

A patient with advanced right heart failure will have jugular venous distention, edema and ascites. To meet the National Institutes of Health criteria for diagnosis of PPH, the mean pulmonary artery pressure must be greater than 25 mm Hg at rest or greater than 30 mm Hg in response to exercise. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. A patient suspected of having PPH should be given certain diagnostic tests, including a chest radiograph; a ventilation-perfusion scan; an echocardiogram; and pulmonary function tests.

Blood tests may be needed to exclude secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension, including antinuclear antibody, human immunodeficiency virus tests, liver function tests and hepatitis serology tests. A lung biopsy is necessary only in rare cases when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain. Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is directed at the underlying etiology. For example, patients with emphysema should be treated with long-term oxygen therapy, bronchodilators and steroids to reduce the pulmonary artery pressure. Afterload reduction and diuretics are part of the therapy in patients with left ventricular dysfunction causing pulmonary venous disease. A patient with mitral valve disease may need valve repair or replacement to reduce the chronically elevated left atrial pressure. A patient with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension will need to be treated indefinitely with anticoagulation therapy, an inferior vena cava filter and a thromboendarterectomy to open the lumen.

Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension usually have the following conditions: in situ thrombosis caused by endothelial dysfunction, smooth muscle hypertrophy and intimal and adventitial proliferation. Right heart catheterization confirms the diagnosis and helps to determine the most appropriate therapy when performed in conjunction with a vasodilator trial. Specific treatments that address each of these pathologic changes include warfarin to maintain an International Normalized Ratio between 1. 7 and
2. 2, vasodilators and continuous intravenous epoprostenol. The hemodynamic measurements obtained can predict a patient's life expectancy.
