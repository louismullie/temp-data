## Question

MOA droperidol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of action of droperidol. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about its primary pharmacologic class and dopamine D2 antagonism. Then, I should examine secondary targets like cardiac HERG channel blockade and other receptor/channel interactions. Next, I will connect these mechanisms to therapeutic effects and adverse events, review dose–response and onset/offset, outline practical indications with dosing, and finally align this with monitoring, boxed warnings, and special populations, making sure to verify conflicting data as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic identity and core mechanism before I go further. Droperidol is a butyrophenone first-generation antipsychotic whose principal action is potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonism in the chemoreceptor trigger zone and mesolimbic pathways, producing antiemetic, antipsychotic, and sedative effects, with a rapid onset of 3–10 minutes and peak at about 30 minutes, and typical sedative duration of 2–4 hours, though residual effects can persist up to 12 hours [^116tkPkY] [^115HZ8aA] [^114e9ymx].

> Wait, let me verify the secondary mechanisms because they drive key safety issues. Droperidol blocks the cardiac IKr current by inhibiting the human ether-à-go-go–related gene (HERG/Kv11.1) channel with submicromolar potency, demonstrating state- and use-dependent block and involving the S6 residue F656, which mechanistically explains dose-related QT interval prolongation and the risk for torsades de pointes in susceptible settings [^111HZsDB] [^1159KE7P]. I also need to check CNS receptor/channel effects beyond D2: in vitro, droperidol inhibits GABAA currents at low-nanomolar concentrations and also inhibits neuronal nicotinic receptors at micromolar levels, and it suppresses delayed-rectifier K+ and fast Na+ currents in spinal neurons at micromolar ranges, which could modulate neuronal excitability and contribute to analgesic or sedative interactions, especially with other CNS depressants [^112hSBbw] [^116dGMZX]. Hmm, wait a minute — I initially framed GABAA inhibition as anxiogenic based on oocyte data; however, clinically droperidol produces tranquilization and sedation, so D2 antagonism and network-level effects likely dominate patient-level behavior, and the in vitro GABAA findings may not translate straightforwardly to clinical anxiogenesis at therapeutic concentrations [^116tkPkY] [^112hSBbw].

> I will now translate mechanisms into therapeutic effects, but hold on, I should verify dose ranges and routes. For antiemesis, the labeled adult regimen is up to 2.5 mg IV as a slow injection with optional 1.25 mg repeats; low-dose strategies as small as 0.25–1 mg are effective for PONV prevention in trials, and combinations with ondansetron behave additively for PONV risk reduction, consistent with complementary serotonergic and dopaminergic blockade in the CTZ and vomiting center [^117SxVir] [^1161btcn] [^1137q7LD]. For agitation or psychosis, typical ED practice uses 5–10 mg IM or IV, with evidence that droperidol (5–10 mg) is effective alone and even more rapidly sedating when combined with midazolam, aligning with D2 antagonism plus GABAergic potentiation from the benzodiazepine [^114Me1Dt] [^1171faXa] [^114JXAqM] [^11684tQF] [^113cef4W]. For migraines and opioid-related symptoms, clinicians use 2.5 mg IM for migraine and 2.5–5 mg IV for opioid-induced pruritus, while cannabinoid hyperemesis has been treated with 0.625 mg IV, reflecting antiemetic D2 actions with additional analgesic and sedative contributions in select syndromes [^114HsSeR] [^113EKkhy] [^1166PsbJ]. Let me reconsider onset and duration claims: the label's onset 3–10 minutes, peak 30 minutes, and 2–4 hour duration holds across these indications and is consistent with ED sedation time-to-effect observations [^116tkPkY] [^11684tQF].

> Next, I should review the cardiac safety implications mechanistically and operationally. Because HERG blockade prolongs repolarization, droperidol carries a boxed warning for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, with reported events even at or below recommended doses and occasionally without obvious risk factors, prompting a requirement to obtain a 12‑lead ECG before administration, avoid use if QTc > 440 ms (men) or > 450 ms (women), and continuously monitor ECG for 2–3 hours after dosing, especially when the benefit is judged to outweigh risk in higher-risk patients [^115HZ8aA] [^117UWqV5] [^1117o7ap]. I should double-check the dose–QTc relationship: in a perioperative cohort without overt heart disease, 0.1–0.25 mg/kg IV increased median QTc by about 37–59 ms within 10 minutes, supporting a clear, dose-related repolarization effect consistent with its IKr blockade [^117UWqV5]. But wait, what about real-world ED safety signals? Large observational cohorts report no deaths attributable to droperidol and a very low arrhythmia incidence with typical ED dosing and monitoring, suggesting serious proarrhythmia is rare in practice, though this does not negate the labeled monitoring requirements [^111N5qgJ] [^116Y5UKM].

> I need to ensure I cover non-cardiac adverse effects and their mechanistic underpinnings. Extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, and acute dystonia arise from D2 blockade in nigrostriatal pathways and are recognized adverse reactions; these typically respond to anticholinergics, and clinicians should actively differentiate akathisia from anxiety or agitation at the bedside [^11583LoC] [^111nGVrz]. Droperidol can also produce mild alpha-adrenergic blockade with hypotension and tachycardia; fluids should be available and CNS depressant coadministration warrants caution due to additive sedation, which fits with its observed BIS-lowering interaction during propofol sedation and clinical potentiation when combined with benzodiazepines [^116tkPkY] [^117UWqV5] [^114P1sCy] [^11684tQF].

> Let me think about dose–response and time course across use cases, just to confirm clinical expectations. Low antiemetic doses around 0.625–1.25 mg reduce early and late PONV with favorable numbers needed to treat and minimal sedation, while QTc effects can still occur, underscoring the importance of screening and correction of electrolytes even at "low" doses [^1161btcn] [^117UWqV5]. Moderate doses around 5 mg provide effective sedation for agitation with typical sedation by about 10–20 minutes IV/IM, and combination regimens with midazolam accelerate onset and reduce the need for rescue dosing, consistent with synergistic pharmacodynamics [^114JXAqM] [^11684tQF] [^113oi9bt]. I should confirm duration once more: tranquilizing and sedative effects usually last 2–4 hours, though altered alertness may persist up to 12 hours, which is relevant for ED observation and discharge planning [^116tkPkY].

> Hold on, I should verify how to reconcile differing guidance on pre-use ECGs. The FDA labeling is explicit about obtaining a 12‑lead ECG prior to dosing and continuing ECG monitoring for 2–3 hours post‑dose, avoiding use with prolonged QTc or high-risk profiles, and exercising extreme caution with concomitant QT-prolonging drugs or electrolyte abnormalities, which should guide practice, even though some emergency medicine reviews argue that routine ECGs may be unnecessary in low-risk patients; in case of conflict, local policy and the FDA label should prevail while individual risk stratification remains essential [^115HZ8aA] [^1117o7ap] [^114e9ymx] [^116h2X3D].

> I will now examine special populations and pediatric considerations, as I need to ensure safe extrapolation. Pregnancy requires a risk–benefit decision given category C classification and reports of fetal harm, and renal impairment or dialysis states warrant caution due to limited data, even though no specific dose adjustments are defined in labeling for eGFR reductions or dialysis modalities [^112g2iTd] [^112znGDF] [^112SGVYn] [^113wWz93] [^114XYkd4] [^112QfJhe] [^115McMin]. For pediatrics, labeled dosing for PONV prevention is 0.1 mg/kg IV with caution, and RCTs in pediatric strabismus suggest dose-dependent antiemetic efficacy, but the agitation literature is limited and at risk of bias; reported pediatric QTc prolongation cases are confounded, with no pediatric torsades identified in the summarized series, so careful monitoring and conservative dosing remain prudent [^116iB8yF] [^116fBWaT] [^1127jtDj] [^111NYhxj] [^112h2a7a].

> To synthesize and close the loop, droperidol's primary clinical actions flow from dopamine D2 antagonism, yielding antiemetic, sedative, and antipsychotic effects, while its most consequential safety signal arises from HERG channel blockade leading to dose‑related QT prolongation and rare torsades de pointes; thoughtful patient selection, ECG-based risk mitigation, and attention to electrolytes and interacting drugs optimize benefit–risk across indications including PONV, acute agitation, migraine, cannabinoid hyperemesis, and opioid‑induced pruritus, with real‑world data supporting effectiveness and low arrhythmic event rates when used appropriately in monitored settings [^116tkPkY] [^111HZsDB] [^115HZ8aA] [^111N5qgJ].

---

Droperidol's mechanism of action **primarily involves D2 antagonism** in the chemoreceptor trigger zone [^116tkPkY], producing antiemetic effects [^115A4dTG], and **IKr (hERG) blockade** [^111HZsDB] in cardiac myocytes [^1159KE7P], which prolongs the QT interval and increases the risk of torsades de pointes [^117UWqV5]. It also causes alpha-adrenergic blockade [^116tkPkY], contributing to hypotension, and interacts with GABA and nicotinic receptors [^112hSBbw], which augment its sedative profile [^114P1sCy]. These actions explain its clinical uses and safety concerns [^114e9ymx], including the **FDA boxed warning** [^115HZ8aA] for QT prolongation and arrhythmias [^1117o7ap].

---

## Dopamine D2 receptor antagonism

- **Primary mechanism**: Droperidol's antiemetic and antipsychotic effects stem from antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and central nervous system (CNS) [^116tkPkY].

- **Antiemetic effect**: D2 blockade in the CTZ suppresses nausea and vomiting, supporting its use for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) [^115A4dTG] [^1161btcn].

- **Antipsychotic and sedative effects**: Central D2 antagonism produces sedation, tranquilization, and anxiolysis, useful for acute agitation and psychosis [^116tkPkY] [^114JXAqM].

---

## Cardiac ion channel blockade and QT prolongation

- **IKr (hERG) channel blockade**: Droperidol potently inhibits the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), encoded by hERG, prolonging ventricular repolarization and the QT interval [^111HZsDB] [^1159KE7P].

- **QT prolongation and torsades de pointes**: QT prolongation can precipitate torsades de pointes [^117UWqV5], ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death, even at recommended doses [^115HZ8aA].

- **Dose-dependent effect**: QT prolongation occurs within 10 minutes of administration and is dose-dependent [^117UWqV5].

---

## Alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade

Droperidol produces mild **alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade**, leading to peripheral vasodilation, reduced peripheral vascular resistance, and hypotension [^116tkPkY]. Clinically, this may manifest as orthostatic hypotension, particularly when combined with other CNS depressants [^114tuj64] or in patients with compromised cardiovascular function.

---

## Interaction with GABA and nicotinic receptors

Droperidol inhibits **GABA(A) and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors**, contributing to sedation and anxiolysis. These interactions enhance sedation and may explain its use in anesthesia and sedation protocols.

---

## Clinical implications and safety considerations

- **FDA boxed warning**: Due to QT prolongation and torsades risk, droperidol carries a boxed warning; ECG monitoring is recommended before and after administration [^115HZ8aA] [^117UWqV5].

- **Contraindications**: Avoid in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, congenital long QT syndrome, or those on QT-prolonging drugs [^115HZ8aA] [^1117o7ap].

- **Adverse effects**: Common effects include hypotension, sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and rare but serious arrhythmias [^11583LoC] [^111nGVrz].

---

Droperidol's mechanism of action centers on **D2 antagonism** [^116tkPkY] for antiemetic and sedative effects, with clinically significant **IKr blockade** [^111HZsDB] that prolongs the QT interval and can cause torsades [^115HZ8aA]. Alpha-adrenergic and GABA/nicotinic interactions further define its pharmacology and safety profile.

### Molecular interaction of droperidol with human ether-a-go-go-related gene channels: Prolongation of action potential duration without inducing early afterdepolarization [^1159KE7P]. Anesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

The cardiac safety of droperidol given at antiemetic doses is a matter of debate. Although droperidol potently inhibits human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channels, the molecular mode of this interaction is unknown. The role of amino acid residues typically mediating high-affinity block of HERG channels is unclear. It is furthermore unresolved whether droperidol at antiemetic concentrations induces action potential prolongation and arrhythmogenic early afterdepolarizations in cardiac myocytes.

- **Methods**: Molecular mechanisms of HERG inhibition by droperidol were established using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings of Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant channels. The mutants T623A, S624A, V625A, Y652A, and F656A were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The effect of droperidol on action potentials was investigated in cardiac myocytes isolated from guinea pig hearts using the patch clamp technique.

- **Results**: Droperidol inhibited currents through HERG wild-type channels with a concentration of half-maximal inhibition of 0.6–0.9 µM. Droperidol shifted the channel activation and the steady state inactivation toward negative potentials while channel deactivation was not affected. Inhibition increased with membrane potential and with increasing duration of activation. Inhibition of HERG channels was similarly reduced by all mutations. Droperidol at concentrations between 5 and 100 nM prolonged whereas concentrations greater than 300 nM shortened action potentials. Early afterdepolarizations were not observed.

### Inhibition of the HERG channel by droperidol depends on channel gating and involves the S6 residue F656 [^111HZsDB]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Droperidol has a central antiemetic action and is widely used in the fields of psychiatry, anesthesia, and emergency medicine. It has been associated with the prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, and it may also be associated with torsades de pointes and sudden death. Although QT prolongation is consistent with droperidol-induced increases in cardiac ventricular action potential duration, the cellular mechanism for these observations has not been clearly studied. The rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel, IKr, is a primary site of action of drugs causing QT prolongation and is encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG). To determine the mechanism underlying these clinical findings, we investigated the effect of droperidol on human HERG potassium channels.

- **Methods**: Wild type and mutant HERG channels were heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and the activity was recorded using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique at temperatures ranging from 22 to 24 degrees Celsius.

- **Results**: HERG tail currents following test pulses to 50 mV were inhibited by droperidol with an IC(50) of 77.3 ± 9.6 nM (n = 8). The onset of block was fast, and the inhibition was completely reversible upon washout. Droperidol affected HERG channels mainly in their open and inactivated states. The effects were use-dependent, with a stronger steady-state level of block at higher frequencies. The activation curve was slightly shifted towards more negative potentials (P < 0.05, n = 8), and the time course of inactivation was significantly decreased (P < 0.05, n = 8).

### Droperidol [^115HZ8aA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Cases of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes have been reported in patients receiving droperidol at doses at or below the recommended doses. Some cases have occurred in patients with no known risk factors for QT prolongation, and some cases have been fatal.

Due to its potential for serious proarrhythmic effects and death, droperidol should be reserved for patients who fail to show an acceptable response to other adequate treatments. This failure could be due to insufficient effectiveness or the inability to achieve an effective dose because of intolerable adverse effects from those drugs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Cases of QT prolongation and serious arrhythmias (e.g. torsade de pointes) have been reported in patients treated with droperidol. Based on these reports, all patients should undergo a 12-lead ECG prior to the administration of droperidol to determine if a prolonged QT interval (i.e. QTc greater than 440 msec for males or 450 msec for females) is present. If there is a prolonged QT interval, droperidol should not be administered. For patients in whom the potential benefit of droperidol treatment is felt to outweigh the risks of potentially serious arrhythmias, ECG monitoring should be performed prior to treatment and continued for 2–3 hours after completing treatment to monitor for arrhythmias.

Droperidol is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, including those with congenital long QT syndrome. Use droperidol with extreme caution in patients who may develop QT prolongation.

### Droperidol inhibits GABA(A) and neuronal nicotinic receptor activation [^112hSBbw]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Droperidol is used in neuroleptanesthesia and as an antiemetic. Although its antiemetic effect is thought to be caused by dopaminergic inhibition, the mechanism of droperidol's anesthetic action is unknown. Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been implicated as putative targets of other general anesthetic drugs; therefore, the authors tested the ability of droperidol to modulate these receptors.

- **Methods**: Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A alpha1beta1gamma2 receptor, alpha7, and alpha4beta2 nAChRs were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied using two-electrode voltage clamp recording. The authors tested the ability of droperidol at concentrations ranging from 1 nm to 100 microm to modulate activation of these receptors by their native agonists.

- **Results**: Droperidol inhibited the GABA response by a maximum of 24.7 ± 3.0%. The IC50 for inhibition was 12.6 ± 0.47 nm droperidol. At high concentrations, droperidol (100 microm) activates the GABAA receptor in the absence of GABA. Inhibition of the GABA response is significantly greater at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. The activation of the alpha7 nAChR is also inhibited by droperidol, with an IC50 of 5.8 ± 0.53 microm. The Hill coefficient is 0.95 ± 0.1. Inhibition is noncompetitive, and membrane voltage dependence is insignificant.

- **Conclusions**: Droperidol inhibits activation of both the GABAA alpha1beta1gamma2 and alpha7 nAChR. The submaximal GABA inhibition occurs within a concentration range such that it might be responsible for the anxiety and dysphoria observed during usage.

### Droperidol [^116tkPkY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Droperidol produces marked tranquilization and sedation. It allays apprehension and provides a state of mental detachment and indifference while maintaining a state of reflex alertness.

Droperidol produces an antiemetic effect, as evidenced by the antagonism of apomorphine in dogs. It lowers the incidence of nausea and vomiting during surgical procedures and provides antiemetic protection in the postoperative period.

Droperidol potentiates other CNS depressants. It produces mild alpha-adrenergic blockade, peripheral vascular dilatation, and reduction of the pressor effect of epinephrine. It can produce hypotension and decreased peripheral vascular resistance and may decrease pulmonary arterial pressure (particularly if it is abnormally high). It may reduce the incidence of epinephrine-induced arrhythmias, but it does not prevent other cardiac arrhythmias.

The onset of action of single intramuscular and intravenous doses is from three to ten minutes following administration, although the peak effect may not be apparent for up to thirty minutes. The duration of the tranquilizing and sedative effects generally is two to four hours, although alteration of alertness may persist for as long as twelve hours.

### Droperidol [^117UWqV5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Effects on cardiac conduction**: A dose-dependent prolongation of the QT interval was observed within 10 minutes of droperidol administration in a study of 40 patients without known cardiac disease who underwent extracranial head and neck surgery. Significant QT prolongation was observed at all three dose levels evaluated, with 0.1, 0.175, and 0.25 mg/kg associated with prolongation of median QTc by 37, 44, and 59 msec, respectively.

	- Cases of QT prolongation and serious arrhythmias (e.g. torsade de pointes, ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and death) have been observed during post-marketing treatment with droperidol. Some cases have occurred in patients with no known risk factors and at doses at or below recommended doses. There has been at least one case of nonfatal torsade de pointes confirmed by rechallenge.

	- Based on these reports, all patients should undergo a 12-lead ECG prior to administration of droperidol to determine if a prolonged QT interval (i.e. QTc greater than 440 msec for males or 450 msec for females) is present. If there is a prolonged QT interval, droperidol should NOT be administered. For patients in whom the potential benefit of droperidol treatment is felt to outweigh the risks of potentially serious arrhythmias, ECG monitoring should be performed prior to treatment and continued for 2–3 hours after completing treatment to monitor for arrhythmias.

	- Fluids and other countermeasures to manage hypotension should be readily available. As with other CNS depressant drugs, patients who have received droperidol should have appropriate surveillance.

### Rescue sedation after 5 mg or 10 mg of droperidol as the initial treatment for acute agitation in the emergency department [^113WhMJw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Droperidol is commonly used to treat agitation in the emergency department (ED); however, data comparing different doses are lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 5 mg vs. 10 mg as the initial droperidol dose for acute agitation in the ED.

- **Methods**: This single-center, retrospective study examined adult ED patients receiving either 5 mg or 10 mg droperidol as the first agent to treat agitation from 2010 to 2023. The primary outcome was the need for additional (rescue) sedation within 1 hour of the initial droperidol dose.

- **Results**: The authors identified 11,568 patients who received droperidol as their first medication (n = 8603 [74%] via intramuscular route); 10,293 received 5 mg and 1275 received 10 mg. The median age was 39 years (interquartile range 28–50 years), and 8372 (72%) were male. Rescue sedation within 1 hour was administered to 987 patients (9.6%) in the 5-mg group and 189 patients (14.8%) in the 10-mg group (difference 5.2%; 95% CI 3.2–7.3%). Additional sedation at any time was administered to 1776 patients (17.3%) in the 5-mg group and 318 (24.9%) in the 10-mg group (difference 7.7%; 95% CI 5.2–10.2%). The median length of stay was 471 minutes (interquartile range 347–611 minutes) in the 5 mg group and 487 minutes (interquartile range 364–641 minutes) in the 10-mg group (median difference 24 minutes; 95% CI 11–37 minutes).

- **Conclusions**: In this large cohort, patients deemed appropriately treated with 5 mg of droperidol required less rescue sedation than patients determined to need 10 mg.

### Intravenous midazolam-droperidol combination, droperidol or olanzapine monotherapy for methamphetamine-related acute agitation: Subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial [^113cef4W]. Addiction (2017). High credibility.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of (1) midazolam-droperidol versus droperidol and (2) midazolam-droperidol versus olanzapine for methamphetamine-related acute agitation.

- **Design and setting**: A multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, controlled, clinical trial was conducted in two Australian emergency departments, between October 2014 and September 2015.

- **Participants**: 361 patients, aged 18–65 years, requiring intravenous medication sedation for acute agitation, were enrolled in this study. We report the results of a subgroup of 92 methamphetamine-affected patients.

- **Intervention and comparator**: Patients were assigned randomly to receive either an intravenous bolus of midazolam 5 mg-droperidol 5 mg combined, droperidol 10 mg, or olanzapine 10 mg. Two additional doses were administered if required: midazolam 5 mg, droperidol 5 mg, or olanzapine 5 mg, respectively.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients sedated adequately at 10 minutes. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (ORs, 95% CI) were estimated.

- **Findings**: The baseline characteristics of patients in the three groups were similar. At 10 minutes, significantly more patients in the midazolam-droperidol group [29 of 34 (85.3%)] were sedated adequately compared with the droperidol group [14 of 30 (46.7%), OR = 6.63, 95% CI = 2.02–21.78] or with the olanzapine group [14 of 28 (50.0%), OR = 5.80, 95% CI = 1.74–19.33]. The number of patients who experienced an adverse event (AE) in the midazolam-droperidol, droperidol, and olanzapine groups was seven of 34, two of 30.

### Treating primary headaches in the ED: Can droperidol regain its role [^11617NwN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the use and efficacy of low-dose (≤ 2 mg) droperidol for the treatment of primary headaches (i.e. migraine, cluster, tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, and other primary headaches) in the emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: A report was generated from a pharmacy database to identify all adult patients who received low-dose droperidol in the ED over a 7-month period; a subsequent retrospective chart review was conducted. Low-dose droperidol was defined as a cumulative dose of ≤ 2 mg. Patients who received droperidol for any other reason than the treatment of a headache were excluded. Data were analyzed descriptively.

- **Results**: Seventy-three cases in which droperidol was administered for the treatment of a headache were identified over the 7-month period. Most doses (92%) administered were 1.25 mg or less. Fifty-three patients (73%) had complete resolution or significant improvement of headache symptoms as subjectively or objectively (e.g. numerical pain scale) documented by the treating physician. Eight patients (11%) had minimal improvement in their headache symptoms; 12 patients (16%) received no relief after the administration of droperidol. The average time to discharge from the ED was 94.8 ± 67.2 minutes. No cardiac arrhythmias were noted. Other adverse events included two cases of extrapyramidal side effects: one patient reported restlessness/anxiousness and the other patient had dystonia.

The administration of low-dose (≤ 2 mg) droperidol may be safe and effective for the treatment of primary headaches in the ED.

### Effectiveness and safety of droperidol in a United States emergency department [^111N5qgJ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Droperidol is a dopamine receptor antagonist that functions as an analgesic, sedative, and antiemetic. In 2001, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required a black box warning in response to case reports of QT prolongation and potential fatal arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of droperidol in patients presenting to a United States Emergency Department (ED).

- **Methods**: Observational cohort study of all droperidol administrations from January 1, 2012, through April 19, 2018, at an academic ED. The primary endpoint was mortality within 24 hours of droperidol administration. The secondary endpoint included the use of rescue analgesics.

- **Results**: A total of 6,881 visits by 5,784 patients received droperidol, of whom 6,353 visits authorized the use of their records for research. This included 5.4% administrations in children and 8.2% in older adults (≥ 65). Droperidol was used as an analgesic for pain (1,387, 21.8%) and headache (3,622, 57.0%), as a sedative (550, 8.7%), and as an antiemetic (794, 12.5%). No deaths secondary to droperidol administration were recorded within 24 hours. The need for rescue analgesia occurred in 5.2% of patients with headache (188) and 7.4% of patients with pain (102); 1.1% of patients with headache received rescue opioids (38) after droperidol, as did 5.4% of patients with pain other than headache (75). No patients had fatal arrhythmias. Akathisia occurred in 2.9%.

- **Conclusion**: No fatalities were seen among this large cohort of patients who received droperidol in the ED. Our findings suggest droperidol is effective and safe in this setting.

### Antiemetic prophylaxis with droperidol in morphine-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia: a propensity score matched cohort study [^114DH9ck]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

There are limited real-world data regarding the use of droperidol for antiemetic prophylaxis in intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA). This study aimed to evaluate the antiemetic benefits and sedation effects of droperidol in morphine-based IV-PCA.

- **Methods**: Patients who underwent major surgery and used morphine-based IV-PCA at a medical center from January 2020 to November 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was the rate of any postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) within 72 hours after surgery. Propensity score matching was used to match patients with and without the addition of droperidol to IV-PCA infusate in a 1:1 ratio. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: After matching, 1,104 subjects were included for analysis. The addition of droperidol to IV-PCA reduced the risk of PONV (aOR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.35–0.67, p < 0.0001). The antiemetic effect of droperidol was significant within 36 hours after surgery and attenuated thereafter. Droperidol was significantly associated with a lower risk of antiemetic uses (aOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.41–0.80, p = 0.0011). The rate of unintentional sedation was comparable between the patients with (9.1%) and without (7.8%; p = 0.4481) the addition of droperidol. Postoperative opioid consumption and numeric rating scale acute pain scores were similar between groups.

- **Conclusions**: The addition of droperidol to IV-PCA reduced the risk of PONV without increasing opiate consumption.

### Intravenous droperidol or olanzapine as an adjunct to midazolam for the acutely agitated patient: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^11684tQF]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Parenteral benzodiazepines or antipsychotics are frequently utilized to manage acute agitation in emergency department (ED) settings when alternative strategies have failed or are not feasible. This study aims to determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous droperidol or olanzapine as adjuncts to intravenous midazolam for rapid patient sedation.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy clinical trial in three EDs from August 2009 to March 2011. Adult patients (n = 336) needing intravenous drug sedation for acute agitation were randomized to receive a saline solution (control), droperidol (5 mg), or olanzapine (5 mg) bolus. This was immediately followed by incremental intravenous midazolam boluses (2.5 to 5 mg) until sedation was achieved. The primary outcome was time to sedation, while secondary outcomes included the need for "rescue" drugs and adverse events.

- **Results**: A total of 336 patients were randomized into the three groups, with baseline characteristics being similar across groups. The differences in medians for times to sedation between the control and droperidol and control and olanzapine groups were 4 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI] 1 to 6 minutes) and 5 minutes (95% CI 1 to 6 minutes), respectively. Patients in the droperidol and olanzapine groups were approximately 1.6 times more likely to be sedated compared with controls. Specifically, hazard ratios were 1.61 (95% CI 1.23 to 2.11) for the droperidol group and 1.66 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.17) for the olanzapine group.

### The effect of IM droperidol on driving performance [^116mZ6Yw]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2006). High credibility.

Droperidol (DROP) is used in the emergency department (ED) for several indications, but its effect on psychomotor performance is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of DROP, 2.5 mg intramuscular (IM), on driving performance.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized, double-blinded, two-period, placebo-controlled crossover trial that utilized a standard driver-training program with computerized scoring. We solicited 20 paid volunteers who were pre-screened with a 12-lead EKG to evaluate QT length. For the first driving simulation, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 2.5 mg of DROP IM or an equal volume of normal saline (NS). At least 72 hours later, the same subjects participated in a second driving simulation. For the second driving simulation, the assignment of DROP, 2.5 mg IM, or normal saline was reversed: if a subject received DROP, 2.5 mg IM, in the first simulation, the subject received normal saline in the second simulation; conversely, if a subject received normal saline in the first simulation, the subject received DROP, 2.5 mg IM, in the second simulation. Thirty minutes later, participants drove the 20-minute simulation and received an average score based on the errors made in four categories: accelerating, braking, steering, and signaling. Post-testing, participants evaluated their degree of drowsiness and driving impairment using a visual analog scale and compared their perception of impairment to that caused by alcohol ingestion. Data were analyzed using analysis-of-variance, Pearson chi-square, and Fisher's exact test.

### Effects of droperidol dosage on postoperative emetic symptoms following pediatric strabismus surgery [^116fBWaT]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare the frequency of postoperative emetic symptoms and side effects in pediatric strabismus surgery using four doses of droperidol.

- **Design**: The research was conducted as a randomized, blinded study.

- **Setting**: The study took place at a university eye institute.

- **Patients**: Participants included 82 ASA physical status I and II pediatric patients, aged 1 to 16 years, who were undergoing outpatient strabismus surgery.

- **Interventions**: Patients were assigned to receive one of four doses of droperidol: 10, 20, 40, or 80 microg.kg(-1), assigned to Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. All participants received uniform anesthetic management, with droperidol administered intravenously immediately after induction of anesthesia.

- **Measurements and main results**: Postoperative evaluations focused on emetic symptoms such as nausea, retching, and vomiting, as well as side effects like postoperative sedation or extrapyramidal symptoms. A dose-dependent reduction in emetic symptoms was noted with increased droperidol dosage. Predischarge emetic symptoms occurred at rates of 50%, 15%, 15%, and 5% in Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (p < 0.009). Peak emetic symptoms manifested after discharge at 75%, 40%, 35%, and 15% for the respective groups (p < 0.003). Convalescence times, including awakening, extubation, recovery, and hospitalization, remained unaffected by droperidol dosage. Sedation levels were consistent across groups, and no patient exhibited side effects. However, the presence of emetic symptoms was associated with an increased discharge time from 207 ± 57 minutes to 283 ± 128 minutes (p < 0.001).

In conclusion, the prophylactic administration of droperidol at 80 microg.kg(-1) was found to be the most effective in reducing postoperative emetic symptoms among pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery.

### Suppression of potassium conductance by droperidol has influence on excitability of spinal sensory neurons [^116dGMZX]. Anesthesiology (2001). Low credibility.

During spinal and epidural anesthesia with opioids, droperidol is added to prevent nausea and vomiting. The mechanisms of its action on spinal sensory neurons are not well understood. It was previously shown that droperidol selectively blocks a fast component of the Na+ current. The authors studied the action of droperidol on voltage-gated K+ channels and its effect on membrane excitability in spinal dorsal horn neurons of the rat.

- **Methods**: Using a combination of the patch-clamp technique and the "entire soma isolation" method, the action of droperidol on fast-inactivating A-type and delayed-rectifier K+ channels was investigated. Current-clamp recordings from intact sensory neurons in spinal cord slices were performed to study the functional meaning of K+ channel block for neuronal excitability.

- **Results**: Droperidol blocked delayed-rectifier K+ currents in isolated somata of dorsal horn neurons with a half-maximum inhibiting concentration of 20.6 microm. The A-type K+ was insensitive to up to 100 microm droperidol. At droperidol concentrations insufficient for suppression of an action potential, the block of delayed-rectifier K+ channels led to an increase in action potential duration and, as a consequence, to lowering of the discharge frequency in the neuron.

- **Conclusions**: Droperidol blocks delayed-rectifier K+ channels in a concentration range close to that for suppression of Na+ channels. The block of delayed-rectifier K+ channels by droperidol enhances the suppression of activity in spinal sensory neurons at drug concentrations insufficient for complete action potential suppression.

### Droperidol for psychosis-induced aggression or agitation [^112FVYcj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

People experiencing acute psychotic illnesses, especially those associated with agitated or violent behavior, may require urgent pharmacological tranquillization or sedation. Droperidol, a butyrophenone antipsychotic, has been used for this purpose in several countries.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the effects of droperidol, including its cost-effectiveness, when compared to placebo, other 'standard' or 'non-standard' treatments, or other forms of management of psychotic illness, in controlling acutely disturbed behavior and reducing psychotic symptoms in people with schizophrenia-like illnesses.

- **Search methods**: We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (18 December 2015). We searched references of all identified studies for further trial citations and contacted authors of trials. We supplemented these electronic searches by handsearching reference lists and contacting both the pharmaceutical industry and relevant authors.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with usable data that compared droperidol to any other treatment for people acutely ill with suspected acute psychotic illnesses, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mixed affective disorders, the manic phase of bipolar disorder, or a brief psychotic episode.

- **Data collection and analysis**: For included studies, we assessed quality, risk of bias, and extracted data. We excluded data when more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and th

### The additive interactions between ondansetron and droperidol for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting [^1137q7LD]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

Prophylactic ondansetron or droperidol reduces the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Previous studies showed that the combination of these two drugs produced a better antiemetic effect than either drug alone. We present a nonparametric method to determine the pharmacologic interaction between ondansetron and droperidol, comparing the observed response of the drug combination with that predicted from additivity, calculated as the product of the individual drug response normalized to that of the controls.

Five minutes before the induction of anesthesia, 400 patients scheduled for laparoscopic gynecologic surgery were randomly assigned to receive one of the following treatments: 1) saline IV, 2) ondansetron 4 mg IV, 3) droperidol 1.25 mg IV, or 4) a combination of droperidol 1.25 mg and ondansetron 4 mg IV. A standardized anesthetic technique and postoperative analgesic regimen were used. Patients were reviewed regularly for 48 hours. Changes in the heart rate adjusted QT (QTc) interval were measured from electrocardiograms recorded before and 5 minutes after study drug administration. In a subgroup of 160 patients, QTc intervals were measured again at 2–3 hours after surgery.

During the first 48 hours after surgery, the proportion of patients experiencing PONV was 68% (95% CI 58–77) in the control group. A single dose of ondansetron or droperidol decreased the incidence of PONV to 30% (95% CI 21–40) and 28% (95% CI 20–38), respectively. The predicted incidence of PONV after the drug combination, 11.8% (7.1–11.9), was similar to that observed, 12.1% (6.4–20.2), P = 0.94.

### Droperidol in the emergency department: Is it safe [^113iNWPp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Droperidol is an antipsychotic and antiemetic drug that has been used extensively by emergency physicians, psychiatrists, and anesthesiologists worldwide since 1967. It has also been used effectively for other diverse conditions, such as the treatment of headache and vertigo. As of January 2001, droperidol was no longer available in Europe after its founder, Janssen-Cilag Pharmaceuticals, discontinued its distribution. In December 2001, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed a black box warning on the use of droperidol in response to an association between droperidol and fatal cardiac dysrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes, resulting from prolongation of the QT interval. In this review, we closely examine the pharmacology, indications, use, and complications associated with droperidol and speculate on its future use in the emergency department.

### Emergency medicine updates: Droperidol [^116h2X3D]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Droperidol is a butyrophenone that has recently been reintroduced following a United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) black box warning in 2001. Evidence demonstrates utility in a variety of clinical conditions.

- **Objective**: This paper provides evidence-based updates concerning the use of droperidol for the emergency clinician.

- **Discussion**: Droperidol received a black box warning by the US FDA in 2001 due to concerns for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes; however, reevaluation of the available data suggests droperidol is a safe and efficacious medication. It can be used in the emergency department (ED) setting for many conditions, including acute agitation, headaches, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. Extensive literature supports that the QT-prolonging effects are transient and that the risk of torsades de pointes is rare with doses utilized in the ED. An electrocardiogram does not need to be routinely obtained before droperidol use but should be considered in patients at high risk for QT prolongation.

- **Conclusions**: Evidence suggests that droperidol is a safe and effective medication for treating nausea and vomiting, headache, vertigo, and agitation in the ED setting.

### A systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for pediatric agitation in acute care settings [^1127jtDj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Acute agitation in children in the hospital setting poses a serious safety risk to patients and staff. In a national survey of pediatric hospitalists and pediatric psychiatry consultants, most encountered acute agitation as frequently as every week. As pediatric mental health visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) have risen over the past decade, visits involving the use of intramuscular medications for agitation have increased threefold. Nevertheless, a paucity of evidence on medication efficacy and safety is available to guide the choice of medication for acute agitation in children.

Behavioral approaches such as verbal de-escalation are central to reducing acute agitation, but when these fail, medications may be used to reduce acute agitation and decrease the risk of harm to self or others. Classes of medications commonly used to manage pediatric acute agitation include benzodiazepines and antipsychotics, with antihistamines sometimes used as adjuncts to prevent extrapyramidal side effects. Oral medications, whenever possible, are the preferred route of delivery for medication to treat acute agitation. However, response rates to oral medications are generally low, varying from 30% (loxapine) to 53% (quetiapine) within 60 minutes of administration among adolescents with acute agitation in the ED. For children who fail to respond to oral medications or who refuse to take them, intramuscular or intravenous medications may be used to manage acute agitation.

### A comparison of the effects of droperidol and the combination of droperidol and ondansetron on postoperative nausea and vomiting for patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^114hYhJc]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare the prophylactic antiemetic efficacy of the combination of ondansetron and droperidol with droperidol alone in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind controlled trial conducted at a university-affiliated teaching hospital following the induction of standardized general anesthesia.

- **Patients**: The trial involved 64 ASA physical status I or II patients aged 18 to 80 years, undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

- **Intervention**: After induction of general anesthesia, patients received either droperidol 1.25 mg intravenously (IV; n = 30; Group D) or the combination of droperidol 1.25 mg IV and ondansetron 4 mg IV (n = 34; Group D+O).

- **Measurements**: Number and severity of nausea episodes, number of emetic episodes, total analgesic consumption, and rescue antiemetic administration were assessed at 1, 3, and 24 hours after admission to the recovery room. Data were analyzed using Fisher's Exact test and unpaired Student's t-test; a p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.

- **Results**: The proportions of patients who experienced nausea (70% and 53% for D and D+O groups, respectively) and vomiting (30% and 19% for D and D+O groups, respectively) were similar in the two groups. The frequency of moderate and severe nausea requiring administration of antiemetic was less in group D+O (7%) compared with group D (19%; p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Patients who received the combination of droperidol and ondansetron experienced less severe nausea compared with patients who received droperidol alone.

### Droperidol for acute psychosis [^111XknMq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

People with acute psychotic illnesses, especially when associated with agitated or violent behaviour, may require urgent pharmacological tranquillisation or sedation. Droperidol, a butyrophenone neuroleptic, is used for this purpose in several countries.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the effects of droperidol when compared to other treatments for controlling disturbed behaviour and reducing psychotic symptoms for people with suspected acute psychotic illnesses.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 2, 2000), The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (May 2000), EMBASE (1980–2000), MEDLINE (1966–2000), PASCAL (1973–2000) and PsycLIT (1970–2000) were methodically searched. Twenty-one other databases were also searched as part of a broader project, and this composite database was searched for this review. This was supplemented by hand searching reference lists, contacting industry, and relevant authors.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials comparing droperidol to any treatment, for people with suspected acute psychotic illnesses, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mixed affective disorders, manic phase of bipolar disorder, or brief psychotic episode.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Studies were reliably selected, quality assessed, and data extracted. Data were excluded where more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up. For binary outcomes, standard estimations of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Where possible, weighted number needed to treat or harm statistics (NNT, NNH) were also considered.

### Antiemetics in the ED: A randomized controlled trial comparing 3 common agents [^114qkkDB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

We sought to compare the efficacy of three intravenous antiemetic medications in ED patients complaining of moderate to severe nausea. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial compares 1.25 mg droperidol, 10 mg metoclopramide, 10 mg prochlorperazine, and saline placebo. Adult ED patients complaining of nausea were eligible. Nausea was measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale at 0 and 30 minutes after treatment.

A convenience sample of 100 patients was enrolled; 97 had complete data available for analysis. Of these, 22 patients received droperidol, 25 received metoclopramide, 24 received prochlorperazine, and 26 received placebo. Droperidol (-54.5 mm) was significantly better than metoclopramide (-40.2 mm) or prochlorperazine (-40.5 mm) at reducing nausea at 30 minutes (P = 0.04). There were no significant differences in rescue medication or patient satisfaction; however, droperidol had significantly higher akathisia (71.4% vs 23.5%) at 24-hour follow-up. When administered intravenously to adult patients with moderate to severe nausea, droperidol was more effective than metoclopramide or prochlorperazine but caused more extrapyramidal symptoms. Metoclopramide and prochlorperazine were not more effective than saline placebo. All patients improved over time, possibly with intravenous hydration.

### Randomized clinical trial comparing intravenous midazolam and droperidol for sedation of the acutely agitated patient in the emergency department [^111UnBcc]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

We compared intravenous midazolam and droperidol for the onset of sedation in acutely agitated patients in the emergency department (ED).

- **Methods**: This was a double-blind, randomized clinical trial set in the ED of a university teaching hospital. Subjects were adults, acutely agitated due to mental illness, intoxication, or both, who received midazolam or droperidol, 5 mg intravenously, every 5 minutes until sedated. We analyzed time to sedation using survival analysis, median times to sedation, and proportions sedated at 5 and 10 minutes.

- **Results**: Seventy-four patients received midazolam; 79 patients received droperidol. Survival analysis showed no difference in time to sedation (hazard ratio 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 1.23; p = 0.42). The median time to sedation was 6.5 minutes for midazolam (median dose 5 mg) and 8 minutes for droperidol (median dose 10 mg; p = 0.075; effect size 1.5 minutes; 95% CI 0 to 4 minutes). At 5 minutes, 33 of 74 (44.6%) patients from the midazolam group were adequately sedated compared with 13 of 79 (16.5%) patients from the droperidol group, a difference of 28.1% (95% CI 12.9% to 43.4%; p < 0.001). By 10 minutes, 41 of 74 (55.4%) from the midazolam group were sedated compared to 42 of 79 (53.2%) from the droperidol group, a difference of 2.2% (95% CI -14.9% to 19.3%; p = 0.91). Eleven adverse events occurred in the midazolam group and 10 in the droperidol group. Three patients required active airway management (3 patients with assisted ventilation and 1 patient intubated); all received midazolam.

### A systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for pediatric agitation in acute care settings [^111LwgFk]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Agitation in children in acute care settings poses significant patient and staff safety concerns. While behavioral approaches are central to reducing agitation and oral medications are preferred, parenteral medications are used when necessary to promote safety. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an ultra‐short‐acting parenteral medication, droperidol, for the management of acute, severe agitation in children in acute care settings.

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case series/reports examined the effectiveness and safety of parenteral droperidol for management of acute agitation in patients ≤ 21 years old in acute care settings. Effectiveness outcomes included time to sedation and the need for a subsequent dose of medication. Safety outcomes were adverse effects such as QTc prolongation, hypotension, respiratory depression, and dystonic reactions.

A total of 431 unique articles were identified. Six articles met inclusion criteria: two in the prehospital setting, one in the emergency department, and three in the inpatient hospital setting. The articles included a prospective observational study, three retrospective observational studies, and two case reports. The largest study reported a median time to sedation of 14 minutes (interquartile range 10–20 minutes); other studies reported a time to sedation of 15 minutes or less. Across studies, 8%–22% of patients required a second dose of medication for ongoing agitation.

### Droperidol for treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients [^117PHaR7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

This document is an updated version of the original Cochrane review, initially published in Issue 10, 2010, on droperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients. Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms in patients with terminal illness and can be very unpleasant and distressing. Various antiemetic treatments are available to control these symptoms. Droperidol, an antipsychotic drug, has been used and studied as an antiemetic in managing postoperative and chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events (both minor and serious) associated with droperidol's use for treating nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients.

- **Search methods**: We searched electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE (1950-), EMBASE (1980-), CINAHL (1981-), and AMED (1985-), using relevant search terms and synonyms. The basic search strategy was ("droperidol" OR "butyrophenone") AND ("nausea" OR "vomiting"), modified for each database. We updated the search on 2 December 2009, and performed updated searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and AMED from 2009 to 2013 on 19 November 2013. We searched CINAHL on 20 November 2013. Additionally, we searched trial registers, including the metaRegister of controlled trials (www.controlled-trials.com/mrct), clinicaltrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/) on 22 November 2013, using the keyword "droperidol".

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of droperidol.

### Droperidol: Should the black box be light gray [^1115t3Nz]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

In December 2001, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a "black box" warning to the labeling for droperidol, stating that all doses, even those typically used for postoperative nausea and vomiting, were potentially associated with malignant ventricular dysrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. The 19 cases in which droperidol doses less than 10 mg were allegedly associated with such dysrhythmias are reviewed in detail. Confounding issues present in a majority of the cases make it difficult to incriminate droperidol as the likely cause of the reported adverse events.

### Droperidol [^11583LoC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

QT interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, cardiac arrest, and ventricular tachycardia have been reported in patients treated with droperidol. Some of these cases were associated with death. Some cases occurred in patients with no known risk factors, while others were associated with droperidol doses at or below the recommended levels.

Physicians should be alert to palpitations, syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of irregular cardiac rhythm in patients taking droperidol and promptly evaluate such cases. Mild to moderate hypotension and tachycardia are the most common somatic adverse reactions reported with droperidol; these effects usually subside without treatment. If hypotension is severe or persists, hypovolemia should be considered and managed with appropriate parenteral fluid therapy.

The most common behavioral adverse effects of droperidol include dysphoria, postoperative drowsiness, restlessness, hyperactivity, and anxiety. These can result from either inadequate dosage or adverse drug reactions. Care should be taken to search for extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (dystonia, akathisia, oculogyric crisis) to differentiate these clinical conditions. When extrapyramidal symptoms are the cause, they can usually be controlled with anticholinergic agents.

Postoperative hallucinatory episodes, sometimes associated with transient periods of mental depression, have also been reported.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for managing acute agitation in children in acute care settings, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We registered the study protocol with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews at the time of data extraction on February 10, 2021 (registration number CRD42021233313).

- **Article eligibility criteria**: Articles were eligible for inclusion if they reported effectiveness and/or safety outcomes for parenteral droperidol administration for acute agitation in children or youth under 21 years of age in acute care settings, including prehospital, emergency department, or inpatient medical or psychiatric hospital settings. Effectiveness outcomes were defined as time to sedation, depth of sedation, duration of sedation, need for subsequent doses of medication, or utility in preventing patient or staff injury. Safety outcomes included adverse medication effects such as cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, hypoxia, need for airway intervention, and extrapyramidal symptoms including dystonic reactions and akathisia. Articles were included if they examined droperidol administration for the management of acute agitation or if they compared its use to another medication for this indication. The upper age limit for studies of droperidol use in children varied, with at least one article including patients through age 21. Therefore, we chose an inclusive approach by selecting age 21 as the upper age limit for article eligibility.

### A prospective study of intramuscular droperidol or olanzapine for acute agitation in the emergency department: A natural experiment owing to drug shortages [^113oi9bt]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Intramuscular medications are commonly used to treat agitation in the emergency department (ED). This study aims to compare intramuscular droperidol and olanzapine for treating agitation.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study involved ED patients receiving either intramuscular droperidol or olanzapine for acute agitation. The treating physician determined the medication and dose. However, drug shortages led to either olanzapine (July to September 2019) or droperidol (November 2019 to March 2020) being unavailable, creating a natural experiment. The primary outcome was the time to adequate sedation, assessed by the Altered Mental Status Scale (AMSS), defined as the time to an AMSS score less than or equal to 0.

- **Results**: A total of 1,257 patients (median age 42 years; 73% men) were analyzed. Of these, 538 received droperidol (median dose 5 mg) and 719 received olanzapine (median dose 10 mg). The majority (1,086; 86%) experienced agitation due to alcohol intoxication. The time to adequate sedation was 16 minutes (interquartile range 10 to 30 minutes) for droperidol and 17.5 minutes (interquartile range 10 to 30 minutes) for olanzapine, with an absolute difference of -0.7 minutes (95% confidence interval -2.1 to 0.5 minutes). An adjusted Cox proportional hazard model analysis showed no difference between the groups in time to sedation (hazard ratio for adequate sedation for droperidol compared with olanzapine 1.12; 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.25). Patients receiving olanzapine were more likely to require additional medications for sedation (droperidol 17%; olanzapine 24%).

### Low-dose droperidol (≤ 1 mg or ≤ 15 μg kg-1) for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults: Quantitative systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^1161btcn]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2012). High credibility.

Droperidol is widely used for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in European countries. However, it is unclear how efficacious low-dose droperidol is in preventing PONV.

- **Objectives**: To test the efficacy of low-dose droperidol in the prevention of PONV in adults and to test for dose-responsiveness.

- **Design**: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials with meta-analyses.

- **Data sources**: Comprehensive search in electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Central) up to June 2011. Additional trials were obtained from bibliographies of retrieved reports. No language restriction was applied.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Randomised trials testing prophylactic intravenous droperidol ≤ 1 mg or ≤ 15 μg/kg compared with placebo (or no treatment) in adults undergoing general anaesthesia and reporting on PONV.

We analysed 25 trials encompassing 2957 patients. Doses varied from 0.25 to 1.0 mg. For the prevention of early nausea (within 6 hours postoperatively), the relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.58) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 7, 4, and 2 for low, medium, and high baseline risk (i.e. control event rates of 25%, 50%, 75%) respectively. For the prevention of early vomiting, the RR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.74) with an NNT of 11, 6, and 4. For the prevention of late nausea (within 24 hours), the RR was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.87) with an NNT of 15, 8, and 5. For the prevention of late vomiting, the RR was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.80) with an NNT of 10, 5, and 3. Droperidol decreased the risk of headache but increased the risk of restlessness. For these outcomes, there was no evidence of dose-responsiveness.

### DRopEridol for Abdominal pain in the emergency department for Morphine Equivalent Reduction. The DREAMER study [^111HmvJb]. The American journal of emergency medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Droperidol is a dopamine-2 receptor antagonist in the class of butyrophenone antipsychotics with antiemetic, sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic properties. In the postoperative setting, droperidol provides an opioid sparing effect and decreases nausea/vomiting. Another butyrophenone antipsychotic, haloperidol, has been shown to reduce morphine milliequivalents (MME) administered when used for abdominal pain in the emergency department (ED). The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use of droperidol for undifferentiated abdominal pain reduces the amount of MME administered in the ED.

Methods

This retrospective, single-center study included patients ≥ 18 years old who presented to the ED for undifferentiated abdominal pain. Patients must have had two separate encounters for abdominal pain, one encounter where they received droperidol and one encounter where they did not receive droperidol but did receive an opioid. The primary outcome was the difference in MME administered between the two separate patient encounters. Secondary outcomes included utilization rates of rescue antiemetics, rescue analgesics, admission to the hospital, hospital length of stay, and adverse effects (including arrhythmias and extrapyramidal symptoms).

Results

Fifty patients with self-matched encounters were evaluated. A majority of the patients were female (33/50, 66%) with a median age of 38 years old. All doses of droperidol were intravenous and the majority of patients received a dose of 2.5 mg (34/50, 68%; range 1.25–5 mg). Non-droperidol encounters received significantl

### A systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for pediatric agitation in acute care settings [^111aRe2t]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The most common adverse events described in the included articles after droperidol administration were hypotension (which typically did not require intervention) and dystonic reactions (which responded to anticholinergic medications). One case of respiratory depression occurred in a patient who also had alcohol intoxication. We did not identify any children who developed arrhythmias following droperidol administration.

Droperidol has a history of decades of use for the management of acute agitation. In 2001, the FDA issued a boxed warning regarding the risk of QTc prolongation and arrhythmias; however, clinicians have questioned whether this warning was justified based on available evidence. The warning was placed on the basis of 277 reports of adverse events associated with droperidol use, with 65 individual cases involving at least one cardiac symptom and 35 resulting in death. However, 135 of the reported adverse events occurred outside of the United States, with doses that were orders of magnitude higher than typical in the United States. Of the five cases of torsades de pointes that resulted in death, four were reported abroad in patients who received 600 mg intravenous droperidol. Of note, no cases of torsades de pointes or cardiac arrest were reported in children. The youngest patient with a reported adverse event was an 18‐year‐old female who developed tachycardia, not otherwise specified.

Our findings on droperidol for acute agitation in children are largely consistent with the evidence base in adults, in which adverse effects of droperidol are rare.

### Droperidol for acute psychosis [^112yT4Z5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

People suffering from acute psychotic illnesses, especially those associated with agitated or violent behavior, may require urgent pharmacological tranquillization or sedation. Droperidol, a butyrophenone neuroleptic, has been used for this purpose in several countries.

- **Objectives**: To estimate the effects of droperidol compared to other treatments for controlling disturbed behavior and reducing psychotic symptoms for people with suspected acute psychotic illnesses.

- **Search strategy**: We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Register (September 2003). References of all identified studies were searched for further trial citations, and authors of trials were contacted. Twenty-one other databases were also searched as part of a broader project, and this composite database was searched for this review. This was supplemented by hand-searching reference lists and contacting both the pharmacological industry and relevant authors.

- **Selection criteria**: The review included randomized controlled trials comparing droperidol to any other treatment for people with suspected acute psychotic illnesses, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mixed affective disorders, the manic phase of bipolar disorder, or a brief psychotic episode.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Relevant studies were selected for inclusion, their quality was assessed, and data were extracted. Data were excluded when more than 50% of participants were lost to follow-up. For binary outcomes, standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were reported.

### Droperidol for treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients [^114c3zxN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms in patients with terminal illness and can be very unpleasant and distressing. Several different types of antiemetic treatments can be used to control these symptoms. Droperidol is an antipsychotic drug and has been used and studied as an antiemetic in managing postoperative and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and adverse events (both minor and serious) associated with the use of droperidol for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients.

- **Search strategy**: We searched electronic databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and AMED, using relevant search terms and synonyms. The basic search strategy was ("droperidol" OR "butyrophenone") AND ("nausea" OR "vomiting"), modified for each database. The search was updated on 2 December 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of droperidol for the treatment of nausea or vomiting, or both, for adults receiving palliative care or suffering from an incurable progressive medical condition.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We judged the potential relevance of studies based on their titles and abstracts and obtained studies which we anticipated might meet the inclusion criteria. Both authors read these to assess suitability for inclusion. Discrepancies were discussed to achieve consensus.

- **Main results**: The search strategy identified 1,664 abstracts (with 827 duplicates), of which 23 studies were obtained in full as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. On review of the full texts, the results were assessed for inclusion.

### Antiemetic prophylaxis with droperidol in morphine-based intravenous patient-controlled analgesia: a propensity score matched cohort study [^113PoYww]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

There are limited real-world data regarding the use of droperidol for antiemetic prophylaxis in intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA). This study aimed to evaluate the antiemetic benefits and sedation effects of droperidol in morphine-based IV-PCA.

- **Methods**: Patients who underwent major surgery and used morphine-based IV-PCA at a medical center from January 2020 to November 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was the rate of any postoperative nausea and/or vomiting (PONV) within 72 hours after surgery. Propensity score matching was used to match patients with and without the addition of droperidol to IV-PCA infusate in a 1:1 ratio. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: After matching, 1,104 subjects were included for analysis. The addition of droperidol to IV-PCA reduced the risk of PONV (aOR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.35–0.67, p < 0.0001). The antiemetic effect of droperidol was significant within 36 hours after surgery and attenuated thereafter. Droperidol was significantly associated with a lower risk of antiemetic uses (aOR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.41–0.80, p = 0.0011). The rate of unintentional sedation was comparable between the patients with (9.1%) and without (7.8%; p = 0.4481) the addition of droperidol. Postoperative opioid consumption and numeric rating scale acute pain scores were similar between groups.

- **Conclusions**: The addition of droperidol to IV-PCA reduced the risk of PONV without increasing opiate consumption or influencing the level of sedation.

### Midazolam-Droperidol, Droperidol, or Olanzapine for Acute Agitation: A Randomized Clinical Trial [^114JXAqM]. Annals of emergency medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We aim to determine the most efficacious of 3 common medication regimens for the sedation of acutely agitated emergency department (ED) patients.

Methods

We undertook a randomized, controlled, double-blind, triple-dummy, clinical trial in 2 metropolitan EDs between October 2014 and August 2015. Patients aged 18 to 65 years and requiring intravenous medication sedation for acute agitation were enrolled and randomized to an intravenous bolus of midazolam 5 mg-droperidol 5 mg, droperidol 10 mg, or olanzapine 10 mg. Two additional doses were administered, if required: midazolam 5 mg, droperidol 5 mg, or olanzapine 5 mg. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients adequately sedated at 10 minutes.

Results

Three hundred forty-nine patients were randomized to the 3 groups. Baseline characteristics were similar across the groups. Ten minutes after the first dose, significantly more patients in the midazolam-droperidol group were adequately sedated compared with the droperidol and olanzapine groups: differences in proportions 25.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12.0% to 38.1%) and 25.4% (95% CI 12.7% to 38.3%), respectively. For times to sedation, the differences in medians between the midazolam-droperidol group and the droperidol and olanzapine groups were 6 (95% CI 3 to 8) and 6 (95% CI 3 to 7) minutes, respectively. Patients in the midazolam-droperidol group required fewer additional doses or alternative drugs to achieve adequate sedation. The 3 groups' adverse event rates and lengths of stay did not differ.

Conclusion

Midazolam-droperidol combinatio

### A systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for pediatric agitation in acute care settings [^112HMVAc]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In 2015, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine conducted a review of the literature and developed a position statement supporting the use of droperidol for the treatment of agitation in the emergency department (ED). In 2016, a Cochrane review also found high-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of droperidol for treatment of psychosis-induced agitation or aggression and no evidence that droperidol causes more cardiovascular arrhythmias than placebo in adults. However, the effectiveness and safety of droperidol in children remain less well defined. In 2019, a generic manufacturer started to produce droperidol, resulting in a recent increase in the availability of droperidol in the U.S. market. In this context, a structured systematic review of evidence on the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for acute agitation in children is needed.

The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for the management of acute agitation in children in acute care settings.

Overall, the risk of bias assessment among the six articles ranged from moderate to critical, with the majority of articles falling into the serious risk category. Many of the articles demonstrated a high risk of bias due to observational, unblinded study designs. In addition, many articles showed a high risk of bias because of a lack of adjustment for potential confounders. The articles scored low to moderate in risk of bias due to deviations from the intended protocol and missing data.

### The management of severe emergence agitation using droperidol [^112XLiDn]. Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Emergence agitation can occur following recovery from general anaesthesia. The patient may exhibit aggressive behaviour, disorientation, agitation, and restlessness. If untreated, this complication may result in significant morbidity. We report two cases where droperidol was successfully used in the management of severe emergence agitation. In the first case, droperidol was administered to prevent the occurrence of postoperative agitation in a patient known to suffer from this condition following previous general anaesthetics. In the second case, droperidol was used to treat emergence agitation in a morbidly obese patient with a difficult airway who was aggressive and difficult to restrain. Both of these patients remained calm and cooperative, with stable cardio-respiratory parameters following the administration of droperidol and showed no further signs of agitation. We suggest that droperidol is an effective medication that may be used to prevent and treat severe emergence agitation due to its rapid sedative effect and minimal cardio-respiratory depression.

### A retrospective review of the use and safety of droperidol in a large, high-risk, inner-city emergency department patient population [^116Y5UKM]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Droperidol (DROP) is used in the emergency department (ED) for sedation, analgesia, and its antiemetic effect. Its ED safety profile has not yet been reported in patients (pts).

- **Objectives**: To document the use of DROP in high-risk patients (those with head injury, alcohol or cocaine intoxication, and/or remote or recent seizures), and to determine the number of serious and minor adverse events (AEs) such as seizures, hypotension, and extrapyramidal side effects (EPSEs) after DROP.

- **Methods**: The ED database (EmSTAT) was queried to determine who received intramuscular or intravenous DROP in the ED in 1998. Further chart review was done if the patient was considered high risk for, or had experienced an AE. Multiple regression analysis using a random-effects model determined the significance of each variable in the occurrence of AEs.

- **Results**: A total of 2,468 patients (aged 20 months to 98 years; 112 aged 66 years or older) received DROP for agitation (n = 1,357), pain (1,135), anxiety (99), vomiting (173), or other reasons (50). There were 945 patients considered high risk; 933 charts were reviewed, with a DROP mean dose of 4.1 ± 2.0 mg. Of these, 50 patient visits did not meet the criteria for high risk. Among the patients, 622 had head trauma (401 with alcohol use), including 47 with computed tomography (CT) scans positive for brain injury, 64 had cocaine use, and 197 had recent or remote seizures (137 with alcohol use). Minor AEs such as transient hypotension occurred in 96 patients after DROP administration (73 with alcohol use); 20 received intravenous fluids, while an additional 28 patients (8 with alcohol use) experienced EPSEs.

### Droperidol use in the emergency department: A clinical review [^114e9ymx]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Droperidol is a butyrophenone with antiemetic, sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. Although droperidol was once widely used in both emergency and perioperative settings, use of the medication declined rapidly following a 2001 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) boxed warning called the medication's safety into question.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this clinical review was to provide evidence-based answers to questions about droperidol's safety and to examine its efficacy in its various clinical indications.

- **Discussion**: Droperidol is an effective sedative, anxiolytic, analgesic, and antiemetic medication. As a sedative, when compared with haloperidol, droperidol has faster onset as well as greater efficacy in patients experiencing acute psychosis, with no increase in adverse events. As an antiemetic, droperidol has been found to have equal or greater efficacy in reducing nausea and vomiting than ondansetron and metoclopramide, with similar adverse effects and the added effect of reducing the need for rescue analgesia in these patients. As an analgesic, droperidol is effective for migraines and has opioid-sparing effects when used to treat abdominal pain. Droperidol is a particularly useful adjunct in patients who are opioid-tolerant, whose pain is often difficult to manage adequately.

- **Conclusions**: Droperidol seems to be effective and safe, despite the boxed warning issued by the FDA. Droperidol is a powerful antiemetic, sedative, anxiolytic, antimigraine, and adjuvant to opioid analgesia and does not require routine screening with electrocardiography.

### A systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for pediatric agitation in acute care settings [^111NYhxj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Reported adverse effects of droperidol included QTc prolongation, hypotension, respiratory depression, and dystonic reactions. Calver et al. investigated the cardiac effects of droperidol by measuring QTc intervals obtained from continuous electrocardiogram recordings after droperidol administration. While 46 patients participated in the study, safety outcomes for only one pediatric patient were described. A 17-year-old who presented after an ingestion of 2800 mg lamotrigine was found to have a prolonged QTc of 505 ms on a Holter monitor placed 110 minutes after she had received 10 mg droperidol. The QT interval was prolonged from the start of monitoring and resolved over several hours. The patient's concurrent lamotrigine overdose precluded definitive attribution of the patient's QTc prolongation to droperidol. In the study by Szwak et al, all patients received cardiac monitoring from the time of droperidol administration until discharge from the ED, with no patients experiencing an arrhythmia. No other articles reported cases of QTc prolongation or cardiac arrhythmias.

Hypotension and respiratory depression were occasionally noted following droperidol administration. In the study by Page et al, hypotension occurred in five of 102 cases, with four patients experiencing asymptomatic hypotension that resolved without intervention. The remaining patient had a systolic blood pressure of 75 mm Hg that responded to intravenous fluids. Hameer et al. described one case of hypotension in a patient who had also received lorazepam and haloperidol.

### Intravenous droperidol causes a reduction in the bispectral index in propofol-sedated patients during spinal anesthesia [^114P1sCy]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

We investigated the effect of IV droperidol on the bispectral index (BIS) in conscious and propofol-sedated patients during spinal anesthesia. Thirty minutes after the induction of spinal anesthesia, 20 patients were given 2 mg of droperidol IV without administration of other sedatives (conscious group). Another group of patients were sedated with a propofol infusion to maintain BIS at 60 ± 5 and were administered IV saline (placebo group; n = 20), droperidol 1 mg (dro-1 group; n = 20), or droperidol 2 mg (dro-2 group; n = 20) in a randomized order and in a double-blinded fashion. Although BIS remained the same in the conscious and placebo groups, it significantly decreased after administration of droperidol in the dro-1 and dro-2 groups. The decrease in BIS was significantly larger in the dro-2 group than in the dro-1 group. These results suggest that an antiemetic dose of droperidol enhances the hypnotic effect of propofol in a dose-dependent manner during spinal anesthesia.

An antiemetic dose of IV droperidol causes a decrease in the bispectral index in patients sedated with propofol during spinal anesthesia. We conclude that droperidol may enhance the hypnotic effect of propofol.

### The antipruritic and antiemetic effects of epidural droperidol: a study of three methods of administration [^1123kwx8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

In this study, we compared rates of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and pruritus after using different protocols for administering epidural droperidol. Using the same dose of droperidol, we evaluated the effectiveness of three different methods of administration (single, continuous, and combined) on the frequency of PONV and pruritus induced by continuous infusion of epidural fentanyl for 48 hours postoperatively. One hundred sixty ASA physical status I and II patients who underwent surgical resection for colorectal cancer under general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia were randomly allocated into four groups: (a) control group (no droperidol), (b) single injection group (droperidol 2.5 mg), (c) continuous group (droperidol 1.25 mg/day), and (d) combined single (droperidol 1.25 mg) and continuous (droperidol 0.625 mg/day) group.

Pruritus and PONV were significantly less frequent in all droperidol groups when compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence and the incidence over time of PONV were similar among all groups who received epidural droperidol. Epidural droperidol is effective for reducing pruritus and PONV, regardless of the method of administration.

Dosage and administration:

Dosage should be individualized, considering factors such as age, body weight, physical status, underlying pathological condition, use of other drugs, type of anesthesia to be used, and the surgical procedure involved. Vital signs and ECG should be monitored routinely.

- **Adult dosage**: The maximum recommended initial dose of droperidol is 2.5 mg IM or slow IV. Additional 1.25 mg doses may be administered to achieve the desired effect; however, additional doses should be administered with caution and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.

- **Children's dosage**: For children aged two to 12 years, the maximum recommended initial dose is 0.1 mg/kg, taking into account the patient's age and other clinical factors. Additional doses should be administered with caution and only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk.

See warnings and precautions for use of droperidol with other CNS depressants and in patients with altered response. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit. If such abnormalities are observed, the drug should not be administered.

### A systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of droperidol for pediatric agitation in acute care settings [^112h2a7a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The articles reported a variety of effectiveness outcomes, including time to sedation, depth of sedation, duration of sedation, need for subsequent doses of medication, and utility in preventing patient or staff injury. Page et al. reported a median time to sedation of 14 minutes, with an interquartile range of 10–20 minutes and a range of 3–85 minutes. Joshi et al. described a range of onset of action of 3–15 minutes, while Hameer et al. reported a time of onset of 10–15 minutes. In the case report by Ho et al, the patient was described as calmer after 6 minutes.

In terms of depth of sedation, only one of 102 cases (1%) in the study by Page et al. resulted in a failure to sedate, defined as an inability to achieve a Sedation Assessment Score decrease by 2 points or a score of zero. Four of six patients who received droperidol in the study by Hameer et al. were sleeping within 1 hour of administration, while two patients experienced a decrease in agitation to 2 ("restless and agitated") on their scale. In Szwak et al, 86.6% of cases of droperidol administration resulted in effective sedation, defined as sleeping, calm, resting, cooperative, or quiet. In the case described by Ho et al, the patient was described as "much calmer and quite sleepy" following medication administration.
