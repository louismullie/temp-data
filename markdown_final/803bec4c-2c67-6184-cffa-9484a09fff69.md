## Question

Patients with COPD lethargic co2
retention

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing a lethargic COPD patient with CO2 retention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and whether this is an emergency. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of CO2 retention and how it explains lethargy. Next, I will review oxygen titration targets and the risk of oxygen-induced hypercapnia. After that, I need to check indications and settings for noninvasive ventilation, including when to escalate to invasive ventilation. I will then consider pharmacologic therapy and precipitating factors. Finally, I should plan disposition, follow-up, and long-term strategies, including screening for overlap syndromes and the role of chronic NIV, and I will double-check each step against guidelines and high-quality evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and its severity. Lethargy in a COPD patient with CO2 retention signals acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with altered mental status, which is life-threatening and mandates urgent intervention, continuous monitoring, and likely ICU-level care, so I should not delay escalation while I sort through details [^8ac0ae02] [^0c5533d0].

> I need to check the pathophysiology to connect lethargy with CO2 retention. Hypercapnia depresses cerebral function via CO2 narcosis, worsens acidosis, and can suppress respiratory drive, particularly when hypoxic ventilatory drive is removed by excessive oxygen; dynamic hyperinflation and increased work of breathing further compromise ventilation-perfusion matching and respiratory muscle function, explaining the mental status change and the risk of rapid deterioration [^9708de1b] [^08b6da82].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about oxygen. I should confirm the oxygen target and delivery method. In COPD with hypercapnia, controlled oxygen to a target SpO2 of 88–92% is recommended to mitigate oxygen-induced hypercapnia; Venturi masks provide more precise FiO2 than nasal cannula, and I should obtain frequent ABGs after starting oxygen to detect rising PaCO2 or worsening acidosis early, especially in dusky or darker skin tones where pulse oximetry may overestimate saturation [^a847f43c] [^2abc52d1] [^a5695a9f].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of oxygen-induced CO2 retention risk. Classic teaching overstated the risk; controlled oxygen studies show that only a minority of patients experience clinically meaningful CO2 rises when titrated carefully, though the risk is higher in those with more severe baseline hypercapnia, so the key is tight titration and serial ABGs rather than withholding oxygen from hypoxemic patients [^17dc474e] [^9708de1b].

> Next, I should review noninvasive ventilation indications and settings. NIV is indicated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure with respiratory acidosis (PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg and pH ≤ 7.35) after optimal medical therapy, or for severe dyspnea with signs of respiratory muscle fatigue; I should start with IPAP around 10–12 cm H2O and EPAP 4–5 cm H2O, titrating to improve tidal volume, reduce respiratory rate, and correct acidosis, while monitoring for mask leaks, aerophagia, and patient-ventilator asynchrony [^fabe348f] [^0d54f1b9] [^34611c7e].

> I should double-check when to escalate to invasive ventilation. Indications include failure of NIV, deteriorating mental status, persistent or worsening acidosis (pH ≤ 7.25), hemodynamic instability, inability to protect airway, or massive aspiration; I need to consider reversibility, patient preferences, and ICU availability, recognizing that COPD patients can have favorable outcomes if the precipitant is reversible, whereas poor baseline function and comorbidities worsen prognosis [^71524b5e] [^e9e8a81d].

> Let me consider pharmacologic therapy and precipitating factors. I should administer bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics if infection is suspected; I also need to screen for and reverse contributors to hypoventilation such as sedatives, opioids, benzodiazepines, and electrolyte disturbances, and I should avoid respiratory stimulants like doxapram, which are not recommended in acute respiratory failure [^8ac0ae02] [^27f3693d].

> I will now examine disposition and monitoring. Given lethargy and CO2 retention, ICU admission is appropriate for close ABG monitoring, frequent neurologic checks, and rapid titration of ventilatory support; I should reassess every 1–2 hours initially, with a low threshold to intubate if NIV fails or the patient deteriorates, and I should document goals of care early in the course [^8ac0ae02] [^0c5533d0].

> Next, I should review long-term planning once stabilized. Before discharge, I need to arrange follow-up ABGs, optimize inhaled therapy, and evaluate for chronic hypercapnia; if PaCO2 remains ≥ 50 mmHg, I should consider nocturnal NIV, and I should screen for obstructive sleep apnea because overlap syndrome is common and worsens outcomes; long-term NIV in selected stable hypercapnic COPD patients improves gas exchange, symptoms, and may reduce readmissions, though evidence quality varies and patient selection matters [^5e70f453] [^c8142ce2] [^28512379].

> But wait, what if the patient is difficult to wean or NIV is failing despite optimal settings. I should confirm that extracorporeal CO2 removal is not routinely indicated; recent randomized data suggest ECCO2R increases harm when used to avoid intubation in high-risk NIV failure, though it may facilitate weaning in select intubated patients, so I should avoid ECCO2R for avoidance of intubation outside trials and reserve it for carefully selected weaning scenarios with multidisciplinary input [^9d2f296a] [^cc7450fa].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure nothing is missing. Immediate priorities are controlled oxygen to 88–92% with frequent ABGs, prompt NIV for acidotic hypercapnic failure, and early ICU-level care for lethargy; I should avoid oversedation, treat the precipitant, and escalate to invasive ventilation if NIV fails or the patient worsens; long term, screen for OSA, consider chronic NIV for persistent hypercapnia, and coordinate close follow-up to prevent recurrence [^a847f43c] [^fabe348f] [^8ac0ae02].

---

Lethargy in COPD with CO2 retention reflects **hypercapnic encephalopathy** from rising PaCO2 and acidosis, worsened by hypoxemia and respiratory muscle fatigue [^b3ffc64a]. Immediate priorities are **controlled oxygen** (target SpO2 88–92%) [^a847f43c] to avoid suppressing hypoxic drive, and **noninvasive ventilation** (NIV) if acidosis or respiratory distress persists [^fabe348f] [^c368ec31]. Lethargy signals severe disease and a high risk of deterioration; **close monitoring and rapid escalation** are essential to prevent respiratory arrest [^8ac0ae02].

## Pathophysiology of lethargy in COPD with CO2 retention

Lethargy in COPD with CO2 retention arises from **complex interactions**:

- **Hypercapnia and acidosis**: Elevated PaCO2 lowers cerebral pH, causing CO2 narcosis with drowsiness, confusion, and eventually coma [^b3ffc64a].

- **Hypoxemia**: Low PaO2 further impairs cerebral function and increases lethargy.

- **Respiratory muscle fatigue**: Increased work of breathing from airflow limitation and hyperinflation leads to muscle fatigue, hypoventilation, and CO2 retention [^08b6da82].

- **Sedative effects of medications**: Benzodiazepines, opioids, and other CNS depressants reduce respiratory drive and worsen CO2 retention [^983044c8].

---

## Clinical implications and risks

Lethargy in COPD with CO2 retention signals **severe disease** and high risk of:

- **Respiratory failure**: Progression to acute hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support [^b3ffc64a].

- **Increased mortality**: Hypercapnic respiratory failure carries high in-hospital mortality (~36%) [^b3ffc64a].

- **Long-term complications**: Chronic hypercapnia causes pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and recurrent hospitalizations [^2373c6c9].

---

## Management strategies

### Immediate interventions

- **Controlled oxygen therapy**: Titrate to SpO2 88–92% to correct hypoxemia while avoiding suppression of hypoxic drive; monitor ABGs frequently [^a847f43c] [^2abc52d1].

- **Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)**: Indicated for persistent hypercapnia (PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg) with acidosis (pH ≤ 7.35) or severe dyspnea with respiratory muscle fatigue; NIV improves gas exchange, reduces intubation, and lowers mortality [^fabe348f] [^c368ec31].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics for exacerbations; avoid sedatives that depress respiration [^c136fe87].

---

### Long-term management

- **Smoking cessation**: Essential to slow disease progression and reduce exacerbations [^52ee416d].

- **Pulmonary rehabilitation**: Improves exercise capacity, reduces dyspnea, and enhances quality of life [^08b6da82].

- **Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT)**: For chronic hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤ 55 mmHg or SaO2 ≤ 88%) to improve survival [^52ee416d].

- **Noninvasive ventilation at home**: Consider for chronic hypercapnic COPD to improve gas exchange and reduce hospitalizations [^de3ecc27] [^28512379].

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

Lethargy in COPD with CO2 retention is associated with **poor prognosis**, including high short-term mortality, frequent exacerbations, and rapid disease progression. Early recognition and aggressive management — especially NIV and controlled oxygen — improve outcomes [^c368ec31] [^a847f43c].

### Risk of readmission and mortality following hospitalization with hypercapnic respiratory failure [^b3ffc64a]. Lung (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypercapnic respiratory failure:

- **Definition**: Hypercapnic respiratory failure (type II respiratory failure) is a state of reduced alveolar ventilation with subsequent respiratory acidosis (PaCO₂ > 50 mmHg).
- **Pathophysiology**: Hypercapnic respiratory failure is most frequently caused by drug overdose, COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and the overlap syndrome of COPD and obstructive sleep apnea.
- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with severe COPD is approximately 25%.
- **Disease course**: Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure develops rapidly (within minutes to hours). Clinical manifestations include increasing dyspnea, lethargy, hypoxemic, disorientation, tachycardia, altered mental status, hypoventilation, hyperinflation, and need for ventilatory support. The disease decreases the QoL with increased risk of readmission and longer periods of hospital stay.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypercapnic respiratory failure in hospitalized patients is associated with significant mortality (36%).

### The features of AECOPD with carbon dioxide retention [^9170ec7d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The characteristics of COPD populations with carbon dioxide retention are typically not of concern. Most studies focus on the COPD populations based on pulmonary function grading. In contrast, our research is novel because we focused on a particular population with specific clinical features, and so were able to obtain some valuable results. However, the present study is not without limitations. It is only assumed that persistent carbon dioxide retention and transient carbon dioxide retention are different, but there are no observations for the longitudinal outcomes of these conditions. Secondly, the sample size was small. To address these issues, more research is needed to explore the features of carbon dioxide retention in patients with AECOPD.

### Sleep disorders in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: etiology, impact, and management [^d2c9e257]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality and may frequently be complicated by sleep disorders. Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea are commonly encountered in patients with COPD. Nocturnal hypoxemia is also prevalent in COPD may occur despite adequate awake oxygenation and can be especially severe in rapid eye movement sleep. Additionally, several factors — some of them unique to COPD — can contribute to sleep-related hypoventilation. Recognition of hypoventilation can be vital as supplemental oxygen therapy itself can acutely worsen hypoventilation and lead to disastrous consequences. Finally, accruing data establish an association between restless leg syndrome and COPD — an association that may be driven by hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia. Comorbid sleep disorders portend worse sleep quality, diminished quality of life, and multifarious other adverse consequences. The awareness and knowledge regarding sleep comorbidities in COPD has continued to evolve over past many years. There are still several lacunae, however, in our understanding of the etiologies, impact, and therapies of sleep disorders, specifically in patients with COPD. This review summarizes the latest concepts in prevalence, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of diverse sleep disorders in COPD.

Ventilatory support and intensive care admission — COPD exacerbations: Some patients need immediate admission to the respiratory care or intensive care unit, and admission to intermediate or special respiratory care units may be appropriate if adequate personnel skills and equipment exist to identify and manage acute respiratory failure. Ventilatory support in an exacerbation can be provided by either noninvasive (nasal or facial mask) or invasive (oro-tracheal tube or tracheostomy) ventilation, and respiratory stimulants are not recommended for acute respiratory failure. Indications for respiratory or medical intensive care unit admission include severe dyspnea that responds inadequately to initial emergency therapy, changes in mental status (confusion, lethargy, coma), persistent or worsening hypoxemia (PaO2 < 5.3 kPa or < 40 mmHg) and/or severe/worsening respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.25) despite supplemental oxygen and noninvasive ventilation, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and hemodynamic instability with need for vasopressors.

### Controlled oxygen therapy and carbon dioxide retention during exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^17dc474e]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Hypoxaemic patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at some risk of carbon dioxide (CO2) retention during oxygen therapy. We quantified the risk of CO2 retention with oxygen therapy in COPD in 24 consecutive patients presenting to the accident and emergency department with acute exacerbations associated with hypercapnic respiratory failure (partial arterial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] < 8 kPa and partial pressure of CO2 [PaCO2] ≥ 6.5 kPa). Only three patients developed clinically important CO2 retention (defined as a rise in PaCO2 > 1 kPa) with controlled oxygen therapy (24–40% by Venturi mask to maintain the oxygen saturation at 91–92%). These patients presented with more severe hypercapnia, but all three required only low-flow oxygen (24–28%). These findings suggest only a small risk of aggravating hypercapnia with controlled oxygen supplementation.

Another indicator that holds promise for assessing the severity of COPD is carbon dioxide retention. Carbon dioxide retention indicates the exhaustion of lung reserve, loss of ventilatory function, worsening of clinical symptoms, respiratory failure, and secondary damage. But actually we don't know the complete long term consequences of hypercapnia. Tsuboi reported that persistent carbon dioxide retention in chronic ventilatory deficient subjects may reflect an adaptive mechanism that allows for lower levels of alveolar ventilation so as not to overload the respiratory muscles. In summary, carbon dioxide retention is involved in the respiratory center drive capacity, respiratory muscle strength, airway obstruction, pulmonary parenchymal damage, and many other complex processes. The gold standard for carbon dioxide retention is arterial blood gas analysis, but arterial blood gas analysis only reflects the instantaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. Therefore, checking blood gas at different times will produce different results, and the overall extent of COPD disease leading to carbon dioxide retention (or even respiratory failure) cannot be determined accurately. Accurate prediction of COPD carbon dioxide retention from pathological changes level would be of great help in disease monitoring.

What is the relationship between carbon dioxide retention and pulmonary function and imaging parameters? To date, this relationship has not been clear. For this study, we were interested in the ability to predict and estimate carbon dioxide retention using pulmonary function parameters and imaging parameters. Therefore, the aims of the present study were: 1) to compare the differences in clinical symptom scores, inflammatory markers, pulmonary function indicators, and CT parameters between patients with carbon dioxide retention in COPD vs those without carbon dioxide retention; and 2) to identify the factors associated with carbon dioxide retention in AECOPD.

Respiratory support — oxygen therapy during COPD exacerbations: Supplemental oxygen should be titrated to improve hypoxemia with a target saturation of 88–92%, and once oxygen is started, blood gases should be checked frequently, or as clinically indicated, to ensure satisfactory oxygenation without carbon dioxide retention and/or worsening acidosis. Pulse oximetry is not as accurate as arterial blood gas and may overestimate blood oxygen content among individuals with darker skin tones. Venous blood gas to assess bicarbonate levels and pH is accurate when compared with arterial blood gas assessment, but additional data are needed because most patients included had a pH > 7.30 on presentation and PCO2 levels were dissimilar when measured by venous compared to arterial samples. Venturi masks offer more accurate and controlled delivery of oxygen than nasal prongs.

O

Supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia should be titrated to a target saturation of 88–92%. In severe ECOPD, blood gases should be checked frequently or as clinically indicated to monitor for carbon dioxide retention and/or worsening acidosis. Pulse oximetry is not as accurate as arterial blood gas measurement and, in particular, may overestimate blood oxygen content among individuals with darker skin tones. Venturi masks offer more accurate and controlled delivery of inspired oxygen than do nasal prongs.

High-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) delivers heated and humidified air–oxygen blends via special devices at rates up to 8 L/min in infants and up to 60 L/min in adults. HFNT has been associated with decreased respiratory rate and effort, improved lung mechanics and gas exchange, prolonged time to next exacerbation, and improved health-related quality-of-life scores in COPD patients with acute (or chronic) hypercapnia, but did not prevent intubation in hospitalized patients with ECOPD. In fact, the European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommends ventilatory support before using HFNT in hypercapnic ECOPD.

V

Ventilatory support can be provided by either noninvasive (NIV) means, with a nasal or facial mask, or invasive means, with an orotracheal tube or tracheostomy ventilation. NIV is the preferred initial mode of ventilation. It improves gas exchange and decreases respiratory rate, work of breathing, severity of breathlessness, intubation rates, complications (e.g. ventilator-associated pneumonia), length of hospital stay, and mortality. Once patients improve and can tolerate at least 4 hours of unassisted breathing, NIV can be directly discontinued, without any need for a "weaning" period.

Patients who fail NIV ventilation should receive invasive ventilation as subsequent rescue therapy. The use of invasive ventilation in COPD is influenced by the likely reversibility of the precipitating event, the patient's wishes, and the availability of intensive care facilities. When possible, advance directives or "living wills" make these difficult decisions easier to resolve. Major hazards include the risk of ventilator-acquired pneumonia, barotrauma and volutrauma, and the risk of tracheostomy and consequential prolonged ventilation. Respiratory stimulants (e.g. caffeine, doxapram) are not recommended to treat ECOPD.

### The features of AECOPD with carbon dioxide retention [^3643f050]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and is expected to be the third leading cause of death by 2020. COPD is also a major chronic disease that produces a large economic and social burden worldwide. In China, COPD is a major contributor to the overall morbidity and mortality burden owing to the relatively high prevalence of smoking and rising environmental pollution. There are limited treatments available for the effective prevention of COPD progression. Respiratory failure secondary to AECOPD can lead to disease progression. Therefore, distinguishing patients with a risk of carbon dioxide retention is of clinical importance in the management of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD).

Since COPD is a heterogeneous disease, it is difficult for a single indicator to reflect all features of the disease. Pulmonary function indicators, especially FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s), are recognized as important because they can reflect one of the key characteristics of COPD - airflow limitation, but according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) update in 2017, FEV 1 was used for grading of disease severity but was not a variable used to guide treatment. Other well accepted indicators include 64-detector computed tomography (CT) parameters such as bronchial wall thickness and emphysema index (EI), which reflect COPD pathological changes, airway wall thickening, and airway remodeling response. Emphysema index refers to the proportion of low-density areas less than − 950 HU occupying the lung volume. An increase in the emphysema index reflects an increase in the extent of parenchymal destruction of the lungs. Yamasawa reported that CT could be used as a non-invasive tool to predict aerobic capacity in COPD.

### Oxygen-induced hypercapnia in COPD: myths and facts [^9708de1b]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

During our medical training, we learned that oxygen administration in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) induces hypercapnia through the 'hypoxic drive' mechanism and can be dangerous. This mindset frequently results in the reluctance of clinicians to administer oxygen to hypoxemic patients with COPD. However, this fear is not based on evidence in the literature. Here, we will review the impact and pathophysiology of oxygen-induced hypercapnia in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD and recommend a titrated oxygen management.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^c8142ce2]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is used for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic hypercapnia. However, evidence for clinical efficacy and optimal management of therapy is limited. Target Audience: Patients with COPD, clinicians who care for them, and policy makers. Methods: We summarized evidence addressing five PICO (patients, intervention, comparator, and outcome) questions. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to evaluate the certainty in evidence and generate actionable recommendations. Recommendations were formulated by a panel of pulmonary and sleep physicians, respiratory therapists, and methodologists using the Evidence-to-Decision framework. Recommendations: 1) We suggest the use of nocturnal NIV in addition to usual care for patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty); 2) we suggest that patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD undergo screening for obstructive sleep apnea before initiation of long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty); 3) we suggest not initiating long-term NIV during an admission for acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, favoring instead reassessment for NIV at 2–4 weeks after resolution (conditional recommendation, low certainty); 4) we suggest not using an in-laboratory overnight polysomnogram to titrate NIV in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD who are initiating NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty); and 5) we suggest NIV with targeted normalization of Pa CO2 in patients with hypercapnic COPD on long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, low certainty). Conclusions: This expert panel provides evidence-based recommendations addressing the use of NIV in patients with COPD and chronic stable hypercapnic respiratory failure.

### The features of AECOPD with carbon dioxide retention [^4169dea2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The carbon dioxide retention COPD group had more airflow obstruction and higher residual volume, lung volume, and emphysema index, as well as lower mean lung density compared to the COPD group without carbon dioxide retention. FEV1 < 1 L and EI > 20% may be predictors of an increased risk of carbon dioxide retention.

### The features of AECOPD with carbon dioxide retention [^9cd5c493]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with carbon dioxide retention is associated with a worsening clinical condition and the beginning of pulmonary ventilation decompensation. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with carbon dioxide retention.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of consecutive patients with COPD (meeting the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease diagnostic criteria) hospitalized at The Ninth Hospital of Xi'an Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University between October 2014 and September 2017. The baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory, pulmonary function, and imaging data were compared between the 86 cases with carbon dioxide retention and the 144 cases without carbon dioxide retention.

Results

Compared with the non-carbon dioxide retention group, the group with carbon dioxide retention had a higher number of hospitalizations in the previous 12 months (p = 0.013), higher modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scores (p = 0.034), lower arterial oxygen pressure (p = 0.018), worse pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity [FEV 1 /FVC; p < 0.001], FEV 1%pred [p < 0.001], Z5%pred [p = 0.004], R5%pred [p = 0.008], R5-R20 [p = 0.009], X5 [p = 0.022], and Ax [p = 0.011]), more severe lung damage (such as increased lung volume [p = 0.011], more emphysema range [p = 0.007], and lower mean lung density [p = 0.043]). FEV 1 < 1 L (odds ratio [OR] = 4.011, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.216–7.262) and emphysema index (EI) > 20% (OR = 1.926, 95% CI: 1.080–3.432) were independently associated with carbon dioxide retention in COPD.

Conclusion

Compared with the non-carbon dioxide retention group, the group with carbon dioxide retention had different clinical, pulmonary function, and imaging features. FEV 1 < 1 L and EI > 20% were independently associated with carbon dioxide retention in AECOPD.

### A failed case of weaning from a mechanical ventilator with lorazepam successfully accomplished by ziprasidone [^e131e520]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) exacerbations are potential medical emergencies treated with bronchodilators, glucocorticoids and supplemental oxygen. However, in extreme cases, adequate treatment requires mechanical ventilation via endotracheal intubation to correct the acid-base imbalance created by the disease process. We present a case of a 52-year-old female with COPD exacerbation requiring intubation who failed extubation multiple times while concurrently being treated with lorazepam, for agitation. Based on the evidence for increased carbon dioxide retention associated with benzodiazepine use, we weaned the patient off the lorazepam which in turn allowed the patient to be successfully weaned off the ventilator.

### Oxygen therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^ca321a9e]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of oxygen as a therapeutic agent 70 years ago, much has been learned regarding the detrimental effects of hypoxemia and the beneficial impact of oxygen therapy. It is projected that there are close to 800,000 patients receiving long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) in the United States, at a cost of approximately $1.8 billion annually. The large numbers of patients receiving supplemental oxygen as treatment and the high costs incurred in providing oxygen therapy necessitate the practitioner to know the indications for LTOT as well its effects on survival, pulmonary hemodynamics, sleep, and exercise capacity. It is now recognized that the basis for LTOT prescription for all patients is founded on data that are over 25 years old and that only involve a very select cohort of patients. It is clear that further studies are required to assess the effects of oxygen on patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with only mild hypoxemia, not only survival but also on neurocognitive function, quality of life, exercise physiology, and sleep quality. In addition, although proven to be safe when prescribed long term to individuals with lung disease, there are some concerns about worsening carbon dioxide retention and increased oxidant injury. The goals of this article are to briefly describe the indications for chronic oxygen administration, the physiologic effects of treatment, and potential toxicities, as well as its effect on morbidity and mortality.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of adult patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^2abc52d1]. Respiratory Care (2022). High credibility.

AARC clinical practice guideline — oxygen saturation targets in acute and critical illness recommends population-specific ranges with supporting evidence. The committee recommends SpO2 94–98% for acutely and critically ill adults, 88–92% for critically ill adults with CO2 retention and/or COPD, and 88–93% for critically ill patients requiring FIO2 of 0.70 or higher who are not invasively ventilated with a high PEEP strategy. Supporting evidence cited includes that liberal oxygen targets led to higher 30-d mortality across 25 RCTs including 16,000 subjects with median SpO2 96% in the liberal oxygen group, and that an optimal SpO2 target of 94–98% was found in another study.

Methods

Study design and subjects

This study was a retrospective study of consecutive AECOPD patients admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine of The Ninth Hospital of Xi'an Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from October 2014 to September 2017, meeting the GOLD diagnostic criteria (FEV 1 / FVC < 70% bronchodilators inhaled). AECOPD refers to patients who have COPD symptoms (cough, sputum, shortness of breath, etc.) exacerbating the need for hospitalization. These patients are typically treated with a short acting bronchodilator, antibiotics, and / or a glucocorticoid. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) < 40 years of age; 2) pregnant women; 3) lung diseases such as lung cancer, pneumonia, active tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism, or interstitial lung disease; 4) previous pulmonary surgery; 5) unable to complete the pulmonary function test; 6) asthma, severe heart, liver, or kidney dysfunction; 7) CT images of insufficient quality for analysis; 8) other causes of respiratory failure such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome; 9) Inclusion of AECOPD patients did not use NIV before blood gas analysis; and 10) prehospital treatment that included glucocorticoids or antibiotics.

This is a subgroup of the "Digital Lung" disease assessment system and diagnostic criteria (201402013) approved by the Chinese Society for Clinical Research (Grant No.: ChiCTR-OCH-14004904). The study was approved by the Ninth Hospital of Xi'an ethics committee (No.2014001). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Grouping

Among the included patients with AECOPD, those with arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure greater than 45 mmHg were assigned to the carbon dioxide retention group. Patients with arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure less than 45 mmHg were assigned to the non-carbon dioxide retention group (control group). The 45 mmHg was chosen as the threshold, rather than the diagnostic threshold of 50 mmHg for type II respiratory failure, because our interest was to study the differences in the characteristics of people with carbon dioxide retention and those without carbon dioxide retention. Of course, for treatment, this threshold is low, but for the study of carbon dioxide retention, we believe that the key point of ventilatory decompensation is more suitable, that is, arterial blood gas carbon dioxide partial pressure 45 mmHg. In addition, according to AECOPD treatment recommendations, PaCO2 ≥ 45 mmHg can also be used as a threshold for non-invasive ventilation treatment.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^93c56015]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are characterized by structural abnormalities in the airways, alveoli and pulmonary circulation that alter ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) distributions, identified as the main mechanism of abnormal pulmonary gas exchange leading to arterial hypoxemia with or without hypercapnia; parenchymal destruction from emphysema reduces lung diffusing capacity (DLco), gas exchange generally worsens as disease progresses, and, rarely, reduced ventilatory drive from sedatives or hypnotic drugs can cause hypercapnic respiratory failure and acidosis.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^42a0e64b]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is used for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic hypercapnia. However, evidence for clinical efficacy and optimal management of therapy is limited.

Target Audience: Patients with COPD, clinicians who care for them, and policy makers.

Methods: We summarized evidence addressing five PICO (patients, intervention, comparator, and outcome) questions. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to evaluate the certainty in evidence and generate actionable recommendations. Recommendations were formulated by a panel of pulmonary and sleep physicians, respiratory therapists, and methodologists using the Evidence-to-Decision framework.

Recommendations: 1) We suggest the use of nocturnal NIV in addition to usual care for patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty); 2) we suggest that patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD undergo screening for obstructive sleep apnea before initiation of long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty); 3) we suggest not initiating long-term NIV during an admission for acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, favoring instead reassessment for NIV at 2–4 weeks after resolution (conditional recommendation, low certainty); 4) we suggest not using an in-laboratory overnight polysomnogram to titrate NIV in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD who are initiating NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty); and 5) we suggest NIV with targeted normalization of Pa CO 2 in patients with hypercapnic COPD on long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

Conclusions: This expert panel provides evidence-based recommendations addressing the use of NIV in patients with COPD and chronic stable hypercapnic respiratory failure.

### Association of non-obstructive dyspnoea with all-cause mortality and incident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^ac607c7f]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Our study did not perform a subgroup analysis because the number of relevant studies was small and the minimum requirements were not met. Lindberg et al found that dyspnoea is a significant risk factor for incident COPD in men, but not in women. Whether dyspnoea demonstrate sex differences remains unknown. Knowledge in this area is still lacking, and further studies are needed to enhance our understanding of dyspnoea with COPD. Dyspnoea has various causes, and therefore further etiological investigations are necessary. In individuals with normal spirometry, dyspnoea may be caused by exercise or physical activity, pulmonary infection, inflammatory lung diseases, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary allergic reaction, cardiovascular disease, anaemia or even psychological factors (anxiety or panic). Therefore, clinicians should screen and exclude dyspnoea caused by other diseases and psychological factors before managing individuals with non-obstructive dyspnoea with pre-COPD to avoid delayed management.

At present, no clear evidence indicating that drugs can alter COPD progression is available. Our study focused on identifying high-risk individuals who retained normal lung function, increasing attention to non-obstructive dyspnoea, strengthening follow-up and lung function testing, and even drug therapy to allow patients to benefit from early treatment. Early intervention for individuals who are at risk of COPD is a crucial next step.

The pathophysiological mechanism of COPD caused by dyspnoea is still unclear, but reasonable assumptions can be made. Dyspnoea is a symptom that may indicate underlying health conditions, such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which can contribute to an increased mortality risk. Dyspnoea is often a manifestation of underlying diseases, such as COPD, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or interstitial lung disease. These conditions can significantly impact pulmonary function and overall health, leading to an increased mortality risk. Dyspnoea can also limit an individual's ability to engage in physical activity and exercise, which is associated with various health benefits. Reduced physical activity can lead to deconditioning, muscle weakness, and an increased risk of other health complications. Additionally, decreased exercise tolerance can result in a sedentary lifestyle, which is associated with high mortality rates. Furthermore, dyspnoea often occurs due to inadequate oxygenation of the body, and impaired lung function leads to reduced oxygen uptake and increased carbon dioxide retention. Our research team recently found that ventilatory inefficiency was associated with small airway dysfunction, which is a key pathological feature in patients with COPD.

### The features of AECOPD with carbon dioxide retention [^cff92718]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

COPD is a heterogeneous disease, and for the specific population included in this study, carbon dioxide retention indicates that the disease has progressed to the decompensation phase of respiratory dysfunction. In terms of COPD treatment, this population therefore requires the most medical resources and tends to respond poorly to clinical treatment. Our study revealed the clinical, pulmonary function, and imaging features of patients who have carbon dioxide retention. The carbon dioxide retention group had more frequent hospital admissions for acute exacerbations in the 12 months prior to the study, more pronounced dyspnea symptoms, and lower arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Regardless of the traditional lung function or IOS test, the carbon dioxide retention group had poorer parameters, more obstructive airflow, and higher residual volume. In imaging, the carbon dioxide retention group had higher lung volume and emphysema index, and lower mean lung density. However, there was no difference in emphysematous distribution and multi-stage bronchial wall area. Our results showed that FEV 1 < 1 L and EI > 20% can help predict the increased risk of COPD with carbon dioxide retention.

Studies from ECLIPSE suggest that the clinical manifestations of COPD vary widely, and the extent of airflow limitation cannot capture the heterogeneity of the disease. FEV 1 is not believed to reflect the whole picture of COPD and is not a reliable predictor of disease stage for specific individuals. However, there is also the opinion that FEV 1 < 1 L is an independent prognostic factor. Although FEV1 is generally expressed more accurately as a percentage of the predicted value, a fixed cutoff is assessed for limited airflow severity when FEV1 is much lower than normal, and we believe it to be reliable for clinical use. Our study also showed that FEV 1 < 1 L predicts the presence of carbon dioxide, which is especially useful for assessing COPD with chronic long-term carbon dioxide retention and to provide a reference for deciding on treatments like adjuvant ventilation, or for parameter selection as a follow-up step. Emphysema index is currently a more accepted imaging parameter for the assessment of COPD because of its reflection of both pathological and functional impairments. Our regression analysis showed that EI > 20% and FEV 1 < 1 L can be used to predict carbon dioxide retention, reflecting both pathological and functional impairments. O'Donnell conducted a similar study using discriminant analysis and found that FEV 1 / FVC rates, as well as vital capacity (% predicted) or FVC (% predicted), differentiated patients requiring mechanical ventilation from those who did not.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^a1a3649d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world and is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Despite progress in the treatment of symptoms and prevention of acute exacerbations, few advances have been made to ameliorate disease progression or decrease mortality. To date, the only therapeutic interventions known to reduce mortality in COPD are smoking cessation and long-term treatment with continuous supplemental oxygen for patients who have severe hypoxemia at rest.

Since the development of NIV, there has been interest in its use for the treatment of patients with COPD and chronic stable hypercapnia. During acute exacerbations with ventilatory failure, NIV is frequently used because it has been shown to improve survival (reviewed in Reference). However, there have been fewer studies addressing the use of chronic domiciliary, nocturnal NIV for stable hypercapnic COPD. Most older studies were small and/or used modest driving pressures in an attempt to normalize gas exchange, improve symptoms, and reduce morbidity and mortality. More recently, however, interest in the use of NIV in chronic hypercapnic COPD has been renewed with studies of so-called "high-intensity" NIV, which refers to inspiratory pressures higher than those used in most previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as controlled ventilation with higher-than-baseline respiratory rates to maximally reduce the Pa CO 2.

Thus, in stable patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnia (defined as FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70; resting Pa CO 2 > 45 mm Hg; not during exacerbation), long-term NIV has the potential to improve physiological parameters (e.g. lung function or gas exchange), clinical symptoms (e.g. functional capacity, dyspnea, quality of life [QOL], and sleep quality) and patient-centered outcomes (e.g. hospital readmission and survival).

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to summarize the available evidence and provide actionable recommendations addressing 1) patients with COPD, especially potential subgroups who might benefit from NIV therapy; 2) the ideal timing and location (e.g. hospital or sleep laboratory vs. home) for NIV initiation; and 3) the identification of optimal modes and settings for chronic NIV therapy.

### Inspired fraction of carbon dioxide in oxygen supply to chronic pulmonary disease [^ddda81ed]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoxemic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at risk of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) retention during oxygen therapy and hypercapnia in COPD is associated with an ominous prognosis. Rebreathing with oxygen mask is possible in practice and possibly affects CO(2) retention due to an increased inspired fraction of CO(2). Its effects on arterial partial pressure of CO(2) during oxygen supply have, to the best of our knowledge, never been studied. We measured the inspired fraction of CO(2) in eighteen non-hypoxemic stable COPD patients with a capnograph during a 5 min trial with two different modes of oxygen supply (oxygen mask without reservoir bag and nasal prongs, respectively at a flow of 10 l/min and 2l/min). We found no significant increase in inspiratory CO(2) concentration. These findings suggest that inspired fraction of CO(2) does not increase markedly during controlled oxygen therapy.

### The features of AECOPD with carbon dioxide retention [^216081d9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

There are many phenotypes based on COPD, however, COPD with carbon dioxide retention has rarely been studied. Gas exchange in COPD is very complicated; the mechanism of carbon dioxide retention induced hypercapnia is the result of multiple pathological processes that are interwoven at varying degrees and affected by the disease process itself. In addition, the cellular and molecular details of lung tissue destruction are not completely understood. The destruction of lung parenchyma mainly manifested as emphysema, accompanied by pulmonary vascular bed damage. Small airway remodeling and occlusion are other important outcomes of pathological damage. In acute exacerbation events, airway spasms, mucosal edema, and sputum cause increased airway obstruction and inflammation.

Chronic respiratory failure results in carbon dioxide retention due to respiratory insufficiency, We found that there was a more severe airflow limitation in the carbon dioxide retention group. In the image data for this group, we found a more obvious increase in the lung volume and the emphysema index, and that the mean lung density was lower, suggesting that there was not only excessive expansion of dynamic lung, but also more physical damage to the lung involved in the pathological process.

Clinical strategies for AECOPD include: treatment of the primary disease, controlled oxygen therapy, and the use of an invasive or non-invasive ventilator to improve lung ventilation. Current clinical treatment is partial to improving lung ventilation, while putting less emphasis on changes in the pulmonary parenchyma. However, better carbon dioxide removal has been a topic of growing interest in recent years, and a new approach involves extracorporeal venous CO 2 removal.

Carbon dioxide retention in the body can cause harm that is multi-system and widespread. Clinical emphasis is on the treatment of hypoxia, but there is an attitude of tolerance to carbon dioxide retention. Clinicians should recognize that carbon dioxide retention will increase the hypoxic damage to multiple tissues. Hypervolemic respiratory failure noninvasive ventilation (NIV) treatment is the primary method of clinical management and, based several large studies, it is reasonable to use a higher level of partial pressure of carbon dioxide to determine NIV use. Our study focused on the parameters of pulmonary function and imaging that would be valuable when carbon dioxide retention was elevated, so the cutoff partial pressure of carbon dioxide was chosen as 45 mmHg.

Prioritization of Outcomes

Following the standard GRADE guidance, the panel rated each outcome for their perceived importance to a patient with COPD on a scale of 1–9, with mean scores of 7–9 indicating a "critical" outcome, mean scores of 4–6 indicating an "important but not critical" outcome, and scores of 1–3 indicating an outcome that was "not important". In general, outcomes deemed critical should be most informative to the panel in generating recommendations. The panel identified 11 key outcomes that would take priority in guideline decision-making for all PICO questions: dyspnea, hospitalizations, mortality, 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD), serum CO 2 and O 2, QOL, FEV 1, FVC, sleep efficiency, and minor side effects.

Literature Search and Study Selection

With the assistance of a medical librarian, the two methodologists conducted literature searches for each PICO question. We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL (Central Register of Controlled Trials), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science from inception to April 2019 for English-language observational studies and RCTs addressing the PICO questions of interest. If existing systematic reviews addressing the PICO questions were available, these searches and reviews were updated to include the latest evidence. The two methodologists screened all potential citations identified by the search independently in duplicate to identify all relevant studies to include in the quantitative evidence summaries.

### Noninvasive ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis [^a770a44d]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Although long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves survival, it has little effect on hypoventilation and other outcomes in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recent studies have shown that the use of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, when used in combination with LTOT in selected stable COPD patients, controls hypoventilation and improves daytime arterial blood gases, sleep quality, health status and may have a benefit in reducing exacerbation frequency and severity. Patients who show the greatest reduction in overnight carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood with ventilation are most likely to benefit from long-term ventilatory support. Some benefits have also been shown in patients with chronic respiratory failure due to bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis, though survival is inferior in this patient group. As most studies of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been relatively short term, large multicentre studies with survival, exacerbations and hospital admissions as the primary end points are required to evaluate longer term effects.

### Sleep hypoventilation in hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: prevalence and associated factors [^9ef95224]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Sleep hypoventilation (SH) may be important in the development of hypercapnic respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The prevalence of SH, associated factors, and overnight changes in waking arterial blood gases (ABG), were assessed in 54 stable hypercapnic COPD patients without concomitant sleep apnoea or morbid obesity. Lung function assessment, anthropomorphic measurements, and polysomnography with ABG measurement before and after sleep were conducted in all patients. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension (Pt, CO2) was measured in sleep, using simultaneous arterial carbon dioxide tension (Pa, CO2) for in vivo calibration and to correct for drift in the sensor. Of the patients, 43% spent ≥ 20% of sleep time with Pt, CO2 > 1.33 kPa (10 mmHg) above waking baseline. Severity of SH was best predicted by a combination of baseline Pa, CO2, body mass index and per cent rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. REM-related hypoventilation correlated significantly with severity of inspiratory flow limitation in REM, and with apnoea/hypopnoea index. Pa, CO2 increased mean ± SD 0.70 ± 0.65 kPa (5.29 ± 4.92 mmHg) from night to morning, and this change was highly significant. The change in Pa, CO2 was strongly correlated with severity of SH. Sleep hypoventilation is common in hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and related to baseline arterial carbon dioxide tension, body mass index and indices of upper airway obstruction. Sleep hypoventilation is associated with significant increases in arterial carbon dioxide tension night-to-morning, and may contribute to long-term elevations in arterial carbon dioxide tension.

Ventilatory support in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) notes that noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is occasionally used in patients with stable very severe COPD, and NIV may be considered of some use in a selected group of patients, particularly in those with pronounced daytime hypercapnia and recent hospitalization, although a systematic review was unable to support or refute this; in contrast, in patients with both COPD and obstructive sleep apnea there are clear indications for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). During exacerbations of COPD, NIV in the form of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is the standard of care for decreasing morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of COPD and acute respiratory failure, and in stable patients with both COPD and obstructive sleep apnea there are clear benefits associated with the use of CPAP to improve both survival and the risk of hospital admissions.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^7b72a2a9]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should no longer be seen as a condition for which little can be done. Novel pharmacotherapeutic interventions, surgical and procedural advances, and respiratory assist devices have provided numerous ways to help patients with COPD and treatable traits. For nearly 30 years, non-invasive ventilation, the application of positive pressure through a mask interface placed outside of the airway, has been the cornerstone for treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation. Clinical trials indicate that this intervention could benefit patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in a stable state. This narrative review aims to provide the necessary background for internists to consider this therapeutic option for their COPD patients. We discuss the mechanism of action and implementation, and provide a glimpse into the future of this promising intervention.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute respiratory failure — invasive ventilation considerations and outcomes: The use of invasive ventilation in patients with very severe COPD is influenced by the likely reversibility of the precipitating event, the patient's wishes, and the availability of intensive care facilities, and major hazards include the risk of ventilator-acquired pneumonia, barotrauma and volutrauma, and the risk of tracheostomy with prolonged ventilation; acute mortality among COPD patients with respiratory failure is lower than mortality among patients ventilated for non-COPD causes, and a large study reported in-hospital mortality of 17–49%, with further deaths over the next 12 months particularly among those with poor lung function before invasive ventilation (FEV1 < 30% predicted), a non-respiratory comorbidity, or who were housebound, whereas patients without a previously diagnosed comorbidity, with a potentially reversible cause (such as an infection), or who were relatively mobile and not using long-term oxygen did well after ventilator support.

Hospitalization assessment and emergency department management in COPD exacerbations — potential indications for hospitalization assessment include severe symptoms such as sudden worsening of resting dyspnea, high respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, confusion, drowsiness; acute respiratory failure; onset of new physical signs (e.g., cyanosis, peripheral edema); failure of an exacerbation to respond to initial medical management; presence of serious comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, newly occurring arrhythmias, etc.); and insufficient home support. When patients with a COPD exacerbation come to the emergency department, if hypoxemic they should be provided with supplemental oxygen and undergo assessment to determine whether the exacerbation is life-threatening and if increased work of breathing or impaired gas exchange requires consideration for non-invasive ventilation; if so, healthcare providers should consider admission to an area where proper monitoring and care can be provided, whereas in less severe cases the patient may be managed in the emergency department or hospital ward unit. In addition to pharmacological therapy, hospital management of exacerbations includes respiratory support (oxygen therapy, ventilation), and we recommend that in hospitalized patients the severity of the exacerbation should be based on the patient's clinical signs.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^206c5e18]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) & insomnia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include key epidemiology and outcomes: COPD has an estimated prevalence in U.S. adults of 13.9% and OSA affects 9% to 26% of the U.S. adult population. Patients with both COPD and OSA have a worse prognosis compared with either condition alone, with more frequent episodes of oxygen desaturation and more total sleep time with hypoxemia and hypercapnia than OSA patients without COPD. In combined OSA and COPD, apneic events have more profound hypoxemia and more cardiac arrhythmias, and these patients are more likely to develop daytime pulmonary hypertension than patients with just OSA or COPD alone. The use of positive pressure ventilation in patients with COPD and OSA has been reported to reduce all-cause hospitalizations, emergency room visits, moderate and severe exacerbations and associated healthcare costs. Insomnia in COPD is associated with higher rates of outpatients' visits and hospitalizations.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: key concepts and advances in pulmonary rehabilitation [^08b6da82]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary rehabilitation — exercise assessment and mechanisms of exercise limitation in chronic respiratory disease are outlined as follows: Before starting an exercise training program, an exercise assessment is needed to individualize the exercise prescription, evaluate the potential need for supplemental oxygen, help rule out some cardiovascular comorbidities, and help ensure the safety of the intervention. This patient assessment may also include a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test to assess the safety of exercise, to define the factors contributing to exercise limitation, and to identify a suitable exercise prescription, and analyzing the output from a cardiopulmonary exercise test may uncover otherwise hidden exercise-related issues such as hypoxemia, dysrhythmias, musculoskeletal problems, or cardiac ischemia. Exercise intolerance in individuals with chronic respiratory disease may result from ventilatory constraints, pulmonary gas exchange abnormalities, peripheral muscle dysfunction, cardiac dysfunction, or any combination of the above. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ventilatory requirements during exercise are often higher than expected because of increased work of breathing, increased dead space ventilation, impaired gas exchange, and increased ventilatory demand, with expiratory airflow obstruction and dynamic hyperinflation further limiting maximal ventilation and contributing to increased work of breathing, mechanical constraints on the respiratory muscles, and an intensified sense of dyspnea. Hypoxia directly increases pulmonary ventilation through augmenting peripheral chemoreceptor output and indirectly through stimulation of lactic acid production, whereas supplemental oxygen therapy during exercise, in hypoxemic and even in nonhypoxemic patients with COPD, allows for higher intensity training. The cardiovascular system is affected by chronic respiratory disease, with an increase in right ventricular afterload from elevated pulmonary vascular resistance due to combinations of hypoxic vasoconstriction, vascular injury and/or remodeling, and erythrocytosis, and other cardiac complications include tachyarrhythmias and elevated right atrial pressure that may further compromise cardiac function during exercise. Lower limb muscle dysfunction is frequent in individuals with chronic respiratory disease and is an important cause of exercise limitation, and in COPD increased lactic acid production for a given exercise work rate increases ventilatory requirement, with a tendency to retain carbon dioxide during exercise further increasing acidosis and ventilatory burden. Despite adaptations, patients with COPD often have static and dynamic hyperinflation that places respiratory muscles at a mechanical disadvantage, and both functional inspiratory muscle strength and inspiratory muscle endurance are compromised.

### Fentanyl transdermal system [^983044c8]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Hypoventilation (Respiratory Depression)

Serious or life-threatening hypoventilation may occur at any time during the use of fentanyl transdermal system especially during the initial 24 to 72 hours following initiation of therapy and following increases in dose.

Because significant amounts of fentanyl continue to be absorbed from the skin for 17 hours or more after the patch is removed, hypoventilation may persist beyond the removal of fentanyl transdermal system. Consequently, patients with hypoventilation should be carefully observed for degree of sedation and their respiratory rate monitored until respiration has stabilized.

The use of concomitant CNS active drugs requires special patient care and observation.

Respiratory depression is the chief hazard of opioid agonists, including fentanyl the active ingredient in fentanyl transdermal system. Respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly or debilitated patients, usually following large initial doses in non-tolerant patients, or when opioids are given in conjunction with other drugs that depress respiration.

Respiratory depression from opioids is manifested by a reduced urge to breathe and a decreased rate of respiration, often associated with the "sighing" pattern of breathing (deep breaths separated by abnormally long pauses). Carbon dioxide retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids. This makes overdoses involving drugs with sedative properties and opioids especially dangerous.

Fentanyl transdermal system should be used with extreme caution in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and in patients having a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression. In such patients, even usual therapeutic doses of fentanyl transdermal system may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients, alternative non-opioid analgesics should be considered, and opioids should be employed only under careful medical supervision at the lowest effective dose.

Chronic Pulmonary Disease

Because potent opioids can cause serious or life-threatening hypoventilation, fentanyl transdermal system should be administered with caution to patients with pre-existing medical conditions predisposing them to hypoventilation. In such patients, normal analgesic doses of opioids may further decrease respiratory drive to the point of respiratory failure.

Head Injuries and Increased Intracranial Pressure

Fentanyl transdermal system should not be used in patients who may be particularly susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure, impaired consciousness, or coma. Opioids may obscure the clinical course of patients with head injury. Fentanyl transdermal system should be used with caution in patients with brain tumors.

The administration of a high FIO2 to COPD patients breathing spontaneously may result in hypercapnia, due to reversal of preexisting regional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, resulting in a greater dead space. Arterial blood gas trends have not been reported in these patients. In a 31-bed medical ICU in a teaching hospital we prospectively investigated the response of 17 CO2-retaining COPD patients, after acute respiratory crisis stabilization with noninvasive ventilation, to an FIO2 of 1.0 for 40 min, after having been noninvasively ventilated with an FIO2 of ≤ 0.50 for 40 min.

Results

The mean ± SD baseline findings were: PaO2 101.4 ± 21.7 mm Hg, PaCO2 52.6 ± 10.4 mm Hg, breathing frequency 17.8 ± 3.7 breaths/min, tidal volume 601 ± 8 mL, and Glasgow coma score of 14.8 ± 0.3. PaO2 significantly increased (P < .001) when FIO2 was increased to 1.0, but there was no significant change in PaCO2, breathing frequency, tidal volume, or Glasgow coma score.

Conclusions

During noninvasive ventilation with an FIO2 sufficient to maintain a normal PaO2, a further increase in FIO2 did not increase PaCO2 in our CO2-retaining COPD patients.

Regarding respiratory support for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, more specifically with respect to noninvasive ventilation, GOLD 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating long-term noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation to improve hospitalization-free survival in patients with severe chronic hypercapnia (particularly with pronounced daytime persistent hypercapnia, PaCO2 ≥ 53 mmHg) and a history of hospitalization for acute respiratory failure.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^88879602]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

An important subgroup to consider in the discussion of non-invasive ventilation is the obstructive sleep apnea and COPD overlap syndrome. These patients have been systematically excluded from most randomized controlled trials of non-invasive ventilation in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD, although they might benefit particularly well from the intervention. Another important consideration is whether one should modify the positive airway pressure modality strategy to continuous positive airway pressure rather than non-invasive ventilation when obstructive sleep apnea is the predominant pathology in the overlap syndrome, akin to the recommendation in the obesity hypoventilation syndrome with severe sleep apnea, where continuous positive airway pressure rather than non-invasive ventilation is the first line option. Patients with the overlap syndrome have lower 5 year survival rates than those obstructive sleep apnea even when treated with continuous positive airway pressure. However, in a prospective cohort, continuous positive airway pressure treatment in patients with the overlap syndrome improved survival and decreased hospital admissions. Whether adding high intensity non-invasive ventilation strategy to adequate end-expiratory pressure to maintain airway patency would serve to improve outcomes in this group of patients is not known. When confronted with patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and COPD overlap, it might be challenging to determine the primary factor responsible for hypercapnic respiratory failure. Nonetheless, pragmatic goals relating to positive airway pressure treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome are similar to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD and include correction of sleep hypoxemia, obstructive events and hypercapnia. In the absence of robust clinical trials in this population, the authors tend to use high intensity non-invasive ventilation when clinical evaluation points toward COPD as the biological cause for chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, and positive airway pressure treatment when obesity hypoventilation syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea predominate.

Evidence Summary and Critical Appraisal of Included Studies

The methodologists extracted data and imported them into RevMan version 5.3 software (Cochrane) for meta-analysis. We used DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to conduct all meta-analyses. Study weights were generated using the inverse-variance method. We present results of all analyses using relative risks (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risk of bias (RoB) independently and in duplicate for each outcome of individual studies using the Cochrane RoB tool that classifies RoB as "low", "high", or "unclear" for each of the following domains: sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting, and other bias. We rated the overall RoB as the highest risk attributed to any criterion.

With input from the panel chairs, the methodologists developed an evidence profile for each PICO. Following GRADE principles, the certainty of evidence for each outcome was judged to be "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low". In accordance with GRADE, the certainty of evidence for each outcome was originally set as high if it originated from RCTs and low if it originated from observational data. We subsequently downgraded the quality of the evidence by one or two degrees if results from individual studies had a serious or very serious RoB, there were serious inconsistencies in the results across studies, the evidence was indirect, the data were imprecise, or publication bias was believed to be likely.

Generation of Clinical Recommendations for PICO Questions

The direction and strength of recommendations was decided by consensus at an in-person panel meeting. With the assistance of the methodologists, the chairs led the panel in developing recommendations for each PICO question by working through the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework, which considers the quality of evidence, balance of desirable and undesirable effects, assumptions of patient values and preferences, resource use, health equity, acceptability of an intervention, and feasibility of implementation. For question 2 (obstructive sleep apnea [OSA] screening), we used the GRADE EtD framework for diagnostic tests. Following GRADE guidance, each recommendation was designated as "strong" or "conditional", using the phrasing "we recommend" for strong recommendations and "we suggest" for conditional recommendations.

Mechanisms of benefit and rationale of non-invasive ventilation

Respiratory symptoms of COPD originate from hyperinflation of the lungs due to emphysematous loss of elastic recoil and increased airflow resistance in small airways from inflammatory changes of chronic bronchitis. These parenchymal and airway changes result in mismatching of the lung ventilation and perfusion and in consequent gas exchange abnormalities. Hyperinflation, in turn, means that respiratory muscles have to operate at a shorter than optimal resting length. Consequently, respiratory muscles have chronic adaptions that include atrophy and a tendency for more slow twitch, high endurance fibre types. A disequilibrium between the elastic (hyperinflation) and resistive (narrowed, collapsible airways) loads and capacity to counteract these loads (respiratory pump function) result in respiratory failure.

Non-invasive ventilation involves the provision of positive airway pressure to augment inspiration. The positive airway pressure from the ventilator is provided via a mask interface placed on a patient's face (figure 1). Although the exact mechanism of benefit is unknown in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, non-invasive ventilation can favorably impact several of these pathophysiological mechanisms. After the first night of non-invasive ventilation, patients with COPD have higher average tidal volumes (the amount of inspired and expired air with each respiratory cycle) compared with matched controls without non-invasive ventilation, despite cessation of assisted ventilation, throughout the day. This favorable breathing pattern of higher tidal volume and unchanged respiratory rate is maintained over six months. One explanation might be that ventilatory response to carbon dioxide inhalation after non-invasive ventilation is improved. Indeed, a strong correlation has been shown between the decrease in nocturnal PaCO 2 during non-invasive ventilation and a heightened ventilatory response to carbon dioxide rebreathing. Windisch and colleagues showed persistent improvements in diurnal PaCO 2 concentrations after non-invasive ventilation was applied with the goal of normocapnia. Normocapnia while on non-invasive ventilation was accompanied by sustained improvement in PaCO 2 and bicarbonate concentrations while the patient was awake and off non-invasive ventilation. Functional respiratory imaging data suggest the recruitment of collapsed small airway units and improved ventilation or perfusion matching. Application of positive airway pressure at the airway opening could serve as a splint that abrogates a premature small airway closure, thereby improving exhalation. As such, several studies have shown non-invasive ventilation results in modest decreases in total lung capacity, residual volumeand higher FEV 1. Although these studies did not aim to determine exact onset and duration of the salutary changes in lung volumes, these effects seem to be evident as early as day fiveand persist through six to 12 months. Furthermore, non-invasive ventilation might improve lung edema, reduce a pro-inflammatory state, and enhance innate immunity, most likely by facilitating the elimination of carbon dioxide, a signalling molecule that mediates adverse effects in the lung. The improvement in hyperinflation seems to correlate with the reduction in PaCO 2 concentrations. Non-invasive ventilation could allow respiratory muscle rest and reversal of muscle fatigue. Nonetheless, respiratory muscle strength appears unchanged when measured directly via electromagnetic phrenic nerve stimulation, in contrast to some studies that showed an improved performance in volitional indices, presumably due to motivational factors. A study from 2022 of 30 patients with COPD on non-invasive ventilation for a year showed an improvement in the thickening fraction of the diaphragm with a statistically significant change in hyperinflation indices, perhaps indicating improved function of the diaphragm. Figure 2 briefly summarises the pathophysiology of hyperinflation and potential salutary effects of non-invasive ventilation.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) monitoring and follow‑up — Routine follow‑up of COPD patients is essential, and symptoms, exacerbations and objective measures of airflow obstruction should be monitored to determine when to modify management and to identify any complications and/or comorbidities that may develop. At each visit, information on symptoms since the last visit should be collected, including cough and sputum, breathlessness, fatigue, activity limitation, and sleep disturbances, including insomnia; questionnaires such as the COPD Assessment Test (CAT™) can be used, and trends and changes are more valuable than single measurements. The frequency, severity, type and likely causes of all exacerbations should be monitored, with sputum volume and presence or absence of sputum purulence noted; specific inquiry into response to previous treatment, unscheduled visits to providers, telephone calls for assistance, and use of urgent or emergency care facilities is important, and hospitalizations should be documented including the facility, duration of stay, and any use of critical care or mechanical ventilatory support. Adherence and appropriate use of prescribed treatments is a key action that should be mandatory in each clinical visit, with attention to dosages of prescribed medications, adherence to the regimen, inhaler technique, effectiveness of the current regime, and side effects.

### Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: It depends on the objective! [^9d2f296a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The independent analysis of the two study strata reveals noteworthy findings. In patients at risk of NIV failure (first stratum), in line with previous studies, ECCO2R use lowered Pa CO 2 and alleviated dyspnea within 24 hours of the start of the therapy. However, a higher intubation rate was observed in the ECCO2R arm (13% vs. 4%), and ECCO2R significantly increased ICU length of stay and in-hospital and 60-day mortality, despite no increase in the total number of severe adverse events with ECCO2R. Severe bleeding complications nevertheless occurred in the intervention group. The poor outcomes observed with ECCO2R in the NIV stratum cannot be attributed to baseline differences between the groups. Importantly, the VENT-AVOID study results likely have good extrinsic validity, as baseline patient characteristics were typical of patients with COPD experiencing severe exacerbation. It is also crucial to mention that the study results are consistent with the trend toward increased mortality previously observed in the smaller study published in 2022 by Barrett and colleagues, which also addressed the interest of ECCO2R in avoiding intubation. Consequently, the results of the VENT-AVOID study NIV stratum clearly suggest refraining from the use of ECCO2R in attempting to avoid intubation in patients with COPD exacerbation at risk of NIV failure.

The results of the VENT-AVOID trial regarding ECCO2R use in facilitating weaning (second study stratum) are much more encouraging, showing a trend toward more VFD-5 with ECCO2R than with standard care. This was also true for VFD at 10 days. Interestingly, the potential benefit of ECCO2R to enhance weaning in patients with COPD experiencing difficulties in being separated from the ventilator was visible even if an increase in pH and decrease inwith ECCO2R were no longer observed after 24 hours of treatment. Importantly, no increases in ICU or hospital length of stay or in mortality were observed when ECCO2R was used in difficult-to-wean intubated patients with COPD. Although the VENT-AVOID trial has acknowledged limitations, it suggests that additional studies powered to assess mortality outcomes are warranted to explore the role of ECCO2R to facilitate weaning in patients with COPD exacerbation who had to be intubated and are difficult to wean. However, given the high prevalence of bleeding complications and other adverse events reported with the currently available ECCO2R devices, not only in patients with COPD but also in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is advisable to address technical issues and enhance the safety of the technique before planning large-scale trials.

### A retrospective analysis to identify predictors of COPD-related rehospitalization [^68438423]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow limitation and is associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the lungs to noxious particles or gases. Although the primary effect of COPD is on the lungs, it is also associated with the development of adverse systemic effects and comorbidities, which contribute to its severity. COPD is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality; worldwide in 2010, it affected more than 210 million individuals and was one of the top six leading causes of death. In 2015, the World Health Organization estimated that approximately 65 million individuals had moderate-to-severe COPD and projected it to become the third leading cause of death globally by 2030. In 2012, chronic lower respiratory diseases, including COPD, were the third leading cause of deaths in the United States and, in 2013, an estimated 15.7 million adults had physician-diagnosed COPD. In 2012, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) estimated that around 12 million individuals in the United States had undiagnosed COPD.

Patients with COPD often experience acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, known as exacerbations, which range in severity from mild events that patients manage themselves at home to severe episodes that require hospitalization. Recurrent COPD exacerbations, particularly those requiring hospitalization, have been shown to hasten lung function decline and increase patient mortality, as well as have a deleterious impact on health-related quality of life. According to the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society task force, indications for hospitalization of patients with an exacerbation include: occurrence of high-risk comorbidities (e.g. pneumonia, cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, renal or liver failure); inadequate response of symptoms to outpatient management; marked increase in dyspnea; inability to eat or sleep because of symptoms; worsening hypoxemia or hypercapnia; alterations in mental status; inability of patients to care for themselves (lack of home support); uncertain diagnosis; and inadequate home care.

### Fentanyl citrate [^351cd733]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Adequate facilities should be available for postoperative monitoring and ventilation of patients administered anesthetic doses of Fentanyl Citrate Injection. It is essential that these facilities be fully equipped to handle all degrees of respiratory depression. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Fentanyl Citrate Injection are essential. As with other potent opioids, the respiratory depressant effect of Fentanyl Citrate Injection may persist longer than the measured analgesic effect. The total dose of all opioid agonists administered should be considered by the practitioner before ordering opioid analgesics during recovery from anesthesia.

Certain forms of conduction anesthesia, such as spinal anesthesia and some peridural anesthetics can alter respiration by blocking intercostal nerves. Through other mechanisms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] Fentanyl Citrate Injection can also alter respiration. Therefore, when Fentanyl Citrate Injection is used to supplement these forms of anesthesia, the anesthetist should be familiar with the physiological alterations involved and be prepared to manage them in the patients selected for these forms of anesthesia.

Patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Fentanyl Citrate Injection. Elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients resulting in greater risk for respiratory depression.

Monitor such patients closely including vital signs, particularly when initiating and titrating Fentanyl Citrate Injection and when Fentanyl Citrate Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Fentanyl Citrate Injection are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Oxygen use in critical illness [^92dd4221]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Oxygen is the most commonly used drug in critical care. However, because it is a gas, most clinicians and most patients do not regard it as a drug. For this reason, the use of medical oxygen over the past century has been driven by custom, practice, and "precautionary principles" rather than by scientific principles. Oxygen is a life-saving drug for patients with severe hypoxemia, but, as with all other drugs, too much can be harmful. It has been known for many decades that the administration of supplemental oxygen is hazardous for some patients with COPD and other patients who are vulnerable to retention of carbon dioxide (ie, hypercapnia). It has been recognized more recently that excessive oxygen therapy is associated with significantly increased mortality in critically ill patients, even in the absence of risk factors for hypercapnia. This paper provides a critical overview of past and present oxygen use for critically ill patients and will provide guidance for safer oxygen use in the future.

Exacerbations of COPD

A New Definition

Exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) negatively affect health status, disease progression, and prognosis. The previous GOLD definition of ECOPD was highly non-specific ("acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy ").

Besides, the severity of ECOPD was determined post facto (mild, moderate, or severe) based on the use of healthcare resources, which is useless to guide treatment at the point of care.

To address these limitations, GOLD 2023 has adopted the recent consensus Rome proposal, which defines ECOPD as: " an event characterized by dyspnea and/or cough and sputum that worsen over ≤ 14 days, which may be accompanied by tachypnea and/or tachycardia and is often associated with increased local and systemic inflammation caused by airway infection, pollution, or other insult to the airways".

Differential Diagnosis

Patients with COPD are at increased risk of other acute events, particularly decompensated heart failure, pneumonia, and/or pulmonary embolism that may mimic or aggravate an ECOPD (Figure 8). Thus, while worsening of dyspnea, particularly if associated with cough and purulent sputum, and no other symptoms or signs in a patient with COPD, may be diagnosed as an ECOPD, other patients may have worsening of respiratory symptoms, particularly dyspnea without the classic characteristics of ECOPD, that should prompt careful consideration and/or search of those potential confounders, or contributors.

Summary of Recommendations

For patients with chronic (FEV 1 /FVC < 0.70; resting Pa CO 2 > 45 mm Hg; not during exacerbation) hypercapnic respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):
1 We suggest the use of nocturnal noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in addition to usual care for patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty).
2 We suggest that patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD undergo screening for obstructive sleep apnea before initiation of long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty).
3 We suggest not initiating long-term NIV during an admission for acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, favoring instead reassessment for NIV at 2–4 weeks after resolution (conditional recommendation, low certainty).
4 We suggest not using an in-laboratory overnight polysomnogram (PSG) to titrate NIV in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD who are initiating NIV (conditional recommendation, very low certainty).
5 We suggest NIV with targeted normalization of Pa CO 2 in patients with hypercapnic COPD on long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

Unanswered questions and research priorities

Many basic questions remain about the optimal mode and settings used for NIV in COPD and how such settings should be modified over time to maximize effectiveness and adherence. The ideal time course for change in CO 2 is not known (i.e. should the goal be to change Pa CO 2 in a single night or over many weeks?). Whether clinicians should attempt to decrease Pa CO 2 using a specific mode of NIV, by attempting larger Vs or with a more rapid respiratory rate, is not known. Finally, nearly all research studies of NIV in chronic stable hypercapnic COPD exclude those who are at risk for OSA or those with known OSA. Yet, in clinical practice, many patients with COPD will also have OSA and will likely need higher EPAP settings.

Question 5: Should NIV with targeted normalization of Pa CO 2 amounts versus NIV without targeting normal Pa CO 2 amounts be used for long-term NIV in patients with COPD?

Recommendation

We suggest NIV with targeted normalization of Pa CO 2 in patients with hypercapnic COPD on long-term NIV (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

Background

A variety of different approaches to NIV have been used over the years in studies of patients with hypercapnic COPD, including different equipment, ventilation modes and settings, and therapeutic targets (e.g. symptoms and patient adherence). Given that stable hypercapnia is characterized by persistent elevation in Pa CO 2, one target for NIV has been adjustment of therapy on the basis of Pa CO 2. More recently, several studies have used so-called high-intensity NIV, which refers to high inspiratory pressures as well as higher-than-baseline respiratory rates to reduce Pa CO 2. However, the impact of normalization of Pa CO 2 is not known.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — evidence and caveats for first-line long-acting bronchodilator therapy: Evidence suggests that, in patients with symptomatic COPD, long-acting bronchodilators decrease dyspnea, improve QoL, and decrease exacerbations compared to placebo, and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) and LABAs do not increase the risk of serious adverse events or total adverse events. Long-acting bronchodilators do not supplant short-acting bronchodilators, which may improve lung function and decrease respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD. LAMAs remain the first-line maintenance therapy for symptomatic patients with confirmed COPD, with comparative reviews showing LAMAs were more effective in reducing the risk of acute exacerbations and were associated with less adverse events than LABAs; further supporting LAMAs over LABAs for first-line monotherapy, patients treated with LAMAs had reduced risk of severe exacerbations leading to hospitalization. The guideline update identified two SRs comparing various LAMAs, and neither review found that one LAMA was superior to another in terms of safety or efficacy. For certain patient populations, such as those with glaucoma or urinary retention who may not tolerate a LAMA or may be reluctant to start a LAMA given the perceived risk of an adverse outcome, a LABA could be considered as a first-line agent for symptomatic COPD. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate.

Results

Question 1: Should long-term nocturnal NIV versus usual care be used for chronic stable outpatients with hypercapnic COPD?

Recommendation

We suggest the use of nocturnal NIV in addition to usual care for patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty).

Background

Currently, COPD has been diagnosed in over 15 million adults in the United States. The most severe of these have hypercapnia, which has been associated with increased dyspnea, decreased QOL, more frequent hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Despite progress in the treatment of symptoms and prevention of acute exacerbations, few advances have been made to ameliorate disease progression or reduce mortality in this population. Since the development of positive-pressure NIV, there has been interest in its use for the treatment of patients with COPD and hypercapnia. However, clinical heterogeneity and variability in NIV protocols employed in available studies have led to a lack of consensus, variable practice, and no clear direction related to its use in this population with COPD.

Summary of the evidence

Thirteen RCTs from the search were included in the analysis for this question. Follow-up for these trials ranged from 3 to 12 months. There was some variation in the standard of care provided to the control group in the included studies. Although most trials compared NIV as an addition to oxygen therapy, two compared nocturnal NIV with exercise training with exercise training alone, and in one study, not all patients received oxygen therapy in the control arm.

All 13 studies reported mortality, but in 5 studies, the effect of NIV on mortality was not able to be estimated because of an absence of events in either group. In the remaining eight studies, mortality risk was reduced by 14% in the NIV group compared with those receiving usual care (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.27; low certainty). Patients receiving NIV had a decrease in hospitalizations (MD, 1.26 fewer; 95% CI, 2.59 fewer to 0.08 more hospitalizations; low certainty), improved QOL (standard MD [SMD], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.88; low certainty) and improvement in dyspnea (SMD, −0.51; 95% CI, −0.95 to −0.06; moderate certainty) compared with standard of care.

In the second meta-analysis, 21 randomised controlled trials, encompassing 1142 patients, that investigated non-invasive ventilation for at least 5 h per night for three consecutive weeks or more were included and compared with standard care. The investigators obtained individual patient data from most of the clinical trials and conducted linear and cox regression mixed effect modeling as well as meta-analysis on aggregated clinical trial data. Among patients with stable COPD, non-invasive ventilation reduced PaCO 2 concentrations at three months and 12 months. Non-invasive ventilation was associated with low risk for all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.75 (95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.97)). Among patients who received non-invasive ventilation in the setting of a recent (within 3 months) exacerbation, similar reductions in PaCO 2 concentrations were noted without any improvement in all-cause mortality. However, survival without admission to the hospital seemed to improve with non-invasive ventilation (adjusted hazard ratio 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.94)).

### Acute exacerbations and respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^c136fe87]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) describe the phenomenon of sudden worsening in airway function and respiratory symptoms in patients with COPD. These exacerbations can range from self-limited diseases to episodes of florid respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The average patient with COPD experiences two such episodes annually, and they account for significant consumption of health care resources. Although bacterial infections are the most common causes of AECOPD, viral infections and environmental stresses are also implicated. AECOPD episodes can be triggered or complicated by other comorbidities, such as heart disease, other lung diseases (e.g., pulmonary emboli, aspiration, pneumothorax), or systemic processes. Pharmacologic management includes bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics in most patients. Oxygen, physical therapy, mucolytics, and airway clearance devices may be useful in selected patients. In hypercapneic respiratory failure, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation may allow time for other therapies to work and thus avoid endotracheal intubation. If the patient requires invasive mechanical ventilation, the focus should be on avoiding ventilator-induced lung injury and minimizing intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure. These may require limiting ventilation and "permissive hypercapnia". Although mild episodes of AECOPD are generally reversible, more severe forms of respiratory failure are associated with a substantial mortality and a prolonged period of disability in survivors.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable systemic disease with symptoms that overlap other respiratory illnesses. An estimated 24 million adults in the United States have COPD, but > 50% of them are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Spirometry remains the "gold standard" for diagnosing COPD and for monitoring the progression of the disease. Cigarette smoking is the main cause of COPD; therefore, smoking cessation is an integral component of any program to reduce COPD risk and delay or limit the progression of airflow obstruction. Influenza vaccinations will also reduce acute respiratory illness in patients with COPD. With increasing awareness of COPD and earlier diagnosis, implementation of treatment guidelines and smoking-cessation efforts may lead to more effective management of this disease, which is projected to be the third leading cause of death in the United States by 2020.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^2373c6c9]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Economic and societal perspective

Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD carries a poor prognosis. In a query of electronic medical records, among 491 patients with compensated hypercapnia of various causes, with 170 (35%) having COPD, each 5 mm Hg increase in PaCO 2 was associated with an increased all cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.16). Over the course of a year, these patients accounted for 1030 hospital admissions and 218 (44.4%) had ≥ two hospital admissions. Therefore, implementing non-invasive ventilation in this context could reduce healthcare use and costs. In a retrospective study of the Medicare Limited Data Set (2012–18), patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure who received non-invasive ventilation treatment experienced reduced risk of mortality (relative risk reduction 39%) and reduced hospital admissions (17%) compared with a matched cohort who did not have reductions. Furthermore, a cost effectiveness analysis, based on the results of a randomized controlled trial, showed a favorable incremental cost per quality adjusted life year of $50 856 (£42 406, €49 818) in the USA.

Clearly, the burden of the evidence suggests a salutary effect for non-invasive ventilation in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD. In the following sections, we provide the reader with general recommendations for some of the unresolved issues that surround non-invasive ventilation implementation.

Which patients with COPD would benefit from non-invasive ventilation?

Early data for the efficacy of non-invasive ventilation in patients with COPD and stable, chronic hypercapnia were not very encouraging. In 2013, a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials encompassing 245 patients suggested benefits for patients who had higher PaCO 2 concentrations at baseline (≥ 55 mm Hg), who used nocturnal non-invasive ventilation > 5 h per night and with high inspiratory positive airway pressure (≥ 18 cm H 2 O). This general notion of patient selection for optimal outcomes guided the design of three randomized controlled trials of one year duration, which inform contemporary practice. The details of these clinical trials are summarized in table 1.

Results

Comparison of blood gas analysis data and other clinical parameters between the groups

Blood gas analysis showed that PaCO 2 in the carbon dioxide retention group was 49.5 (46–57.75) mmHg, higher than 38 (35–41) mmHg in the non-retention group (P < 0.001). The pH in the carbon dioxide retention group was 7.39 (7.36–7.40), lower than 7.43 (7.41–7.45) in the non-retention group (P < 0.001), while PaO 2 was 69 (58–89) mmHg in the carbon dioxide retention group, lower than 76.5 (67–85.5) mmHg in the non-retention group (P = 0.018).

Compared with the non-carbon dioxide retention group, the number of hospitalizations for the carbon dioxide retention group increased significantly during the 12 months prior to the study (P = 0.013); mMRC also increased (P = 0.034); There was no significant statistical difference between the groups for age, smoking, number of comorbidities, body mass index, CAT score (P > 0.05) (Table 1).

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: research questions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^638d1417]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) in COPD improves acute outcomes in acute on chronic respiratory failure but the effects of long-term NIV in chronic respiratory failure remain uncertain; some studies show benefits in health status, dyspnea, or blood gases but little or no impact on rehospitalization or mortality, although one recent study found NIV may improve survival. We recommend: Studies that assess the effects of long-term NIV in patients with COPD who have chronic respiratory failure, and Studies that identify characteristics of patients who are most likely to benefit from long-term NIV.

### Home non invasive ventilation (NIV) treatment for COPD patients with a history of NIV-treated exacerbation; a randomized, controlled, multi-center study [^a385f669]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the prognosis for patients who have survived an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation is poor. Despite being shown to improve survival and quality-of-life in stable patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, long-term noninvasive ventilation is controversial in unstable patients with frequent exacerbations, complicated by acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. In an uncontrolled group of patients with previous episodes of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, treated with noninvasive ventilation, we have been able to reduce mortality and the number of repeat respiratory failure and readmissions by continuing the acute noninvasive ventilatory therapy as a long-term therapy.

Methods

Multi-center open label randomized controlled trial of 150 patients having survived an admission with noninvasive ventilatory treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The included patients are randomized to usual care or to continuing the acute noninvasive ventilation as a long-term therapy, both with a one-year follow-up period. The primary endpoint is time to death or repeat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure; secondary endpoints are one-year mortality, number of readmissions and repeat acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, exacerbations, dyspnea, quality of life, sleep quality, lung function, and arterial gases.

Discussion

Though previous studies of long-term noninvasive ventilation have shown conflicting results, we believe the treatment can reduce mortality and readmissions when applied in patients with previous need of acute ventilatory support, regardless of persistent hypercapnia.

### Long-term noninvasive ventilation in chronic stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^2e35199f]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendation

We suggest not using in-hospital initiation of long-term NIV after an episode of acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, favoring instead reassessment for NIV at 2–4 weeks after resolution (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

Background

COPD exacerbations are a key cause of morbidity and mortality and place a considerable burden on healthcare systems. Unfortunately, patients often do not recover to the baseline amount of lung function or degree of symptoms, and COPD exacerbations are therefore an important contributor to worse outcomes, including lung-function decline, poorer QOL, and increased risk of death. After discharge, 60–80% of the patients are readmitted within 1 year, and 30–49% die within this first year after their hospital admission for an acute COPD exacerbation. These disappointing outcomes raised the question of whether long-term NIV should be provided to patients admitted to the hospital with an exacerbation of COPD.

Summary of the evidence

We identified four RCTs evaluating the use of long-term NIV after an episode of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Pooled data suggest that there are no major differences in mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.25; low certainty), exacerbations (MD, 0.3 fewer; 95% CI, 1.17 fewer to 0.57 more; low certainty), the need for hospitalization (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.24; very low certainty), changes in dyspnea (MD, 0.8 points lower; 95% CI, 2.17 points lower to 0.58 points higher; low certainty), QOL (MD, 2.89 points higher; 95% CI, 1.03 points lower to 6.8 points higher; low certainty), or exercise tolerance measured with 6MWD (MD, 8.64 m lower; 95% CI, 209 m lower to 192 m higher; very low certainty) when using NIV. There was a significant reduction in Pa CO 2 (MD, 3.41 mm Hg lower; 95% CI, 4.09 to 2.73 mm Hg lower; moderate certainty), but there was no improvement in Pa O 2 (MD, 1.53 mm Hg lower; 95% CI, 4.24 mm Hg lower to 1.17 mm Hg higher; very low certainty) or FEV 1 (SMD, 0.36 SD; 95% CI, −0.74 to 0.03; low certainty).

### Oxygen versus air-driven nebulisers for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomised controlled trial [^cd1dd68d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The two previous open crossover studies of inpatients with AECOPD both showed oxygen-driven nebulisation worsened hypercapnia in patients with Type 2 respiratory failure. Gunawardena et al. studied 16 patients with COPD and reported that only those with carbon dioxide retention at baseline (n = 9) demonstrated a rise in PaCO 2 after 15 min (mean of 7.7 mmHg), and one patient had a rise of 22 mmHg. Similarly, O'Donnell et al reported that 6/10 patients, all with carbon dioxide retention at baseline, showed a rise in PaCO 2 after 10 min (mean of 12.5 mmHg).

The current BTS guidelines recommend air-driven nebulisation and, if this is not available in the ambulance service, the maximum use of 6 min for an oxygen-driven nebuliser. This is based on the rationale that most of the nebulised medication will have been delivered, and is categorised as grade D evidence. We observed the mean time for dissipation of salbutamol solution from the nebuliser chamber of 5.2 min confirming that 6 min is adequate for salbutamol delivery. The proportion of participants with a PtCO 2 increase ≥ 4 mmHg was lower after 6 min than 15 min, suggesting some amelioration of risk with the shorter nebulisation treatment. Alternative methods of bronchodilator delivery include air-driven nebulisers or multiple metered dose inhaler actuations via a spacer.

The potential for rebound hypoxia after abrupt cessation of oxygen therapy has been observed both in the treatment of asthma and COPD. We identified some evidence consistent with this phenomenon which is a potentially important yet poorly recognised clinical issue.

Conclusions

There is little direct evidence about management of COVID-19 in people with COPD. Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion of COVID-19 in patients with COPD presenting with new or worsening respiratory symptoms, fever, and/or any other symptoms that could be COVID-19 related, even if these are mild, and should test for SARS-CoV-2. Patients should keep taking their oral and inhaled respiratory medications for COPD as directed, as there is no evidence that COPD medications should be changed during this COVID-19 pandemic.

### Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: It depends on the objective! [^cc7450fa]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Since the 1990s noninvasive ventilation (NIV) revolution in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and the subsequent reduction in intubation rate and mortality, we have been looking for new strategies to further improve these patients' outcomes. Because hypercapnia refractory to NIV stands as the primary cause of intubation in COPD exacerbation, and because persistent hypercapnia largely contributes to weaning difficulties, considering the use of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) is straightforward to try to optimize severe COPD exacerbation treatment. ECCO2R in COPD exacerbation has previously been evaluated in small studies. The device was used to prevent intubation in patients at high risk of NIV failure and to facilitate weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation. In a meta-analysis of 10 studies and 87 patients, ECCO2R proved effective in increasing pH, reducing Pa CO 2, and lowering respiratory rate, without compromising oxygenation significantly. However, safety concerns arose, with frequent reports of bleeding and other adverse events. Regarding the outcome of preventing intubation, several small nonrandomized studies suggested potential reduction in intubation rates and ICU length of stay, whereas others were negative. In 2022, Barrett and colleagues published a first small randomized controlled trial, with 18 patients at risk for NIV failure randomized to receive ECCO2R and NIV (9 patients) or NIV only (9 patients). In this study, ECCO2R use resulted in lower Pa CO 2 after 4 hours, alleviated dyspnea, and reduced time to NIV discontinuation. However, ICU and hospital length of stay were longer in the ECCO2R group, and a trend toward increased mortality at 90 days was observed with ECCO2R. ECCO2R use to facilitate weaning in patients with COPD exacerbation has been reported in case reports and case series. A physiological study in 10 patients with a crossover design (ECCO2R in place with sweep gas flow switched on or off) showed reduced Pa CO 2, increased pH, and decreased respiratory muscle CO 2 production with ECCO2R. The use of the technique, however, failed to reduce hyperinflation. Interestingly, work of breathing measured during the weaning process in 5 of the 10 patients tended to be lower with ECCO2R, clearly suggesting a potential interest of the technique to facilitate weaning. Overall, the use of ECCO2R in COPD exacerbation has a strong physiological rationale, but the lack of robust data does not allow providing any recommendation regarding its use in this context.

### Markers of exacerbation severity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^a9a893bd]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can experience 'exacerbations' of their conditions. An exacerbation is an event defined in terms of subjective descriptors or symptoms, namely dyspnoea, cough and sputum that worsen sufficiently to warrant a change in medical management. There is a need for reliable markers that reflect the pathological mechanisms that underlie exacerbation severity and that can be used as a surrogate to assess treatment effects in clinical studies. Little is known as to how existing study variables and suggested markers change in both the stable and exacerbation phases of COPD. In an attempt to find the best surrogates for exacerbations, we have reviewed the literature to identify which of these markers change in a consistent manner with the severity of the exacerbation event.

Methods

We have searched standard databases between 1966 to July 2004 using major keywords and terms. Studies that provided demographics, spirometry, potential markers, and clear eligibility criteria were included in this study. Central tendencies and dispersions for all the variables and markers reported and collected by us were first tabulated according to sample size and ATS/ERS 2004 Exacerbation Severity Levels I to III criteria. Due to the possible similarity of patients in Levels II and III, the data was also redefined into categories of exacerbations, namely out-patient (Level I) and in-patient (Levels II & III combined). For both approaches, we performed a fixed effect meta-analysis on each of the reported variables.

Results

We included a total of 268 studies reported between 1979 to July 2004. These studies investigated 142,407 patients with COPD. Arterial carbon dioxide tension and breathing rate were statistically different between all levels of exacerbation severity and between in out- and in-patient settings. Most other measures showed weak relationships with either level or setting, or they had insufficient data to permit meta-analysis.

Conclusion

Arterial carbon dioxide and breathing rate varied in a consistent manner with exacerbation severity and patient setting. Many other measures showed weak correlations that should be further explored in future longitudinal studies or assessed using suggested mathematical modelling techniques.

### Current opinions on non-invasive ventilation as a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^2043f848]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review examines the current reports, the evidence and the issues surrounding the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in both the acute and domiciliary setting.

Recent Findings

With the increasing use of NIV, more recent studies have focused on investigating the outcomes of our current practice. Although overall morbidity and mortality outcomes in the acute setting have improved, patients who initially stabilize but then deteriorate during an acute exacerbation of COPD have a poor prognosis. The focus must be on phenotyping this high-risk group to investigate other potential rescue treatments, including extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal. Indeed, phenotyping appears to favour the obese COPD patient, which may have a protective role in reducing the risk of NIV failure and recurrent hospital admissions. Randomized controlled trial evidence to support the use of NIV in a domiciliary setting as a treatment for COPD is awaited, and until the data from a number of ongoing clinical trials are available, the wide variation in global practice will continue. Increased understanding of patient ventilator asynchrony has improved domiciliary NIV set up, which is expected to enhance the tolerability of NIV, promoting patient adherence.

Summary

NIV is the established standard of care to treat acute hypercapnic exacerbations of COPD postoptimal medical management. NIV as a long-term treatment for COPD remains controversial based on the evidence from the published randomized controlled trials. With increasing experience of NIV therapy, patient outcomes are improving; however, further work is still required to better characterize and target the patients who will most benefit from NIV.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society statement: update on limb muscle dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^124f3709]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exercise intolerance and leg fatigue are characterized by the following on-page findings: a significant portion stops exercise because of leg fatigue, and the impact of leg fatigue on the exercise response to acute bronchodilation was evaluated; in that study, bronchodilation with ipratropium bromide did not enhance exercise tolerance in patients who developed contractile fatigue after cycling exercise as it did in those without contractile leg fatigue. Lower capacity for muscle aerobic metabolism may influence exercise tolerance; increased lactic acidosis for a given work rate increases ventilatory needs by increasing nonaerobic carbon dioxide production and may be exacerbated by a tendency to retain carbon dioxide during exercise. Perturbation in muscle energy metabolism is another potential contributor, and direct biopsy measurements after constant work rate exercise (at 80% peak work rate) showed accumulation of muscle lactate, degradation of muscle PCr, and loss of muscle ATP in COPD, with similar magnitude to healthy control subjects but occurring at substantially lower absolute exercise work rates; this observation was replicated using plasma ammonemia as a surrogate for adenine nucleotide loss.

### Geriatric trauma management [^3b2d261d]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary comorbidities — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in trauma: Judiciously administer resuscitation fluids to patients with COPD who have traumatic injury. Continue home medications or resume them as soon as possible, including oral medications and breathing treatments. Scheduled respiratory therapy assessments and treatments can aid patient recovery. During the history and physical examination, identify the severity of baseline disease; home use of medications, inhalers, and oxygen; and baseline performance status. Access to prior pulmonary function tests (and a preinjury room-air arterial blood gas study, if available) helps with understanding a patient's baseline function, and consider baseline hypoxia or hypercarbia when interpreting arterial blood gas results. Patients with acute COPD exacerbation may also benefit from antibiotics, steroids, or noninvasive ventilation, although risks and benefits must be considered. Investigate the cause of acute respiratory failure (e.g., reduced ventilatory capacity, muscle weakness, reduced cardiac output, or a complication such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or medication-related adverse events). When planning extubation after mechanical ventilation is used, a lower target oxygen saturation or higher carbon dioxide level may be acceptable.

Key messages

Is high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) beneficial for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with chronic hypercapnic failure?

HFNC treatment stabilises patients with COPD with persistent hypercapnic failure, in terms of preventing progression in hypercapnia, number of exacerbations and hospitalisations.

This study suggests that HFNC is an effective treatment for patients with COPD with persistent hypercapnic failure.

### Contemporary management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease… [^52ee416d]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

An inhaled corticosteroid, either alone or more commonly in combination with a long-acting bronchodilator, can further reduce exacerbations and improve the health status of these patients. Furthermore, patients with severe COPD, particularly those who are debilitated, should be considered for pulmonary rehabilitation because these programs have been proven useful in maintaining, or in some cases improving, health status for these patients. Finally, correction of resting arterial hypoxemia with oxygen therapy for more than 15 h/d prolongs survival of COPD patients for those with a resting PaO2 lower than 55 to 60 mm Hg. Once a clinical diagnosis of COPD is made, its severity can be determined, in part, by the patient's postbronchodilator FEV1 values.

In general, long-term administration of oxygen should be reserved for individuals with COPD who have arterial hypoxemia, or a PaO2 between 55 and 60 mm Hg with evidence of pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, or secondary erythrocytosis. In these patients, continuous domiciliary oxygen therapy sufficient to correct hypoxemia has been shown to improve survival. 20, 21 On the basis of the arterial blood oxygen results, this patient would not appear to need long-term oxygen treatment. As well, the relatively high hemoglobin concentration in this patient raises the suspicion that he usually is hypoxemic. Finally, the evidence of chronic right-sided heart failure probably indicates chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Therefore, this patient should be treated with long-term supplemental oxygen to raise the arterial oxygen saturation at rest to 90% to improve survival. Besides long-acting bronchodilators for symptom control, a growing body of evidence shows that inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial for COPD patients who have an FEV1 of less than 2. 0 L by reducing the rate of acute exacerbations. As well, the use of combination of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2-agonists has been shown to reduce the rate of acute exacerbations compared with monotherapy with these products.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^d9fdfe7b]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Personalised treatments are interventions with a substantial impact on meaningful clinical outcomes, such as decreased dyspnea, reduced healthcare use, and reduced mortality for well defined subgroups of patients with a particular disorder. For example, provision of oxygen to patients with severe hypoxemia, lung volume reduction surgery for patients with heterogeneous emphysema and low exercise capacity, and possibly the use of bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for symptomatic patients with frequent exacerbationscould improve survival for well defined subgroups of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Emerging data suggest that non-invasive ventilation in patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure could provide a similar clinical benefit to patients. The objective of this narrative review is to describe the current state of the practice of non-invasive ventilation for this patient population, provide a framework for understanding the benefits, and discuss potential future directions in its implementation.

### Improving oxygen prescribing rates by tailoring interventions for specific healthcare professional groups [^eaa74741]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Oxygen is a widely used drug in the NHS with the national BTS audit reporting just over 14% of inpatients sampled received oxygen. An oxygen tap can be found at most bedsides and the administration of oxygen is very simple, this contributes to it often being started without medical review or without a valid prescription. It is a very powerful drug which is effective in treating hypoxia, the causes of which are numerous. It is worth noting that oxygen is often incorrectly used in breathless patients, in studies into the use of oxygen in breathlessness without hypoxia researchers found that there was no significant improvement over placebo.

Before oxygen is administered or prescribed an assessment of the patient should be done to identify any risk factors for carbon dioxide retention. In patients who chronically retain carbon dioxide (C02) a degree of hypoxia is essential to maintain central respiratory drive. Removing this respiratory stimulus can lead to respiratory failure. One 2010 study showed that even short bursts of oxygen therapy, in the ambulance prior to admission, significantly increases mortality in this oxygen sensitive group. Inpatients with risk factors for hypercapnia are common, any of the following conditions can lead to retention; obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic respiratory disease such as bronchiectasis, chest wall abnormalities and disorders of the neuromuscular junction.

Following its prescription (which should include a target saturation) oxygen should be administered by nursing staff, who will choose the delivery device and oxygen flow rate. Changing devices and flow rates allows the target saturation to be reached and ongoing oxygen administration titrated to maintain the target. Oxygen should not be given without a valid prescription, the only exception to this is the emergency administration where intervention is required rapidly. BTS guidance states that even in the emergency situation the oxygen delivery and requirement should be promptly reviewed and prescribed appropriately.

Other projects addressing this issue have found difficulty changing the culture around oxygen prescribing. Good results have been shown when using visual reminders and one project in Bristol suggested this should be trialed in different centres, they found however difficulty sustaining the initial improvement seen after each plan, do, study, act cycle.

Interestingly the NICE guidance for COPD, whilst providing some broad recommendations, states that local guidelines should be followed regarding oxygen therapy during acute exacerbations of the disease.

### Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in COPD [^2dad4428]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

COPD is a progressive inflammatory process affecting both the airways and alveolar structures of the lungs. Exacerbations of COPD are episodes of acute worsening of this inflammatory process, often triggered by infections. The most severe exacerbations are characterized by substantial air trapping and inspiratory muscle overload, which leads to hypercapnic respiratory failure. Pharmacologic therapies focus on intense bronchodilator administration (usually by aerosol), corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Respiratory life support technologies are often needed for severe exacerbations and range from carefully titrated supplemental O 2 administration to positive-pressure ventilation (both invasive and noninvasive). Future life support strategies will likely involve extracorporeal life support technologies.

### Sleep-disordered breathing and COPD: the overlap syndrome [^689a6d8a]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing (mainly obstructive sleep apnea [OSA]) and COPD are among the most common pulmonary diseases, so a great number of patients have both disorders; this "overlap syndrome" causes more severe nocturnal hypoxemia than either disease alone. This common combination of OSA and COPD has important implications for diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. Specifically, patients with COPD and OSA have a substantially greater risk of morbidity and mortality, compared to those with either COPD or OSA alone. Only now are the interactions between these 2 systemic diseases being determined and appreciated. Many questions remain, however, with regard to disease definition, prognosis, and optimal treatment. Treatment currently consists of continuous positive airway pressure, and oxygen as needed. Noninvasive ventilation may be helpful in overlap syndrome patients, but this has not yet been well studied.

Ventilatory Support for Patients with COPD and COVID-19 Pneumonia

The prevalence of hypoxic respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 is around 19%. Ventilatory support has been used in up to 20% of patients who develop severe hypoxemia because of COVID-19, and approximately 5% of patients require ICU care and advanced respiratory support. Patients requiring ventilatory support have a high risk of mortality, and COPD has been reported to increase the risk of respiratory failure and ICU admissions in some but not all studies.

There is a wide variation (2.3–33%) in the reported rates of use of IMV in hospitalized patients with moderate-to-severe hypoxemic respiratory failure because of COVID-19. This may, in part, reflect differences in the use of NIV and high-flow nasal therapy (HFNT), possibly as a result of advocation of early intubation during the pandemic's initial phases because of concerns about viral dissemination. Data supporting those concerns are lacking.

Although early reports showed mixed outcomes, several studies have now shown that HFNT significantly reduces rates of intubation and IMV, although with variable effects on mortality. HFTN should be considered in preference to NIV for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure despite conventional oxygen therapy, as it may have a lower failure rate. Prone positioning has also been suggested for awake nonintubated patients with hypoxemia.

NIV is the normal standard of care for patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure. NIV may be beneficial for the treatment of hypercapnic respiratory in patients with COPD and COVID-19 pneumonia, but it also has the potential to worsen lung injury as a result of high transpulmonary pressures and V. Patients on HFNT or NIV should be monitored closely for worsening, and early intubation and IMV with adoption of a protective lung strategy, similar to that used in other forms of ARDS, should be considered. A Pa O 2 /F O 2 ratio < 150 mm Hg may be a useful indicator for NIV failure and increased risk of mortality.

### Outcome of COPD patients with mild daytime hypoxaemia with or without sleep-related oxygen desaturation [^ca0a35d2]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to compare the evolution of pulmonary haemodynamics and of arterial blood gases in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with mild-to-moderate hypoxaemia, with or without sleep-related oxygen desaturation. COPD patients with daytime arterial oxygen partial pressure in the range 56–69 mmHg were included prospectively. Sleep-related oxygen desaturation was defined as spending ≥ 30% of the nocturnal recording time with arterial oxygen saturation < 90%. From the 64 patients included, 35 were desaturators (group 1) and 29 were nondesaturators (group 2). At baseline (t0), patients with sleep-related desaturation had a significantly higher daytime (mean ± SD) arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (Pa, CO2) (44.9 ± 4.9 mmHg versus 41.0 ± 4.1 mmHg, p = 0.001) whereas mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was similar in the two groups. After 2 yrs (t2) of follow-up, 22 desaturators and 14 nondesaturators could be re-evaluated, including pulmonary haemodynamic measurements. None of the nondesaturator patients became desaturators at t2. The difference between the two groups in terms of daytime Pa, CO2 was still present at t2. The mean changes in mPAP from t0 to t2 were similar between the two groups, as were the rates of death or requirement for long-term oxygen therapy (American Thoracic Society criteria) during follow-up of up to 6 yrs. The presence of sleep-related oxygen desaturation is not a transitional state before the worsening of daytime arterial blood gases, but is a characteristic of some chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients who have a higher daytime arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure. Such isolated nocturnal hypoxaemia or sleep-related worsening of moderate daytime hypoxaemia does not appear to favour the development of pulmonary hypertension, nor to lead to worsening of daytime blood gases.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^b0dbc0ce]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease — 2014 recommendations include that for patients with COPD and hypoxemia and/or borderline hypoxemia (SaO2 < 90%) who are planning to travel by plane, we suggest a brief consultation or an e-consult with a pulmonologist. When other causes of nocturnal hypoxemia have been excluded, we suggest against routinely offering LTOT for the treatment of outpatients with stable, confirmed COPD and isolated nocturnal hypoxemia. In the absence of other contributors (e.g., sleep apnea), we suggest referral for a pulmonary consultation in patients with stable, confirmed COPD and hypercapnea. We suggest supported self-management for selected high risk patients with COPD. We suggest against using action plans alone in the absence of supported self-management.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^3306121d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Panic disorder and air hunger descriptors — unexplained dyspnea is one of the hallmarks of panic disorder, and clustering of suffocating, smothering, and air hunger has been observed in patients with panic disorder in response to breath-holding and carbon dioxide (CO2) rebreathing or challenge; similar clustering has been reported in idiopathic hyperventilation without cardiopulmonary or neuromuscular disease. This suggests that, in susceptible individuals, air hunger may occur even in the absence of reduced ventilatory capacity, with possible roles for excessive ventilatory drive, impaired perception of achieved ventilation, increased sensitivity to CO2 (potentially with a genetic component), or excessive responses to cerebral acidosis or hypoxia due to hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia. Whatever term is used, it represents a perception that the drive to breathe is not being matched by adequate pulmonary ventilation.
