## Question

Phosphorus repletion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about phosphorus repletion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify hypophosphatemia by severity and chronicity. Then, I should verify the underlying pathophysiology to guide route and urgency. Next, I will review oral versus intravenous repletion strategies, including dosing, infusion rates, and safety. After that, I need to check special populations and scenarios like refeeding, DKA, ICU, CKD/transplant, XLH, and drug-induced hypophosphatemia. Finally, I will confirm monitoring, adverse effects, and a practical decision algorithm, making sure I reconcile any conflicting recommendations as I go.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because dosing and route hinge on it. Severe hypophosphatemia is generally defined as serum phosphate less than 0.32 mmol/L (less than 1.0 mg/dL), moderate as 0.32–0.65 mmol/L (1.0–2.0 mg/dL), and mild as 0.65–0.81 mmol/L (2.0–2.5 mg/dL), with normal adult reference typically 0.81–1.45 mmol/L, though I should double-check lab-specific ranges and age/sex adjustments before finalizing thresholds [^114DTL9o] [^115W6N4w]. I also need to distinguish acute from chronic disease, since acute hypophosphatemia often reflects redistribution or transient losses, whereas chronic hypophosphatemia implies sustained renal phosphate wasting or malabsorption and mandates disease-specific therapy beyond simple repletion [^117LCpxS] [^112ST91P].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before I verify the mechanism. I need to check whether the low phosphate is due to intracellular shifts, decreased GI absorption, or increased renal excretion, because this determines whether repletion alone suffices or whether I must also address the driver such as refeeding, DKA treatment, hyperventilation, primary hyperparathyroidism, FGF-23 excess, or medications like ferric carboxymaltose or tenofovir [^112ST91P]. Let me consider that serum phosphate does not reliably reflect total body stores, especially in critical illness or during renal replacement therapy, so I should avoid overinterpreting a single value and instead integrate clinical context and trends [^111jRXF6].

> Next, I should review when to treat. I need to ensure I treat severe hypophosphatemia regardless of symptoms, and moderate hypophosphatemia if symptomatic or in high-risk settings such as refeeding, DKA, ICU, or ventilatory dependence, because these contexts carry higher risk of cardiopulmonary and neuromuscular complications [^114DTL9o] [^112ST91P]. Wait, let me verify the refeeding nuance: guidelines suggest a lower treatment threshold around phosphate less than 0.8 mmol/L during nutrition initiation in high-risk patients to preempt symptomatic hypophosphatemia, so I should incorporate that proactively rather than waiting for severe values [^112sSUpH].

> For oral repletion, I will now examine dosing and formulation. Typical oral phosphate provides about 250 mg elemental phosphorus per tablet, and adults often receive 750–2000 mg/day divided into 3–4 doses to improve absorption and tolerability; I should confirm that GI side effects like diarrhea are common and dose-limiting, and that taking with food and separating from calcium or antacids can mitigate binding and improve absorption [^1158VgwG] [^116iuwPk]. Let me reconsider the total dose range; some reviews cite 80–110 mmol/day, which is roughly 2.5–3.5 g elemental phosphorus, but I need to tailor to tolerance and response and avoid exceeding what the gut can handle to prevent hyperparathyroidism or nephrocalcinosis with chronic therapy [^111jgz46] [^116iuwPk].

> For intravenous repletion, I should confirm weight-based dosing and infusion safety. A commonly cited regimen is 0.3–0.6 mmol/kg over 4–12 hours for severe deficiency, with a maximum single dose around 45 mmol and infusion rates not exceeding about 7.5 mmol/hour to reduce risks of hypocalcemia, arrhythmias, and hypotension; I need to ensure I choose sodium or potassium phosphate based on serum potassium and volume status [^114AAerR] [^111jgz46]. Wait, I initially thought rates up to 20 mmol/hour were acceptable based on some ICU reviews, but that conflicts with safety-focused guidance; to be conservative and align with labeling and contemporary reviews, I should cap at approximately 7.5 mmol/hour and monitor calcium and potassium closely during infusion [^111jgz46] [^114AAerR]. I should double-check that a simple, pragmatic regimen of 9 mmol every 12 hours has also shown efficacy in small prospective data for severe hypophosphatemia, which can be useful when weight-based calculations are impractical [^114Qi5a1].

> Now, refeeding syndrome deserves special attention. I need to ensure baseline phosphate is checked before feeding, start nutrition cautiously with energy restriction if phosphate falls, and supplement phosphate proactively when phosphate drops below about 0.8 mmol/L in high-risk patients; ASPEN-endorsed protocols restrict calories to 20 kcal/h if phosphate falls to less than 0.71 mmol/L and then advance slowly, which reduces hypophosphatemia and may improve 60-day mortality [^112aKrUn] [^111L1mZg]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence; daily phosphate checks early in refeeding are reasonable, with tighter intervals in the highest-risk patients, and I should anticipate that enteral and parenteral nutrition formulations contain variable phosphate that may influence needs [^112sSUpH].

> In diabetic ketoacidosis, I should confirm that phosphate often declines with insulin and fluids due to intracellular shifts, and that routine phosphate measurement during treatment is advised; supplementation is generally reserved for severe hypophosphatemia or significant symptoms, as evidence for routine supplementation improving outcomes is limited, so I must individualize and avoid overtreatment [^114t1KTm] [^112ST91P]. Let me double-check that some guidelines still advise measuring phosphate 1–3 times in the first 24 hours of DKA therapy, which I should incorporate into orders to catch precipitous drops early [^114t1KTm].

> In the ICU, I need to ensure frequent monitoring given the high incidence of hypophosphatemia and its association with respiratory and cardiac complications; SCCM/A.S.P.E.N. suggest close monitoring and replacement as needed, and although correction has not consistently improved mortality, preventing severe or prolonged hypophosphatemia is reasonable while we await stronger outcome data [^112ZQ3Rz] [^113AFik3]. Wait, let me verify whether preemptive strategies help; in burns, continuous preemptive IV phosphate reduced hypophosphatemia and was associated with fewer complications compared with reactive dosing, suggesting a role for protocolized prevention in selected high-risk ICU populations [^1165H4Tr].

> For CKD and kidney transplant, I should confirm that hypophosphatemia is common early after transplantation and that KDOQI supports considering high phosphorus intake via diet or supplements to replete serum phosphate, with decisions individualized and mindful of bioavailability and dynamic needs; in dialysis, low pre-dialysis phosphate may reflect malnutrition, and enriching dialysate with phosphate can be considered in selected patients to avoid persistent hypophosphatemia [^113SexHv] [^114VqYm1] [^111fEi9m]. Hold on, I should verify that phosphate-containing CRRT solutions are increasingly used to mitigate phosphate losses during continuous therapy, though protocols vary and evidence remains limited, so local protocols and frequent monitoring are essential [^117MpTNh].

> In X-linked hypophosphatemia, I need to ensure I do not treat phosphate alone, as active vitamin D is required to counteract FGF-23–mediated phosphate wasting; conventional therapy pairs oral phosphate with calcitriol or alfacalcidol, and burosumab is preferred when available, with dosing adjusted to age-appropriate phosphate targets rather than forcing normal fasting levels to avoid hyperparathyroidism and nephrocalcinosis [^113W3Ej1] [^116iuwPk]. Let me double-check pediatric guidance; burosumab is recommended over conventional therapy in children 12 months and older, and conventional therapy should avoid phosphate monotherapy and doses exceeding about 60–80 mg/kg/day of elemental phosphorus to limit GI and endocrine toxicity [^113RW12r] [^114f9ZWW].

> Drug-induced hypophosphatemia requires me to identify and, when possible, stop the offending agent. Ferric carboxymaltose frequently causes hypophosphatemia via increased intact FGF-23 and renal phosphate loss; if repeat dosing is needed, I should check phosphate before and 1–5 weeks after infusion and consider alternative iron formulations such as ferric derisomaltose, which has a lower hypophosphatemia risk in randomized comparisons [^116j45jG] [^1174xKUL]. I should confirm that FDA labeling now recommends phosphate testing around repeat FCM courses, which supports proactive monitoring in at-risk patients [^1174xKUL].

> Monitoring and adverse effects must be explicit. I need to check serum phosphate, calcium, potassium, magnesium, and renal function during IV repletion, watch for hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and arrhythmias, and with chronic oral therapy guard against secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis; separating calcium from phosphate by about an hour and using divided doses can improve absorption and tolerability [^116iuwPk] [^114QSxuN]. Hold on, I should verify that urinary calcium monitoring is advised in chronic phosphate therapy to detect hypercalciuria early and permit dose adjustments of active vitamin D and phosphate to mitigate complications [^116iuwPk].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway, and I will sanity-check each branch. If phosphate is less than 0.32 mmol/L or the patient is symptomatic, I should use IV repletion with weight-based dosing and slow infusion, reassessing within 6–24 hours; if phosphate is 0.32–0.65 mmol/L, I can use oral therapy in stable patients and IV in ICU or symptomatic cases; if phosphate is 0.65–0.81 mmol/L, oral repletion or dietary augmentation is reasonable, with close follow-up; if the hypophosphatemia is chronic, I should diagnose the cause, avoid phosphate monotherapy, and tailor long-term therapy to the underlying disorder, using burosumab when appropriate for XLH [^114AAerR] [^112ST91P] [^116iuwPk]. But wait, what if the patient is in a refeeding scenario? In that case, I should lower my treatment threshold and proactively supplement to prevent severe drops as nutrition advances, aligning with ASPEN guidance and nutrition support protocols [^112aKrUn] [^112sSUpH].

> Finally, I should confirm that evidence gaps remain and document uncertainties. There is no high-quality randomized evidence that correcting hypophosphatemia improves hard outcomes in ICU or other acute settings, so my approach should balance safety, symptoms, and context while avoiding both undertreatment of severe deficiency and overtreatment of mild, asymptomatic cases; shared decision-making and local protocol alignment are prudent until stronger data emerge [^113AFik3] [^112ST91P].

Phosphorus repletion should be tailored to severity, symptoms, and patient context [^115W6N4w]. For **severe hypophosphatemia (< 0.32 mmol/L)** or symptomatic patients, use **IV phosphate** (0.3–0.6 mmol/kg over 4–12 h) with close monitoring of calcium, potassium, and renal function [^114AAerR] [^114QSxuN]. For **mild to moderate cases**, use **oral phosphate** (750–2,000 mg/day in divided doses) with active vitamin D if needed, and monitor for GI intolerance and hyperparathyroidism [^116iuwPk] [^1158VgwG]. In refeeding syndrome, start phosphate before feeding and monitor daily; in CKD, avoid overcorrection and consider dialysate phosphate for persistent hypophosphatemia [^112sSUpH] [^111fEi9m]. Always address the cause and adjust therapy to avoid complications such as hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and nephrocalcinosis [^114pZU3u].

## Indications for phosphorus repletion

Phosphorus repletion is indicated based on **serum phosphate levels, clinical symptoms, and patient-specific factors**:

| **Severity** | **Serum phosphate level** | **Clinical indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe | < 0.32 mmol/L (< 1 mg/dL) | - Immediate IV repletion <br/> - Symptomatic patients (respiratory failure, cardiac dysfunction, neuromuscular weakness, rhabdomyolysis) [^114AAerR] [^115JQAXe] |
| Moderate | 0.32–0.65 mmol/L (1–2 mg/dL) | - Oral or IV repletion <br/> - Symptomatic patients or those at risk of complications [^114AAerR] [^112ST91P] |
| Mild | 0.65–0.81 mmol/L (2–2.5 mg/dL) | - Oral repletion <br/> - Asymptomatic patients or those with chronic hypophosphatemia [^114Zd7rT] [^112ST91P] |

---

## Routes of administration

Phosphorus repletion can be administered **orally or intravenously**, depending on severity and patient condition:

- **Oral repletion**: Preferred for mild to moderate hypophosphatemia, chronic hypophosphatemia, or stable patients. Common oral preparations include sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, and neutral phosphate salts [^113U2vfg] [^1158VgwG].

- **Intravenous repletion**: Indicated for severe hypophosphatemia, symptomatic patients, or those unable to tolerate oral intake. IV phosphate is available as sodium or potassium phosphate solutions [^111jgz46].

---

## Dosing strategies

### Intravenous phosphorus repletion

IV repletion is **guided by serum phosphate level, patient weight, and clinical context**:

| **Serum phosphate level** | **Recommended iv dose** | **Infusion duration** |
|-|-|-|
| < 0.32 mmol/L (< 1 mg/dL) | 0.3–0.6 mmol/kg | 4–12 hours [^114AAerR] |
| 0.32–0.65 mmol/L (1–2 mg/dL) | 0.2–0.3 mmol/kg | 4–6 hours [^notfound] |
| 0.65–0.81 mmol/L (2–2.5 mg/dL) | 0.1–0.2 mmol/kg | 2–4 hours [^notfound] |

---

Maximum single dose: **45 mmol** (with potassium 66 mEq) [^114QSxuN]. Infusion rate: **≤ 7.5 mmol/hour** to minimize risk of hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and arrhythmias [^114AAerR].

---

### Oral phosphorus repletion

Oral repletion is **typically 750–2,000 mg/day** (24–64 mmol/day) divided into 2–4 doses, with dose adjusted to serum phosphate and tolerance [^116iuwPk] [^1158VgwG]. Active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) is often co-administered to enhance intestinal phosphate absorption and counteract secondary hyperparathyroidism [^116iuwPk] [^111yc5Hu].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

During repletion, **close monitoring is essential** to prevent complications:

- **Serum phosphate**: Monitor every 6–12 hours during IV repletion, then daily until stable.

- **Calcium and potassium**: Monitor frequently to detect hypocalcemia or hyperkalemia.

- **Renal function**: Monitor regularly, especially in patients with CKD or those receiving nephrotoxic drugs.

- **Clinical symptoms**: Monitor for signs of over-repletion (hyperphosphatemia, ectopic calcification) or under-repletion (persistent hypophosphatemia symptoms).

---

## Special considerations

### Chronic kidney disease (CKD)

In CKD, **hypophosphatemia is less common** but may occur due to dietary restrictions, dialysis, or secondary hyperparathyroidism. Repletion should be cautious to avoid hyperphosphatemia, which increases cardiovascular risk; consider dialysate phosphate supplementation in patients undergoing frequent dialysis [^111fEi9m].

---

### Refeeding syndrome

In refeeding syndrome, **hypophosphatemia is common**; start phosphate supplementation before feeding initiation and monitor daily during the first week [^112sSUpH] [^111QUHK8].

---

### Drug-induced hypophosphatemia

Certain drugs (e.g. ferric carboxymaltose, tenofovir, mTOR inhibitors) can cause hypophosphatemia. Management includes **discontinuing the offending drug** if possible and providing supplementation based on severity [^1174xKUL] [^114pZU3u].

---

## Potential complications of phosphorus repletion

Phosphorus repletion, if not carefully managed, can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Hyperphosphatemia**: Risk of ectopic calcification, renal injury, and cardiovascular complications [^114m1xe5].

- **Hypocalcemia**: Due to calcium-phosphate precipitation, potentially causing tetany or cardiac arrhythmias.

- **Hyperkalemia**: Particularly with potassium phosphate preparations, risking cardiac arrhythmias [^114QSxuN].

- **Nephrocalcinosis**: Chronic over-repletion can cause renal calcification, especially in chronic hypophosphatemia management [^116iuwPk].

---

## Clinical outcomes

Effective phosphorus repletion improves muscle strength, respiratory function, and cardiac output, and reduces the risk of rhabdomyolysis and neurologic complications. However, **over-repletion can cause hyperphosphatemia** and related complications, underscoring the need for careful monitoring and individualized dosing [^117LCpxS] [^112ST91P].

---

Phosphorus repletion requires a **tailored approach** based on severity, symptoms, and patient-specific factors, with careful monitoring to balance efficacy and safety.

Current evidence regarding the clinical consequences of hypophosphatemia is not straightforward.

### Treatment of hypophosphatemia in the intensive care unit: a review [^113AFik3]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Critically ill patients have a high prevalence of hypophosphatemia because of the presence of multiple causal factors. Hypophosphatemia may lead to a multitude of symptoms, but most often remains asymptomatic. Hypophosphatemia, however, is associated with increased mortality in important patient subgroups. It is important to investigate whether hypophosphatemia causes higher mortality in itself, or rather is associated with a higher severity of illness.

Because of the current paucity of evidence, serum phosphate levels are not routinely measured in all critically ill patients. The spontaneous course of serum phosphate is not well documented in the literature, so it is insufficiently clear whether an initially low phosphate level after surgery will return to normal spontaneously. Although multiple studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of phosphate repletion regimens, the effect on mortality and morbidity is not well reported. Currently, no widely agreed-on guidelines exist concerning the approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients, because evidence is lacking on when and how to treat hypophosphatemia.

A reasonable approach awaiting randomized controlled trial evidence would be to reserve intravenous correction of hypophosphatemia for patients with associated symptoms or phosphate levels < 0.32 mmol/L. Doses of up to 40 mmol of sodium phosphate, administered at a speed of up to 20 mmol per hour, are proven to be safe. Additional studies are required, addressing the current approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients, as well as the association of hypophosphatemia with morbidity and mortality, and the effect of treatment. Evidence-based guidelines are needed to guide critical care physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of hypophosphatemia.

Correction of hypophosphatemia

With the high prevalence of hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients, as well as their susceptibility to life-threatening symptoms, frequent laboratory monitoring is recommended, especially in previously mentioned high-risk groups. It is generally recommended to correct hypophosphatemia in hypophosphatemic patients with associated symptoms. However, no randomized controlled evidence indicates whether correction of hypophosphatemia in apparently asymptomatic patients leads to improved outcome. Taking this into account, the indication for — and recommended frequency of — laboratory monitoring and treatment remains debatable.

Correction of hypophosphatemia is possible via oral or intravenous routes. Intravenous administration of phosphate is not without complications, though. Phosphate may precipitate with calcium. Large intravenous doses of phosphate may result in hyperphosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypotension. It is therefore necessary to know when intravenous therapy is indicated, and how much and how fast phosphate should be supplied. Intravenous therapy is generally recommended in symptomatic hypophosphatemia and phosphate levels < 0.32 mmol/L. Multiple studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of intravenous phosphate repletion regimens (Table 4). These studies generally agree that aggressive phosphate supplementation is safe with phosphate doses up to 45 mmol with infusion rates up to 20 mmol per hour. Hyperkalemia is prevented by using sodium phosphate instead of potassium phosphate in patients with potassium levels > 4 mmol/L.

Table 4
Intravenous treatment of hypophosphatemia

iP, serum inorganic phosphate.

Moderate hypophosphatemia can be treated with oral supplementation of phosphate. One should keep in mind that active vitamin D is required for intestinal absorption of phosphate. Typical oral supplementation amounts are three times the normal daily intake, with advised amounts of 2.5 to 3.5 g (80 to 110 mmol) per day, divided over two to three doses. Patients who receive feeding after a period of starvation are often phosphate depleted, so additional phosphate should be added to nutritional preparations. An additional preventive strategy is to build up the caloric intake slowly. The total required amount of phosphate cannot be predicted by serum phosphate levels, as phosphate shifts between multiple body compartments.

Dipyridamole can decrease urinary phosphate loss. Further research is needed to establish further the role of this drug in the treatment of hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients.

### Chronic kidney disease CKD: guideline recommendations and supporting information (2020) [^113U2vfg]. AND (2020). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — phosphorus intake with hypophosphatemia — for posttransplantation adults with hypophosphatemia, it is reasonable to consider prescribing high-phosphorus intake (diet or supplements) in order to replete serum phosphate (OPINION), Rating: Consensus Conditional. The serum phosphate level at which supplementation should be considered in these patients or the dose of replacement to be given is, however, not well studied, and should be decided based on patient needs and clinical judgment. In kidney transplant patients, one small randomized controlled trial examined the effects of 12-week dietary phosphorus supplementation by means of a neutral phosphate salt (disodium phosphate) in patients with early post-transplantation hypophosphatemia, observed that, compared to sodium chloride, supplementation of phosphorus improved hypophosphatemia as well as adenosine triphosphate in the muscles and the acid excretion capacity of the kidney, and noted that no adverse effects on serum calcium and PTH concentrations were noted during intervention.

### Hypophosphatemia: an evidence-based approach to its clinical consequences and management [^115JQAXe]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2006). Medium credibility.

Optimal cellular function is dependent on maintenance of a normal serum phosphorus concentration. Serum phosphorus concentration is affected by several determinants, the most important of which is regulation of phosphorus reabsorption by the kidney. The majority of this reabsorption (80%) occurs in the proximal tubule and is mediated by an isoform of the sodium-phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-II). Parathyroid hormone, via a variety of intracellular signaling cascades leading to NaPi-IIa internalization and downregulation, is the main regulator of renal phosphate reabsorption. Shift of phosphorus from extracellular to intracellular compartments, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, and increased urinary losses, are the primary mechanisms of hypophosphatemia, which affects approximately 2% of hospitalized patients. Hypophosphatemia has been implicated as a cause of rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, hemolysis and left ventricular dysfunction. With the exception of ventilated patients, there is little evidence that moderate hypophosphatemia has significant clinical consequences in humans, and aggressive intravenous phosphate replacement is unnecessary. By contrast, patients with severe hypophosphatemia should be treated. Intravenous repletion may be considered, especially for patients who have clinical sequelae of hypophosphatemia.

Conclusions

In conclusion, data quality for the measurement and supplementation of phosphate in the context of hypophosphatemia or suspicion of hypophosphatemia varies, but overall, chronic hypophosphatemia testing should be performed in patients with ongoing unclear musculoskeletal complaints, especially if drugs known to cause hypophosphatemia are taken or during osteoporosis evaluation. Among drug-related causes, FMC–associated hypophosphatemia warrants particular attention; clinicians should monitor phosphate around repeat infusions and manage cases individually given ongoing uncertainties about optimal dosing and monitoring. Supplementation for chronic hypophosphatemia overall should be given to symptomatic individuals if the causative agent cannot be eliminated by the oral route via multiple doses. The goal should most likely be clinical improvement, and doses and monitoring remain unclear. For acute hypophosphatemia, it is important to know potential causes, such as treatment of alcoholic ketoacidosis or refeeding syndrome, and potential signs, such as arrhythmia or respiratory distress, to prompt phosphate testing. It is unclear when to treat it, especially as most causes of acute hypophosphatemia are self-limited, but the general consensus seems to be to treat severe or moderate symptomatic hypophosphatemia, with differing recommendations for dosing and monitoring. More studies are needed on when to evaluate acute hypophosphatemia and how to treat and monitor acute and chronic hypophosphatemia.

Further noteworthy is the refeeding syndrome, occurring in patients where nutrition is reinstated, which can present itself with life-threatening hypophosphatemia if not detected and supplemented. Generally, a risk assessment to develop a refeeding syndrome is performed, which varies but generally includes the current and previous weight, height, feeding habits, weight kinetics, and risky clinical conditions, e.g. anorexia nervosa or alcohol use disorder. Guidelines agree on baseline phosphate testing before nutrition initiation but differ in terms of when to monitor and when and how to supplement. Initial monitoring is most often recommended daily, with longer intervals over time but shorter intervals in higher-risk patients. While in most other forms of acute hypophosphatemia, supplementation is most commonly recommended if hypophosphatemia is severe or moderate and symptomatic, it is reasonable to supplement phosphate at higher levels in patients at risk of refeeding to avoid the development of symptomatic hypophosphatemia, but it is unclear at which phosphate level. One suggestion is when the phosphate concentration is < 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). Additionally, enteral and parenteral nutrition preparations already contain phosphate, ranging from 700 to 2000 mg (≈22.6–38.7 mmol)/L.

### Prevention of hypophosphatemia during continuous renal replacement therapy-an overlooked problem [^117MpTNh]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatemia is a common and potentially serious complication occurring during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Phosphate supplementation is required in the vast majority of patients undergoing CRRT, particularly beyond the first 48 hours. Supplementation can be provided either as a standalone oral or parenteral treatment or as an additive to CRRT solutions. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages, and clinicians must weigh the individual factors most relevant in their practice setting. Currently there are no consensus protocols for phosphate replacement in CRRT, and many centers replete phosphate in response to hypophosphatemia as opposed to pre-emptively. Repletion protocols have also been challenged in recent years by shortages in injectable phosphate solutions. More recently a commercially available phosphate-containing CRRT solution was approved in the United States, but there has been limited clinical experience with this product. In this review, we present recommendations for phosphate repletion in CRRT to prevent hypophosphatemia, and describe our experience using phosphate-containing CRRT solutions.

Discussion

In this systematic literature review, we identified a very heterogeneous data landscape with some well-researched topics, but overall, there is no clear consensus on when to test and when and how to supplement phosphate.

Chronic hypophosphatemia can lead to osteomalacia with debilitating symptoms and is often recognized late, which is why clinicians should be aware of this. We support the recommendation of testing phosphate in patients with ongoing unclear musculoskeletal symptoms. It is also recommended as part of osteoporosis and insufficiency fracture evaluations. There are rare genetic disorders that cause hypophosphatemia, the most studied being X-linked hypophosphatemia, which is most commonly diagnosed in childhood and needs surveillance in adulthood. It is important to note that phosphate levels can be affected by dietary intake and should best be measured as morning fasting phosphate. If the cause of chronic hypophosphatemia cannot be eliminated (surgical removal in the case of tumor-induced osteomalacia or cessation of the causative drug, see below), supplementation is commonly recommended, always in symptomatic cases, Regimens vary with some dose suggestions considering body weight, others with overall doses ranging from 150 to 2000 mg (4.8–64.5 mmol)/day, but prospective studies evaluating the optimal doses are lacking. There is consensus on the need to divide the doses, which vary from 2 to 6/day, as phosphate is absorbed and excreted rapidly. Treatment monitoring, if mentioned, is commonly recommended every 3–6 months, e.g. 3 months after treatment initiation and every 6 months when stable. Treatment goals are not always defined but are most commonly clinical improvements, as laboratory targets do not lead to better symptom control in X-linked hypophosphatemia patients but potentially to more side effects. Common side effects of phosphate supplementation include gastrointestinal symptoms, which can be managed by dose reduction and slow upward titration. Long-term supplementation can further lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism and renal complications, with some authors recommending regular laboratory monitoring and/or lower laboratory or clinical targets, as mentioned above. A new alternative treatment for FGF-23-mediated hypophosphatemia is the antibody burosumab, which is outside the scope of this review. Much more common causes of hypophosphatemia are primary hyperparathyroidism, where phosphate testing is not strictly necessary but is recommended, and vitamin D deficiency, where phosphate testing and supplementation are seen as unnecessary.

### Approach to treatment of hypophosphatemia [^115W6N4w]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatemia can be acute or chronic. Acute hypophosphatemia with phosphate depletion is common in the hospital setting and results in significant morbidity and mortality. Chronic hypophosphatemia, often associated with genetic or acquired renal phosphate-wasting disorders, usually produces abnormal growth and rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Acute hypophosphatemia may be mild (phosphorus level, 2–2.5 mg/dL), moderate (1–1.9 mg/dL), or severe (< 1 mg/dL) and commonly occurs in clinical settings such as refeeding, alcoholism, diabetic ketoacidosis, malnutrition/starvation, and after surgery (particularly after partial hepatectomy) and in the intensive care unit. Phosphate replacement can be given either orally, intravenously, intradialytically, or in total parenteral nutrition solutions. The rate and amount of replacement are empirically determined, and several algorithms are available. Treatment is tailored to symptoms, severity, anticipated duration of illness, and presence of comorbid conditions, such as kidney failure, volume overload, hypo- or hypercalcemia, hypo- or hyperkalemia, and acid-base status. Mild/moderate acute hypophosphatemia usually can be corrected with increased dietary phosphate or oral supplementation, but intravenous replacement generally is needed when significant comorbid conditions or severe hypophosphatemia with phosphate depletion exist. In chronic hypophosphatemia, standard treatment includes oral phosphate supplementation and active vitamin D. Future treatment for specific disorders associated with chronic hypophosphatemia may include cinacalcet, calcitonin, or dypyrimadole.

### Indications for the evaluation and supplementation of hypophosphatemia: an umbrella systematic review of reviews and guidelines [^114AAerR]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, chronic hypophosphatemia should be sought in patients with unclear persistent musculoskeletal symptoms and should most likely be treated orally in several doses, starting with a low dose and slowly titrating upward until clinical improvement, while monitoring phosphate and signs of complications.

Acute hypophosphatemia can be caused by an intracellular shift, such as with hyperventilation or treatment of ketoacidosis with insulin. These shifts correct themselves and do not usually require treatment. Several studies on diabetic ketoacidosis have failed to show a benefit of phosphate supplementation; however, no such studies exist in other states, such as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome or alcoholic ketoacidosis. Nevertheless, some authors recommend phosphate testing during treatment of the aforementioned states to detect and supplement severe (< 0.32 mmol/L; < 1 mg/dL) and/or symptomatic hypophosphatemia. A further publication recommended testing phosphate in patients with COPD or asthma due to potential hyperventilation causing a phosphate shift, especially when patients present in an exacerbated state that fails to improve despite adequate therapy. It is also well known that hypophosphatemia is common in ventilated patients and is associated with difficulties in weaning, but as we decided to exclude the ICU setting, this is outside the scope of this review. Overall, in cases of severe hypophosphatemia (< 0.32 mmol/L; < 1 mg/dL) or moderate symptomatic (e.g. altered mental status, rhabdomyolysis, arrhythmia, respiratory distress), supplementation is commonly recommended, with intravenous doses of 0.3–0.6 mmol (9–18 mg)/kg/day administered over 4–12 h, with laboratory monitoring after 6–24 h, although these recommendations mostly rely on case reports and expert opinions. The potential side effects of intravenous supplementation are hypocalcemia and arrhythmias; thus, infusions over several hours with a maximum infusion rate of 7.5 mmol (≈232 mg)/h are recommended.

Acute hypophosphatemia: testing

Acute hypophosphatemia can be critical in high-risk clinical scenarios, particularly when shifts in phosphate levels occur due to underlying conditions. A well-known cause of acute hypophosphatemia is refeeding syndrome, which necessitates routine phosphate monitoring before and during nutrition initiation, with differing monitoring intervals depending on baseline risk and phosphate levels. Further clinical scenarios that might warrant phosphate testing include conditions where treatment commonly leads to an intracellular shift — diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome, or alcoholic ketoacidosis — as well as COPD or asthma exacerbations that do not improve with standard therapy. Hypophosphatemia can occur in end-stage CKD when patients undergo intensive dialysis, which is defined as short daily (< 3 h, 5–7 days/week) or long (often nocturnal, ≥ 5.5 h, ≥ 3/week) sessions. In this situation, it is recommended to measure phosphate before dialysis and to use enriched dialysate (0.65–2.6 mmol/L; ≈2–8 mg/dL) with the goal of normal phosphate levels predialysis.

### Approach to patients with hypophosphataemia [^117LCpxS]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Phosphate metabolism is an evolving area of basic and clinical research. In the past 15 years, knowledge on disturbances of phosphate homoeostasis has expanded, as has the discovery of new targeted therapies. Hypophosphataemia might be the biochemical finding in several diseases, and its clinical evaluation should initially focus on the assessment of pathophysiological mechanisms leading to low serum phosphate concentrations. Clinical consequences of hypophosphataemia can involve multiple organ systems and vary depending on several factors, the most important being the underlying disorder. This Review focuses on the approach to patients with hypophosphataemia and how underlying pathophysiological mechanisms should be understood in the evaluation of differential diagnosis. We define an algorithm for the assessment of hypophosphataemia and review the most up-to-date literature on specific therapies. Continuous research in this area will result in a better understanding and management of patients with hypophosphataemia.

### Hypophosphatemia: an update on its etiology and treatment [^111yLznz]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Phosphate plays a key role in several biological processes. In recent years, new insights have been obtained into the regulation of the phosphate metabolism, including a growing amount of evidence suggesting that factors other than parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D are involved in maintaining the phosphate balance. A new class of phosphate-regulating factors, the so-called "phosphatonins", have been shown to be important in phosphate-wasting diseases. However, the role of the phosphatonins in the normal human homeostasis remains to be established. The incidence of hypophosphatemia in selected patient series can be more than 20%, with clinical sequelae ranging from mild to life threatening. Only when combined with phosphate depletion does hypophosphatemia become clinically significant. The factors that are involved in the phosphate homeostasis, the pathophysiology, the relevance in patient care, the clinical manifestations, and an appropriate management of phosphate depletion are discussed in this review.

### Treatment of hypophosphatemia in the intensive care unit: a review [^116mjnME]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Currently no evidence-based guideline exists for the approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients.

Methods

We performed a narrative review of the medical literature to identify the incidence, symptoms, and treatment of hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients. Specifically, we searched for answers to the questions whether correction of hypophosphatemia is associated with improved outcome, and whether a certain treatment strategy is superior.

Results

Incidence: hypophosphatemia is frequently encountered in the intensive care unit; and critically ill patients are at increased risk for developing hypophosphatemia due to the presence of multiple causal factors.

Symptoms

hypophosphatemia may lead to a multitude of symptoms, including cardiac and respiratory failure.

Treatment

hypophosphatemia is generally corrected when it is symptomatic or severe. However, although multiple studies confirm the efficacy and safety of intravenous phosphate administration, it remains uncertain when and how to correct hypophosphatemia.

Outcome

in some studies, hypophosphatemia was associated with higher mortality; a paucity of randomized controlled evidence exists for whether correction of hypophosphatemia improves the outcome in critically ill patients.

Conclusions

Additional studies addressing the current approach to hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients are required. Studies should focus on the association between hypophosphatemia and morbidity and/or mortality, as well as the effect of correction of this electrolyte disorder.

### An expert perspective on phosphate dysregulation with a focus on chronic hypophosphatemia [^113KLD3b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Given the physiologic importance of phosphate for optimal health, phosphate homeostasis control is necessary throughout life. Chronic hypophosphatemic diseases are rare, often underrecognized, and may be suboptimally managed. Moreover, serum phosphate is not always routinely measured in primary care practice and may be misinterpreted if not compared against age‐ and sex‐specific normal phosphate reference ranges. These diseases have a multisystem impact that impair quality of life. In some genetic forms of these diseases, inadequate management during childhood or adolescence leads to further complications in adulthood.

Given the considerable clinical impact of chronic hypophosphatemic diseases, we emphasize the need to identify these as early as possible. A universally well‐accepted definition of chronic hypophosphatemia will help raise awareness of these diseases, aid in the identification and management of affected individuals, and facilitate further clinical studies. We propose a definition for chronic hypophosphatemia in this article, although we note that further investigations should be performed in patients without delay if necessary. Finally, we provide our recommendations for assessing renal phosphate wasting and highlight the urgency to restore phosphate homeostasis with the aim to improve patient outcomes.

Acute hypophosphatemia: supplementation

Supplementation in refeeding syndrome patients is warranted with nutrition initiation if the phosphate concentration is < 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) before nutrition initiation and prophylactically in very high-risk patients (BMI < 14 kg/m², starvation > 15 days, weight loss > 20% in the last 3–6 months) and in all receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. Dose recommendations vary (Table 3). For other acute hypophosphatemia causes, supplementation is generally warranted for severe, as well as moderate but symptomatic, hypophosphatemia. Oral supplementation can be considered for moderate hypophosphatemia, whereas the intravenous route is preferred for severe hypophosphatemia, with varying dose recommendations (Tables 2 and 3).

For TDF, recommendations vary from monitoring phosphate levels every 3 to 12 months during treatment or only in patients with declining renal function. mTOR inhibitors are associated with hypophosphatemia, and monitoring is recommended monthly for mild hypophosphatemia, weekly for moderate hypophosphatemia, and daily for severe hypophosphatemia, with no recommendation for initial phosphate measurement.

### Hypophosphatemia: a practical guide to evaluation and management [^113LptRr]. Endocrine Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Phosphate plays a critical and diverse role in human physiology. In addition to its importance in skeletal mineralization, it is essential for energy homeostasis, enzyme function, and cell membrane integrity. These diverse functions of phosphate provide an explanation for the range of symptoms and clinical manifestations observed in patients with both acute and chronic causes of hypophosphatemia. Normal phosphate homeostasis involves several major systems, including the gastrointestinal tract, bones, and kidneys. Phosphate balance is maintained directly and indirectly by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3, parathyroid hormone, and the osteocyte-derived phosphatonin fibroblast growth factor 23. This review discusses normal phosphate homeostasis, the clinical manifestations and causes of hypophosphatemia, and an approach to establish a diagnosis and appropriate management.

### Approach to the hypophosphatemic patient [^114dQBKZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatemia is commonly missed due to nonspecific signs and symptoms, but it causes considerable morbidity and in some cases contributes to mortality. Three primary mechanisms of hypophosphatemia exist: increased renal excretion, decreased intestinal absorption, and shifts from the extracellular to intracellular compartments. Renal hypophosphatemia can be further divided into fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated or non-fibroblast growth factor 23-mediated causes. Proper diagnosis requires a thorough medication history, family history, physical examination, and assessment of renal tubular phosphate handling to identify the cause. During the past decade, our understanding of phosphate metabolism has grown greatly through the study of rare disorders of phosphate homeostasis. Treatment of hypophosphatemia depends on the underlying disorder and requires close biochemical monitoring. This article illustrates an approach to the hypophosphatemic patient and discusses normal phosphate metabolism.

### Indications for the evaluation and supplementation of hypophosphatemia: an umbrella systematic review of reviews and guidelines [^112ST91P]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypophosphatemia, defined as low serum phosphate levels, is a frequent yet underrecognized condition associated with significant morbidity. Its etiology ranges from chronic conditions such as osteomalacia to acute states such as refeeding syndrome. This review systematically summarizes evidence and guidelines for phosphate testing and supplementation in adults, aiming to support clinical decision-making.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines. Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception to September 2024 included reviews, guidelines, and consensus statements addressing phosphate measurement for hypophosphatemia and supplementation in adults outside intensive care settings. Eligibility criteria included English-language publications focused on diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations. Quality assessment was performed using the AGREE II tool, and data were synthesized across chronic and acute clinical contexts.

Results

Thirty-three publications (11 guidelines, 19 reviews, and 3 consensus statements) were included, with high heterogeneity in the recommendations. Phosphate measurement to evaluate chronic hypophosphatemia is recommended for persistent musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis evaluation, and rare conditions known to cause chronic hypophosphatemia, such as X-linked hypophosphatemia and tumor-induced osteomalacia. The post-kidney transplantation stage requires intensive early monitoring for hypophosphatemia. Recommendations for testing for drug-induced hypophosphatemia, such as with ferric carboxymaltose, vary. Phosphate measurement to evaluate acute hypophosphatemia is advised in high-risk settings: refeeding syndrome, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome, alcoholic ketoacidosis, worsening COPD or asthma exacerbations. Further potential indications for phosphate measurement include certain iron infusions, tenofovir treatment, immediate post-kidney transplantation, and intensive hemodialysis. Supplementation is indicated for severe or symptomatic cases, with oral therapy preferred for chronic conditions and intravenous routes for acute, severe hypophosphatemia.

Conclusions

The heterogeneity in the recommendations emphasizes the need for individualized approaches based on clinical context. While robust evidence supports testing and supplementation under select conditions, gaps remain regarding optimal dosing and monitoring protocols. Clinicians should consider phosphate testing in high-risk scenarios and follow evidence-based supplementation guidelines tailored to chronic and acute hypophosphatemia. Future research is needed to unify recommendations and address existing uncertainties.

### Incidence and determinants of hypophosphatemia in diabetic ketoacidosis: an observational study [^114t1KTm]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an acute and life-threatening complication of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), with an estimated mortality rate of DKA of 2%–14%. The incidence of DKA is 46–80 per 10 000 persons‐years. In most cases, DKA is caused by an infection, limited compliance to insulin therapy and — in approximately 20% — new-onset diabetes. DKA is characterized by insulin deficiency, causing hyperglycemia and high amounts of ketone bodies leading to acidosis. During DKA, the body uses ketone bodies as a surrogate source of energy. Both hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis contribute to volume depletion and electrolyte deficiencies in the intracellular and extracellular environment. One of these electrolyte disturbances is hypophosphatemia, which often presents during the treatment phase of DKA.

Phosphate is the most abundant intracellular anion in the body and is among others involved in bone mineralization and energy metabolism. Approximately 85% of phosphate is stored in teeth and bones, merely 1% is in the extracellular compartment. In DKA, net (urinary) loss of phosphate occurs because of a transcellular shift, osmotic diuresis and reduced renal phosphate reabsorption by the Na-Pi transporters in the renal proximal tubule (due to acidosis and hyperglycemia). During insulin and fluid repletion in the treatment of DKA, phosphate shifts from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment, worsening hypophosphatemia. However, in clinical settings a normophosphatemia or even hyperphosphatemia (> 1.5 mmol/L) may also be found at admission. In this phase, the transcellular shift eliminates the net urinary loss of phosphate and sometimes even exceeds. International guidelines indicate the determination of Pi during the treatment of DKAand our national guidelineeven states that it should be measured 1–3 times in the first 24 hours. Phosphate supplementation is recommended at levels < 0.32 mmol/L.

Data extraction

Data from all included publications were extracted independently by two reviewers (SN and LB), and disagreements were resolved by discussion. The following data items were extracted: authors, year of publication, publication type, number of involved specialties, involved countries, whether acute or chronic hypophosphatemia was addressed, when to test for hypophosphatemia, when to supplement, how to supplement, and difficulties or side effects of phosphate supplementation.

Quality assessment

To assess the quality of the publications, we used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool. Two researchers (SN and AEB) independently assessed the article quality. Each domain is assessed from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). We defined the risk of bias as high when the score was 1–2 points, moderate when the score was 3–5 points, and low when the score was 6–7 points.

Data analysis

The findings were categorized on the basis of indications for phosphate testing and supplementation, separated into chronic and acute hypophosphatemia owing to different clinical presentations, and further organized to align with clinical settings and specific conditions, as outlined in Tables 1, 2, and 3. We reported how to supplement it if it was addressed. We further summarized the difficulties and side effects of phosphate supplementation when this was addressed in the publication.

Results

Phosphate metabolism and causes of hypophosphatemia in critically ill patients

Phosphorus is an essential element for all living cells, with different functions (Table 1). The phosphate balance is a complex interplay between phosphate uptake and phosphate excretion (Figure 1). Normal values of the total serum phosphate level are 0.80 to 1.45 mmol/L (2.5 to 4.5 mg/dl).

Table 1
Functions of phosphate

Figure 1
Phosphate metabolism and causes of hypophosphatemia.

Hypophosphatemia can be caused by three different mechanisms: decreased intestinal absorption, increased renal excretion, or internal redistribution of inorganic phosphate (Figure 1). In most patients with severe hypophosphatemia, both depletion of total body phosphorus stores and redistribution of phosphate to the intracellular space are found. Decreased intestinal absorption of phosphate rarely causes hypophosphatemia, as a low-phosphate diet increases renal reabsorption and enhances intestinal uptake of phosphate. Still, malnutrition, diarrhea, and nasogastric suction are common features in critically ill patients.

How to Treat?

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS* (GRADEd)

In children 12 months of age and older with XLH, we recommend burosumab therapy over conventional therapy (active vitamin D and phosphate salts) (strong recommendation, moderate certainty).
In children 6–12 months of age with XLH, we suggest burosumab therapy over conventional therapy (active vitamin D and phosphate salts) (conditional recommendation, low certainty).

* We recognize that there may be limitations to drug therapy accessibility

TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS (NON-GRADEd)

The panel proposes

Commence medical therapy promptly upon confirming XLH diagnosis and hypophosphatemia to optimize outcomes.
Treatment is directed at improving radiographic, biochemical and clinical signs of rickets (serum ALP, total or bone-specific), lower limb deformity, physical function, and the optimization of growth by addressing the mineral metabolism abnormalities of XLH.
When treating with burosumab, adhere to the recommended starting dose and adjust doses to achieve serum phosphorus levels in the low- to mid-normal (peak) or just below the normal or low-normal (trough) range for age, while avoiding hyperphosphatemia at any point in the dose cycle.
Optimal management with burosumab entails dose adjustments based on optimizing serum phosphorus levels for age rather than solely based on weight increases to avoid increasing the risk of hyperphosphatemia.
If burosumab is not available, children should be treated with conventional therapy (active vitamin D, usually combined with phosphate salts). Conventional therapy is advised over no treatment.
Active vitamin D can be administered with or without phosphate salts, but phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy.
When treating with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts), avoid targeting normal fasting serum phosphorus levels to prevent phosphate overdosing or toxicity.
Adjust active vitamin D and oral phosphate therapy with the aim to lower, and to normalize alkaline phosphatase activity, if this can be safely achieved, and promote normal linear growth. However, phosphate doses exceeding 60 mg elemental phosphorus/kg/day are rarely well-tolerated. The active vitamin D dose should be decreased in the presence of persistent hypercalciuria. However, unbalanced increases in the phosphate doses without raising active vitamin D doses increases the risk of sustained hyperparathyroidism.
Consider decreasing the phosphate dose or increasing the active vitamin D dose (the latter, in the absence of hypercalciuria/hypercalcemia) if PTH levels are consistently elevated, as phosphate stimulates PTH secretion and calcitriol can suppress PTH.
The routine use of recombinant human growth hormone for children with XLH and short stature is not advised due to limited benefit noted in randomized clinical trials.
Early involvement of orthopedic surgery is crucial to assess for the necessity, and the timing of, any corrective procedures.
In tertiary hyperparathyroidism, multigland involvement is expected. Calcimimetics (ie, cinacalcet) can be used on an off-label basis to decrease PTH level in the setting of hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism, while ensuring close monitoring of serum calcium in order to avoid hypocalcemia. If hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia cannot be controlled, subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered.
Burosumab is contraindicated in chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 30 mL/min), and in acute kidney injury. Cautious use is advised if eGFR is between 30 and 60 mL/min with careful monitoring for hyperphosphatemia and changes in eGFR.
If clinic blood pressure measures consistently exceed the 95th percentile (for age and height) confirmation with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or serial home blood pressure measurements is indicated. Treatment should follow current pediatric hypertension recommendations.

### Indications for the evaluation and supplementation of hypophosphatemia: an umbrella systematic review of reviews and guidelines [^1174xKUL]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In summary, the most common causes of acute hypophosphatemia are transient and rarely need treatment, except for severe or moderate symptomatic hypophosphatemia. In patients at risk of refeeding syndrome and nutrition initiation, supplementation is warranted at higher phosphate levels to prevent symptomatic hypophosphatemia.

Several drugs can cause hypophosphatemia, most commonly through renal phosphate loss. Notably, the iron infusion preparation FCM has been shown to cause hypophosphatemia, ranging from acute life-threatening symptoms to osteomalacia. FCM leads to a 3–sixfold increase in FGF-23, which in turn leads to an increase in urinary phosphate excretion, thus potentially causing acute hypophosphatemia. Especially with repeat infusions and undetected hypophosphatemia, the risk for chronic hypophosphatemia and, accordingly, osteomalacia increases. It is currently unknown why other iron preparations do not lead to the same extent of increase in FGF-23, although it is important to note that other iron infusions such as ferric derisomaltose and ferrumoxytol can also lead to hypophosphatemia, albeit less commonly and less severely. In the included works, recommendations for phosphate testing differ from universal screening before FCM infusions to screening in those with repeat infusions and those with musculoskeletal symptoms and ongoing fatigue after infusion. Due to the described data and recent emerging data from clinical trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has adjusted its warning label for FCM infusions in November 2024 to recommend testing for hypophosphatemia in patients at risk for low serum phosphate who require a repeat course of treatment or for any patient who receives a repeat course of treatment within 3 months. Risk factors for low serum phosphate include a history of gastrointestinal disorders associated with malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins or phosphate, concurrent or prior use of medications that affect proximal renal tubular function, hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and malnutrition. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also includes a warning on hypophosphatemic osteomalacia in their Summary of Product Characteristics for FMC infusions, stating the need for phosphate testing in patients with multiple administrations at higher doses or long-term treatment, and those with existing risk factors for hypophosphatemia, as well as patients with worsening fatigue, myalgias, or bone pain. Since elevated FGF-23 underlies the disorder, phosphate supplementation is not expected to sustainably correct hypophosphatemia, thus the most common treatment recommendation was to discontinue or, if not possible, switch iron preparations. TDF, which is used to treat hepatitis B and HIV, can cause tubular kidney dysfunction and thus lead to hypophosphatemia, which is why older reviews recommend regular phosphate testing for all patients treated with TDF. However, studies, mainly in patients with HIV, have shown that it is a rare complication, and in newer HIV guidelines, testing is recommended only in the case of certain prompts, such as preexisting CKD, worsening GFR, or proteinuria. These recommendations can probably be used for patients with hepatitis B as well. Notably, these conditions disproportionately affect low-income countries, where resources can influence monitoring strategies. Other drugs known to cause hypophosphatemia include mTOR inhibitors, aluminum-based antacids (if taken in large quantities over a longer period of time, as they bind to phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (particularly imatinib) and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors. However, we found no recommendations on when to evaluate for hypophosphatemia in these medications.

X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the prototypic disorder of renal phosphate wasting, and the most common form of heritable rickets. Physicians, patients, and support groups have all expressed concerns about the dearth of information about this disease and the lack of treatment guidelines, which frequently lead to missed diagnoses or mismanagement. This perspective addresses the recommendation by conferees for the dissemination of concise and accessible treatment guidelines for clinicians arising from the Advances in Rare Bone Diseases Scientific Conference held at the NIH in October 2008. We briefly review the clinical and pathophysiologic features of the disorder and offer this guide in response to the conference recommendation, based on our collective accumulated experience in the management of this complex disorder.

2.4 Treatment

The appropriate regimen for phosphorus replacement is based upon clinical symptoms, as there are no standardized protocols for management of hypophosphatemia. Mild, asymptomatic cases can be managed with clinical symptom monitoring and watchful waiting. In many cases, patients can receive dietary phosphate or oral phosphate therapy depending on the severity of the deficiency. 18 Intravenous phosphate is indicated for severe, symptomatic cases, depending on serum phosphorus levels and with chronic hypophosphatemia, supplements may also be administered. 18 Replacement regimens must consider that serum phosphorus may not be an accurate reflection of the total body phosphorus deficit. 18

2.5, hypophosphatemia and approach to management

Existing case studies provide insight into the two types of clinical manifestations that have been described herein: acute symptomatic hypophosphatemia which may occur after a single administration of FCM and resolve within weeks, and in rare, isolated instances, chronic hypophosphatemia with bone mineral disorder that may progress to pathological fractures seen after repeated courses of intravenous iron including FCM. The stacking effect of multiple courses of treatment might be prevented by checking serum phosphorus and ensuring normal vitamin D status before giving a repeat course.

A genetic study of patients who experience the acute syndrome could be informative and help identify additional predisposing factors beyond those already known.

### Impact of hypophosphatemia on outcome of patients in intensive care unit: a retrospective cohort study [^112aoEMN]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypophosphatemia may lead to a multitude of complications in critically ill patients since numerous cellular mechanisms require phosphates. Hypophosphatemia is associated with cardiac, respiratory, immunologic, and hematologic disorders, which is a subsequence of the impaired energy metabolism. Hypophosphatemia can be asymptomatic but may as well be accompanied by fatal clinical complications, leading to poor outcomes in critically ill patients.

Some important limitations to our study should be acknowledged. First, this investigation was retrospective and performed at a single medical center. Second, we identified only the baseline measurements of the plasma phosphate level, which hindered the evaluation of plasma phosphate values over time. Phosphate replacement is recommended in symptomatic hypophosphatemia and phosphate levels < 0.32 mmol/L. Whether maintenance of normal plasma phosphate level and correction of the hypophosphatemia in critically -ill-patients can improve outcome is currently unknown. Further randomized controlled trials are required to assess the benefit when the patients are treated with hypophosphatemia. Finally, we did not have information on the other confounders, such as fluid therapy, but we had a large number of other confounding variables for adjustment. Therefore, further studies in larger populations are required to confirm our findings.

### Parenteral iron therapy and phosphorus homeostasis: a review [^111E4ndT]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

3 CONCLUSIONS

Serum phosphorus should be monitored in patients with symptomatic hypophosphatemia and those at risk of hypophosphatemia. Patients considered at risk for hypophosphatemia include those with a history of gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, conditions associated with malabsorption of fat‐soluble vitamins or phosphate, and other causes of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. Concurrent or prior use of certain classes of medications that affect proximal renal tubular function, hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, menorrhagia, and malnutrition are also contributory factors to an increased risk of hypophosphatemia. Treatment with the IV iron formulation FCM is associated with transient hypophosphatemia in some patients based on pre‐existing risk factors and need for repeat dosing. In instances where repeat dosing with FCM therapy is indicated, monitoring phosphorus levels should be sufficient to justify the use of FCM vs other IV iron formulations. Note, FCM therapy is associated with hypophosphatemia in certain groups of patients. It is key to note that the overall benefit risk profile of FCM remains positive given its robust efficacy and overall worldwide safety experience in patients with ID and IDA.

### Diagnosis and management of hypophosphatemic disorders [^116heeBC]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to being an essential component of the mineralized skeleton, phosphate plays a role in different physiological and cellular functions. Several different mineral-regulating hormones, including 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast-growth factor 23, modulate serum phosphate levels predominantly at the level of the bone, kidney, and intestine. Impaired serum phosphate levels can lead to non-specific symptoms and serum phosphate levels are not routinely measured in laboratory analyses, therefore disorders of hypophosphatemia are often over-looked during patient evaluations. In the past few decades, significant progress has been made in identifying the genetic causes of and novel therapies for hypophosphatemic disorders.

### Treatment of hypophosphatemia in the intensive care unit: a review [^112dKy5z]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

In patients with malnutrition, a so-called refeeding syndrome may develop when they receive (par-)enteral feeding, a syndrome characterized by multiple metabolic abnormalities including depletion of total body phosphorus stores and redistribution of phosphate to the intracellular compartment, which may result in severe hypophosphatemia.

Hypothermia induces polyuresis and is associated with hypophosphatemia as well. The use of (continuous) renal replacement therapy may lead to hypophosphatemia when low-phosphate replacement solution and dialysate are used. Patients who require high-flux dialysis for intoxications are especially at risk. Addition of potassium phosphate to dialysate and replacement fluids safely prevents the development of hypophosphatemia.

Finally, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis commonly present with hypophosphatemia due to increased urinary phosphate excretion. Phosphate levels generally decrease further during treatment because of intracellular shifting along with glucose and potassium.

Hyperphosphatemia

Hyperphosphatemia (defined in adults as serum phosphate > 1.45 mmol/L [4.5 mg/dL]) often occurs in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypophosphatasia, or vitamin D intoxication. Rare genetic disorders of hyperphosphatemia include familial tumoral calcinosis (associated with reduced intact FGF23 levels) and hypoparathyroidism (associated with reduced PTH production). Higher phosphate levels, even if within the normal range, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the normal population and can result in overt hyperphosphatemia, particularly in patients with CKD. Serious complications associated with prolonged hyperphosphatemia include vascular calcification and heart failure.

### Treatment of hypophosphatemia using a protocol based on patient weight and serum phosphorus level in a surgical intensive care unit [^114K91hS]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hypophosphatemia may cause organ derangements in the surgical intensive care unit. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a repletion protocol for hypophosphatemia based on admission weight and phosphorus level.

Study Design

All patients who presented to an 18-bed surgical intensive care unit with a serum phosphorus level of 2.2 mg/dL or less or who received phosphorus supplementation despite having normal levels were identified. In the preintervention phase between January and June 2001, 137 patients were retrospectively identified who met these criteria. A protocol was then designed giving a single intravenous dose of phosphorus based on weight and serum phosphorus. Repletion was given with sodium or potassium phosphorus based on presupplementation levels. After protocol implementation 141 patients met these criteria between September 2001 and February 2002, and treatment and postrepletion levels were followed prospectively.

Results

A total of 47 patients were repleted before the intervention with adequate followup and 22 (47%) attained a normal level. Supplementation success was 53% in moderate hypophosphatemia (2.2 mg/dL or less) and 27% in severe hypophosphatemia (less than 1.5 mg/dL). After protocol implementation, 111 patients were repleted with 84 (76%) correcting to a normal level (p = 0.002 compared with retrospective patients). Success was 78% in moderate hypophosphatemia and 62% in severe hypophosphatemia. Inappropriate supplementation of normal phosphorus levels decreased from 51 to 16 patients after protocol implementation.

Conclusions

A protocol based on weight and serum levels successfully treated both moderate and severe hypophosphatemia in the majority of critically ill patients. Protocol implementation also decreased unnecessary supplementation of normal phosphorus levels.

ABSTRACT

Because of their rarity, diseases characterized by chronic hypophosphatemia can be underrecognized and suboptimally managed, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, serum phosphate may not be measured routinely in primary care practice. Authors participated in several working sessions to advance the understanding of phosphate homeostasis and the causes, consequences, and clinical implications of chronic hypophosphatemia. Phosphate levels are regulated from birth to adulthood. Dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis can result in hypophosphatemia, which becomes chronic if phosphate levels cannot be normalized. Chronic hypophosphatemia may be underrecognized as serum phosphate measurement is not always part of routine analysis in the primary care setting and results might be misinterpreted, for instance, due to age‐specific differences not being accounted for and circadian variations. Clinical consequences of chronic hypophosphatemia involve disordered endocrine regulation, affect multiple organ systems, and vary depending on patient age and the underlying disorder. Signs and symptoms of chronic hypophosphatemic diseases that manifest during childhood or adolescence persist into adulthood if the disease is inadequately managed, resulting in an accumulation of clinical deficits and a progressive, debilitating impact on quality of life. Early identification and diagnosis of patients with chronic hypophosphatemia is crucial, and clinical management should be started as soon as possible to maximize the likelihood of improving health outcomes. Furthermore, in the absence of a universally accepted description for "chronic hypophosphatemia", a definition is proposed here that aims to raise awareness of these diseases, facilitate diagnosis, and guide optimal phosphate management strategies by improving monitoring and assessment of patient response to treatment. © 2021 The Authors.

### A retrospective chart review to determine hypophosphatemia incidence and phosphorus supplementation requirements in patients with severe thermal cutaneous injuries receiving high-volume hemofiltration [^1154bLx2]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with severe thermal injuries have increased metabolic demands necessitating frequent phosphate supplementation. Patients with acute renal failure may have less requirements, due to reduced elimination. However, patients being supported with renal replacement therapy have varying degree of requirements. Little published evidence depicts the incidence of hypophosphatemia and repletion requirements in patients with severe thermal injuries treated with high-volume hemofiltration (HVHF) and a high-flux membrane. The objective of this retrospective chart review was to determine the incidence of hypophosphatemia and characterize repletion requirements and response in this population. Enrolled patients had at least 20% TBSA thermal injuries and required continuous hemofiltration with prefilter replacement fluid doses ≥ 35 mL/kg IBW/hr. A randomly selected cohort without acute kidney injury (AKI) and matched based on age and extent of TBSA was used to compare phosphorus requirements over an initial 14-day period. Demographics, diet, and variables affecting phosphorus concentrations were collected. Sixteen patients were included in the retrospective HVHF group and 16 patients in a case-control cohort to better depict the impact of HVHF. The average age was 60.2 ± 15.1 years and median TBSA was 30% (23.4, 56.3) in the HVHF group, compared to 53.3 ± 16.4 years (P = 0.22) and TBSA 29% (26.4, 33.9; p = 0.73). All patients in the HVHF group were started on HVHF with a 1.6 m2 polyethersulfone membrane for AKI. As expected, the HVHF group exhibited statistically higher than normal baseline potassium and phosphorous laboratory values. The HVHF group experienced more days with hypophosphatemia (49.6 ± 12.4% vs 29.3 ± 16.3%, P = 0.012), despite 0.75 mmol/kg/day phosphorous supplementation (compared to 0.66 mmol/kg/day for the control group, P = 0.45). Patients with longer durations of HVHF therapy experienced increasing risk of hypophosphatemia, reaching 100% by the end of the study period. This study demonstrates severe thermally injured patients receiving HVHF for AKI are at increased risk for hypophosphatemia, and require high phosphate supplementation.

Study selection and characteristics

After removing duplicate records, 5,699 records were screened, 412 were assessed for eligibility, and 33 were included in this review, comprising 11 guidelines, 19 reviews, and 3 consensus statements (Fig. 1).

Quality assessment

Study quality was very mixed, ranging from the highest quality guidelines to expert opinions without a systematic literature search, as detailed in Additional file 1: Table S1.

Chronic hypophosphatemia: testing

Chronic hypophosphatemia was defined as serum phosphate levels below the normal range of 0.81–1.45 mmol/L (2.5–4.5 mg/dL) on at least three consecutive fasting morning measurements taken 3 months apart in one included article (Table 1). Testing for chronic hypophosphatemia is recommended in morning fasting blood samples and in cases of persistent musculoskeletal symptoms; clinical scenarios where phosphate evaluation is indicated include suspected osteomalacia, which is based on symptoms such as bone pain, muscle weakness, and pseudofractures, as well as during evaluations for osteoporosis or fragility fractures. Tumor-induced osteomalacia also warrants testing in unexplained musculoskeletal symptoms or abnormal DXA scans. For X-linked hypophosphatemia, a genetic condition most commonly diagnosed in childhood due to rickets, annual monitoring is advised for untreated adult patients, and semiannual monitoring is advised for those on treatment, with first monitoring after the initiation of supplementation at 3 months or monthly monitoring until stable. Treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia with burosumab should also be monitored. Fibrous dysplasia/McCune–Albright syndrome necessitates testing during disease staging or when skeletal symptoms change. The updated international guidelines on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism state that measuring phosphate when evaluating the condition is not essential but can be helpful and is recommended. Japanese experts recommend testing phosphate as the first step in evaluating the cause of hypocalcemia. Most kidney transplant patients experience hypophosphatemia within the first 3 months after transplantation due to renal phosphate loss. Weekly phosphate testing is thus recommended during this period until levels stabilize, followed by monitoring every 6 to 12 months during later stages of chronic kidney disease.

Expert Opinion: Practical Considerations for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Hypophosphatemia

A standardized definition for chronic hypophosphatemia

To help harmonize nomenclature, raise awareness, and guide clinical decision making for diseases characterized by chronic hypophosphatemia, it is important to establish a standard definition. Definitions of hypophosphatemia exist for children and adults, yet there is currently no universally accepted definition of chronic hypophosphatemia. This definition should consider age‐ and sex‐specific normal phosphate reference ranges, as well as the duration of low phosphate levels.

While we acknowledge the difficulties in defining chronic hypophosphatemia, we propose the following definition may be used in children and adults:

"At least three consecutive, morning fasting serum phosphate readings below the lower limit of normal (LLN) for healthy age‐ and sex‐matched reference ranges, taken at least 3 months apart (eg, 0, 3, and 6 months)".

However, we emphasize the importance of using clinical judgment when managing patients with hypophosphatemia. Further investigations and management should be considered without delay when there is suspicion of an underlying condition that may require earlier intervention, if severe hypophosphatemia is identified (eg, serum phosphate in adults < 0.3 mmol/L), if hypophosphatemia is associated with severe symptoms or in patients with a known genetic risk (eg, a mother with XLH) and causes of acute hypophosphatemia have been excluded. In children beyond perinatal age, the first measurement of low phosphate should prompt additional investigations. In such situations, serum phosphate measurement should be repeated as soon as possible, and treatment should be initiated promptly, without the need to formally define hypophosphatemia as a chronic condition. In all cases of chronic hypophosphatemia, it is crucial to determine the underlying cause because some disorders (eg, TIO) may require extensive diagnostic investigations and surgical treatment, whereas others may need lifelong therapy and follow‐up (eg, XLH).

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to vitamin D and phosphate salts (children), XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend to increase the dose of phosphate supplements progressively in cases of insufficient clinical response, but avoid doses > 80 mg/kg daily (based on elemental phosphorus) to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort and hyperparathyroidism. Adjust treatment by decreasing the dose and/or increasing the frequency if adverse effects are present.

### Hypophosphatemia after high-dose iron repletion with ferric carboxymaltose and ferric derisomaltose-the randomized controlled HOMe aFers study [^116j45jG]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with iron deficiency anemia, ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and ferric derisomaltose (FDI) allow high-dose iron repletion. While FCM is reported to induce hypophosphatemia, the frequency of hypophosphatemia after an equivalent dosage of FDI had not been assessed prospectively.

Methods

In the prospective, single-center, double-blind HOMe aFers study, 26 women with iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL plus either plasma ferritin ≤ 100 ng/mL or a plasma ferritin ≤ 300 ng/mL and transferrin saturation (TSAT) ≤ 30%) were randomized to a single intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg body weight (up to a maximum of 1000 mg) FCM or FDI. The primary endpoint was the incidence of hypophosphatemia (plasma phosphorus levels < 2.0 mg/dL at day 1, day 7 ± 2, and/or day 35 ± 2 after the infusion). In order to investigate potential skeletal and cardiovascular implications, we assessed changes in other components of mineral and bone metabolism, left ventricular function, and arrhythmias.

Results

Hypophosphatemia occurred more frequently in women treated with FCM (9 out of 12 [75%]) than in those treated with FDI (1 out of 13 [8%]; p = 0.001). Within 24 h after iron supplementation, women in the FCM group had significant higher plasma intact FGF23 (p < 0.001) and lower plasma 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D (p < 0.001). As an indicator of urinary phosphorus losses, urinary fractional phosphorus excretion was higher in the FCM group (p = 0.021 at day 7 ± 2 after iron supplementation). We did not observe differences in skeletal and cardiovascular markers, potentially because of the limited number of participants.

Conclusions

While both FCM and FDI provide efficient iron repletion in participants with iron deficiency anemia, FCM induced hypophosphatemia more often than FDI.

The Panel Proposes

Provide ongoing care by an expert in metabolic bone disease who recognizes the importance of multidisciplinary services at the transition to adulthood — along with patient support groups — to address disease-related comorbidities.
Continue medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) for at least several years following epiphyseal closure enabling the optimization of peak bone mass which occurs at approximately 20 to 25 years of age in asymptomatic individuals.
Provide medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) in the presence of symptoms or biochemical/histological evidence of osteomalacia (bone pain, weakness, osteomalacic fractures, elevated ALP, or osteomalacia on bone biopsy)
Optimize medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D) prior to undertaking orthopedic surgeries or dental implant surgeries.
Provide ongoing adult care with pharmacotherapeutic management (with either burosumab or conventional therapy) with consideration of the benefits and risks of therapy and the patient's capacity for ongoing monitoring.
When treating with burosumab, adhere to the recommended starting dose and adjust doses to achieve serum phosphorus levels in the low to mid normal (peak) or just below the normal or low normal (trough) range for age, while avoiding hyperphosphatemia at any point in the dose cycle.
If burosumab is not available, symptomatic adults should be treated with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts).
Phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy.
When treating with conventional therapy (active vitamin D with or without phosphate salts), the fasting serum phosphorus should not serve as a target. It is not necessary to achieve normal fasting serum phosphorus levels to treat XLH, and the high phosphate loads used to accomplish this often lead to severe hyperparathyroidism.
Treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate salts should be modified to avoid hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.
Burosumab is contraindicated in CKD (GFR less than 30 mL/min), and in acute kidney injury. Cautious use may be considered in the presence of an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min with careful monitoring.
Treat hypertension using current regional recommendations pertaining to hypertension management.
Treat tertiary hyperparathyroidism in the setting of hypercalcemia, where multi-gland involvement is anticipated, with off-label use of calcimimetics (ie, cinacalcet) to lower PTH levels, with careful monitoring of serum calcium to prevent hypocalcemia. If hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia remain uncontrolled, a subtotal parathyroidectomy should be considered.
Treat hypercalciuria by reducing the dose of active vitamin D, and in persistent hypercalciuria, hydrochlorothiazide or potassium citrate may be used. The panel also proposes a low sodium intake (< 1500 mg/day) and increased fluid intake up to 3 L/24 hours in the presence of hypercalciuria.
Early referral to the spinal team with physiotherapy in cases of spinal scoliosis.
Treat spinal scoliosis with surgical fixation if the Cobb angle is greater than 30 degrees depending on the rate of progression and location of the curve.

Monitoring and assessment of response to treatment

Parameters and clinical features commonly used in assessing adequacy of response to phosphate management strategies are shown in Table 4.

Table 4
Assessment of Adequacy of Response to Management Strategies for Chronic Hypophosphatemia

Serum phosphate monitoring

There is a lack of standardization of phosphate monitoring across the clinical literature. We highlight the need to consider age‐ and sex‐specific reference values when monitoring serum phosphate response to treatment, including consideration of menopause and puberty influencing target serum levels. Impact of circadian rhythm variation should be minimized by measuring morning fasting serum phosphate, and blood samples should be drawn with care, to avoid hemolysis, which could mask hypophosphatemia. The phosphate‐monitoring schedule should be based on the causative disease and individual patient needs.

Additional considerations

The appropriateness of a target in terms of serum phosphate levels should be questioned or clarified. In our experience, treatment with oral phosphate supplementation and active vitamin D analogs should not aim to normalize serum phosphate levels in patients with XLH. Although hypophosphatemia frequently persists (with serum phosphate below or toward the lower normal ranges for age and sex), the treatment still provides clinical benefits, especially in children and when initiated early. However, oral phosphate dosing should always be monitored and adjusted as necessary to avoid treatment‐related complications (eg, hyperparathyroidism or hypercalciuria).

In contrast, when using burosumab, dosing is adjusted to normalize serum phosphate levels. Although some patients with XLH treated with burosumab may not achieve a consistent serum phosphate level above the age‐adjusted lower limit of normal (LLN), clinical improvements are still observed. In general, we consider the following to be useful indications of a good response to burosumab therapy in patients with XLH, as has been shown in clinical trials when analyzed at the midpoint between doses: a 50% increase from baseline in serum phosphate concentration (even if LLN is not achieved); a 50% decline from baseline in fractional excretion of phosphate; and/or a 50% increase in TmP/GFR. Assessment of total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in children, or bone‐specific ALP in adults, can also be used to monitor response.

Several endocrine factors, especially PTH, 1,25(OH) 2 D, and kidney function, influence serum phosphate homeostasis, and these should be monitored in parallel with serum and urinary phosphate concentrations.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to management of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (general principles), XLH-EG 2025 guidelines recommend to manage patients with elevated PTH levels on therapy with oral phosphate and active vitamin D by increasing the dose of active vitamin D and/or decreasing the dose of oral phosphate supplements.
Reduce or stop active vitamin D and phosphate supplements in cases of persistent hypercalciuria and/or hypercalcemia.
Consider administering active vitamin D without phosphate supplements in adult patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism if careful follow-up is guaranteed.
Consider switching these patients to burosumab therapy if possible.

OUTLOOK

Phosphate is an essential mineral and its balance has to be tightly controlled to avoid states of hypophosphataemia with cellular energy deficiency as well as the sequelae of hyperphosphataemia with ectopic calcifications and cardiovascular disease. In times of very high consumption of phosphate in industrialized countries and evidence associating dietary phosphate with disease and mortality in the general population, as well as in the very vulnerable population of patients with CKD, a better understanding of the effects of phosphate in the human body is required. Fields that must be further addressed are the role of CPPs, transport mechanisms of phosphate in the intestine and other organs (e.g. bone), Pi sensing, the impact of Pi (and/or CPPs) on inflammation and cardiovascular health, the interactions of phosphate and phosphate-containing crystals on gut microbes and the role that phosphatotropic hormones play in these processes.

### Parenteral iron therapy and phosphorus homeostasis: a review [^111QyhVn]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Phosphorus plays a critical biochemical role through its involvement in cellular and extracellular metabolism, as an integral component of nucleic acids, cell membranes, high‐energy compounds (eg, adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) utilized in metabolism, and through regulating the activity of many enzymes. Phosphorus is also an important component of the hydroxyapatite crystal, which provides mechanical strength to mineralized tissues and participates in maintaining the proper pH of extracellular fluids. 1, 2 Hypophosphatemia is a common laboratory abnormality; however, hypophosphatemia is usually an incidental finding, delaying its diagnosis. 3 It is relevant to interpret serum phosphorus within age‐dependent reference ranges for normal levels. In adults, normal serum phosphorus is defined as a serum phosphorus level of 2.5 mg/dL (0.8 mmol/L) or greater with the upper limit of normal of 4.5 mg/dL (1.45 mmol/L), but normal serum phosphorus levels are considerably higher in children (4.5–6.5 mg/dL [1.45–2.10 mmol/L]) and newborns (4.3–9.3 mg/dL [1.4–3.0 mmol/L]). 4, 5

The prevalence of hypophosphatemia in the general population is difficult to ascertain because hypophosphatemia is usually asymptomatic. Moreover, serum phosphorus is not routinely measured. By contrast, hypophosphatemia has been documented in 2.2%–3.1% of hospitalized patients and 29%–34% of patients in intensive care. 6 Most cases of hypophosphatemia are the result of excessive renal loss of phosphorus, but in some patients hypophosphatemia is a consequence of inadequate gastrointestinal absorption or an insufficient amount in parenteral nutrition formulations. Some medications have also been associated with hypophosphatemia including specific formulations of intravenous iron used to treat iron deficiency, 3 the most common cause of anemia. 7 These iron formulations have been associated with transient hypophosphatemia, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 which is usually asymptomatic, although some cases of severe or protracted hypophosphatemia have been reported. 13, 14 This review focuses on the effects of iron deficiency and parenteral iron replacement on phosphorus homeostasis.

Drug-associated hypophosphatemia: supplementation

Supplementation for FCM-induced hypophosphatemia depends on severity, with oral doses for moderate hypophosphatemia and intravenous administration for severe hypophosphatemia. Supplementation for mTOR inhibitor-induced hypophosphatemia is recommended when the phosphate level is < 0.81 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dl), with oral administration for mild and moderate hypophosphatemia and intravenous administration for severe hypophosphatemia (Table 3).

Adverse outcomes associated with phosphate testing and supplementation

We found no mention of adverse outcomes associated with testing. For adverse outcomes associated with supplementation, multiple reviews mentioned the risk of secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, as well as renal issues such as nephrocalcinosis in cases of long-term oral supplementation (Table 4). Management recommendations varied from laboratory monitoring to dose modification, the use of calcimimetics, surgical interventions, or the cessation of drugs that cause hypophosphatemia. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and dyspepsia were also commonly mentioned and recommended to be managed by careful dose upward titration. Due to rapid absorption and excretion, oral phosphate has to be given in several doses, which, in combination with the gastrointestinal effects, can lead to compliance issues. For intravenous supplementation, hypocalcemia, thrombophlebitis, and arrhythmias were mentioned as adverse outcomes, and recommended to be managed with laboratory monitoring and low doses and infusion rate.

### Hypophosphatemia after high-dose iron repletion with ferric carboxymaltose and ferric derisomaltose-the randomized controlled HOMe aFers study [^116fnXyc]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In HOMe aFers, FCM dosed intravenously as a single 1000mg infusion induced a larger reduction in plasma phosphorus than a single equivalent dosage of FDI. With respect to the primary study endpoint, 75% of women treated with FCM developed hypophosphatemia with plasma phosphorus levels below 2.0 mg/dL, compared to 8% in the FDI group. Hypophosphatemia was first observed at day 8 and plasma phosphorus levels normalized not later than days 35 to 37 in the majority of affected participants. After a mild increase of plasma phosphorus within the first 24 h after iron supplementation in both groups (which was previously also seen by Wolf et al.), of which the etiology remains speculative, the drop in plasma phosphorus was evidently caused by renal phosphorus loss due to increased activity of the phosphaturic hormone iFGF23, as reflected by inappropriately high urinary fractional phosphorus excretion.

The magnitude and the time course of endocrinologic alterations in women with uterine bleeding receiving FCM were in line with those reported in the randomized clinical trials conducted by Wolf et al. In these three earlier trials as well as in the present study, iron-deficient patients had elevated plasma cFGF23 prior to repletion, and all iron compounds caused a tremendous drop of cFGF23 by around 80% within the first days of treatment. cFGF23 measurements comprise a substantial proportion of physiologically inactive FGF23, so high plasma cFGF23 before iron repletion did not cause hypophosphatemia, nor did its drop after iron treatment affect plasma phosphorus.

Unlike cFGF23, iFGF23 was not increased in study participants before iron supplementation. In all four studies, FCM induced a selective rise in iFGF23, which was not seen after iron dextran, ferumoxytol, and FDI (and present trial), respectively. As iFGF23 measurements selectively reflect biologically active hormone levels, its rising plasma levels after FCM are followed by increased urinary phosphorus excretion and a subsequent drop of serum phosphorus. As iFGF23 also inhibits vitamin D activation, FCM treatment is also followed by a drop of plasma 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D. This may subsequently reduce gastrointestinal calcium absorption and lower plasma calcium levels. Both low plasma 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D and low calcium may finally explain why plasma PTH tended to increase after FCM, which is in line with secondary hyperparathyroidism reported after FCM in other trials.

### Approach to hypophosphatemic rickets [^112NFjqp]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Dosage is titrated based on laboratory testing, improvement in rickets and skeletal deformity on radiographs, and minimization of gastrointestinal and other side effects. Conventional therapy does not correct renal phosphate wasting, so, during treatment with calcitriol and phosphate, we do not target normal serum phosphorus due to safety concerns (nephrocalcinosis and hyperparathyroidism). Oral phosphate and calcitriol are administered multiple times a day due to short half-life and ongoing renal losses, limiting compliance.

Since the goal is for alkaline phosphatase and rickets to improve with treatment, it may be reasonable to increase doses of calcitriol or phosphate carefully to help reach this goal, unless the other safety laboratory assessments (normal to high serum phosphorus, high calcium, high PTH, or high urine calcium excretion) or other safety issues would prohibit that change. Recognize also that improvements in alkaline phosphatase takes time, and often alkaline phosphatase increases transiently on initiation of therapy for hypophosphatemic rickets or osteomalacia. Once stable dosing (of calcitriol and phosphate, or of burosumab) is established, monitoring is recommended about every 3 to 4 months for serum phosphorus, calcium, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as urine calcium and creatinine. Importantly if the fasting serum phosphorus is low on treatment, that is not itself an indication to adjust phosphate salts or calcitriol.

Treating non-FGF23–mediated hypophosphatemia is more complex; hypercalciuria is often present. HHRH is treated with phosphate salts as monotherapy because of inherently elevated 1,25(OH) 2 D and hypercalciuria. When treating HHRH with phosphate salts, high 1,25(OH) 2 D may persist, though hypercalciuria can improve, while phosphaturia persists and hyperparathyroidism remains a risk. Similarly, patients with renal tubulopathies are at risk for hypercalciuria, limiting treatment with active vitamin D and requiring careful monitoring for hypercalciuria and progressive kidney disease. Targeted therapy for cystinosis is available as cysteamine.

Regarding medical management for X-linked hypophosphatemia, more specifically with respect to general principles, adults, XLH-IWG 2025 guidelines recommend to continue medical therapy with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D for at least several years following epiphyseal closure to optimize peak bone mass, which occurs at approximately 20–25 years of age in asymptomatic patients.

### Oral iron replacement normalizes fibroblast growth factor 23 in iron-deficient patients with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets [^111jQDuB]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR) is caused by mutations impairing cleavage of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). FGF23 gene expression increases during iron deficiency. In humans and mice with the ADHR mutation, iron deficiency results in increased intact FGF23 concentrations and hypophosphatemia. We conducted a prospective open label pilot clinical trial of oral iron replacement over 12months in ADHR patients to test the hypothesis that oral iron administration would normalize FGF23 concentrations. Eligibility criteria included: FGF23 mutation; and either serum iron < 50 μg/dL; or serum iron 50 to 100 μg/dL combined with hypophosphatemia and intact FGF23 > 30pg/mL at screening. Key exclusion criteria were kidney disease and pregnancy. Oral iron supplementation started at 65mg daily and was titrated based on fasting serum iron concentration. The primary outcome was decrease in fasting intact FGF23 by ≥ 20% from baseline. Six adults (three male, three female) having the FGF23-R176Q mutation were enrolled; five completed the 12-month protocol. At baseline three of five subjects had severely symptomatic hypophosphatemia (phosphorus < 2.5mg/dL) and received calcitriol with or without phosphate concurrent with oral iron during the trial. The primary outcome was met by 4 of 5 (80%) subjects all by month 4, and 5 of 5 had normal intact FGF23 at month 12. Median (minimum, maximum) intact FGF23 concentration decreased from 172 (20, 192) pg/mL at baseline to 47 (17, 78) pg/mL at month 4 and 42 (19, 63) pg/mL at month 12. Median ferritin increased from 18.6 (7.7, 82.5) ng/mL at baseline to 78.0 (49.6, 261.0) ng/mL at month 12. During iron treatment, all three subjects with baseline hypophosphatemia normalized serum phosphorus, had markedly improved symptoms, and were able to discontinue calcitriol and phosphate. Oral iron repletion normalized FGF23 and phosphorus in symptomatic, iron-deficient ADHR subjects. Thus, the standard approach to ADHR should include recognition, treatment, and prevention of iron deficiency. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Evaluation of hypophosphatemia: lessons from patients with genetic disorders [^113CXUQn]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Phosphate is a key component of several physiologic pathways, such as skeletal development, bone mineralization, membrane composition, nucleotide structure, maintenance of plasma pH, and cellular signaling. The kidneys have a key role in phosphate homeostasis, with 3 hormones having important roles in renal phosphate handling: parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Independent of the genetic diseases affecting the FGF-23 pathway (such as hypophosphatemic rickets), hypophosphatemia is a frequent condition encountered in daily practice, and untreated critical hypophosphatemia can induce hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure, cardiac dysfunction, and neurologic impairment. Rapid correction thus is necessary to avoid severe complications. The aims of this teaching case are to summarize the causes and biological evaluation of hypophosphatemia and provide an overview of our current understanding of phosphate metabolism.

### Prevention of hypophosphatemia after burn injury with a protocol for continuous, preemptive repletion [^1165H4Tr]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Severe burn injury has been shown to result in hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia can cause cardiac, hematologic, immunologic, and neuromuscular dysfunction. This study compares serum phosphate levels and outcomes in patients who were administered a continuous, preemptive phosphate repletion protocol vs those who only received phosphate supplementation after they developed hypophosphatemia. Records of patients with greater than 19% TBSA burn admitted to the intensive care unit from 2006 to 2010 were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: historical controls who received responsive repletion when serum phosphate levels were less than 2.5 mg/dl (2006–2008) and the experimental group that received 30 mmol intravenous every 6 hours starting at approximately 24 hours after injury as long as serum phosphate levels were less than 4 mg/dl (2008–2010). Patients with chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury were excluded. Data collected included age, weight, burn size, age, all serum phosphate levels, and total amount of phosphate administered. Differences in groups were compared with Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. A total of 30 patients were included in the study, 20 in the responsive repletion group and 10 in the continuous repletion group. No significant difference was detected in age, sex, burn size, or full thickness burn size between groups. The continuous group had a statistically lower percentage of hypophosphatemic lab values compared with the responsive group, 13 ± 14% vs 45 ± 21% (P < .0001). No difference was found in percent of observations reflecting hyperphosphatemia (median of 2% in each group, P = 0.7). Four patients in the continuous group suffered cardiac and/or infectious complications compared with 16 in the responsive group (P = 0.04). Continuous, pre-emptive repletion of phosphate prevents hypophosphatemia after severe burn injury when compared with responsive repletion in historical controls. The protocol resulted in less hypophosphatemia without increasing the risk of hyperphosphatemia. This study also suggests that continuous repletion may result in fewer complications, but this needs to be confirmed in larger, prospective studies.

### Acute liver damage and subsequent hypophosphatemia in malnourished patients: case reports and review of literature [^116b9uuL]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The relationship between liver damage and subsequent hypophosphatemia in malnourished patients will be discussed.

Method

The authors report two malnourished females who developed severe liver damage and subsequent hypophosphatemia. Liver damage commenced suddenly after over a week of hospitalization and deteriorated rapidly. Although the precise pathology of the liver damage could not be determined and the specific cause was not identified, steatohepatitis associated with fatty liver might be considered.

Results

Hypophosphatemia following liver damage was considered to be the result of hepatocyte regeneration and replacement of phosphorus was an effective treatment.

Conclusion

Hypophosphatemia in these cases suggested improvement from liver damage; however, it is commonly known that hypophosphatemia has a central role in refeeding syndrome in malnourished patients. Therefore, it was concluded that attention should be paid to hypophosphatemia after liver damage.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in adults: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^116iuwPk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Conventional Therapy

Generally, symptomatic adults with XLH are treated with phosphate salts (750–2000 mg/day) divided into 3 to 4 doses daily, and active vitamin D (calcitriol [0.5 to 1 µg/day] or alfacalcidol [0.75–1.5 μg daily]), especially when treating osteomalacia or fractures. Doses may then be lowered during the maintenance phase of treatment to minimize long-term complications. A balanced use of calcitriol (useful in dampening PTH secretion) and phosphate is of value in order to avoid phosphate stimulation of PTH, which exacerbates renal phosphate loss and further lowers serum phosphate. Importantly, phosphate salts should not be used as monotherapy without concurrent active vitamin D. Active vitamin D without phosphate salts, however, may be considered in adults with mild symptoms.

Figure 4.
GRADEd monitoring recommendations for follow-up in adults with XLH.

Figure 5.
GRADEd treatment recommendations in adult XLH.

Adequate dietary calcium intake is recommended to provide calcium for skeletal mineralization and the healing of osteomalacia and rickets, especially during the first few months of treatment, acknowledging that the active vitamin D also increases gastrointestinal calcium and phosphate absorption, and the combination may increase the risk of hypercalciuria. As calcium supplements act as phosphate binders, potentially reducing the bioavailability of phosphate supplements, calcium intake must be separated 1 hour from phosphate intake. Elevated PTH with concomitant low urinary Ca/Cr may indicate the need for increasing the calcium intake.

Phosphate supplementation is often limited by gastrointestinal tolerability issues, including dyspepsia, and a laxative effect. Patients may opt to discontinue phosphate replacement due to gastrointestinal side effects. As mentioned above, complications of conventional therapy include secondary and tertiary (hypercalcemic) hyperparathyroidism, nephrocalcinosis, and CKD. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs in about 25% to 30% of adults with XLH and may develop several years after stopping conventional therapy. The resulting hypercalcemia limits the use of active vitamin D. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism usually requires multi-gland parathyroidectomy, and hypercalcemia can still recur. Cinacalcet may be effective as adjunctive therapy for hyperparathyroidism.

### Hypophosphatemia after high-dose iron repletion with ferric carboxymaltose and ferric derisomaltose-the randomized controlled HOMe aFers study [^11115sMT]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 2.2 billion people suffer from anemia worldwide. Iron deficiency is the most frequent cause of anemia, and menstruating women are particularly affected. The importance of adequate iron repletion is undisputed, and in the majority of individuals without chronic disease, treatment with oral iron compounds is sufficient. When intolerance or inefficacy precludes success of oral iron, intravenous administration is indicated.

Several novel iron compounds have been approved that allow the repletion of large amounts of iron with a single intravenous infusion. Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) and ferric derisomaltose (FDI) are widely used, but FCM treatment has been reported to be associated with hypophosphatemia 2 to 5 weeks after administration, usually resolving spontaneously after 6 to 12 weeks. Hypophosphatemia after FCM treatment is caused by transiently rising plasma levels of the phosphaturic hormone intact FGF23 (iFGF23), which stimulates the renal excretion of phosphorus. Such transient increase of iFGF23 with a consecutive period of hypophosphatemia after FCM has been described to induce relevant clinical consequences in retrospective case reports.

Interestingly, in randomized clinical trials, patients who received iron dextran or ferumoxytol rather than FCM at equivalent dosages did not experience hypophosphatemia, as iron dextran and ferumoxytol did not induce an increase in iFGF23 in these trials.

Similarly, FCM caused hypophosphatemia substantially more often than FDI when both compounds are given at dosages licensed in the United States (FCM, 750 mg at day 0 and day 7; FDI, 1000 mg).

In the HOMe aFers (HOMburg evaluations on application of Ferrum study 1) trial, we compared the incidence of hypophosphatemia in women randomized to receive either FDI or FCM at equivalent dosages, as licensed in Europe. Furthermore, we investigated changes in markers of mineral and bone metabolism, changes in left ventricular ejection fraction, and the incidence of arrhythmic events.

### Potassium phosphate [^114QSxuN]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.2 Dosage for Administration in Intravenous Fluids to Correct Hypophosphatemia

Potassium phosphates injection provides phosphorus 3 mmol/mL (potassium 4.4 mEq/mL).

The dosage is dependent upon the individual needs of the patient, and the contribution of phosphorus and potassium from other sources.

Initial or Single Dose

The phosphorus doses in Table 2 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose and are intended for most patients. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose. The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m² to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), start at the low end of the dose range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium serum concentrations.

### Change of serum phosphate level and clinical outcome of hypophosphatemia in massive burn patient [^1175TNRh]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypophosphatemia is relatively common phenomenon in patients with massive burn injury. Therefore, we check serum phosphate level routinely and try to supply phosphate in a timely manner. The purpose of this study was to investigate the change of the serum phosphate level of early postburn period and the impact of hypophosphatemia on the prognosis of patients.

Methods

A total of 227 patients with burn injury were reviewed retrospectively. We performed analysis of serum phosphate level within 20 days from burn injury.

Results

Patients' mean (SD) age was 47.0 (14.1) years, and mean (SD) percentage of total body surface area burned were 47.7 (21.9). Severe hypophosphatemia (phosphate < 1.0 mg/dL) was observed in 35 patients (15.8%), and moderate hypophosphatemia (1.0 ≤ phosphate < 2.0 mg/dL) was found in 115 patients (50.6%). Therefore, overall incidence of hypophosphatemia was 66.4%. There was no significant difference in serum phosphate level with survival, total body surface area burned, and mechanical ventilation. Age (odds ratio [OR], 3.180; 95% confidence interval, 1.025–9.871; p = 0.045), total body surface area burned (OR, 20.934; 95% CI, 6.845–64.024; p = 0.000), and mechanical ventilation (OR, 5.581; 95% CI, 2.380–13.085; p = 0.002) were independently associated with mortality. However, serum phosphate level (OR, 0.828; 95% CI, 0.275–2.495; p = 0.737) does not have a statistical significance.

Conclusion

Although multiple studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of phosphate repletion regimens, the effect on mortality and morbidity is not well reported. However, our results show that patients with massive burn injury have high incidence of hypophosphatemia, and hypophosphatemia can result in many complications. Therefore, routine check and supply of phosphate can be suggested in patients with massive burn injury.

Box 6 Recommendations for conventional treatment in adults

We recommend treatment in symptomatic adults with X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) by active vitamin D together with oral phosphorus (phosphate salts) to reduce osteomalacia and its consequences and to improve oral health (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We suggest treating pregnant and lactating women with active vitamin D in combination with phosphate supplements if needed (grade D, weak recommendation)
We do not recommend routine treatment of asymptomatic adults with XLH (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend using substantially lower doses of active vitamin D and oral phosphate than are used in children (grade C, moderate recommendation). We recommend a dose range of 750–1,600 mg daily (based on elemental phosphorus) for phosphate and of 0.50–0.75 and 0.75–1.5 μg daily for calcitriol and alfacalcidol, respectively (grade C, weak recommendation)
We recommend reducing doses of active vitamin D in patients in whom long-term immobilization is anticipated, to prevent hypercalciuria and hypercalcaemia (grade D, weak recommendation)
We recommend stopping phosphate supplements in patients with markedly increased parathyroid hormone levels (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We suggest that active vitamin D might be given without phosphate supplements to adult patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism if careful follow-up is provided (grade D, weak recommendation)
We suggest supplementing patients with native vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) in case of vitamin D deficiency; we also suggest ensuring normal calcium intake (grade C, weak recommendation)

### Hypophosphatemia in kidney transplant recipients: report of acute phosphate nephropathy as a complication of therapy [^1123qpm2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatemia is a common complication after kidney transplant, affecting > 90% of patients. However, no specific recommendations for phosphate repletion exist for transplant recipients. We report a case of a 70-year-old highly sensitized woman with end-stage renal disease caused by diabetic nephropathy who underwent deceased donor kidney transplant. Four weeks later, she was noted to have hypophosphatemia with undetectable serum phosphate levels, and she reported mild diarrhea. She was started on oral phosphate supplementation. On a routine visit 2 weeks later, she was found to have an acute increase in serum creatinine level and kidney biopsy was performed. We discuss the causes, management, and complications of hypophosphatemia in kidney transplant.

### Hypophosphatemia as a predictor of pancreatic necrosis in acute alcohol-induced pancreatitis [^112ePpr5]. Pancreas (2025). Medium credibility.

There are, however, several limitations to our study. Since this study was conducted in a single-center community-based academic setting, it limits the generalizability of our findings. In addition, in our hospital, phosphate levels are not routinely reported on basic or comprehensive metabolic panels and must be ordered separately, so our findings are likely impacted by selection bias. Our sample size was impacted by our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria which were put into place to minimize confounding. We excluded patients who did not have phosphate levels collected within the first 48 hours of their admission, thereby narrowing our pool of patients with necrosis. This is because, in our hospital, phosphate levels are not routinely trended to assess for adequate repletion, unlike some other electrolytes such as potassium, magnesium, and sodium. This, therefore, generates data that is sporadic and cannot be used reliably for establishing associations. We also excluded patients who did not receive any imaging during their hospitalization and were given the diagnosis exclusively on clinical and laboratory findings, as without imaging, we could not objectively determine the presence of necrosis. We also excluded patients who had their hospital course complicated by problems not associated with the pancreas, such as alcohol withdrawal, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hospital-acquired infections, again to minimize confounding. Furthermore, we also did not evaluate for correction/repletion of phosphate levels which could have impacted the development of necrosis during the hospital stay. Despite the limitations, we were able to observe an association between hypophosphatemia within 48 hours of admission and pancreatic necrosis, which leads us to suggest that further prospective studies may be warranted to evaluate this relationship in more detail. Our study is also consistent with the data available in the literature, which also suggests a role of phosphate in determining the severity of pancreatitis, and hence, we recommend the need for further randomized controlled studies with phosphate repletion to assess the development of necrosis.

In conclusion, our study highlights a significant association between low serum phosphate levels within the first 48 hours of admission and the development of pancreatic necrosis in patients with acute alcoholic pancreatitis. This relationship, while statistically significant, does not confirm causality but suggests that hypophosphatemia could serve as a useful marker for identifying patients at risk. The observation that some patients developed necrosis despite initially normal phosphate levels further complicates this relationship, indicating that phosphate dynamics may vary during the progression of the disease. Consequently, proactive monitoring and management of phosphate levels could potentially play a role in preventing severe outcomes in acute pancreatitis.

### Physiopathology of phosphate disorders [^115ZNJy7]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Intracellular phosphate is critical for cellular processes such as signaling, nucleic acid synthesis, and membrane function. Extracellular phosphate (Pi) is an important component of the skeleton. Normal levels of serum phosphate are maintained by the coordinated actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, parathyroid hormone and fibroblast growth factor-23, which intersect in the proximal tubule to control the reabsorption of phosphate via the sodium-phosphate cotransporters Npt2a and Npt2c. Furthermore, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 participates in the regulation of dietary phosphate absorption in the small intestine. Clinical manifestations associated with abnormal serum phosphate levels are common and occur as a result of genetic or acquired conditions affecting phosphate homeostasis. For example, chronic hypophosphatemia leads to osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children. Acute severe hypophosphatemia can affect multiple organs leading to rhabdomyolysis, respiratory dysfunction, and hemolysis. Patients with impaired kidney function, such as those with advanced CKD, have high prevalence of hyperphosphatemia, with approximately two-thirds of patients on chronic hemodialysis in the United States having serum phosphate levels above the recommended goal of 5.5 mg/dL, a cutoff associated with excess risk of cardiovascular complications. Furthermore, patients with advanced kidney disease and hyperphosphatemia (> 6.5 mg/dL) have almost one-third excess risk of death than those with phosphate levels between 2.4 and 6.5 mg/dL. Given the complex mechanisms that regulate phosphate levels, the interventions to treat the various diseases associated with hypophosphatemia or hyperphosphatemia rely on the understanding of the underlying pathobiological mechanisms governing each patient condition.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on haemodialysis [^111fEi9m]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The conventional haemodialysis patient struggles to achieve sufficient phosphate removal, and historically dialysate has always been phosphate-free. Guidelines usually focus more on the upper limit than the lower limit for optimal pre-dialysis phosphate and ranges in the region of 1.1–1.7mmol/L are often suggested, with most of the emphasis on treatments to reduce phosphate - indeed, most of the Renal Association's advice on phosphate can be found in the guideline on mineral-bone management. However, with demographic and

treatment trends of the last decade, low phosphate is becoming more common, and since the symptoms of hypophosphataemia are non-specific, this problem may be easily overlooked.

The relationship between pre-dialysis phosphate and mortality is J-shaped, with increased risk occurring at both high and low levels. But phosphate is strongly associated with age and nutritional state, so that the mortality risk associated with low phosphate is substantially (although incompletely) attenuated by adjustment for comorbidity and malnutrition. In the context of low pre-dialysis phosphate therefore, the main clinical focus should be on nutritional assessment and support.

When patients are unable to consume sufficient phosphate to match intradialytic loss, supplementation of the dialysate is a logical approach to managing hypophosphataemia. The argument for supplementation is generally accepted in the context of augmented dialysis, when post-dialysis phosphate is often measured, and may be found to be very low in well-nourished patients. It is common practice, for example, to supplement dialysate with phosphate in pregnant patients receiving daily dialysis.

Supplementation could also be used to prevent undesired loss of phosphate in patients on conventional regimes with low pre-dialysis phosphate that is refractory to other measures. While this does appear to be clinically helpful in case reports, data to support this approach remain limited. However, as patients with low pre-dialysis phosphate currently receive a form of dialysis which inevitably worsens this abnormality, so the instinct to 'do no harm' may be a sufficiently persuasive argument for some clinicians.

### Hypophosphatemia during continuous veno-venous hemofiltration is associated with mortality in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury [^111jRXF6]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Hypophosphatemia can be caused by decreasing absorption, increasing renal excretion or internal redistribution of inorganic phosphate. In critically ill patients, inorganic phosphate redistribution across the cell membrane is a common phenomenon. Therefore, serum phosphorus levels do not accurately reflect total body phosphorus stores, and this bias can be aggravated by CVVH therapy because of the quick serum phosphorus clearance during the intervention. The ratio of CVVH therapy days with hypophosphatemia to total CVVH therapy days was calculated in the present study to avoid the bias of the serum phosphorus test. The present study showed that a single test of serum phosphorus concentration could not serve as an independent factor predictive of mortality even if it reached the standard of severe hypophosphatemia. Interestingly, the ratio of CVVH therapy days with hypophosphatemia to total CVVH therapy days was proved to be a factor independent of the global clinical outcome through the multivariate analysis, indicating that a high ratio conferred a higher 28-day mortality rate. The results suggested that the persistence of hypophosphatemia had the potential to harm critically ill patients. Once hypophosphatemia happens, the therapeutic strategy might be adjusted, including more phosphate supplementation as well as regulation of renal replacement dosage or modality, to avoid persistence of hypophosphatemia.

To date, whether the impact of intensity or dosage of renal replacement therapy is crucial to the outcomes of critically ill patients is controversial. Despite the benefits of high-intensity renal replacement therapy, including superior hemodynamic stability, metabolic clearance and volume control, no survival advantage can be demonstrated with its use. Although study design may explain much of this paradox, it is also quite plausible that the complications of the high-intensity renal replacement therapy offset its potential benefits in critically ill patients. Unfortunately, some outcome–dose studies have not even discussed adverse effects. In our data, normal phosphate supplementation treatment failed to reverse hypophosphatemia during CVVH because the majority of the patients with hypophosphatemia (68.6%) received regular sodium glycerophosphate injections. Thus, a new strategy should be adopted to resolve this clinical problem. The present study highlights the need for analysis of adverse effects and clinical strategies to correct hypophosphatemia during CVVH therapy, including phosphate supplementation, especially the use of phosphate-containing replacement fluid to decrease the high mortality rate of severe AKI patients.

Epidemiology of hypophosphatemia

Table 2 summarizes the reported incidence and prevalence of hypophosphatemia in surgical and medical ICU patients. Hypophosphatemia is usually categorized as moderate (serum phosphate level of 0.32 to 0.65 mmol/L (1 to 2 mg/dl) or severe (< 0.32 mmol/L (< 1 mg/dl)). In the general hospital population, the prevalence of moderate hypophosphatemia ranges between 2.2 and 3.1%, and the prevalence of severe hypophosphatemia is reported to be 0.2 to 0.4%. One study reports that 45% of all hospital hypophosphatemia cases occur in the ICU population. Hypophosphatemia has a higher incidence in certain patient groups, such as patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, sepsis, and postoperative patients. Hypophosphatemia is found in as many as 34% of patients after elective cardiac surgery. An extremely high incidence of hypophosphatemia is reported after major hepatic surgery, where almost all patients develop hypophosphatemia in the first postoperative week. In this group, serum phosphate levels decrease to a nadir within approximately 2 days and recover in the following days. This early nadir is also described after cardiac surgery and in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and the refeeding syndrome. Trauma patients have a higher incidence of hypophosphatemia, especially patients with burn wounds and head trauma. Although the use of renal replacement therapy leads to hypophosphatemia, no epidemiologic reports were found.

Table 2
Prevalence and/or incidence of hypophosphatemia

Correction of hypophosphatemia, when encountered, is not reported in epidemiologic studies and the spontaneous course of serum phosphate levels without treatment is generally not addressed.

Symptoms of hypophosphatemia

Serum phosphate levels do not accurately reflect total body phosphorus stores; hence the degree of hypophosphatemia does not always correlate to the presence of symptoms. Although most patients with hypophosphatemia do not develop symptoms, fatal complications have been described. A common mechanism in hypophosphatemia-caused complications is impaired energy metabolism, leading to cellular dysfunction in multiple organ systems. Symptoms are summarized in Table 3.

Renal phosphate wasting assessment

Assessment of renal phosphate wasting for diagnostic and treatment monitoring purposes can be measured by the fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) or the ratio of maximum tubular phosphate reabsorption to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR). TmP/GFR is preferred as TRP depends on nutritional phosphate intake and if measured using 24‐hour urine collection, it may overlook the circadian variability of serum phosphate concentrations, hence becoming unreliable. European clinical practice recommendations also outline TmP/GFR for XLH diagnosis and management. When using TmP/GFR to evaluate renal phosphate wasting, reference ranges, online calculators, and normal reference ranges according to age and sex are available (Table 3).

Table 3
Normal Ranges for TmP/GFR (Adapted from Chong et al.))

However, challenges associated with TmP/GFR assessment include the lack of universally accepted guidelines regarding fasting requirements and timing of urine and blood sampling, as well as reference values obtained before the isotope‐dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) international standardization of creatinine assays. We recommend the simultaneous collection of fasting second morning urine void and blood for TmP/GFR determination. Timing of urine and blood sampling should stay the same for individual patients to optimize validity of longitudinal determinations. For example, adults should fast for at least 12 hours from oral phosphate supplementation and 48 hours from active vitamin D, where feasible; fasting serum and urine samples can then be taken 2 hours after the first morning urine void. Alternatively, a 24‐hour urine collection sample can be used.

### X-linked hypophosphatemia management in adults: an international working group clinical practice guideline [^113sxFnu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Achieving a normal fasting serum phosphorus throughout the dose cycle with burosumab is challenging and not all adults achieve normal fasting serum phosphorus with doses of up to 90 mg of burosumab every 4 weeks. In order to achieve consistently normal fasting serum phosphorus with burosumab therapy, some patients may require more frequent dosing than every 4 weeks and may require dosing every 2 weeks. The total monthly dose may be more than 90 mg in a 4-week period. These are currently off-label regimens. In contrast, some patients may require very low burosumab doses in order to normalize fasting serum phosphorus, highlighting the broad individual variation in response.

Complications of hyperparathyroidism in adults may be less likely to occur with burosumab. In a recent clinical trial reductions in PTH levels were noted with burosumab in comparison to placebo. Injection site reactions occur in adults less commonly than in children and are typically brief and usually do not require discontinuation. Occasionally patients have reported transient generalized bone pain at the onset of therapy. About 8% (or more) of patients with XLH have restless legs syndrome in the absence of burosumab therapy. Restless leg syndrome has been noted as an adverse event of burosumab therapy.

Orthopedic and Related Surgical Procedures

Orthopedic intervention for XLH is predominately devoted to fracture care and osteotomies performed to correct limb alignment. Fractures and deformity occur primarily in the lower extremities and are attributed to progressive osteomalacia and the impact of prolonged weight bearing on poorly mineralized bones and misaligned joints. Reports of surgical treatment of bone deformity in skeletally mature adults with XLH include small numbers of patients with no control groups. The few articles specific to surgical treatment in adults with XLH promote intramedullary fixation (rods) for realignment osteotomies to span the full length of the bone; this approach allows for long healing time and prevents recurrence of deformity over the long term. In general, however, surgical management should be coordinated between the surgical team and the metabolic bone disease specialists. For most skeletal surgeries, surgical healing of the bone is likely to be improved with antecedent medical therapy (with either burosumab or phosphate and active vitamin D). Improved healing of active fractures after starting burosumab therapy was noted in the RCT study evaluating burosumab in comparison to placebo (before which many participants were receiving conventional therapy), supporting the use of burosumab for postoperative skeletal healing.

### Rickets [^115wRgzy]. Pediatrics in Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Rickets remains one of the most common nontransmissible pediatric diseases, especially in low- to middle-income countries. Rickets is characterized by impaired mineralization of growing bone resulting in bone frailty, deformities, impaired growth and development, and pain with standing or walking. Nutritional rickets is the most common cause of bone disease in the world. The most frequent etiology of rickets is vitamin D deficiency, with pathognomonic biochemical and radiologic characteristics. However, even in the context of appropriate vitamin D levels, other causes for rickets need to be considered, such as decreased calcium intake or absorption, metabolic bone disorders, abnormal phosphorus metabolism, and specific genetic forms that are not responsive to vitamin D therapy. Biochemical tests measuring serum and urine calcium and phosphorus, vitamin D, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone allow differentiation between various forms of rickets. Treatment of rickets helps optimize growth and reduce disability. Nutritional rickets is treated with vitamin D repletion, most commonly with ergocalciferol. The treatment of hypophosphatemic rickets depends on the etiology of the condition and may include calcitriol, phosphorus, and, more recently, burosumab.

### A new graduated dosing regimen for phosphorus replacement in patients receiving nutrition support [^113PBJmL]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hypophosphatemia is a common metabolic complication in patients receiving specialized nutrition support. We changed our previously reported dosing algorithm because the low dose no longer appeared to be effective at increasing serum phosphorus concentrations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a revised weight-based phosphorus-dosing algorithm in critically ill trauma patients receiving specialized nutrition support.

Methods

Seventy-nine adult trauma patients with hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus concentration ≤ 0.96 mmol/L) receiving nutrition support received an IV dose of phosphorus on day 1 according to the serum concentration of phosphorus: 0.73–0.96 mmol/L (0.32 mmol/kg, low dose), 0.51–0.72 mmol/L (0.64 mmol/kg, moderate dose), and ≤ 0.5 mmol/L (1 mmol/kg, high dose). The IV phosphorus bolus dose was administered at 7.5 mmol/hour. Generally, patients with a serum potassium concentration < 4 mmol/L received potassium phosphate and patients with a serum potassium concentration ≥ 4 mmol/L received sodium phosphate. Patients who still had hypophosphatemia on day 2 were dosed using the new dosing algorithm by the nutrition support service according to that day's serum concentration of phosphorus, or empirically by the trauma service.

Results

Of the 79 patients studied, 57 were male and 22 were female with a mean age of 44.8 ± 20.6 years. Mean Injury Severity Scores and APACHE-II scores were 27.1 ± 11.6 and 15.2 ± 6.8, respectively. There was no difference in baseline characteristics among the 3 dosing groups. Of the 79 patients, 34 received the low dose, 30 received the moderate dose, and 15 received the high dose of phosphorous. Mean serum phosphorous concentrations on day 2 were significantly increased in the moderate-dosed group (0.64 ± 0.06 to 0.77 ± 0.22 mmol/L, p < .05) and high-dosed group (0.38 ± 0.06 to 0.93 ± 0.32 mmol/L, p < .01), respectively, when compared with day 1. Mean serum phosphorus concentrations were normal in all 3 groups on day 3. Serum concentrations of magnesium, sodium, and potassium, as well as arterial pH, were stable across the study. Mean concentrations of ionized calcium were not significantly different in any of the 3 dosing groups across the study period.

Conclusions

This weight-based phosphorus-dosing algorithm is safe for use in critically ill patients receiving nutrition support. The moderate and severe-dose regimens effectively increase serum phosphorus concentrations.

### Efficacy of intravenous phosphorus therapy in the severely hypophosphatemic patient… [^114Qi5a1]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a simple approach to intravenous phosphorus therapy, ten adult patients with severe hypophosphatemia and normal renal function were studied prospectively. They were treated with a solution containing 9 mmole of phosphorus as monobasic potassium phosphate, infused continuously every 12 hours. Serum phosphorus, potassium, and calcium levels and urinary excretion of phosphorus were measured every 12 hours. The serum phosphorus level was significantly improved at 12 hours, more than 1 mg/dL in all patients at 36 hours, and normal in six patients at 48 hours. The serum potassium level was never above normal, and serum calcium levels declined in only one patient. Administration of 9 mmole of phosphorus as KH2PO4 every 12 hours is both safe and efficacious IV therapy for severe hypophosphatemia in the adult patient with normal renal function and without hyperkalemia or hypercalcemia.
