## Question

suddenly raising onto feet from sitting position - causing dizziness?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why suddenly rising from sitting to standing can cause dizziness and how to think through the differential, workup, and management of that symptom. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanism of orthostatic blood pressure regulation and what goes wrong in orthostatic hypotension. Then, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds and subtypes of orthostatic hypotension, including initial and delayed forms. Next, I will consider key mimics such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and postural tachycardia syndrome. After that, I need to check medication and age-related contributors. Finally, I will outline the bedside evaluation, when to use tilt testing, and evidence-based management and safety counseling, making sure I confirm each step against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the core mechanism. When a person stands, roughly 500–1000 mL of blood pools in the lower body, venous return drops, and stroke volume falls; normally, baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasoconstriction and a modest heart rate increase maintain cerebral perfusion, but if these compensations are impaired, cerebral hypoperfusion causes lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness, or syncope, which is the essence of orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance syndromes [^114ZmB6w] [^113612CJ] [^114ottzN].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic thresholds and subtypes so I don't misstate them. Classic orthostatic hypotension is defined as a sustained drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing, whereas initial orthostatic hypotension is a transient blood pressure decrease within 15 seconds of standing that can cause presyncope or syncope; delayed orthostatic hypotension manifests after 3 minutes and is particularly relevant in older adults and those with autonomic failure, and neurogenic OH reflects autonomic nervous system dysfunction rather than volume depletion or drugs alone [^1175WD3D] [^116htDvS] [^116pTeU9].

> Hold on, I should also review the timing of symptom onset relative to standing because it refines the subtype. Evidence from a large cohort suggests that early measurements within the first minute of standing correlate more strongly with dizziness and long-term adverse outcomes than later measurements, supporting the clinical relevance of initial OH and reinforcing the need to measure blood pressure promptly after standing rather than waiting several minutes [^116vyhWw].

> Next, I should review orthostatic intolerance syndromes beyond classic OH. Postural tachycardia syndrome is characterized by a heart rate increase of at least 30 bpm within 10 minutes of standing without orthostatic hypotension, often with standing heart rates exceeding 120 bpm, and symptoms such as lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, and fatigue that are relieved by recumbency; syncope can occur but is less frequent and not necessarily due to POTS itself [^1175WD3D] [^113Xrjzq] [^116C7kKC].

> But wait, what if the dizziness is vertiginous rather than presyncopal. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo produces brief, triggered spinning vertigo lasting seconds to a minute, classically provoked by head position changes such as rolling over, looking up, or moving from lying to sitting, and is diagnosed by characteristic positional nystagmus on Dix-Hallpike or supine roll testing; importantly, BPPV does not cause fainting, which helps distinguish it from orthostatic hypotension [^114kjarU] [^114FPKMQ] [^1174mT58].

> I need to ensure I consider medication-induced contributors because they are common and modifiable. Alpha-1 blockers such as tamsulosin and doxazosin, dopaminergic agents including ropinirole and rotigotine, and antipsychotics like risperidone can precipitate orthostatic hypotension, especially during initiation or dose escalation; patient counseling to rise slowly and monitor for dizziness is standard, and combining with other hypotensive agents increases risk [^1152Sogp] [^113VBEDP] [^116imPu1] [^1134UQ9P] [^1138mzjK] [^112RWjv2].

> Let me think about age-related physiology and comorbidities. Older adults have higher prevalence of orthostatic hypotension due to impaired baroreflexes, autonomic dysfunction, and polypharmacy, and they are at increased risk of falls and fractures; guidelines emphasize routine screening for dizziness and orthostatic vitals in older adults and those with falls, and careful history to separate presyncope from vertigo and imbalance [^117SLvEN] [^113612CJ].

> I should double-check the bedside evaluation steps so I don't miss anything. The initial workup should include a focused history of triggers, prodrome, duration, and recovery; a targeted exam including orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate after 5 minutes supine and at 1 and 3 minutes standing, with attention to neurologic signs; and an ECG when indicated; if the active standing test is negative but suspicion remains high, head-up tilt testing can unmask delayed OH or neurogenic OH [^113xRawe] [^1138uSz6] [^111jn2Ym].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of tilt testing and when it changes management. Tilt testing is particularly useful for delayed OH, neurogenic OH, and recurrent unexplained syncope, and active standing with beat-to-beat monitoring can document initial OH; in patients at fall risk or with limited mobility, tilt testing avoids injury while capturing delayed hemodynamic responses that a brief standing test might miss [^115ip7JA] [^111jn2Ym].

> Next, I should review the differential and how to separate overlapping entities. Orthostatic hypotension typically causes lightheadedness, visual graying, weakness, and syncope with upright posture and relief on sitting, whereas BPPV causes brief spinning vertigo with head movements and may show positional nystagmus; cervical vertigo is often triggered by neck rotation rather than pure postural change; and POTS features prominent palpitations and tachycardia without orthostatic hypotension, which helps triage the syndrome [^112BUNKs] [^1175WD3D] [^114kjarU].

> I will now examine management principles, starting with nonpharmacologic therapy because it is foundational. Education on slow positional transitions, liberalizing salt and water intake when not contraindicated, using compression stockings or abdominal binders, and employing physical counter-maneuvers such as leg crossing and squatting can mitigate symptoms; for BPPV, canalith repositioning maneuvers such as the Epley are first-line and should be offered at the time of diagnosis rather than relying on vestibular suppressants [^113612CJ] [^113XSwHB] [^116rnRRq] [^1119ZDtn].

> Let me consider pharmacologic therapy when nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient. Midodrine, an alpha-1 agonist, and droxidopa, a norepinephrine prodrug, are first-line for neurogenic and refractory orthostatic hypotension, while fludrocortisone can expand plasma volume but carries long-term risks; for POTS, low-dose propranolol and midodrine can improve tachycardia and symptoms, and for BPPV, vestibular suppressants are not recommended routinely [^113612CJ] [^1153yfc8] [^1119ZDtn].

> I should confirm safety counseling and follow-up because recurrence and injury risk are nontrivial. Patients should be advised to rise slowly, sit on the edge of the bed before standing, avoid rapid postural changes after meals or in heat, and report falls or persistent dizziness promptly; reassessment within about a month after initial treatment or observation is recommended to document resolution or uncover alternate diagnoses, and falls prevention screening is prudent in older adults [^116imPu1] [^111Ar3eC] [^117SLvEN].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "never use fludrocortisone", but I should correct that. Fludrocortisone can be effective for volume expansion in orthostatic hypotension, yet given concerns for long-term adverse effects such as supine hypertension and hypokalemia, many experts prefer midodrine or droxidopa as first-line agents, reserving fludrocortisone for selected cases with careful monitoring, which aligns with contemporary guidance [^113612CJ].

> In summary, sudden standing dizziness most commonly reflects impaired orthostatic blood pressure regulation, with initial or classic orthostatic hypotension, neurogenic OH, POTS, and medication effects comprising the principal cardiovascular causes, while BPPV and cervical vertigo represent key vestibular mimics; a structured history, orthostatic vitals with appropriate timing, targeted neurologic and otologic exams, and judicious use of tilt testing usually clarify the diagnosis and guide safe, effective management and follow-up [^1175WD3D] [^113612CJ] [^1132xzrG].

Sudden dizziness when rising from sitting is most often due to **orthostatic hypotension** (OH) [^113612CJ], a transient blood pressure drop from impaired autonomic reflexes or volume depletion [^113X16Sj]. It can also reflect **benign paroxysmal positional vertigo** (BPPV) [^114kjarU] from inner ear crystals, or **postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome** (POTS) [^113Xrjzq] with excessive heart rate rise on standing. Less common causes include cardiac arrhythmias, anemia, dehydration, or medication effects (e.g. alpha-blockers, antihypertensives, dopaminergic agents) [^116imPu1] [^113VBEDP] [^1134UQ9P]. Evaluation should include orthostatic vitals [^113xRawe], medication review, and targeted testing; management focuses on slow position changes, hydration, salt intake, compression stockings, and treating the cause [^115w65E6]; urgent care is needed for syncope, chest pain, or focal deficits [^112w51bx].

---

## Physiological mechanisms

Several **physiological mechanisms** can explain sudden dizziness when rising from a seated position:

- **Orthostatic hypotension (OH)**: A sustained drop in systolic BP ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing [^113612CJ], causing cerebral hypoperfusion and dizziness [^115FLRn5].

- **Initial orthostatic hypotension**: A transient BP drop within 15 seconds of standing [^116pTeU9], often causing brief dizziness or lightheadedness [^115ip7JA].

- **Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)**: A heart rate increase ≥ 30 bpm (≥ 40 bpm in adolescents) within 10 minutes of standing [^113Xrjzq], without significant BP drop, causing dizziness and palpitations [^113Xrjzq].

- **Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)**: Inner ear otoconia displacement causing brief vertigo with head position changes [^114kjarU] [^1157B8C3].

## Diagnostic evaluation

A thorough diagnostic evaluation includes:

- **Detailed history**: Onset, duration, frequency, triggers, associated symptoms, medication use, and medical history [^113xRawe].

- **Physical examination**: Orthostatic vital signs (supine, immediate standing, and 3-minute standing BP/HR) [^113xRawe], neurological exam, and cardiovascular assessment [^1132xzrG].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, electrolytes, glucose, renal function, and thyroid function as indicated [^notfound].

- **Specialized tests**: Tilt table testing for orthostatic intolerance, ECG for arrhythmias, echocardiography for structural heart disease, and vestibular testing for BPPV [^115ip7JA] [^112w51bx] [^114FPKMQ].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: Slow position changes, increased fluid/salt intake, compression stockings, and medications (midodrine, fludrocortisone) [^113612CJ] [^113XSwHB].

- **BPPV**: Canalith repositioning maneuvers (Epley, Semont) [^111Swr6D] [^116rnRRq].

- **POTS**: Increased fluid/salt intake, exercise training, and medications (midodrine, beta-blockers) [^1153yfc8].

- **Medication-induced dizziness**: Adjust or discontinue offending medications [^113612CJ].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Regular exercise, adequate hydration, and avoiding alcohol [^113XSwHB].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek **medical attention** if dizziness is accompanied by:

- Syncope or loss of consciousness [^113xRawe]

- Chest pain or palpitations [^notfound]

- Severe headache or focal neurological deficits [^113xRawe]

- Frequent or persistent dizziness affecting daily activities [^notfound]

- Recent initiation or adjustment of medications [^notfound]

---

Sudden dizziness when rising from sitting is most often due to **orthostatic hypotension**, BPPV, or POTS, with other cardiovascular, neurological, vestibular, metabolic, medication-related, and lifestyle factors also contributing. A structured evaluation and targeted management are essential for symptom control and fall prevention [^117SLvEN].

### Morbidity and mortality of orthostatic hypotension: implications for management of cardiovascular disease [^115FLRn5]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is the failure of cardiovascular reflexes to maintain blood pressure on standing from a supine or sitting position. Although OH may cause symptoms of dizziness or syncope, asymptomatic OH (AOH) is far more common and is an independent risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The prevalence of AOH increases with age, the presence of hypertension or diabetes and the use of antihypertensive or other medications. The implications of AOH for the treatment of CVD and hypertension are not well defined. This review provides an overview of the current information on this topic and recommends the more frequent assessment of OH in clinical practice and in future clinical trials.

Circulation (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic intolerance — Orthostatic intolerance is a general term referring to frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing (usually with a change in position from sitting or lying to an upright position) and are relieved by sitting or lying. Most commonly, the symptoms include lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. These symptoms may be accompanied by hemodynamic disturbances, including blood pressure decrease, which may or may not meet criteria for OH, and heart rate increase, which may be inadequate or compensatory. One condition of note is Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), in which upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm. Although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that is an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, leading further to the difficulty of this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

### Tilt testing remains a valuable asset [^115ip7JA]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Moving from supine to upright posture rarely induces syncope in normal healthy patients but may cause minor worrisome symptoms. For instance, a transient sensation of 'greying out/dizziness/light-headedness/unsteadiness' is common immediately after upright postural change (so-called 'initial' or 'immediate' OH). While usually harmless, this sensation may cause alarm/instability in some patients. Active standing is sufficient to document this problem and initiate treatment. Thus, active standing should be seen as a necessary, complementary aspect of cardiovascular autonomic workup in unexplained syncope, optimally with beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring for diagnostic accuracy.

Delayed OH is a far more important clinical problem, especially in older patients, debilitated patients, those with neurogenic OH, or in diseases that affect neurological responses, such as diabetes or alcohol abuse. In these cases, OH may be considerably delayed after change of posture that can result in fall injury. Active standing may not be tolerated for sufficient time to be diagnostic with additional fall injury risk during testing. TT avoids injury risk while providing the possibility of defining the diagnosis.

### Distinguishing peripheral from central causes of dizziness and vertigo without using HINTS or STANDING [^112bLcJj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Three validated diagnostic algorithms for diagnosing patients with acute onset dizziness or vertigo (HINTS, HINTS-plus and STANDING) exist. All are extremely accurate in distinguishing peripheral from central causes of dizziness when done by experienced clinicians. However, uptake of these diagnostic tools in routine emergency medicine practice has been sub-optimal, in part, due to clinicians' unease with the head impulse test, the most useful component contained of these algorithms. Use of these validated algorithms is the best way to accurately diagnose patients with acute dizziness. For clinicians who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable performing or interpreting HINTS and STANDING, this article will suggest alternative approaches to help with accurate diagnosis of patients with acute dizziness or vertigo.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^117SLvEN]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Dizziness and vestibular disorders assessment

Expert recommendation. Routinely ask about dizziness symptoms, and undertake follow-up assessment as necessary to identify cardiovascular, neurological and/or vestibular causes (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online). GRADE: E.

Recommendation details and justification

Dizziness is a common complaint in older adults who fall, with different meanings between individuals, and often no single explanatory cause. Careful history taking is of particular importance. Presyncope and observable unsteadiness or ataxia may be present.
Additionally, the vestibular system has a key role in the control of posture and gait, and there is evidence of a high incidence of both benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular dysfunction in those presenting with falls. In younger adults, such disorders can often be identified in the clinical history by a reported sensation of vertigo with clear positional or motion-provoked triggers. Identifying cases of vestibular dysfunction is more challenging in older adults due to more variable symptoms.
Where vertigo is reported, positional tests should be used to identify cases of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from non-cases (e.g. Dix-Hallpike, Head Impulse Test); however, the sensitivity of case-finding algorithms based purely upon symptoms compared with screening with positional testing in older adults is unknown.

### Postural tachycardia syndrome – current experience and concepts [^114VvGBj]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) is a poorly understood but important cause of orthostatic intolerance resulting from cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. PoTS is distinct from the syndromes of autonomic failure usually associated with orthostatic hypotension, such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. Individuals affected by PoTS are mainly young (aged between 15 years and 40 years) and predominantly female. The symptoms — palpitations, dizziness and occasionally syncope — mainly occur when the patient is standing upright, and are often relieved by sitting or lying flat. Common stimuli in daily life, such as modest exertion, food ingestion and heat, are now recognized to be capable of exacerbating the symptoms. Onset of the syndrome can be linked to infection, trauma, surgery or stress. PoTS can be associated with various other disorders; in particular, joint hypermobility syndrome (also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type, formerly termed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type III). This Review describes the characteristics and neuroepidemiology of PoTS, and outlines possible pathophysiological mechanisms of this syndrome, as well as current and investigational treatments.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^111DfMcy]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance — pathophysiology and symptoms — are characterized by autonomic nervous failure (ANF) with chronically impaired sympathetic efferent activity and deficient vasoconstriction, leading upon standing to a fall in BP with syncope or pre-syncope. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined as an abnormal decrease in systolic BP upon standing. Although pathophysiologically there is no overlap between reflex syncope and ANF, their clinical manifestations frequently overlap. Orthostatic intolerance refers to symptoms and signs in the upright position due to a circulatory abnormality, where syncope is one symptom along with dizziness/lightheadedness, weakness or fatigue, palpitations and sweating, visual and hearing disturbances, and pain in the neck, low back, or precordial region.

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — history and physical examination: A detailed history and physical examination should be performed in patients with syncope, with the history aimed to identify the prognosis, diagnosis, reversible or ameliorable factors, comorbidities, medication use, and patient and family needs; helpful elements include video recordings when available and obtaining a family history with emphasis on syncope or sudden unexplained death (or drowning). The physical examination should include determination of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate with changes in lying and sitting positions, on immediate standing, and after 3 minutes of upright posture, and a basic neurological examination should be performed, looking for focal defects or other abnormalities that would suggest need for further neurological evaluation or referral.

Orthostatic intolerance and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) — clinical features note that orthostatic intolerance refers to frequent, recurrent, or persistent symptoms that develop upon standing and are relieved by sitting or lying, with common symptoms including lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. In POTS, upright posture results in an apparently inappropriate tachycardia, usually with heart rates > 120 bpm; although syncope occurs in patients with POTS, it is relatively infrequent, and there is little evidence that the syncope is due to POTS, and treatments that improve symptoms of POTS might decrease the occurrence of syncope, although this is unknown.

Cervical vertigo and orthostatic hypotension — provocation patterns that help differentiate from BPPV: Cervical vertigo has been described as vertigo arising in conjunction with degenerative cervical spine disease and may produce similar symptoms to BPPV due to proprioceptive abnormalities from cervical spine dysfunction. Symptoms of cervical vertigo may be triggered by rotation of the head relative to the body while in an upright posture, whereas orthostatic (postural) hypotension may produce episodic dizziness or vertigo provoked by moving from the supine or sitting to the upright position, in distinction to the positional changes of BPPV.

### Dizziness: evaluation and management [^1132xzrG]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Dizziness is a common but often diagnostically difficult condition. Clinicians should focus on the timing of the events and triggers of dizziness to develop a differential diagnosis because it is difficult for patients to provide quality reports of their symptoms. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes peripheral and central causes. Peripheral etiologies can cause significant morbidity but are generally less concerning, whereas central etiologies are more urgent. The physical examination may include orthostatic blood pressure measurement, a full cardiac and neurologic examination, assessment for nystagmus, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (for patients with triggered dizziness), and the HINTS (head-impulse, nystagmus, test of skew) examination when indicated. Laboratory testing and imaging are usually not required but can be helpful. The treatment for dizziness is dependent on the etiology of the symptoms. Canalith repositioning procedures (e.g. Epley maneuver) are the most helpful in treating benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Vestibular rehabilitation is helpful in treating many peripheral and central etiologies. Other etiologies of dizziness require specific treatment to address the cause. Pharmacologic intervention is limited because it often affects the ability of the central nervous system to compensate for dizziness.

What should I avoid while taking CARDURA XL?

Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how CARDURA XL affects you. CARDURA XL can cause dizziness, weakness, or fainting.

What are the possible side effects of CARDURA XL?

CARDURA XL may cause serious side effects including:

a sudden drop in blood pressure (postural hypotension). Postural hypotension can happen at any time while you take CARDURA XL. The chance of having postural hypotension is higher a few hours after you take CARDURA XL or if you start taking a higher dose.

Symptoms of postural hypotension may happen after you stand up from a lying or sitting position and may include:
dizziness or
fainting or
feeling light-headed
You should get up slowly from a chair or bed until you know how CARDURA XL will affect you. If you begin to feel dizzy or lightheaded, sit or lie down with your legs and feet up. If your symptoms do not get better call your healthcare provider.
intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS). IFIS can happen during eye surgery to people who are taking or have taken alpha-blockers such as CARDURA XL. If you have an eye surgery for a clouding of the eye (cataract) planned, tell your eye doctor that you are using CARDURA XL or have taken an alpha-blocker before.
blockage of the digestive tract. There have been rare reports of symptoms of blockage in the digestive tract in patients with prior history of narrowing or blockage of the digestive tract. These symptoms are severe and persistent abdominal pain/cramping/bloating. If you know you have a narrowing of your digestive tract and you experience these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider.
prolonged erection of the penis. Extremely rarely, CARDURA XL and similar medications have caused painful erection of the penis, sustained for hours and unrelieved by sexual intercourse or masturbation. This condition is serious, and if untreated it can be followed by permanent inability to have an erection. If you have a prolonged abnormal erection, call your doctor or go to an emergency room as soon as possible.

### EFNS guidelines on the diagnosis and management of orthostatic hypotension [^113XSwHB]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension (OH) is a common, yet under diagnosed disorder. It may contribute to disability and even death. It can be the initial sign, and lead to incapacitating symptoms in primary and secondary autonomic disorders. These range from visual disturbances and dizziness to loss of consciousness (syncope) after postural change. Evidence based guidelines for the diagnostic workup and the therapeutic management (non-pharmacological and pharmacological) are provided based on the EFNS guidance regulations. The final literature research was performed in March 2005. For diagnosis of OH, a structured history taking and measurement of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate in supine and upright position are necessary. OH is defined as fall in systolic BP below 20 mmHg and diastolic BP below 10 mmHg of baseline within 3 min in upright position. Passive head-up tilt testing is recommended if the active standing test is negative, especially if the history is suggestive of OH, or in patients with motor impairment. The management initially consists of education, advice and training on various factors that influence blood pressure. Increased water and salt ingestion effectively improves OH. Physical measures include leg crossing, squatting, elastic abdominal binders and stockings, and careful exercise. Fludrocortisone is a valuable starter drug. Second line drugs include sympathomimetics, such as midodrine, ephedrine, or dihydroxyphenylserine. Supine hypertension has to be considered.

### Impact of proprioceptive cervical dizziness in chronic neck pain syndromes on gait and stance during active head-turn challenges [^114sP3X1]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analysis of specific questions on cervical syndrome and dizziness

All nineteen patients who complained of dizziness associated with their neck pain syndrome had experienced sudden, brief episodes of dizziness or unsteadiness in the event of neck pain and restricted head movements, particularly with rapid head movements. Fourteen of these nineteen patients only experienced dizziness in the acute stage of sensing neck pain while the remaining five patients also reported dizziness to linger even after the acute neck pain subsided. In ten patients, attacks occurred predominantly during horizontal head rotations (evenly distributed for bilateral and unilateral movements); in seven, they were elicited by vertical head movements in the pitch plane (5 head flexion, 1 head declination, 1 in both directions); four reported this while sitting, and four while lying or lying down. The quality of dizziness was described as drowsiness (n = 12), spinning vertigo (n = 8), unsteadiness (n = 8); four patients felt the need to make compensatory movements, one perceived an external perturbation (i.e. the sensation of being pushed or pulled). The duration of dizziness was mostly in the range of seconds (n = 9). As to the frequency of such dizziness episodes, most reported more than five times during the entire course of the condition (n = 11). Slow head movements elicited dizziness only in five patients. Some patients had attempted to reproduce the dizziness with repetitive head movements to determine the specific trigger and find out the possible origin on their own (Table 2).

Socioeconomic impact of symptoms

Fourteen out of the 19 patients spontaneously complained about neck pain associated dizziness beyond the specific questions (see Table 2). Twelve patients had consulted more than one medical specialist, with an average of 2.6 specialist consultations. In four cases, the cervical spine was considered to be the source of the symptoms. Eight patients described a fear of falling; four, significant discomfort; 12 described the dizziness as subjectively impairing, and four would take sick leave due to dizziness. At the time of presentation, 10 had developed avoidance behavior such as no longer riding a bicycle/motorcycle, avoiding fast head movements or overhead work, no longer leaving their house unaccompanied, or doing any sports which involve head movement. Twelve described the dizziness as subjectively impairing, and 4 had been on sick leave due to dizziness.

Lempert 360° roll maneuver — right lateral canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), geotropic type — is performed as follows: start from the supine position; some recommend rolling to start on the involved side; roll the head (or full body) to the unaffected side; keep rolling in the same direction until the head is completely nose down or prone, with some recommending ending here and returning to sit (270° roll) as anatomically the debris is repositioned; as originally published, complete the final roll (full 360°) and return to sitting. Each position is held for 15–30 seconds or until nystagmus stops.

### Sitting-up vertigo and trunk retropulsion in patients with benign positional vertigo but without positional nystagmus [^111mn5AF]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Presently, the unambiguous diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo (BPPV) requires the detection of positioning or positional nystagmus provoked by Dix-Hallpike (for vertical semicircular canals) or supine roll (for horizontal semicircular canals) manoeuvres, which indicates canalo- or cupolithiasis of affected semicircular canals. There are patients, however, in whom — despite typical complaints of BPPV — no positional nystagmus can be documented; this is called 'subjective BPPV' (sBPPV). These patients usually complain of short vertigo spells during and after sitting up, sometimes with abnormal retropulsion of the trunk.

Aim

In this study, the authors aimed to ascertain whether these patients in fact demonstrate abnormal sitting-up trunk oscillations when measured by posturography. Of 200 unselected patients with vertigo or dizziness, 43% had sBPPV with vertigo spells while sitting up, and 20% classical BPPV.

Methods

Posturographic recordings were performed in 20 patients with sBPPV and sitting-up vertigo.

Results and Discussion

Seven of the 20 patients had trunk oscillations during the act of sitting up and for a short time immediately afterwards. Based on their findings, the authors propose a new type of BPPV, the so-called Type 2 BPPV (typical complaints of BPPV, no nystagmus in Dix-Hallpike positions but short vertigo spell while sitting up), which may be the result of chronic canalolithiasis within the short arm of a posterior canal. Furthermore, the authors suggest that Type 2 BPPV, which could be identical to sBPPV or constitute a major subgroup of it, occurs frequently among patients with vertigo. For therapy, the authors recommend repetitive sit-ups from the Dix-Hallpike positions to liberate the short arm of the posterior canal from canaloliths.

### The recommendations of a consensus panel for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and associated supine hypertension [^111jn2Ym]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of nOH in individuals who screen positive for OH

After screening to identify a patient as being at risk for OH, an accurate assessment of the underlying cause(s) is required to determine the appropriate treatment recommendation. A stepwise approach is recommended for diagnosis of nOH, specifically starting with measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate, followed by more detailed autonomic testing in select cases (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Stepwise approach to the diagnosis of nOH

Diagnostic tests for nOH

Blood pressure testing

The hallmark test for OH is measurement of change in blood pressure from supine, after at least 5 min of rest, to standing (or head-up tilt [HUT]). Current guidelines define OH as a sustained fall of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing (or HUT). However, in patients with supine hypertension (a supine systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg), a 30 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure or 15-point fall in diastolic blood pressure may be a more appropriate criterion for patients with nOH as the magnitude of blood pressure fall is dependent on the baseline blood pressure.

A practical stepwise approach to orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate testing

In-clinic monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate

The recommended gold standard measurement of OH includes having patients rest in the supine position for at least 5 min and then stand for 3 min, with blood pressure measurements taken just prior to standing and at both 1 and 3 min of standing. However, in facilities in which this method is impractical, a seated-to-standing blood pressure can be performed as an acceptable alternative. In the alternative method, patients sit for at least 5 min and then stand for 3 min, with blood pressure measured just prior to standing and at 1 and 3 min of standing. If the test is positive (i.e. ≥ 20/10 mmHg decline in blood pressure with standing), the subject has OH. However, if the test is negative but symptoms are strongly suggestive of OH, a supine-to-standing blood pressure test (or HUT) should be considered. As some individuals with OH are at risk for falls when standing suddenly, testing staff should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate precautions.

Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and risk stratification — syncope: The initial evaluation of a patient presenting with T-LOC consists of "careful history, physical examination, including orthostatic BP measurements, and electrocardiogram (ECG)". Based on these findings, additional examinations "may be performed", including "CSM in patients > 40 years", echocardiogram "when there is previous known heart disease or data suggestive of structural heart disease or syncope secondary to cardiovascular cause", "Immediate ECG monitoring when there is a suspicion of arrhythmic syncope", and "Orthostatic challenge (lying-to-standing orthostatic test and/or head-up tilt testing) when syncope is related to the standing position or there is a suspicion of a reflex mechanism"; "Other less specific tests such as neurological evaluation or blood tests are only indicated when there is suspicion of non-syncopal T-LOC". The initial evaluation "should answer three key questions" about whether the event is a syncopal episode, whether "the aetiological diagnosis" is determined, and whether "there are data suggestive of a high risk of cardiovascular events or death". For diagnosis of syncope, the following "should be answered": "Was LOC complete? Was LOC transient with rapid onset and short duration? Did the patient recover spontaneously, completely and without sequelae? Did the patient lose postural tone?" If all are positive there is a "high likelihood of being syncope"; if any are negative, "exclude other forms of LOC before proceeding with syncope evaluation". Initial evaluation "is able to define the cause of syncope in 23–50% of patients".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic syndromes — diagnostic definitions and thresholds are described as follows: Orthostatic intolerance is a syndrome with frequent, recurrent, or persistent lightheadedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalized weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance, and fatigue upon standing; symptoms can occur with or without orthostatic tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension (OH), or syncope, and individuals have ≥ 1 of these symptoms associated with reduced ability to maintain upright posture. Orthostatic tachycardia is a sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position, or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age. OH is a drop in systolic blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture. Initial (immediate) OH is a transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope. Classic OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 min of assuming upright posture. Delayed OH is a sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or ≥ 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop; the fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold.

### When and how to use orthostatic vital signs [^114sYtpa]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Much controversy surrounds the use of orthostatic vital signs (OVS), including their indications, performance, and interpretation. This can lead to conflict between nurses, physicians, and consultants. This article summarizes the evidence for OVS in selected emergency department (ED) indications and the basis for a rapid measurement protocol.

Objective

This narrative review is intended to clarify indications for OVS measurement, their performance, and interpretation.

Discussion

Phlebotomy studies indicate that OVS are more discriminating than supine vital signs in hypovolemia, but many findings, even some considered "positive", do not provide compelling evidence in favor of or against disease. Evaluated as a diagnostic test, they have a low yield and controversial criteria for a positive test, but as vital signs, they are useful for selected patients with frequent ED presentations-blood loss, dehydration, dizziness, weakness, and falls. Available evidence supports a rapid measurement protocol, including a 1-min interval after standing.

Conclusion

OVS are useful in selected patients, in a variety of frequent presentations, but their indications and implications for a patient's care are subject to physician interpretation. Given their ease of measurement and effect on decision-making, physicians may consider measuring them early in the evaluation of selected patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117AP6bq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^114kjarU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient information — definition, triggers, symptoms, and epidemiology are described: BPPV is "the most common inner ear problem and cause of vertigo", and "certain head positions or movements can trigger a spell". Common symptoms are "distinct triggered spells of vertigo or spinning sensations" with nausea, disorientation, and instability, and "these symptoms will be intense for seconds to minutes". In seniors, it can present as "an isolated sense of instability brought on by position change", and BPPV "does not affect your hearing or cause you to faint", with "the natural course of BPPV" being to "become less severe over time". BPPV is very common and "is more common in older people", with most cases occurring "for no reason" though associations include trauma, migraine, other inner ear problems, diabetes, osteoporosis, and prolonged bed rest. Mechanistically, BPPV occurs when inner ear calcium carbonate crystals become "unglued" and "float around and/or get stuck on sensors", and symptom intensity relates to how long the crystal/sensor takes "to settle after you move or change your head or body position".

Orthostatic hypotension, defined as a drop in blood pressure (BP) (systolic BP ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg) from the supine to standing position, was measured up to 5 times at 25-second intervals.

Main Outcomes and Measures

We determined the association of each of the 5 OH measurements with history of dizziness on standing (logistic regression) and risk of fall, fracture, syncope, motor vehicle crashes, and all-cause mortality (Cox regression) over a median of 23 years of follow-up (through December 31, 2013).

Results

In 11 429 participants (mean age, 54 years; 6220 [54%] were women; 2934 [26%] were black) with at least 4 OH measurements after standing, after adjustment OH assessed at measurement 1 (mean [SD], 28 [5.4] seconds; range, 21–62 seconds) was the only measurement associated with higher odds of dizziness (odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.18–1.89). Measurement 1 was associated with the highest rates of fracture, syncope, and death at 18.9, 17.0, and 31.4 per 1000 person-years. Measurement 2 was associated with the highest rate of falls and motor vehicle crashes at 13.2 and 2.5 per 1000 person-years. Furthermore, after adjustment measurement 1 was significantly associated with risk of fall (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.03–1.44), fracture (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01–1.34), syncope (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.20–1.63), and mortality (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.23–1.51). Measurement 2 (mean [SD], 53 [7.5] seconds; range, 43–83 seconds) was associated with all long-term outcomes, including motor vehicle crashes (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.04–1.96). Measurements obtained after 1 minute were not associated with dizziness and were inconsistently associated with individual long-term outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In contrast with prevailing recommendations, OH measurements performed within 1 minute of standing were the most strongly related to dizziness and individual adverse outcomes, suggesting that OH be assessed within 1 minute of standing.

ACC/AHA/HRS orthostatic tachycardia and hypotension definitions — orthostatic tachycardia is "A sustained increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 bpm within 10 min of moving from a recumbent to a quiet (nonexertional) standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12–19 y of age)". Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is "A drop in systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg with assumption of an upright posture". Initial (immediate) OH is "A transient BP decrease within 15 s after standing, with presyncope or syncope". Classic OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 min of assuming upright posture". Delayed OH is "A sustained reduction of systolic BP of ≥ 20 mm Hg (or 30 mm Hg in patients with supine hypertension) or diastolic BP of ≥ 10 mm Hg that takes ≥ 3 min of upright posture to develop", and "The fall in BP is usually gradual until reaching the threshold". Neurogenic OH is "A subtype of OH that is due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and not solely due to environmental triggers (such as dehydration or drugs)".

Reflex syncope and orthostatic intolerance — lifestyle management: The goal of therapy is primarily prevention of recurrence and associated injuries, and improvement in quality of life, but not to prolong survival. Since the 2004 guidelines, the greatest advances in treatment lie in the field of lifestyle measures, stemming from basic physiological knowledge and controlled trials. The cornerstone of the non-pharmacological management of patients with reflex syncope is education and reassurance regarding the benign nature of the condition, and initial treatment comprises education regarding awareness and possible avoidance of triggers, early recognition of prodromal symptoms, and performing manoeuvres to abort the episode such as supine posture and physical counterpressure manoeuvres (PCMs).

Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the more common causes of dizziness with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4% and accounts for 8% of individuals complaining of moderate or severe dizziness. It is generally recognized as the most common cause of peripheral vertigo. Robert Bárány, the namesake of the Bárány society, was the first to describe this condition over a century ago.

BPPV presents with attacks of vertigo lasting less than a minute or two, and it occurs with head movements including going from lying to sitting, sitting to lying, rolling over in bed, and looking up or down. They are not associated with any other neurologic or otologic symptoms. The Dix-Hallpike was the first positional maneuver described to diagnose posterior canal BPPV, which is characterized by a crescendo-decrescendo upbeat-torsional nystagmus that occurs after a brief latency.

The most common form of BPPV is canalithiasis, first described in 1979, where otoconia float freely as debris within the endolymphatic fluid of the semicircular canal. The less common cupulolithiasis was the originally proposed mechanism behind BPPV, where otoconia are adherent to the cupula itself rather than free floating. Beyond the above-mentioned posterior canal canalithiasis, we know the otoconia may end up in the lateral canal, which is characterized by a horizontal form of nystagmus in the supine position. This nystagmus may be geotropic, where there is a right-beat nystagmus on head to the right and a left-beat nystagmus with head to the left, or apogeotropic, which exhibits the opposite positional nystagmus pattern. Anterior canal involvement is rare, however the nystagmus associated with it is well described. During positional changes to test for BPPV due to cupulolithiasis, symptoms could be persistently ongoing since these heavy otoconia will continue to displace the cupula with respect to gravity in certain positions. Since the above, a variety of descriptions and localization of BPPV have emerged.

Methadone patient counseling — Patients should use other CNS depressants (especially benzodiazepines) with caution and only as directed by a healthcare provider, and should only use methadone in combination with other opioids as prescribed by a healthcare provider. The use of illicit drugs and/or alcohol with methadone may be fatal. Pain relief builds gradually and usually takes 5–7 days to see the full effects of a particular dose. Patients should tell all medical providers that they are taking methadone; adding medications or changing dosing of other medications can affect methadone and should be coordinated with the methadone prescriber. Patients should avoid activities requiring mental alertness or coordination (such as driving or using machinery) until the effects of methadone are realized, typically a week or longer, and should rise slowly from a sitting/supine position, as methadone may cause dizziness. Methadone, like other opioids, can cause significant constipation, and patients should take a prescribed laxative as directed. Patients should report any of the following symptoms immediately and/or seek urgent/emergent care: dizziness or lightheadedness, irregular heartbeat (palpitations), falls or near falls, chest pain/pressure, and shortness of breath. Patients should avoid abrupt discontinuation of methadone without first consulting a healthcare provider.

What should I avoid while using APOKYN?

Do not drink alcohol while you are using APOKYN. It can increase your chance of developing serious side effects.
Do not take medicines that make you sleepy while you are using APOKYN.
Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how APOKYN affects you.
Do not change your body position too fast. Get up slowly from sitting or lying. APOKYN can lower your blood pressure and cause dizziness or fainting.

What are the possible side effects of APOKYN?

APOKYN may cause serious side effects. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of the serious side effects, including:

allergic reaction. An allergic reaction with side effects of hives, itching, rash, swelling (e.g., eyes, tongue, etc.); trouble breathing and/or swallowing may occur after injecting APOKYN.
blood clots. Injecting APOKYN into a vein (intravenous) can cause blood clots. Do not inject APOKYN in your vein.
nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting, which may be severe, can happen with APOKYN. Your healthcare provider may prescribe a medicine to help decrease nausea and vomiting. Follow your healthcare providers instructions on how to take and when to stop this medicine.
sleepiness or falling asleep during the day. Some people treated with APOKYN may get sleepy during the day or fall asleep without warning while doing everyday activities such as talking, eating, or driving a car.
dizziness. APOKYN can lower your blood pressure and cause dizziness. Dizziness can happen when APOKYN treatment is started or when the APOKYN dose is increased. Do not get up too fast from sitting or after lying down, especially if you have been sitting or lying down for a long period of time.
falls. The changes that can happen with Parkinson's disease (PD), and the effects of some PD medicines, can increase the risk of falling. APOKYN may also increase your risk of falling.
hallucinations or psychotic-like behavior. APOKYN can cause or worsen psychotic-like behavior including hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real), confusion, excessive suspicion, aggressive behavior, agitation, delusional beliefs (believing things that are not real), and disorganized thinking.
sudden uncontrolled movements (dyskinesias). Some people with PD may get sudden, uncontrolled movements after treatment with some PD medicines. APOKYN can cause or make dyskinesias worse.
low red blood cells (hemolytic anemia). Tell your healthcare provider if you have any of the following signs or symptoms: you become pale, fast heartbeat, feel more tired or weaker than usual, skin or eyes look yellow, chest pain, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, dark-colored urine, fever, dizziness, or confusion.
intense urges. Some people with PD have reported new or increased gambling urges, increased sexual urges, and other intense urges, while taking PD medicines, including APOKYN.
heart problems. If you have shortness of breath, fast heartbeat, or chest pain while taking APOKYN, call your healthcare provider or get emergency help right away.
serious heart rhythm changes (QT prolongation). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have a change in your heartbeat (a fast or irregular heartbeat), or if you faint.
injection site problems. Bruising, swelling, and itching can happen at the site where you inject APOKYN.
fever and confusion. This can happen in some people when their PD medicine is stopped or there is a fast decrease in the dose of their PD medicine.
tissue changes (fibrotic complications). Some people have had changes in the tissues of their pelvis, lungs, and heart valves when taking medicines called nonergot derived dopamine agonists like APOKYN.
prolonged painful erections (priaprism). APOKYN may cause prolonged, painful erections in some people. If you have an erection that lasts more than 4 hours you should call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.
swelling of ankles/legs. APOKYN may cause swelling, especially in the ankles or legs. Tell your healthcare provider if you notice any swelling.

Patients in each of these groups have a higher risk of OH/nOH when compared to the normal population.

For these five categories of patients, clinicians should ask about cardinal symptoms of OH, their frequency and severity, how long they can stand, and the effect of symptoms on their activities of daily living. Questions about symptoms should also note the time of day when the symptoms occur, as symptoms of OH/nOH are most likely to occur in the morning and after meals. A more complete list of questions to use when screening patients for OH/nOH is presented in Table 1. If a patient gives a positive response to one or more of the questions listed in Table 1, they should be considered as being at risk for OH/nOH and a more complete evaluation including orthostatic vital signs needs to be conducted to confirm a diagnosis of OH/nOH. From a practical standpoint, at the minimum, the patient should be asked a variation of question 10 "Do you have symptoms when you stand up or within 3–5 min of standing and get better when you sit or lay down?" Because falls are of such consequence to aging patients, a specific question about circumstances of falls is appropriate. Clinicians must recognize that some patients are reluctant to admit symptoms of OH or falls, fearing that they may lose their autonomy due to family member insistence on enhancing their safety.

### Orthostatic hypotension: a practical approach [^113612CJ]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a decrease in blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more systolic or 10 mm Hg or more diastolic within three minutes of standing from the supine position or on assuming a head-up position of at least 60 degrees during tilt table testing. Symptoms are due to inadequate physiologic compensation and organ hypoperfusion and include headache, lightheadedness, shoulder and neck pain (coat hanger syndrome), visual disturbances, dyspnea, and chest pain. Prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in the community setting is 20% in older adults and 5% in middle-aged adults. Risk factors such as diabetes mellitus increase the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in all age groups. Orthostatic hypotension is associated with a significant increase in cardiovascular risk and falls, and up to a 50% increase in relative risk of all-cause mortality. Diagnosis is confirmed by performing a bedside simplified Schellong test, which consists of blood pressure and heart rate measurements after five minutes in the supine position and three minutes after moving to a standing position. If the patient is unable to stand safely or the clinical suspicion for orthostatic hypotension is high despite normal findings on the bedside test, head-up tilt table testing is recommended. Orthostatic hypotension is classified as neurogenic or nonneurogenic, depending on etiology and heart rate response. Treatment goals for orthostatic hypotension are reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. Initial treatment focuses on the underlying cause and adjusting potentially causative medications. Nonpharmacologic strategies include dietary modifications, compression garments, physical maneuvers, and avoiding environments that exacerbate symptoms. First-line medications include midodrine and droxidopa. Although fludrocortisone improves symptoms, it has concerning long-term effects.

### Epley maneuver, performed by family doctors or emergency physicians, for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in adults [^1157B8C3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Typical clinical symptoms (vertigo) and signs (nystagmus)

The typical symptomatology of BPPV is a spinning sensation of oneself or the environment in the absence of true movement (Bösner 2018), characteristically of sudden onset, paroxysmal, and transitory, lasting less than one minute (Giardino 2021). It is usually triggered by changes in head position, for example, lying down, sitting, or turning over in bed (Bhattacharyya 2017; Giardino 2021). It may be associated with feeling faint, nausea or vomiting, sweating, skin pallor, and hypotension (Von Brevern 2007).

Nystagmus appearing on the DHT has two typical features: a latency period of about five to 20 seconds and fatigability within 60 seconds of onset (although repeating the maneuver to test for fatigability is not recommended). In cases of cupulolithiasis, the nystagmus may last for more than one minute. This nystagmus is a torsional and vertical movement (often described as horizonto‐rotatory) that usually begins smoothly, increases in intensity, and then decreases as it resolves. When the person sits up, a nystagmus in the opposite direction may appear.

There are two types of nystagmus. Geotropic nystagmus is the most frequent and the one that beats more strongly towards the dependent (affected) ear. In these cases, calcium carbonate debris is found in the long arm of the semicircular canal. In contrast, apogeotropic type nystagmus is less frequent and the cephalic rotation test produces a horizontal nystagmus that beats towards the upper ear. In these cases, calcium carbonate debris is located adherent to the cupula (cupulolithiasis) or near the ampulla of the semicircular canal (Bhattacharyya 2017; Epley 1980; Parnes 2009).

### Common syndromes of orthostatic intolerance [^114ZmB6w]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The autonomic nervous system, adequate blood volume, and intact skeletal and respiratory muscle pumps are essential components for rapid cardiovascular adjustments to upright posture (orthostasis). Patients lacking sufficient blood volume or having defective sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstriction develop orthostatic hypotension (OH), prohibiting effective upright activities. OH is one form of orthostatic intolerance (OI) defined by signs, such as hypotension, and symptoms, such as lightheadedness, that occur when upright and are relieved by recumbence. Mild OI is commonly experienced during intercurrent illnesses and when standing up rapidly. The latter is denoted "initial OH" and represents a normal cardiovascular adjustment to the blood volume shifts during standing. Some people experience episodic acute OI, such as postural vasovagal syncope (fainting), or chronic OI, such as postural tachycardia syndrome, which can significantly reduce quality of life. The lifetime incidence of ≥ 1 fainting episodes is ∼40%. For the most part, these episodes are benign and self-limited, although frequent syncope episodes can be debilitating, and injury may occur from sudden falls. In this article, mechanisms for OI having components of adrenergic hypofunction, adrenergic hyperfunction, hyperpnea, and regional blood volume redistribution are discussed. Therapeutic strategies to cope with OI are proposed.

### Ropinirole hydrochloride [^1134UQ9P]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENT INFORMATION

Ropinirole tablets (roe pin' i role"), USP

People with RLS should take ropinirole tablets differently than people with Parkinson's disease (see "How should I take ropinirole tablets for RLS?" for the recommended dosing for RLS). A lower dose of ropinirole tablet is generally needed for people with RLS, and is taken once daily before bedtime.

What is the most important information I should know about ropinirole tablets?

Ropinirole tablets can cause serious side effects, including:

Falling asleep during normal activities. You may fall asleep while doing normal activities such as driving a car, doing physical tasks, or using hazardous machinery while taking ropinirole tablets. You may suddenly fall asleep without being drowsy or without warning. This may result in having accidents. Your chances of falling asleep while doing normal activities while taking ropinirole tablets are greater if you take other medicines that cause drowsiness. Tell your healthcare provider right away if this happens. Before starting ropinirole tablets, be sure to tell your healthcare provider if you take any medicines that make you drowsy.
Fainting. Fainting can happen, and sometimes your heart rate may be decreased. This can happen especially when you start taking ropinirole tablets or your dose is increased. Tell your healthcare provider if you faint, feel dizzy, or feel light-headed.
Decrease in blood pressure. Ropinirole tablets can decrease your blood pressure (hypotension), especially when you start taking ropinirole tablets or when your dose is changed. If you feel faint or feel dizzy, nauseated, or sweaty when you stand up from sitting or lying down (orthostatic hypotension), this may mean that your blood pressure is decreased. When you change position from lying down or sitting to standing up, you should do it carefully and slowly. Call your healthcare provider if you have any of the symptoms of decreased blood pressure listed above.
Hallucinations and other psychotic-like behavior. Ropinirole tablets can cause or worsen psychotic-like behavior including hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not real), confusion, excessive suspicion, aggressive behavior, agitation, delusional beliefs (believing things that are not real), and disorganized thinking. If you have hallucinations or any of these other psychotic-like changes, talk with your healthcare provider.
Unusual urges. Some patients taking ropinirole tablets get urges to behave in a way unusual for them. Examples of this are an unusual urge to gamble, increased sexual urges and behaviors, or an uncontrollable urge to shop, spend money, or eat. If you notice or your family notices that you are developing any unusual behaviors, talk to your healthcare provider.
Withdrawal Symptoms. Ropinirole tablets are dopamine agonist medicines. Dopamine agonist medicines, including ropinirole tablets can cause withdrawal symptoms as your dose is slowly lowered (tapered) or when treatment with ropinirole tablets is stopped. Tell your doctor right away if you get any of the following withdrawal symptoms:

Autonomic/exertional tolerance impairments — physical therapists should test for orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysfunction by evaluating heart rate and blood pressure in supine, sitting, and standing positions, and should conduct a symptom-guided, graded exertional tolerance test for patients reporting exertional intolerance, dizziness, headache, and/or a desire to return to high-level exertional activities, tailoring timing, modality, and protocol to optimize safety; for patients highly symptomatic at rest, the test should be delayed until symptoms are stable and more tolerable at rest, and clinicians may postpone testing if other symptoms and impairments are of higher priority; testing modality and protocol should be based on clinical judgment, patient comfort, and equipment availability, with heart rate and blood pressure monitored periodically throughout and afterward with symptom and rating-of-perceived-exertion responses; if vestibulo-oculomotor or cervical spine impairments or symptoms are present, a stationary bicycle should be used to reduce the risk of exacerbating impairments or compromising validity; clinicians may use orthostatic/autonomic assessments and symptom-guided graded exertional tolerance tests even when exertional intolerance is not reported to help determine contributions of autonomic dysfunction, deconditioning, or fitness to symptoms, and may conduct exertional tests in such patients to rule out subtle autonomic dysfunction, establish initial postconcussion performance level, and identify exertional targets for aerobic exercise training that may promote brain health and healing.

### Post-COVID-19 dizziness associated with a patulous eustachian tube [^115WUPc5]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Dizziness following a SARS-CoV-2 infection can arise from a variety of causes. Dizziness is a frequently described symptom of long COVID, but is usually one of the multiple symptoms and is rarely seen as the sole symptom of long COVID. Dysautonomia, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), can lead to dizziness on standing due to abnormal heart rate and blood pressure regulation, but the patient did not experience any POTS symptoms, and dizziness occurred irrespective of standing up or sitting.

Common causes of dizziness, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and vestibular neuronitis, have already been excluded by medical history and examination. Medication side effects can sometimes also induce dizziness, but this seemed unlikely to be induced by nasal corticosteroids, also because dizziness presented weeks before the patient started taking medication. A CT scan ruled out the presence of a third window anomaly, and the patient's symptoms were not consistent with those typically associated with third window syndromes such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence. Also, there were no signs of a perilymphatic fistula, except for the dizziness that was associated with changes in middle ear pressure.

A potential cause of dizziness in this patient came from the diagnosed PET and the observation that dizziness was only present on nasal respiration. The highly specific presentation of vestibulo-visual symptoms triggered by nasal respiration, but not by oral respiration or breath-holding, made this case stand out as a unique set of complaints, with the exception of the previously mentioned case report.

### A new diagnostic approach to the adult patient with acute dizziness [^113wqDst]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Dizziness, a common chief complaint, has an extensive differential diagnosis that includes both benign and serious conditions. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients with self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment.

Objective Of The Review

This article presents a new approach to diagnosis of the acutely dizzy patient that emphasizes different aspects of the history to guide a focused physical examination with the goal of differentiating benign peripheral vestibular conditions from dangerous posterior circulation strokes in the emergency department.

Discussion

Currently, misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic testing costs are high. This relates in part to use of an outdated, prevalent, diagnostic paradigm. The traditional approach, which relies on dizziness symptom quality or type (i.e., vertigo, presyncope, or disequilibrium) to guide inquiry, does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes, and is inconsistent with current best evidence. A new approach divides patients into three key categories using timing and triggers, guiding a differential diagnosis and targeted bedside examination protocol: 1) acute vestibular syndrome, where bedside physical examination differentiates vestibular neuritis from stroke; 2) spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, where associated symptoms help differentiate vestibular migraine from transient ischemic attack; and 3) triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, where the Dix-Hallpike and supine roll test help differentiate benign paroxysmal positional vertigo from posterior fossa structural lesions.

Conclusions

The timing and triggers diagnostic approach for the acutely dizzy patient derives from current best evidence and offers the potential to reduce misdiagnosis while simultaneously decreases diagnostic test overuse, unnecessary hospitalization, and incorrect treatments.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) definition — POTS is "a clinical syndrome usually characterized by (1) frequent symptoms that occur with standing", with physiologic criteria including "an increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 beats per minute (bpm) when moving from a recumbent to a standing position (or ≥ 40 bpm in individuals 12 to 19 years of age)" and "the absence of orthostatic hypotension (> 20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure)". The standing heart rate in POTS "is often ≥ 120 bpm, and undergoes greater increases in the morning than in the evening", and orthostatic heart rate increases "gradually decrease with age and not abruptly at age 20". The document also notes that "the diagnoses of POTS and vasovagal syncope are not mutually exclusive".

Barrier 6: limited spinal mobility

Reduced mobility of the thoracic spine, back pain and a kyphosis can all limit the appropriate positioning during manoeuvres. In addition, orthopnoea can limit manoeuvres involving the supine position.

Solution (posterior canal):

The side lying test avoids these difficulties and has been found to be a sensitive test for anterior and posterior canals. It avoids extension of the back and neck and uses lateral flexion with rotation instead (Figure 2).
As mentioned earlier, there is also reduced load on the clinician as the patient may be able to assist in the movement. If the side lying test is positive, the Semont manoeuvre can be used as an alternative treatment to the Epley. This involves moving the patient from lying on one side, to sitting upright and lying down on their other side, whilst maintaining 45° rotation of neck away from affected side.
If necessary, the side lying test can be modified with additional head down positioning if there is insufficient lateral flexion of the spine to achieve downward angle of the head to 20–30° (Figure 5, online video 4).

### Risperidone (Risperdal CONSTA) [^112RWjv2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Orthostatic Hypotension

RISPERDAL CONSTA may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia, and in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period with oral risperidone, probably reflecting its alpha-adrenergic antagonistic properties. Syncope was reported in 0.8% (12/1499 patients) of patients treated with RISPERDAL CONSTA in multiple-dose studies. Patients should be instructed in nonpharmacologic interventions that help to reduce the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension (e.g., sitting on the edge of the bed for several minutes before attempting to stand in the morning and slowly rising from a seated position).

RISPERDAL CONSTA should be used with particular caution in (1) patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, and conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension, e.g., dehydration and hypovolemia, and (2) in the elderly and patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered in all such patients, and a dose reduction should be considered if hypotension occurs. Clinically significant hypotension has been observed with concomitant use of oral RISPERDAL and antihypertensive medication.

5.8 Falls

Somnolence, postural hypotension, motor and sensory instability have been reported with the use of antipsychotics, including RISPERDAL CONSTA, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other fall-related injuries. For patients, particularly the elderly, with diseases, conditions, or medications that could exacerbate these effects, assess the risk of falls when initiating antipsychotic treatment and recurrently for patients on long-term antipsychotic therapy.

Postural (orthostatic) hypotension

A standard definition for postural hypotension, agreed by a multidisciplinary consensus conference is used: "postural or orthostatic hypotension, defined as a sustained reduction of systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg or a drop in systolic blood pressure to below 100 mmHg, or a reduction of diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg within 3 min of standing ". PreFIT participants are screened by asking if they ever feel dizzy or light-headed if they stand up too quickly or first thing in the morning getting out of bed (Table 2). Lying and standing blood pressure is taken on all trial participants, regardless of history of dizziness, using a calibrated manual or electronic sphygmomanometer. The radial pulse is taken for 1 min and electrocardiogram (ECG) taken if the participant has an irregular pulse, bradycardia or tachycardia. Participants are asked to report the presence of dizziness or light-headedness during the standing phase. Symptomatic patients only are given a PreFIT postural hypotension leaflet that provides advice about changing position, fluid intake, tightening calves when getting up from a lying position etc. Onward referral is made to the GP or consultant-led falls clinic if any cardiac problem is suspected (Table 2).

### Association of symptomatic dizziness with all-cause and cause-specific mortality [^115jRkWA]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Dizziness is a highly prevalent complaint with wide-ranging causes and resultant morbidity. Whether symptomatic dizziness and its various manifestations are associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality is unknown.

Objective

To examine the associations of symptomatic dizziness and its manifestations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study is a mortality follow-up study based on the 1999–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The study cohort included adults 40 years and older who completed questions about symptomatic dizziness, including problems with dizziness, balance, falling, and positional dizziness, within the past 12 months. Respondents were linked to mortality data through December 31, 2019. Data were analyzed from February to August 2023.

Exposure

Self-reported symptomatic dizziness.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause and cause-specific (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and unintentional injuries) mortality. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to examine associations between symptomatic dizziness and all-cause and cause-specific mortality while adjusting for demographics and medical history.

Results

In this nationally representative cohort of 9000 middle-aged and older US adults (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [13.8] years; 4570 [50.8%] female), prevalence of symptomatic dizziness was 23.8%. Specifically, 18.3% reported problems with dizziness, 14.5% reported problems with balance, 5.7% reported problems with falling, and 3.8% reported dizziness when turning in bed (positional dizziness). At a median (range) of 16.2 (0.1–20.6) years of follow-up, all-cause mortality for adults with symptomatic dizziness was higher than for those without (45.6% vs 27.1%). Symptomatic dizziness was associated with elevated risk for cause-specific mortality from diabetes (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% CI, 1.23–2.25), cardiovascular disease (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.12–1.55), and cancer (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.99–1.47) but not unintentional injuries (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.51–1.88). Reporting problems with balance or falling was associated with increased all-cause mortality (balance: HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17–1.39; and falling: HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.33–1.73), cardiovascular disease-specific mortality (balance: HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.20–1.66; and falling: HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.15–1.94), and diabetes-specific mortality risks (balance: HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26–2.39; and falling: HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.26–3.18). There was no association between positional dizziness and mortality (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.82–1.19).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study, symptomatic dizziness was associated with increased risk for all-cause and diabetes-, cardiovascular disease-, and cancer-specific mortality. The imprecision of the effect size estimate for cancer-specific mortality prevents making a definitive conclusion. Future studies are needed to determine whether symptomatic dizziness indicates underlying health conditions contributing to mortality or if early intervention for imbalance and falls can reduce mortality risk.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure treatment on orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and individual participant-based meta-analysis [^113fpocK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although intensive blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment reduces risk for cardiovascular disease, there are concerns that it might cause orthostatic hypotension (OH).

Purpose

To examine the effects of intensive BP-lowering treatment on OH in hypertensive adults.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception through 7 October 2019, without language restrictions.

Study Selection

Randomized trials of BP pharmacologic treatment (more intensive BP goal or active agent) that involved more than 500 adults with hypertension or elevated BP and that were 6 months or longer in duration. Trial comparisons were groups assigned to either less intensive BP goals or placebo, and the outcome was measured OH, defined as a decrease of 20 mm Hg or more in systolic BP or 10 mm Hg or more in diastolic BP after changing position from seated to standing.

Data Extraction

2 investigators independently abstracted articles and rated risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

5 trials examined BP treatment goals, and 4 examined active agents versus placebo. Trials examining BP treatment goals included 18 466 participants with 127 882 follow-up visits. Trials were open-label, with minimal heterogeneity of effects across trials. Intensive BP treatment lowered risk for OH (odds ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.99]). Effects did not differ by prerandomization OH (P for interaction = 0.80). In sensitivity analyses that included 4 additional placebo-controlled trials, overall and subgroup findings were unchanged.

Limitations

Assessments of OH were done while participants were seated (not supine) and did not include the first minute after standing. Data on falls and syncope were not available.

Conclusion

Intensive BP-lowering treatment decreases risk for OH. Orthostatic hypotension, before or in the setting of more intensive BP treatment, should not be viewed as a reason to avoid or de-escalate treatment for hypertension.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

LUCEMYRA may mitigate, but not completely prevent, the symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may include feeling sick, stomach cramps, muscle spasms or twitching, feeling of cold, heart pounding, muscular tension, aches and pains, yawning, runny eyes and sleep problems (insomnia). Patients should be advised that withdrawal will not be easy. Additional supportive measures should be clearly advised, as needed.

Hypotension and Bradycardia

Inform patients to be alert for any symptoms of low blood pressure or pulse (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, or feelings of faintness at rest or upon abruptly standing). Advise patients on how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position).

Patients being given LUCEMYRA in an outpatient setting should be capable of and instructed on self-monitoring for hypotension, orthostasis, and bradycardia and advised to withhold LUCEMYRA doses and contact their healthcare provider for instructions if they experience these signs or related symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated, which may potentially increase the risks of hypotension and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Concomitant Medications

Review with patients all concomitant medications being taken and request that they immediately inform their healthcare provider of any changes in concomitant medications, including any other medications that may be used to treat individual symptoms of withdrawal.

Increased Risk of CNS Depression with Concomitant use of CNS Depressant Drugs

Inform patients of the increased risk of CNS depression with concomitant use of benzodiazepines, alcohol, barbiturates, or other sedating drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Advise patients using LUCEMYRA in an outpatient setting that, until they learn how they respond to LUCEMYRA, they should be careful or avoid doing activities such as driving or operating heavy machinery.

Sudden Discontinuation of LUCEMYRA

Inform patients not to discontinue LUCEMYRA without consulting their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

### Consensus statement on the definition of orthostatic hypertension endorsed by the American autonomic society and the Japanese society of hypertension [^113gBUb7]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

We propose a consensus definition of "an exaggerated orthostatic pressor response" in subjects in whom systolic blood pressure increases ≥ 20mmHg when going from the supine to standing posture. This definition can be extended for seated to standing measurements. We reserve the term "orthostatic hypertension" if this pressor response leads to an upright systolic blood pressure ≥ 140mmHg. We believe this consensus definition will help in the study of the pathophysiology, clinical impact, and potential treatment of these entities, and the identification of patients that are at greater cardiovascular risk.

5.4 Symptomatic Hypotension

Dopaminergic agonists, in clinical studies and clinical experience, appear to impair the systemic regulation of blood pressure, resulting in postural/orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation. Parkinson's disease patients, in addition, appear to have an impaired capacity to respond to a postural challenge. For these reasons, both Parkinson's and Restless Legs Syndrome patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists ordinarily (1) require careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of postural hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and (2) should be informed of this risk.

An increased risk for decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed when supine, standing, and changing from supine to standing position in patients treated with NEUPRO. In patients taking the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, orthostatic (change from supine to standing) decreases in systolic blood pressure (at least 20 mm Hg or greater) was 16% for NEUPRO and 14% for placebo in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, 32% for NEUPRO and 27% for placebo in patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 13% for NEUPRO and 11% for placebo in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome.

More severe decreases in systolic blood pressure (40 mm Hg or greater) and in diastolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg or greater) also occurred more frequently (NEUPRO incidence at least 2% greater than placebo) in patients with early- and advanced-stage Parkinson's disease during measurements when supine, standing, or changing from supine to standing position. Patients experienced dose-related decreases in blood pressure at different times throughout the trial including the final visit.

An analysis using a variety of adverse reaction terms suggestive of orthostatic hypotension, including dizziness/postural dizziness and others, showed an increased risk for all patients treated with NEUPRO. For the maximum recommended NEUPRO dose, the incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of hypotension/orthostatic hypotension was 29% for NEUPRO and 11% for placebo in early-stage Parkinson's disease, 27% for NEUPRO and 23% for placebo in advanced-stage Parkinson's disease, and 8% for NEUPRO and 7% for placebo in Restless Legs Syndrome.

This increased risk for symptomatic hypotension and decreases in blood pressure was observed in a setting in which patients were very carefully titrated, and patients with clinically relevant cardiovascular disease or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension at baseline had been excluded from this study. The increased risk for significant decreases in blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension occurred especially in the dose escalation/titration period.

### Syndromes of orthostatic intolerance: a hidden danger [^1149XgjG]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a relatively common heterogenous and multifactorial disorder, traditionally classified as neurogenic (less common but often more severe) or nonneurogenic (more common, with no direct signs of autonomic nervous system disease). The different clinical variants of orthostatic intolerance include initial, classical and delayed OH as well as postural tachycardia syndrome. Orthostatic instability may induce syncopal attacks either alone or in combination with other mechanisms, and is often dismissed as a precipitating factor. Moreover, prevalent OH is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, and the majority of patients with OH are asymptomatic or have few nonspecific symptoms. Management of symptomatic orthostatic intolerance includes both nonpharmacological and pharmacological methods, but it is not always successful and may lead to complications. Future studies of OH should focus on mechanisms that lead to neurogenic and nonneurogenic OH, novel diagnostic methods and more effective therapeutic modalities.

### Orthostatic hypotension: management of a complex, but common, medical problem [^115w65E6]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH), a common, often overlooked, disorder with many causes, is associated with debilitating symptoms, falls, syncope, cognitive impairment, and risk of death. Chronic OH, a cardinal sign of autonomic dysfunction, increases with advancing age and is commonly associated with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and kidney failure. Management typically involves a multidisciplinary, patient-centered, approach to arrive at an appropriate underlying diagnosis that is causing OH, treating accompanying conditions, and providing individually tailored pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment. We propose a novel streamlined pathophysiological classification of OH; review the relationship between the cardiovascular disease continuum and OH; discuss OH-mediated end-organ damage; provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms to guide clinical decision making and patient care; identify current gaps in knowledge and try to define future research directions. Using a case-based learning approach, specific clinical scenarios are presented highlighting various presentations of OH to provide a practical guide to evaluate and manage patients who have OH.

Distinguishing BPPV from other disorders can often be achieved by positional test responses. Most of these other disorders can be further distinguished from BPPV based on the responses to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and the supine roll test, and clinicians should remain alert for concurrent diagnoses accompanying BPPV, especially in patients with a mixed clinical presentation.
