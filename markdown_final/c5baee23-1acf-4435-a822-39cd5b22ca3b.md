## Question

How long should anticoagulation be continued for history of PE?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to continue anticoagulation after a pulmonary embolism, and how to individualize that decision by risk category, bleeding considerations, and special situations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal minimum duration of therapeutic anticoagulation. Then, I should classify the PE as provoked versus unprovoked and appraise how that drives recurrence risk. Next, I will apply major guideline recommendations for each category, integrate bleeding risk into shared decision-making, and review the evidence for extended therapy. After that, I need to examine special scenarios like active cancer, recurrent VTE, pregnancy, and thrombophilia testing. Finally, I will synthesize practical, patient-centered recommendations and close with monitoring and reassessment advice, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality sources such as ESC 2019, ASH 2020, CHEST 2016, and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the universal baseline: every patient with acute PE should receive therapeutic anticoagulation for at least 3 months in the absence of a contraindication, because shorter durations are inferior and increase recurrence without improving bleeding outcomes. I initially thought some guidelines allowed shorter than 3 months, but wait, I should verify that — ESC 2019 explicitly recommends a minimum of 3 months for all PE, and CHEST/ASH concur, so 3 months is the floor, not negotiable [^1142oMtm] [^111ojjh2] [^117T3ypv].

> Next, I should review the core classification that governs duration: PE can be provoked by a major transient risk factor (most commonly surgery), provoked by a minor transient risk factor (e.g., travel, estrogen), or unprovoked. Importantly, unprovoked PE carries substantially higher long-term recurrence risk than provoked PE, and that risk profile dictates whether we stop at 3 months or extend indefinitely, so I need to ensure I classify the index event correctly before proceeding [^116etbCj] [^1157N3ai].

> For a first PE provoked by a major transient factor, I should confirm the standard: stop anticoagulation after 3 months. Extending beyond 3 months does not improve outcomes and increases bleeding, and guidelines uniformly recommend discontinuation at 3 months if the provoking factor is no longer present, which aligns with both CHEST and ESC positions [^111j9qxg] [^1111m3zs].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do with nonsurgical transient triggers. CHEST advises 3 months for PE provoked by a nonsurgical transient factor and favors stopping over extending unless bleeding risk is very low and patient preference strongly favors continuation, so the default remains 3 months, with individualized exceptions, which I need to document clearly with the patient [^117MpZ4U] [^111oX5ga].

> For unprovoked PE, let me think about the competing risks: the annual recurrence risk off therapy is roughly 10% in the first 1–2 years and remains meaningful thereafter, while extended anticoagulation reduces recurrences by 80–90% but increases bleeding. Thus, in patients with low or moderate bleeding risk, extended (often indefinite) anticoagulation is favored, whereas in high bleeding risk, stopping at 3 months is preferred, with aspirin considered if anticoagulation is stopped, though anticoagulation is more effective than aspirin for prevention [^1157N3ai] [^114z8hnr] [^114BZgG8].

> Wait, let me verify a potential point of confusion: some clinicians interpret "extended" as 6–12 additional months. However, guidelines increasingly frame "extended" as indefinite continuation with periodic reassessment rather than a fixed 6–12 month course, and the PADIS-PE randomized trial showed that adding 18 months of warfarin after 6 months reduced recurrence during treatment but lost benefit after cessation, reinforcing that the decision is best framed as stop at 3 months versus continue indefinitely, reassessed annually [^111A5Y8X] [^114z8hnr] [^117D9sTx].

> I should double-check how bleeding risk modifies this: for high bleeding risk (e.g. HAS-BLED ≥ 3 or major bleeding history), stopping at 3 months is recommended. For low or moderate bleeding risk, extended therapy is reasonable. Shared decision-making is essential, and I should also remember that during extended therapy the observed annual major bleeding risk is low but not negligible, and recurrence during extended therapy is uncommon but possible, which should be discussed transparently [^111vmyRe] [^112gwswZ].

> Now, let me consider special populations. For active cancer, indefinite anticoagulation is recommended unless bleeding risk is high, and low molecular weight heparin remains first-line in many guidelines, with DOACs as acceptable alternatives in selected patients. I need to ensure oncology input and monitor closely for interactions and cytopenias [^1158hVBk] [^113svGKB].

> For recurrent unprovoked VTE, I should confirm that indefinite anticoagulation is recommended, given the very high recurrence risk off therapy. I initially almost said "lifetime for all", but wait, I should be precise: guidelines say indefinite continuation with periodic reassessment, not necessarily immutable lifetime therapy, which leaves room to revisit if risks or preferences change over time [^111kEZye] [^117D9sTx].

> Pregnancy is another area where I need to check specifics. Anticoagulation should continue throughout pregnancy and for at least 6 weeks postpartum, typically with LMWH, and then the duration after pregnancy should be reclassified based on whether the PE was provoked or unprovoked, which I should plan proactively with obstetrics [^111mAF5b].

> Thrombophilia testing deserves careful handling. I should avoid routine testing to guide duration after unprovoked VTE because it rarely changes management, but I may consider testing in selected scenarios such as VTE provoked by a nonsurgical transient factor, young age with strong family history, or suspected heparin resistance. Even if a thrombophilia is found, the decision to extend should still be anchored in global recurrence and bleeding risk, not the label alone [^117Nddpd] [^1166o5ex] [^116f8V9x].

> Next, I should review tools that sometimes sway decisions. Although D-dimer measured one month after stopping and sex have been used to inform recurrence risk, guidelines caution against relying on prognostic scores, D-dimer, or residual vein thrombosis to dictate duration in unprovoked VTE, so I should use these judiciously and not over-interpret them in isolation [^111A4Z7B] [^111vmyRe].

> I will now examine the strength of evidence for extended therapy. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that extended anticoagulation reduces recurrent VTE by about 80–90% at the cost of more bleeding, and importantly, benefit accrues during treatment but often wanes after stopping, which explains why the clinical question is framed as indefinite continuation versus stopping, rather than simply extending for a fixed extra interval [^111A5Y8X] [^1157N3ai] [^112gwswZ].

> But wait, what if the patient strongly prefers to stop at 3 months despite unprovoked PE and low bleeding risk? I should document that preference, consider aspirin as a modest-risk-reduction alternative, and ensure close follow-up with a low threshold to resume anticoagulation if new risk factors emerge or D-dimer is positive after stopping, recognizing aspirin is less effective than anticoagulation but better than nothing when anticoagulation is unacceptable [^114BZgG8] [^111vmyRe].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations: for a first PE provoked by a major transient factor, stop at 3 months. For a first PE provoked by a minor transient factor, default to 3 months but consider individualized extension if bleeding risk is low and patient preference supports it. For unprovoked PE, favor indefinite anticoagulation if bleeding risk is low or moderate, and stop at 3 months if bleeding risk is high, with annual reassessment of risks, benefits, and patient values guiding continuation or cessation [^1111m3zs] [^114z8hnr] [^111vmyRe].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and monitoring are explicit: at 3 months, I should review bleeding history, renal function, drug interactions, and patient preferences. If continuing anticoagulation, I should reassess annually for bleeding, falls, malignancy, surgery, and changing values. If stopping, I should consider D-dimer around one month after cessation in select cases and maintain vigilance for recurrence, adjusting plans as the risk-benefit balance evolves over time [^117D9sTx] [^111vmyRe] [^116zNBYV].

The duration of anticoagulation after pulmonary embolism (PE) is guided by whether the event was provoked or unprovoked, and by the patient's bleeding risk [^115sm5Zz]. For provoked PE, treat for **3 months** [^111rJyQH] [^111oX5ga] and stop if the provoking factor has resolved [^113CFVqY]. For unprovoked PE, treat for **at least 3 months** [^111ojjh2] and consider indefinite therapy if bleeding risk is low or moderate [^111vmyRe]; if bleeding risk is high, stop at 3 months [^114TrNWt]. For recurrent PE or active cancer, continue anticoagulation indefinitely unless bleeding risk is unacceptable [^111kEZye] [^1158hVBk]. Reassess annually [^117D9sTx] and tailor decisions to patient preference and clinical context [^116zNBYV].

---

## Classification of pulmonary embolism

PE is classified as **provoked** or **unprovoked** based on the presence of identifiable risk factors:

- **Provoked PE**: Associated with a transient or reversible risk factor (e.g. surgery, trauma, immobilization, estrogen therapy, pregnancy) [^114eY82s].
- **Unprovoked PE**: Occurs without identifiable risk factors, indicating an underlying thrombophilic tendency or unknown cause [^114eY82s].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation for provoked PE

For provoked PE, the recommended duration is **3 months** [^1111m3zs] of therapeutic anticoagulation if the provoking factor has resolved [^114eY82s]. Extended therapy beyond 3 months is not recommended unless the patient has a history of prior unprovoked VTE or chronic risk factors [^112XoZJD] [^116QLqVS].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation for unprovoked PE

For unprovoked PE, treat for **at least 3 months** [^111ojjh2]. After 3 months, the decision to continue anticoagulation indefinitely depends on the patient's bleeding risk and preferences:

- **Low or moderate bleeding risk**: Consider indefinite anticoagulation [^111vmyRe] to reduce recurrence risk [^117Kf97r].
- **High bleeding risk**: Stop anticoagulation at 3 months [^114TrNWt].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation for recurrent PE

For recurrent PE, continue **indefinite anticoagulation** [^111kEZye] unless bleeding risk is unacceptable [^111vmyRe].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation in patients with active cancer

For patients with active cancer, continue **indefinite anticoagulation** [^1158hVBk] unless bleeding risk is high [^1158hVBk].

---

## Role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)

DOACs (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) are effective and safe alternatives to **warfarin** for PE treatment and secondary prevention [^113CFVqY]. They offer advantages such as fixed dosing, **no routine laboratory monitoring**, and a lower risk of intracranial bleeding [^notfound]. Extended therapy with DOACs effectively **reduces recurrence** [^116kMtrw] with acceptable bleeding risk [^116kMtrw].

---

## Individualized decision-making

The duration of anticoagulation should be **individualized** [^116zNBYV], considering:

- **Recurrence risk**: Based on provocation status, prior VTE, and patient-specific factors [^115sm5Zz].
- **Bleeding risk**: Assessed using validated tools (e.g. HAS-BLED, VTE-BLEED) [^111RKRf2].
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential [^116zNBYV].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Provoked PE (resolved factor) | 3 months | Stop after 3 months [^1111m3zs] |
| Unprovoked PE (low/moderate bleeding risk) | Indefinite | Consider indefinite anticoagulation [^114z8hnr] |
| Unprovoked PE (high bleeding risk) | 3 months | Stop after 3 months [^114TrNWt] |
| Recurrent PE | Indefinite | Continue indefinitely [^114BZgG8] |
| Active cancer | Indefinite | Continue indefinitely [^1158hVBk] |

---

The duration of anticoagulation after PE is determined by whether the event was provoked or unprovoked, the presence of ongoing risk factors, and the patient's bleeding risk. For provoked PE, **3 months** is sufficient if the provoking factor has resolved [^1111m3zs]. For unprovoked PE, treat for at least 3 months and consider indefinite therapy if bleeding risk is low or moderate [^111vmyRe]. For recurrent PE or active cancer, continue indefinitely unless bleeding risk is high [^1158hVBk].

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a common, potentially fatal yet treatable condition. After short term oral anticoagulant treatment, the risk of recurrent VTE after discontinuing anticoagulants is variable, depending on the presence or absence of provoking factors at the time of the initial event. Some patient subgroups with major provoking factors (eg, post-surgical VTE) have a low risk of recurrent VTE (1% at one year)and anticoagulants can be safely discontinued after short term treatment. However, more than 50% of patients with VTE do not have a major provoking factor. In these patients with unprovoked VTE, the risk of recurrent VTE is substantially higher; up to 10% in the first year after stopping short term treatment, 5% in the subsequent year, and 30% at eight years. Recurrent VTE is fatal in 3.6% of cases.

Oral anticoagulant treatment is effective at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE during treatment; oral anticoagulant treatment reduces the risk of recurrent VTE by 80–90%. Longer term oral anticoagulant treatment likely only delays recurrent VTE compared with short term treatment. The highest bleeding risks are observed during initial oral treatment. Patients who do not bleed during this time, termed "anticoagulant experienced" patients, are at lower risk of major bleeding with ongoing treatment (1.3% per year). Major bleeding is fatal in 11.3% of affected patients.

Guidelines recommend long term anticoagulant treatment in patients with unprovoked VTE with non-high bleeding risks, but this is based on weak evidence (grade 2B)owing to closely balanced competing risks and burdens of recurrent VTE and major bleeding. Hence, the clinical question of who should continue taking anticoagulants indefinitely and who can safely discontinue them after short term treatment for unprovoked VTE remains a high research priority. To answer this important question, the long term risks and burdens of recurrent VTE must be balanced against the long term risks and burdens of oral anticoagulant treatment, especially major bleeding. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis suggests that it is safe to discontinue anticoagulants if the risk of recurrent VTE is less than 5% at one year after discontinuing treatment. To date, no clinical decision rulesdesigned to achieve these standards have been prospectively validated.

### International clinical practice guideline Recommendations for acute Pulmonary embolism: harmony, dissonance, and silence [^115ZsUrY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) has continued to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients living with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent health care disparities herald a growing burden of PE. In the meantime, navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneity in recommendations, as well as areas of uncertainty or omission may leave the readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. In this review of international PE guidelines, we highlight key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations (silence) with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

### Long term risk of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism event: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1157N3ai]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

For patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, the optimal duration of anticoagulant treatment is uncertain. After three to six months of initial anticoagulation, extended treatment is highly effective at reducing the risk of recurrent VTE, but this clinical benefit is not maintained when anticoagulation is stopped. After discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment, patients with a first unprovoked VTE have a much higher risk of recurrence compared with patients with VTE provoked by a major transient risk factor. Consequently, anticoagulant treatment is discontinued after three to six months in patients with VTE due to a major transient provoking factor, whereas current guidelines suggest extended (ie, indefinite) anticoagulation in patients with unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism who have a non-high bleeding risk. This is, however, a weak (grade 2B) recommendation, in large part as a result of uncertainty in estimates of the long term risk of major bleeding if treatment is continued, and, importantly, the long term risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is discontinued. Thus deciding whether patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE should receive indefinite anticoagulation or can stop treatment after the initial three to six months, remains an important challenge.

A previous individual patient data meta-analysisof 1732 patients with unprovoked VTE from six randomised trials, reported an overall risk of recurrent VTE of about 10% per year in the first two years after discontinuation of anticoagulation. That analysis did not assess the risk of recurrent VTE in men and women separately or in patients with isolated pulmonary embolism, and it only followed patients for 24 months. Furthermore, trials in that analysis were published before 2004, whereas since then additional prospective studies have reported on the risk for recurrent VTE after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment in patients with a first episode of unprovoked VTE, with several of these studies having followed patients beyond 24 months and some up to 10 years. This offers an opportunity to obtain reliable estimates of the long term risk of recurrent VTE and to assess how the risk varies over time — knowledge that is crucial for deciding the need for indefinite anticoagulation, as well as defining the burden of illness in this common patient population.

Consider continuing anticoagulant treatment indefinitely in patients with thrombophilia and discontinuing it in patients without thrombophilia.

### Long-term anticoagulant therapy for idiopathic pulmonary embolism in the elderly: a decision analysis [^116saELu]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with idiopathic pulmonary embolism (PE) are at high risk for recurrent venous thromboembolic disease and might benefit from long-term anticoagulant therapy. But they are also at higher risk for bleeding complications. Because there have been no clinical trials addressing PE treatment in elderly patients, the balance of therapeutic benefits and risks is unclear.

Methods

We constructed a decision-analytic model to forecast the effects of long-term warfarin therapy for idiopathic PE. We focused on 65- and 80-year-old outpatients, with or without a propensity for falls, who previously had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulant therapy without experiencing a major bleed. The model incorporated age-appropriate thromboembolic recurrence rates after PE, major bleeding risks of warfarin use, and the contribution of falls to major bleeding episodes in anticoagulated elderly patients. We used probabilistic sensitivity analysis to model outcomes over ranges of potential thromboembolic and bleeding risks.

Results

In our baseline analysis, long-term warfarin was superior to conventional duration therapy. Depending on the patient subgroup (stratified by age and fall risk), it increased life expectancy by 0.16 to 0.56 years and event-free life expectancy by 0.32 to 0.51 years. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that long-term warfarin therapy was likely to increase life expectancy when compared with conventional-duration therapy (76 to 93% likelihood across all groups).

Conclusions

Extended anticoagulant therapy for idiopathic PE may be beneficial in a subgroup of elderly patients who tolerate the initial 6 to 12 months of therapy without bleeding complications. In this population, advanced age and fall risk were not contraindications to long-term anticoagulation.

### Updated guidelines on outpatient anticoagulation [^1178Szfi]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The American College of Chest Physicians provides recommendations for the use of anticoagulant medications for several indications that are important in the primary care setting. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is recommended for the treatment of venous thromboembolism and for the prevention of stroke in persons with atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, or valvular heart disease. When warfarin therapy is initiated for venous thromboembolism, it should be given the first day, along with a heparin product or fondaparinux. The heparin product or fondaparinux should be continued for at least five days and until the patient's international normalized ratio is at least 2.0 for two consecutive days. The international normalized ratio goal and duration of treatment with warfarin vary depending on indication and risk. Warfarin therapy should be stopped five days before major surgery and restarted 12 to 24 hours postoperatively. Bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin or other agents is based on balancing the risk of thromboembolism with the risk of bleeding. Increasingly, self-testing is an option for selected patients on warfarin therapy. The ninth edition of the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, published in 2012, includes a discussion of anticoagulants that have gained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration since publication of the eighth edition in 2008. Dabigatran and apixaban are indicated for the prevention of systemic embolism and stroke in persons with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Rivaroxaban is indicated for the prevention of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery, for treatment of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, for reducing the risk of recurrent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after initial treatment, and for prevention of systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.

### Duration of primary / secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Kf97r]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Antithrombotic therapy can prevent recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It is, however, associated with an increased risk for major bleeding. This meta-analysis systematically reviewed the evidence regarding the duration of antithrombotic therapy to assess benefits and harms. We systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared shorter (3–6 months) with longer (> 6 months) courses of anticoagulation for the primary treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or that compared discontinued with indefinite antithrombotic therapy for the secondary prevention of VTE. Pairs of reviewers screened the eligible trials and collected data. This study included 22 RCTs (11617 participants). Pooled estimates showed that, for the primary treatment of unprovoked VTE, VTE provoked by chronic risk factors or transient risk factors, treating patients with a longer course (> 6 months) of anticoagulation, as opposed to a shorter course (3–6 months), probably reduced recurrent PE (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–1.02) and DVT (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63–1.14), but it was associated with increased mortality (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.85–2.41) (moderate certainty) and a higher risk for major bleeding (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.02–3.98; high certainty). For the secondary prevention of unprovoked VTE and VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, when compared with discontinuing treatment, indefinite anticoagulation therapy was associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36–0.81), a reduction in recurrent PE (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.16–0.41) and DVT (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.10–0.21), and an increase in the risk for bleeding (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.18–3.30), all supported by high certainty. Indefinite antiplatelet therapy may be associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.53–1.68; low certainty), probably a reduction in recurrent PE (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41–1.03) and DVT (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.17–1.13) (moderate certainty), and may increase the risk for bleeding (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.48–3.41; low certainty). In summary, for the primary treatment of all types of VTE, shorter (3–6 months) duration of anticoagulation is more beneficial. For the secondary prevention of unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, indefinite antithrombotic treatment is more beneficial.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

Duration of anticoagulant therapy after surgery-provoked VTE: In patients with a proximal DVT of the leg or PE provoked by surgery, we recommend treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over (i) treatment of a shorter period (Grade 1B), (ii) treatment of a longer time-limited period (eg, 6, 12, or 24 months) (Grade 1B), or (iii) extended therapy (no scheduled stop date) (Grade 1B).

### Contemporary management of pulmonary embolism: the answers to ten questions [^111VUmNJ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) cannot be diagnosed solely on a clinical basis, because of the lack of sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs and symptoms. Pulmonary angiography is invasive and resource demanding. Because the prevalence of PE is relatively low (20% or less) amongst individuals who are clinically suspected of having the disease, submitting all of them to imaging (multi-detector CT angiography or ventilation/perfusion lung scintigraphy) would not be cost-effective. Therefore, diagnostic algorithms have been developed that include clinical probability assessment and D-dimer measurement to select the patients who require noninvasive imaging. Once the diagnosis is suspected or confirmed, therapy must be started to avoid potentially fatal recurrence. Treatment starts for an initial 3-month period with a 5-day course of parenteral unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists monitored to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2–3. This initial period of 3 months may then be followed by a long-term secondary prevention period in patients who experience an idiopathic thromboembolic event and are at low risk of bleeding. New oral anticoagulants that do require patient monitoring and might exhibit a more favourable benefit-risk balance are currently under extensive clinical testing and might change the situation in the near future. A critical appraisal of the contemporary management of suspected PE is given in this overview with the discussion of 10 practical questions.

### Evidence-based anticoagulation choice for acute pulmonary embolism… [^111ScSKq]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Systemic anticoagulation is the foundation of treatment for most patients with pulmonary embolism. Guidelines recommend that most patients hospitalized for acute PE who are treated with parenteral anticoagulation should receive low-molecular-weight heparin rather than unfractionated heparin because LMWH achieves therapeutic anticoagulation more quickly and is associated with fewer bleeding complications. 1–3. Despite this recommendation, the proportion of US patients with acute PE initially treated with UFH increased from
41. 9% to 56. 3% between 2011 and 2020, whereas less than 10% of similar patients in Europe were treated with UFH. 4 Faced with such contradictory data, Stubblefield and colleagues5 conducted a robust qualitative study of 46 emergency physicians, hospitalists, and interventionalists in the US to understand the factors associated with anticoagulation decisions for PE.

Heparin revolutionized the care of thromboembolic disease when it was first introduced to clinical care in the late 1930s, yet it is far from perfect. The action of UFH is affected by extensive binding to plasma proteins and vascular endothelial cells; minor UFH dose changes can produce dramatic swings in the intensity of anticoagulation due to its nonlinear and dose-dependent elimination. As a result, UFH infusions require frequent monitoring and dose adjustments. In contrast, LMWH and direct oral anticoagulants experience less protein binding, more predictable pharmacokinetics, and a more consistent anticoagulation effect. 6 In their study, Stubblefield et al5 found several major themes behind the selection of UFH as an initial anticoagulant for acute PE. Three common misconceptions regarding pharmacology and contraindications to anticoagulation therapy represent opportunities for intervention to improve the safety of PE care.

The findings in the Stubblefield et al5 study suggest widespread misunderstanding of the pharmacology and guideline-recommended use of heparins in acute PE. Addressing these misconceptions and changing clinical practice will require a multifaceted approach, including pragmatic trials of anticoagulation effectiveness and safety in clinical settings, targeted educational programs from professional societies, and adoption of evidence-based policies by institutional quality committees. Ongoing emergency care research using implementation science frameworks should be conducted to modernize anticoagulation choices and improve outcomes for patients with PE.

### Duration of anticoagulation: applying the guidelines and beyond [^117L7tse]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Despite an improved understanding of the risk factors underlying venous thromboembolism (VTE), extensive clinical investigation, and detailed clinical guidelines, the decision to extend anticoagulation indefinitely for an individual patient with VTE is often problematic. Patients with VTE in association with major surgery, trauma, immobilization, or pregnancy are at relatively low risk of recurrence and generally do not require more than 3 to 6 months of anticoagulant therapy. For patients with a first unprovoked, or idiopathic, episode of VTE, an individualized approach should be taken in deciding on the duration of anticoagulation based on the patient's recurrence and bleeding risk, as well as their personal preference. Although the presence of genetic thrombophilic disorders (factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A gene mutations; deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S) predispose patients to a first episode of VTE, there is inconsistent data on whether testing for these defects changes patient outcomes or should alter their management. In patients with a single unprovoked VTE, measurement of D-dimer several weeks following the completion of anticoagulant therapy appears useful in stratifying patients with a first unprovoked episode of VTE with regard to recurrence risk. Through a series of clinical vignettes, the utility of the laboratory in risk-stratifying patients with respect to recurrence risk will be discussed, along with decision making regarding the duration of anticoagulation. The potential impact of having a nonremovable inferior vena caval filter will also be addressed.

### Duration of anticoagulation therapy for venous thromboembolism [^112na45n]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism-often denominated together as venous thromboembolism (VTE)- consists of parenteral administration of heparin (usually low-molecular-weight heparin or alternatively unfractionated heparin or fondaparinux) overlapped and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists that are administered for a certain period (usually 3 to 12 months). Recommended or suggested durations differ according to guidelines. Practically, the clinical decision in an individual patient depends upon the estimated risks of VTE recurrence and treatment-induced bleeding. The risk of VTE recurrence is higher in idiopathic events (about 10% per year during the first two years and 3% per year thereafter) (odds ratio of 2.4, compared to secondary events); in male subjects (at least before the age of 60, with an odds ratio of 2–4); in patients with persistently elevated D-dimer level (odds ratio of 2.3, compared with normal level); and during the first two years after discontinuation of treatment. The annual risk of major bleeding on anticoagulant treatment vary largely in observational studies with figures of 2% to 29%, depending on the patient characteristics. The case-fatality rate is 8% (DVT), 12% (PE) for recurrent VTE, and about 10% for major bleed. These figures do not support long-term anticoagulant therapy, except in those patients exhibiting a very high risk of recurrence and/or a very low risk of bleeding. New therapeutic aspects might impact on the duration of anticoagulant therapy after a venous thromboembolic event. They include the possibility of pursuing anticoagulant treatment at a reduced INR after an initial period with an INR 2–3, and the advent of new, more specific and orally active anticoagulants. These features might modify the risk-benefit balance of extending anticoagulant therapy beyond the usual, limited duration.

### Duration of anticoagulant therapy for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^115sm5Zz]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

It takes about 3 months to complete "active treatment" of venous thromboembolism (VTE), with further treatment serving to prevent new episodes of thrombosis ("pure secondary prevention"). Consequently, VTE should generally be treated for either 3 months or indefinitely (exceptions will be described in the text). The decision to stop anticoagulants at 3 months or to treat indefinitely is dominated by the long-term risk of recurrence, and secondarily influenced by the risk of bleeding and by patient preference. VTE provoked by a reversible risk factor, or a first unprovoked isolated distal (calf) deep vein thrombosis (DVT), has a low risk of recurrence and is usually treated for 3 months. VTE associated with active cancer, or a second unprovoked VTE, has a high risk of recurrence and is usually treated indefinitely. The decision to stop anticoagulants at 3 months or to treat indefinitely is more finely balanced after a first unprovoked proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Indefinite anticoagulation is often chosen if there is a low risk of bleeding, whereas anticoagulation is usually stopped at 3 months if there is a high risk of bleeding. The decision to continue anticoagulation indefinitely after a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE is strengthened if the patient is male, the index event was PE rather than DVT, and/or d-dimer testing is positive 1 month after stopping anticoagulant therapy.

### Management guidelines from the American Society of Hematology… [^114BZgG8]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In-hospital and home treatment of PE provide similar outcomes, although home treatment of DVT produces better outcomes.
- After primary DOAC treatment for three to six months, decisions for indefinite anticoagulation depend on risk factors associated with initial VTE.
- When VTE is unprovoked or associated with chronic factors, indefinite anticoagulation reduces recurrent VTE with a slightly increased risk of major bleeding. After VTE that is unprovoked or provoked by a chronic factor, indefinite anticoagulation should be considered. For unprovoked VTE, indefinite anticoagulation with a DOAC reduces recurrent PE and DVT, although with an increase in major bleeding. After a second VTE, indefinite anticoagulation reduces future PE and future DVT with the same slight risk of major bleeding.

Evidence is lacking on whether indefinite anticoagulation is beneficial if both VTE events were associated with transient provoking factors. Although aspirin reduces long-term VTE risk, anticoagulation is more effective. Aspirin does not definitively reduce bleeding risk compared with anticoagulants but does increase the risk of recurrent PE and recurrent DVT. Limited study suggests that indefinite treatment with lower doses of DOACs does not reduce bleeding and recurrent VTE compared with standard dosing. 1 Although both recommend considering indefinite anticoagulation for VTE not associated with a transient risk factor, the ACCP excludes patients with high bleeding risk and the American Society of Hematology discusses excluding only patients at high risk of bleeding complications. The ACCP estimates bleeding risk by counting risk factors, which has not been prospectively validated.

1 ACCP guidelines support aspirin for unprovoked VTE if anticoagulation is stopped because they found bleeding risk with aspirin was similar to no treatment, whereas the American Society of Hematology recommends against aspirin because they found bleeding risk with aspirin was similar to that with anticoagulants. 1 Although the ACCP guidelines are four years older, this difference is likely based on different interpretations of uncertain evidence.

Pulmonary embolism can be acutely life-threatening and is associated with long-term consequences such as recurrent venous thromboembolism and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. In 2020, the American Society of Hematology published updated guidelines on the management of patients with venous thromboembolism. Here, a hematologist and a cardiology and vascular medicine specialist discuss these guidelines in the context of the care of a patient with pulmonary embolism. They discuss advanced therapies such as catheter-directed thrombolysis in the short-term management of patients with intermediate-risk disease, recurrence risk stratification at presentation, and ideal antithrombotic regimens for patients whose pulmonary embolism was associated with a transient minor risk factor.

### Continuing warfarin for 18 months after unprovoked PE reduces risk of recurrent VTE… [^114DyMv8]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does continuing warfarin for 18 months after an unprovoked pulmonary embolism reduce the risk of recurrent venous thrombotic events. Bottom Line Continuing warfarin therapy for 18 months after an unprovoked PE reduces the risk of recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism. However, benefit beyond 18 months is not maintained after the warfarin is discontinued. Synopsis Patients with unprovoked VTE have a higher risk of recurrence than those with a provoked event. This is the first study to evaluate extended anticoagulation beyond six months for patients with unprovoked PE. The authors enrolled adults, 18 years or older, who received six months of therapy with a vitamin K antagonist following their first episode of symptomatic unprovoked PE.

Using intention-to-treat analysis, three of 184 patients in the warfarin group and 25 of 187 in the placebo group developed a symptomatic recurrent VTE during the 18-month treatment period. During the same period, four of 184 patients in the warfarin group and one of 187 patients in the placebo group experienced a major bleed. After discontinuation of therapy at 18 months, the risk of symptomatic recurrent VTE in the warfarin group increased so that over the course of the entire study period there was not a significant difference in the number of symptomatic recurrent VTEs between treatment groups. Thus, extending anticoagulation with warfarin beyond six months after an unprovoked VTE reduces the risk of recurrence, but only during the time of anticoagulation.

Duration of anticoagulant therapy after nonsurgical transient risk factor–provoked VTE and reassessment of extended therapy: In patients with a proximal DVT of the leg or PE provoked by a nonsurgical transient risk factor, we recommend treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over (i) treatment of a shorter period (Grade 1B) and (ii) treatment of a longer time-limited period (eg, 6, 12, or 24 months) (Grade 1B). We suggest treatment with anticoagulation for 3 months over extended therapy if there is a low or moderate bleeding risk (Grade 2B), and recommend treatment for 3 months over extended therapy if there is a high risk of bleeding (Grade 1B). Remarks: In all patients who receive extended anticoagulant therapy, the continuing use of treatment should be reassessed at periodic intervals (eg, annually).

### Anticoagulation for three versus six months in patients with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or both: randomised trial [^112mnUFr]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the optimum duration of oral anticoagulant therapy after an episode of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or both.

Design

Multicentre, prospective, randomised study with follow-up for one year.

Setting

46 hospitals in United Kingdom.

Participants

Patients aged ≥ 18 with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or both.

Interventions

Three (n = 369) or six months (n = 380) of anticoagulation with heparin for five days accompanied and followed by warfarin, with a target international normalised ratio of 2.0–3.5.

Main Outcome Measures

Death from deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; failure to resolve, extension, recurrence of during treatment; recurrence after treatment; and major haemorrhage during treatment.

Results

In the patients allocated to three months' treatment two died from deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during or after treatment, compared with three in the six month group. During treatment deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism failed to resolve, extended, or recurred in six patients in the three month group without fatal consequences, compared with 10 in the six month group. After treatment there were 23 non-fatal recurrences in the three month group and 16 in the six month group. Fatal and non-fatal deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism during treatment, and after treatment thus occurred in 31(8%) of those who had received three months' anticoagulation compared with 29 (8%) of those who had received six months' (P = 0.80, 95% confidence interval for difference -3.1% to 4.7%). There were no fatal haemorrhages during treatment but there were eight major haemorrhages in those treated for six months and none in those treated for three months (P = 0.008, -3.5% to -0.7%). Thus 31 (8%) of the patients receiving three months' anticoagulation experienced adverse outcomes as a result of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism or its treatment compared with 35 (9%) of those receiving six months' (P = 0.79, -4.9% to 3.2%).

Conclusion

For patients in the UK with deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and no known risk factors for recurrence, there seems to be little, if any, advantage in increasing the duration of anticoagulation from three to six months. Any possible advantage would be small and would need to be judged against the increased risk of haemorrhage associated with the longer duration of treatment with warfarin.

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: a multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^116kMtrw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of venous thromboembolism (VTE) management, aimed at preventing thrombus propagation, embolization, and recurrence, but balanced against risk of bleeding. For patients with provoked VTE, referring to VTE after a transient trigger, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines have recommended 3 months of anticoagulation since at least 2008. In patients with provoked VTE and without any other indication for anticoagulation, the ACCP recommends discontinuing anticoagulation at this 3‐month mark. Although these guidelines have been in place for over a decade, it is unclear if they are followed in real‐world practice.

In the past decade, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have shifted anticoagulation administration practices. The favorable safety and efficacy profiles of DOACs have raised the possibility of providing a longer duration of anticoagulation for VTE. The 2013 AMPLIFY‐EXT (Apixaban After the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis With First‐Line Therapy‐Extended Treatment) study evaluated the use of apixaban, and the 2017 EINSTEIN CHOICE (Reduced‐Dosed Rivaroxaban in the Long‐Term Prevention of Recurrent Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism) study evaluated the use of rivaroxaban for extended duration of anticoagulation in patients with provoked and unprovoked VTE. Both studies found a reduced risk of recurrent VTE in the group taking DOACs compared with the control group, without substantial increase in bleeding episodes. The low bleeding rates reported in studies of patients receiving anticoagulation beyond the 3‐ to 6‐month window may influence how clinicians think about the risk–benefit of anticoagulation at the 3‐month mark. Although fewer than 10% of patients in the AMPLIFY‐EXT had a provoked VTE, clinicians may apply the study findings to their patients with a provoked VTE, despite the updated ACCP guidelines released in August 2021 that continue to recommend only 3 months of anticoagulation for patients with provoked VTE, regardless of which anticoagulation agent is prescribed.

The primary aim of this study was to measure anticoagulation duration in an unselected, real‐world population of patients and compare current clinical practice to long‐standing guideline recommendations for patients with provoked VTE. The secondary aims were to compare duration of anticoagulation between patients taking warfarin and DOACs, and to identify variables that predict anticoagulant duration in patients with provoked VTE taking warfarin compared with DOACs.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^113BLMww]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

### Early switch to oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PEITHO-2): a multinational, multicentre, single-arm, phase 4 trial [^115UdvuH]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend a risk-adjusted treatment strategy for the management of acute pulmonary embolism. This is a particular patient category for whom optimal treatment (anticoagulant treatment, reperfusion strategies, and duration of hospitalisation) is currently unknown. We investigated whether treatment of acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism with parenteral anticoagulation for a short period of 72 h, followed by a switch to a direct oral anticoagulant (dabigatran), is effective and safe.

Methods

We did a multinational, multicentre, single-arm, phase 4 trial at 42 hospitals in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain. Adult patients (aged ≥ 18 years) with symptomatic intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism, with or without deep-vein thrombosis, were enrolled. Patients received parenteral low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin for 72 h after diagnosis of pulmonary embolism before switching to oral dabigatran 150 mg twice per day following a standard clinical assessment. The primary outcome was recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism or pulmonary embolism-related death within 6 months. The primary and safety outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The study was terminated early, as advised by the data safety and monitoring board, following sample size adaptation after the predefined interim analysis on Dec 18, 2018. This trial is registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2015–001830–12) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02596555).

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2016, and July 31, 2019, 1418 patients with pulmonary embolism were screened, of whom 402 were enrolled and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (median age was 69·5 years [IQR 60·0–78·0); 192 [48%] were women and 210 [52%] were men). Median follow-up was 217 days (IQR 210–224) and 370 (92%) patients adhered to the protocol. The primary outcome occurred in seven (2% [upper bound of right-sided 95% CI 3]; p < 0·0001 for rejecting the null hypothesis) patients, with all events occurring in those with intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism (seven [3%; upper bound of right-sided 95% CI 5] of 283). At 6 months, 11 (3% [95% CI 1–5]) of 402 patients had at least one major bleeding event and 16 (4% [2–6]) had at least one clinically relevant non-major bleeding event; the only fatal haemorrhage occurred in one (< 1%) patient before the switch to dabigatran.

Interpretation

A strategy of early switch from heparin to dabigatran following standard clinical assessment was effective and safe in patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism. Our results can help to refine guideline recommendations for the initial treatment of acute intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism, optimising the use of resources and avoiding extended hospitalisation.

### Which patients are at high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism)? [^116etbCj]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE, or deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) is associated with mortality and long-term morbidity. The circumstances in which an index VTE event occurred are crucial when personalized VTE recurrence risk is assessed. Patients who experience a VTE event in the setting of a transient major risk factor (such as surgery associated with general anesthesia for > 30 minutes) are predicted to have a low VTE recurrence risk following discontinuation of anticoagulation, and limited-duration anticoagulation is generally recommended. In contrast, those patients whose VTE event occurred in the absence of risk factors or who have persistent risk factors have a higher VTE recurrence risk. Here, we review the literature surrounding VTE recurrence risk in a range of clinical conditions. We describe gender-specific risks, including VTE recurrence risk following hormone- and pregnancy-associated VTE events. Finally, we discuss how the competing impacts of VTE recurrence and bleeding have shaped international guideline recommendations.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^116zNBYV]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

When there is no clear major transient risk factor, how should I approach a discussion and decision on life-long anticoagulation?

Shared decision-making with the patient is vital to support treatment adherence. Regarding the decision on long-term anticoagulation, physicians should consider the long-term risks of bleeding versus the risk of VTE/PE recurrence and discuss how best to balance these risks with the patient. This balance may change over time, thus an annual review of patients taking long-term anticoagulation should take place. The risk of VTE recurrence following discontinuation of anticoagulation is related to the presence or absence of provoking risk factors at the time of the acute event. Readers should refer to the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management for the classification of patients into low, intermediate and high risk of life-long VTE recurrence. Patients who have had multiple episodes of VTE in the absence of major transient or reversible risk factors are considered as being at high risk of VTE recurrence, per the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management, and it is recommended to extend anticoagulation indefinitely in these patients. Cases in which there is no clear provoking risk factor underpinning a patient's first and only episode of VTE are classified as being at intermediate risk of recurrence, and determining the duration of anticoagulation in these patients may be challenging. To inform this decision, several scores for predicting VTE recurrence and bleeding are available to estimate individual patient risk. However, these risk scores should not be used in isolation and cannot be solely relied on.

### Update on the diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism [^114XjNFQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and often fatal disease. In the US, an estimated 40–53 people per 100,000 are diagnosed with PE annually and approximately 60,000 die from the disease. Diagnosis is difficult because symptoms are non-specific; however, a quick and accurate diagnosis is critical because, with appropriate therapy, the risk of recurrent (and potentially fatal) PE can be greatly reduced. Recent publication of prediction rules and improved non-invasive diagnostic tools have simplified diagnostic algorithms for PE. The efficacy of the standard treatment for PE, initial administration of continuous i.v. unfractionated heparin overlapped with long-term oral anticoagulation, is well established. However, newer treatment options such as low-molecular-weight heparins and the pentasaccharides may offer similar efficacy with improved convenience.

### Thirty-day outcomes in patients with acute pulmonary embolism who discontinued anticoagulant therapy before 90 days [^115mS7vM]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The contemporary natural history of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) not receiving (or early discontinuing) anticoagulant therapy has not been consistently evaluated.

Objective

To assess the rate of the composite outcome of PE-related death, sudden death, or recurrent thromboembolism (VTE) within 30 days in all PE patients in whom anticoagulation was not administered or discontinued prematurely (< 90 days of anticoagulation).

Methods

We used the RIETE database to assess the incidence rates (per 100 person-days) of the composite outcome within the subsequent 30 days. The risk of these events was compared to PE patients who were anticoagulated for ≥ 90 days.

Results

Of 34,447 PE recruited from 2001 to 2017, 47 (0.14%) did not receive anticoagulants and 1348 (3.91%) discontinued it before 90 days. Fatal PE developed in 25 (53%) of those without any anticoagulation and in 45 (3.33%) with premature discontinuations. Sudden death or non-fatal recurrent VTE occurred in 6 (0.45%) and 24 (1.48%) patients, respectively. The incidence of the primary outcome declined logarithmically from 6.36 per 100 patient-days in untreated patients to 0.32–0.13 in those treated for 8–90 days. During the first week of follow-up, the incidence rate was 13.9 and 0.60–0.31 per 100 patient-days, respectively. The adjusted odds of the primary outcome was 27 fold higher in untreated than in treated patients, and progressively decreased to 2.5–7 fold higher in patients treated for at least 7 days.

Conclusion

The incidence of the composite outcome was highest during the first week, and inversely and logarithmically correlated with the duration of anticoagulant therapy.

### Short-term versus extended anticoagulant treatment for unprovoked venous thromboembolism: a survey on guideline adherence and physicians' considerations [^117B2F9p]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE), anticoagulant treatment duration should be decided by weighing bleeding risk versus risk of recurrent VTE, considering patient's preference. Because both risks differ between individuals, this recommendation presumably leads to wide variation in clinical management.

Objectives

To identify physician's considerations when deciding between short-term and extended anticoagulation and to assess how current guidelines are put to practice.

Materials and Methods

An online, 33-item survey was developed, containing questions on clinical management, considerations regarding treatment duration, risk scores, information tools and shared decision-making. It was distributed to internists, pulmonologists and residents treating patients with VTE in the Netherlands.

Results

69 internists and 73 pulmonologists including 24 residents participated in the survey. Extended treatment was preferred by 73% (104/142) of participants. Most important reasons for extended treatment were, in descending order: patient's preference, active malignancy, low estimated bleeding risk, history of VTE and hemodynamic instability during previous VTE. Most important reasons for short-term treatment were frequent falls, history of major bleeding, previous bleeding during anticoagulation, patient's preference and thrombocytopenia. Although existing risk scores are infrequently used, physicians express their need for scores combining risks of recurrence and bleeding to aid individualized decision-making.

Conclusion

Our results confirm a wide variety of considerations regarding treatment duration in patients with unprovoked VTE. Although most participants followed guidelines' recommendations to prescribe indefinite treatment in absence of contraindications, rationale is not always supported by evidence. A clinical decision tool to estimate and weigh risks of recurrence and bleeding is warranted.

The three most controversial and unsolved issues in the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) are: (1) the role of thrombolysis, (2) the role of low molecular weight heparin and length of hospital stay, and (3) the optimal duration of anticoagulation. The trend is to use thrombolysis more frequently, to administer low molecular weight heparin and shorten the hospitalization duration in low-risk patients, and to give prolonged courses of anticoagulation with warfarin. PE thrombolysis appears most beneficial in patients at high risk of adverse clinical outcomes in whom the potential hazards of bleeding can be justified by the danger of conservative management with anticoagulation alone. With respect to utilizing low molecular weight heparin as a way of shortening the duration of hospitalization, there are no data to warrant this approach. The current FDA mandate for symptomatic PE patients is to administer intravenous unfractionated heparin administered as a bridge to therapeutic warfarin. Finally, the optimal duration of anticoagulation following acute PE remains mired in controversy. Despite the high rate of recurrent venous thrombosis after discontinuation of anticoagulation, there are currently insufficient data to recommend indefinite warfarin therapy.

Inherited and acquired thrombophilia

Inherited thrombophilia can be detected in up to 30% of VTE patients. However, screening for inherited thrombophilia should only be performed if the results of testing are expected to modify (i) patient management in terms of type, dosage, or duration of anticoagulant therapy or (ii) counselling on oral contraception or prophylactic measures during pregnancy for female first degree relatives. In particular, the presence of inherited thrombophilia should not drive the choice of anticoagulant drug class or its intensity. Notably, in younger patients without identifiable strong risk factors for VTE recurrence and without a strong family history of VTE, in whom the physician and patient are considering anticoagulant treatment discontinuation, the absence of inherited thrombophilia might support the latter decision. Seven of 16 panel members would use the results of genetic thrombophilia testing to support clinical decisions for young patients (e.g. age < 50 years) with unprovoked PE if validated risk assessment models suggest a low risk of recurrence. In their opinion, the presence of inherited thrombophilia may, under those circumstances, support a decision in favour of indefinite anticoagulation. The remaining nine panel members considered available evidence insufficient to support this practice.

### Duration of oral anticoagulation after PE… [^111K3k8z]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

The primary outcome was the composite of symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism and nonfatal or fatal major bleeding up to 18 months. This composite outcome and its components were also assessed during the entire study period. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2 groups, except that more women were assigned to warfarin than were men. In the warfarin group, symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 25 patients, all in the absence of anticoagulation; 17 events were unprovoked, and 4 were fatal. In the placebo group, symptomatic recurrence occurred in 14 patients, all in the absence of anticoagulation; 10 events were unprovoked, and none were fatal.

This result was driven by a reduction in the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism, the risk of bleeding increasing to a minimal extent. However, this benefit of anticoagulation was lost after anticoagulation was discontinued. As previously described, 11–13 the risk of recurrence in the placebo group was greatest during the first 6 months after discontinuing anticoagulation and then increased linearly by 4% to 5% per year, whereas the risk of major bleeding during treatment with warfarin was low, increasing linearly by less than 2% per year. Moreover, the vast majority of recurrences were unprovoked in both study groups, as in other studies. 7–9 Thus, extending the length of secondary anticoagulant prophylaxis to 18 months did not modify the clinical presentation of recurrent venous thromboembolism. Most recurrences were unpreventable and represented the most severe form of venous thromboembolism.

Aspirin for 2 to 4 years following vitamin K antagonist therapy reduced the risk of recurrence by about 30% compared with placebo. 21, 22 Although this 30% risk reduction may be viewed as small compared with the 80% to 90% usually reported with anticoagulation, 32 and it is uncertain whether our results apply to newer anticoagulants, both aspirin and new anticoagulants may represent valuable alternatives to vitamin K antagonists or no treatment.

### Pulmonary embolism: update on management and controversies [^113CFVqY]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder that must be promptly diagnosed and treated. The diagnosis, risk assessment, and management of pulmonary embolism have evolved with a better understanding of efficient use of diagnostic and therapeutic options. The use of either clinical probability adjusted or age adjusted D-dimer interpretation has led to a reduction in diagnostic imaging to exclude pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulation therapies are safe, effective, and convenient treatments for most patients with acute venous thromboembolism, with a lower risk of bleeding than vitamin K antagonists. These oral therapeutic options have opened up opportunities for safe outpatient management of pulmonary embolism in selected patients. Recent clinical trials exploring the use of systemic thrombolysis in intermediate to high risk pulmonary embolism suggest that this therapy should be reserved for patients with evidence of hemodynamic compromise. The role of low dose systemic or catheter directed thrombolysis in other patient subgroups is uncertain. After a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, all patients should be assessed for risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism to guide duration of anticoagulation. Patients with a venous thromboembolism associated with a strong, transient, provoking risk factor can safely discontinue anticoagulation after three months of treatment. Patients with an ongoing strong risk factor, such as cancer, or unprovoked events are at increased risk of recurrent events and should be considered for extended treatment. The use of a risk prediction score can help to identify patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism who can benefit from extended duration therapy. Despite major advances in the management of pulmonary embolism, up to half of patients report chronic functional limitations. Such patients should be screened for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, but only a small proportion will have this as the explanation of their symptoms. In the remaining patients, future studies are needed to understand the pathophysiology and explore interventions to improve quality of life.

### Do anticoagulants improve survival in patients presenting with venous thromboembolism? [^115GN9iD]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants have been available since around 1940 and have become the standard of treatment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) for over four decades. However, as with other treatments which became established before the evidence-based era, there is a paucity of evidence from randomized controlled trials validating their effectiveness in preventing the most feared complication of VTE, recurrent fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). Only two such trials have been performed, the results of which conflict. The bulk of data supporting their use are derived from three sources. First, studies of thromboprophylaxis, and comparisons of shorter and longer courses of anticoagulants in high-risk patients with established VTE have clearly demonstrated their effectiveness in primary and late secondary prevention. Given that heparin has an immediate onset of action, anticoagulants should therefore also be effective in early secondary prevention, the proposed mechanism of action in the acute treatment of VTE. Secondly, studies of inadequately treated patients have consistently shown higher recurrence rates than in those adequately treated. Finally, comparisons of outcomes in untreated and treated historical series, and of untreated historical series to treated series in the modern era have shown substantially lower rates of fatal PE in anticoagulated patients. Because these differences are so marked, harmonize with our current understanding of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants and are supported by other evidence, it is much more likely that they at least partly reflect the effectiveness of anticoagulants as opposed to being explicable purely in terms of accumulated biases and a changing distribution of disease severity.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112geCkt]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) — treatment phases and baseline duration: In patients with proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), we recommend long-term (3 months) anticoagulant therapy over no such therapy (Grade 1B). The minimum duration of anticoagulant therapy for DVT or PE is usually 3 months and is referred to as long-term therapy, while treatment for longer than 3 months is termed extended anticoagulant therapy and usually implies that anticoagulant therapy will be continued indefinitely.

### Duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism: balancing benefits and harms on the long term [^113Cxs3S]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is effectively treated with anticoagulant therapy. After an initial treatment phase, extended treatment is effective to prevent recurrence after a first event but this is at the expense of a continued risk of bleeding. Ideally, patients at a high risk of recurrence and low risk of bleeding continue anticoagulant therapy, and for those at low risk of recurrence the duration of treatment can be limited. Identifying these patients, however, is difficult. Duration of treatment after a first VTE provoked by a transient risk factor should be limited to 3 months. Although guidelines suggest extended treatment for all patients after unprovoked VTE unless bleeding risk is high, we emphasize that the long-term risks of recurrent VTE off anticoagulation are uncertain whereas the risk of bleeding associated with anticoagulant therapy increases with age. In the absence of evidence of replaced mortality or improved quality of life with extended anticoagulant treatment, we suggest a limited duration for most patients after a first VTE. Extended treatment can be considered, based mainly on patient preference.

### Optimal length of oral anticoagulant treatment for maximum benefit within 5 years after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants in patients with acute pulmonary embolism who require secondary thromboprophylaxis [^11223dwz]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

To our best knowledge, the studies which are comparable to the current one are scarce, despite there were several relevant studies. The results from the current study were basically consistent with that from the study of Chopard et al, in which extended OA treatment over 2.5 years after acute PE diagnosis may provide a net clinical benefit, compared with those without extended anticoagulation, although its mean duration of study follow-up was only 2.1 ± 0.3 years. In the PADIS-PE randomised clinical trial, for 371 patients who had experienced a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked PE and had been treated initially for six uninterrupted months with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), an additional 18 months of anticoagulation treatment with warfarin reduced the composite outcome of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared with placebo. However, such benefit was not maintained at the end of 42 months of follow-up after the discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy (20.8% of events in the warfarin group vs 24.0% in the placebo, HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.47 to 1.18). The PADIS-PE study suggested that an overall 2-year VKA anticoagulant therapy can benefit patients with unprovoked acute PE. Nevertheless, such duration is not an optimal one since its legacy effect could not sustain after the discontinuation of anticoagulation treatment. In a meta-analysis of six randomised trials including 5920 patients with VTE at intermediate risk of recurrence, compared with the shorter anticoagulation arm (7.5 months), the longer anticoagulation arm (18.6 months) was associated with a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.75; 0.8% vs 1.8%). PE-related death was also lower in the longer anticoagulation arm (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.83; 0.2% vs 0.6%), compared with the shorter one. It is partly consistent with the result of the current study with respect to the PE-related mortality, whereas it is inconsistent with the result of the current study with regards to the all-cause mortality. The reason for the disparity in all-cause mortality may lie in that the all-cause mortality could be impacted by a variety of causes of death during an average follow-up period being longer than 7 years after PE diagnosis in the present study, which was much longer than the average 18.6 months after PE diagnosis in the previous study. In the SURVET Study, for 615 patients with first-ever unprovoked VTE who had completed 3–12 months of OA treatment and were randomly assigned to sulodexide, which is a natural glycosaminoglycan with antithrombotic and profibrinolytic activities or placebo for 2 years in addition to elastic stockings, VTE recurred in 15 patients who received sulodexide (N = 307) and in 30 patients who received placebo (N = 308) (HR: 0.49 (0.27 to 0.92); p = 0.025). It indicated that a 2–3 years of antithrombotic therapy is beneficial for patients with unprovoked VTE, being basically consistent with the results of the current study.

### Managing pulmonary embolism from presentation to extended treatment [^114GhX1R]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major healthcare problem. PE presents with a variety of non-specific symptoms, and confirmation of diagnosis involves the use of clinical risk scores, scanning techniques and laboratory tests. Treatment choice is informed by the risk of sudden death, with high-risk patients recommended to receive thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy. Patients with less severe presentations are given anticoagulant therapy, traditionally with parenteral heparins in the acute phase of treatment, transitioning to oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The limitations of these agents and the introduction of non-VKA oral anticoagulants challenge this paradigm. To date, clinical studies of four non-VKA oral anticoagulants to treat acute thrombosis have been published, and rivaroxaban is now approved for treatment and prevention of PE (and deep vein thrombosis). Rivaroxaban and apixaban alone, and dabigatran and edoxaban after parenteral anticoagulant induction, were non-inferior to enoxaparin/VKA for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism; the risk of major bleeding was similar with dabigatran and edoxaban and significantly reduced with rivaroxaban and apixaban. Patients with an initial PE are recommended to receive continued anticoagulation for 3 months or longer, depending on individual risk factors, and studies of non-VKA oral anticoagulants have shown a continued benefit for up to 2 years, without a significantly increased risk of major bleeding. Given that the non-VKA oral anticoagulants are given at fixed doses without the need for routine coagulation monitoring, their adoption is likely to ease the burden on both PE patients and healthcare practitioners when longer-term or extended anticoagulation is warranted.

### Extended anticoagulation after pulmonary embolism: a multicenter observational cohort analysis [^111RKRf2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our analysis suggests that extended oral anticoagulation over 2 and a half years after index PE, whether by VKA or DOAC, provides a net clinical benefit compared with no anticoagulation in patients selected by providers to receive extended anticoagulation, likely based on their bleeding risk profile, including factors such as age, renal function, presence of thrombocytopenia or antiplatelet therapy. We observed lower rates of death and recurrent VTE, and an associated similar rate of bleeding in the group of patients treated with long‐term anticoagulant therapy. Results were consistent across the high‐thrombotic‐risk subgroup (ie, cancer, unprovoked PE, and prior history of VTE) as well as in populations at risk of bleeding (ie, women, elderly patients, renal function impairment, low body weight, and VTE‐BLEED score defined high bleeding risk patients). These findings underscore the crucial role of anticoagulant therapy for extended secondary prevention of PE. They provide additional evidence that may help to clarify the persisting zones of uncertainty in evidence‐based guidelines for the long‐term management of PE.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^1116cPiy]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is important to assess recovery, consider the need for on-going anticoagulation and identify chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare but serious complication of PE. 16 dilemmas in the follow-up of acute PE were identified by a steering committee of four pulmonologists and a haematologist with interest in PE and/or CTEPH. Current literature was reviewed and a practical approach suggested based on expert consensus. Dilemmas discussed included: (1) how to manage a breathless patient; (2) what to do if CTEPH is suspected; (3) the difference between CTEPH and post-PE syndrome, (4) testing for thrombophilia, (5) when to investigate for cancer, (6) anticoagulation duration and dose, (7) approaches to discussions and decision-making with respect to anticoagulation, (8) use of aspirin and whether antiplatelet therapy should be stopped during anticoagulation and (9) advice for patients on discharge from hospital at 3 months and information for first-degree relatives. Given the occurrence of complications that may require assessment, follow-up of patients post-PE should be systematic and consider the individual needs of the patient.

### Extended anticoagulation after pulmonary embolism: a multicenter observational cohort analysis [^113qHMzx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is becoming increasingly recognized as an important source of acute and chronic morbidity and mortality. Patients with incident PE carry a long‐lasting risk of recurrence, associated with long‐term complications. Patients with PE may develop chronic conditions including thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, post‐thrombotic syndrome if associated with deep vein thrombosis, post‐PE syndrome, which impairs long‐term clinical functional status, and acute arterial thrombotic events.,

Anticoagulation is the mainstay of PE treatment both in the in‐hospital treatment phase and after hospital discharge. The purpose of anticoagulant therapy is initially to prevent extension of thrombus, but also to prevent recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and death. Following the acute treatment period of a minimum of 3 months, the aim of extended secondary anticoagulation is to prevent VTE recurrence over the long term. Overall, all direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) effectively reduce recurrent VTE by about 80% to 90%, with a persisting 2.0% to 6.0% risk for clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (CRNMB) in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The latest evidence‐based guidelines recommend that extended oral anticoagulation of indefinite duration should be considered for patients with PE with no identifiable risk factors or with a minor transient or reversible risk factor. Nevertheless, long‐term follow‐up data from unselected populations in daily clinical practice are needed to provide insights into the impact of extended anticoagulation after PE.

Using data from a French multicenter prospective nonrandomized registry, we report a comparison of clinical characteristics and outcomes between patients treated with 2‐year extended anticoagulation and those who were not, in a population who had completed 3 to 6 months of anticoagulant therapy after acute PE.

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: a multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^114CrtVA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Background For more than a decade, guidelines have recommended a limited 3months of anticoagulation for the treatment of provoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). How closely real-world practice follows guideline recommendations is not well described. Methods and Results In our multicenter, retrospective cohort study, we evaluated trends in anticoagulation duration for patients enrolled in the MAQI 2 (Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative) registry who were receiving anticoagulation for a provoked VTE. The MAQI 2 registry comprises 6 centers in Michigan that manage patients' long-term anticoagulation. We identified 474 patients on warfarin and 302 patients on direct oral anticoagulants who were receiving anticoagulation for a primary indication of provoked VTE between 2008 and 2020. Using a predefined threshold of 120days (3 months plus a buffer period), predictors of extended anticoagulant use were identified using multivariable logistic regression. Most patients received > 120days of anticoagulation, regardless of which medication was used. The median (25th-75th percentile) length of treatment for patients taking warfarin was 142 (91–234) days and for direct oral anticoagulants was 180 (101–360) days. Recurrent VTE (odds ratio [OR], 2.75 [95% CI, 1.67–4.53]), history of myocardial infarction (OR, 3.92 [95% CI, 1.32–11.7]), and direct oral anticoagulant rather than warfarin use (OR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.59–3.08]) were independently associated with prolonged anticoagulation. Conclusions In our cohort of patients with provoked VTE, most patients received anticoagulation for longer than the guideline-recommended 3months. This demonstrates a potential opportunity to improve care delivery and reduce anticoagulant-associated bleeding risk.

### Balancing risks and benefits of extended anticoagulant therapy for idiopathic venous thrombosis [^116d9u5t]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

About half of the patients with a first idiopathic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) are expected to have a recurrent episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE) within 10 years of stopping therapy, and randomized trials have shown that this group of patients benefit from long-term anticoagulant therapy. High risks for bleeding and patient preference are compelling reasons not to treat such patients long-term. Although a number of factors are associated with a reduced risk of recurrence, they require further validation before it is appropriate to routinely stop anticoagulants after 3 months in patients with idiopathic proximal DVT or PE.

### Trends in the use of oral anticoagulants for adults with venous thromboembolism in the US, 2010–2020 [^1158KKLn]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this large cohort study of 298 609 patients with VTE, we observed a substantial shift in the use of OACs over the course of a decade, with DOACs (especially apixaban) becoming overwhelmingly preferred over warfarin. Most patients completed the initial 3 months of OAC therapy with a median treatment duration of approximately 6 months. Treatment duration was, on average, longer for patients with PE and shorter for patients with a history of bleeding. These insights into OAC use have implications when designing comparative effectiveness and safety studies of OACs for VTE recurrence.

### Six months vs extended oral anticoagulation after a first episode of pulmonary embolism: the PADIS-PE randomized clinical trial [^111A5Y8X]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The optimal duration of anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism is uncertain.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of an additional 18-month treatment with warfarin vs placebo, after an initial 6-month nonrandomized treatment period on a vitamin K antagonist.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind trial (treatment period, 18 months; median follow-up, 24 months); 371 adult patients who had experienced a first episode of symptomatic unprovoked pulmonary embolism (ie, with no major risk factor for thrombosis) and had been treated initially for 6 uninterrupted months with a vitamin K antagonist were randomized and followed up between July 2007 and September 2014 in 14 French centers.

Interventions

Warfarin or placebo for 18 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the composite of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding at 18 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were the composite at 42 months (treatment period plus 24-month follow-up), as well as each component of the composite, and death unrelated to pulmonary embolism or major bleeding, at 18 and 42 months.

Results

After randomization, 4 patients were lost to follow-up, all after month 18, and 1 withdrew due to an adverse event. During the 18-month treatment period, the primary outcome occurred in 6 of 184 patients (3.3%) in the warfarin group and in 25 of 187 (13.5%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22; 95% CI, 0.09–0.55; p = 0.001). Recurrent venous thromboembolism occurred in 3 patients in the warfarin group and 25 patients in the placebo group (HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05–0.43); major bleeding occurred in 4 patients in the warfarin group and in 1 patient in the placebo group (HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 0.44 to 35.89). During the 42-month entire study period (including the study treatment and follow-up periods), the composite outcome occurred in 33 patients (20.8%) in the warfarin group and in 42 (24.0%) in the placebo group (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.47–1.18). Rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism, major bleeding, and unrelated death did not differ between groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism who received 6 months of anticoagulant treatment, an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin reduced the composite outcome of recurrent venous thrombosis and major bleeding compared with placebo. However, benefit was not maintained after discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy.

### Extended oral anticoagulant therapy after a first episode of pulmonary embolism [^114D8KDs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of oral anticoagulant treatment after a first episode of pulmonary embolism remains uncertain.

Objective

To evaluate the long-term clinical benefit of extending a 3-month course of oral anticoagulant therapy to 6 months (pulmonary embolism associated with temporary risk factors) or to 1 year (idiopathic pulmonary embolism) in patients with a first episode of pulmonary embolism.

Design

Multicenter randomized study with independent, blinded assessment of the outcome events.

Setting

19 Italian hospitals.

Patients

326 patients who had had 3 months of oral anticoagulant therapy without experiencing recurrence or bleeding.

Measurements

The primary study outcome was recurrence of symptomatic, objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism.

Results

Among 165 patients assigned to extended anticoagulant therapy, 15 patients (9.1%) had a recurrence of venous thromboembolism (3.1% per patient-year; average follow-up, 34.9 months), as compared with 18 of 161 patients (11.2%) assigned to discontinue treatment (4.1% per patient-year; average follow-up, 32.7 months); the rate ratio was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.42 to 1.56). All but one of the recurrences occurred after anticoagulant treatment was discontinued. Nineteen recurrences (57.6%) were episodes of pulmonary embolism, two of which were fatal. Three major bleeding episodes were observed during extended anticoagulation (1.8%). Among patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism, 11 of 90 patients assigned to extended anticoagulation and 11 of 91 patients assigned to discontinue treatment experienced a recurrence (relative risk, 0.99 [CI, 0.45 to 2.16]).

Conclusion

Patients with pulmonary embolism have a substantial risk for recurrence after discontinuation of oral anticoagulation, regardless of treatment duration. Physicians should try to identify patients who are at high risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism and are therefore potential candidates for indefinite oral anticoagulant therapy.

### Anticoagulation beyond 3 to 6Months: what does the data tell Us? [^1173YnQY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are at risk for a recurrent event. This is particularly true of patients with idiopathic events or events related to low risk triggers. In these patients extending anticoagulation beyond 3 to 6months may be warranted. Using clinical risk, biomarker analysis and risk stratification protocols we can make the best recommendations to patients with respect to the risks and benefits of ongoing therapy. Trials demonstrating benefit from low-dose aspirin for secondary prophylaxis may provide an option for patients in whom ongoing anticoagulation is deemed unsafe. In addition, recent introduction of the direct oral anticoagulants have expanded options for secondary prophylaxis for preventing venous thromboembolism recurrence.

### DVT and pulmonary embolism: part II. treatment and prevention [^111mAF5b]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment goals for deep venous thrombosis include stopping clot propagation and preventing the recurrence of thrombus, the occurrence of pulmonary embolism, and the development of pulmonary hypertension, which can be a complication of multiple recurrent pulmonary emboli. About 30 percent of patients with deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism have a thrombophilia. An extensive evaluation is suggested in patients younger than 50 years with an idiopathic episode of deep venous thrombosis, patients with recurrent thrombosis, and patients with a family history of thromboembolism. Infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by oral administration of warfarin remains the mainstay of treatment for deep venous thrombosis. Subcutaneously administered low-molecular-weight (LMW) heparin is at least as effective as unfractionated heparin given in a continuous infusion. LMW heparin is the agent of choice for treating deep venous thrombosis in pregnant women and patients with cancer. Based on validated protocols, warfarin can be started at a dosage of 5 or 10 mg per day. The intensity and duration of warfarin therapy depends on the individual patient, but treatment of at least three months usually is required. Some patients with thrombophilias require lifetime anticoagulation. Treatment for pulmonary embolism is similar to that for deep venous thrombosis. Because of the risk of hypoxemia and hemodynamic instability, in-hospital management is advised. Unfractionated heparin commonly is used, although LMW heparin is safe and effective. Thrombolysis is used in patients with massive pulmonary embolism. Subcutaneous heparin, LMW heparin, and warfarin have been approved for use in surgical prophylaxis. Elastic compression stockings are useful in patients at lowest risk for thromboembolism. Intermittent pneumatic leg compression is a useful adjunct to anticoagulation and an alternative when anticoagulation is contraindicated.

Heritable thrombophilia

It is not recommended to test for heritable thrombophilia in most patients with a first VTE/PE. However, there are select patient populations in which testing is indicated:

Patients with unfractionated heparin/low molecular weight heparin resistance should be tested for antithrombin deficiency.
Patients with skin necrosis associated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) should be tested for protein C and S deficiency.

Similarly, case finding among asymptomatic relatives of patients with a history of VTE is not recommended in most cases, as the annual risk of thrombosis in family members is low. It is not indicated in asymptomatic relatives of those with low risk thrombophilia (such as factor V Leiden) and, in high risk thrombophilia (such as antithrombin deficiency or protein C or S deficiency), case finding should only be considered in families who are prone to thrombosis (one first-degree or two second-degree relatives with VTE).

In those with confirmed deficiency of antithrombin, protein C or protein S, and patients with homozygous factor V Leiden or homozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation, long-term anticoagulation should be considered after a first episode of PE occurring in the absence of a major reversible risk factor. The 2019 ESC guidelines on management of acute PE advise that testing for thrombophilia may also be considered in patients whose PE occurs at a relatively young age (< 50 years) in the absence of any provoking risk factors, particularly if they have a strong family history of VTE, as testing in these patients may be helpful for treatment decisions. However, it is important to note that thrombophilia testing should not be routinely conducted for unselected patients in order to inform decisions on the duration of anticoagulant treatment; rather, these decisions should be based on the presence or absence of a provoking risk factor for VTE/PE and the risk of bleeding during treatment.

### Recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolism [^1133JM51]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Due to the nonspecific symptoms of the condition, a diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently considered. However, PE will only be confirmed in 10–20% of patients. Because the imaging test of choice, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), is costly and associated with radiation exposure and other complications, a validated diagnostic algorithm consisting of a clinical decision rule and D-dimer test should be used to safely exclude PE in 20–30% of patients without the need for CTPA. Recently, the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold has been validated, and this has increased the proportion of patients at older age in whom PE can be excluded without CTPA. Initial therapeutic management of PE depends on the risk of short-term PE-related mortality. Haemodynamically unstable patients should be closely monitored and receive thrombolytic therapy unless contraindicated because of an unacceptably high bleeding risk, whereas patients with low-risk PE may be safely discharged early from hospital or receive only outpatient treatment. The PESI score and Hestia decision rule are available to select patients in whom early discharge or outpatient treatment will be safe, although the safety of these strategies should be confirmed in additional studies. Standard PE therapy consists of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Recently, several nonvitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants have been shown to be as effective as LMWH/VKAs, and maybe safer. Determining the optimal duration of treatment for a first unprovoked PE remains a challenge, although clinical prediction rules for estimating the risk of recurrence of venous thromboembolism and anticoagulation-associated haemorrhage are under investigation. Using these prediction rules may lead to both more standardized and more individualized long-term treatment of PE.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of JANTOVEN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Optimal length of oral anticoagulant treatment for maximum benefit within 5 years after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants in patients with acute pulmonary embolism who require secondary thromboprophylaxis [^114SF1GR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the main manifestation of venous thromboembolism (VTE) besides deep venous thrombosis. It is associated with relatively high morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is also regarded as a chronic illness since it recurs frequently. For patients with acute PE or a first episode of PE, treatment with oral anticoagulants (OA) for a period of 3 or 6 months is highly recommended by several authoritative guidelines. Nevertheless, after the completion of the 3 or 6 months of anticoagulation with OA, whether or how the following extended treatment is going to proceed is nuanced. Extended OA treatment also known as secondary thromboprophylaxis is oftentimes recommended for patients with acute PE at high risk of recurrence and low risk of bleeding.

In an observational cohort study of patients with PE who survived an initial phase of 3–6 months anticoagulation, over a mean follow-up duration of 2.1 ± 0.3 years, the adjusted rate of the all-cause death or recurrent VTE was 2.1% in the extended and 7.7% in the non-extended anticoagulant groups, for patients treated with extended anticoagulant therapy (p < 0.001). The rate of bleeding was similar between two groups. Extended OA over 2.5 years after index PE provides a net clinical benefit, compared with no anticoagulation in PE patients being selected to receive extended anticoagulation.

Nevertheless, the role of length of OA treatment in long-term outcome such as 5 years after OA discontinuation has been understudied to date, despite it has been already recognised that extended OA use is more beneficial than no extended OA use, for patients with acute PE who require secondary thromboprophylaxis. The optimal length of OA use for the maximum benefit within 5 years after OA discontinuation in patients with acute PE requiring secondary thromboprophylaxis has been undefined by far. Consequently, the current study was performed to investigate this subject.

### Length of anticoagulation in provoked venous thromboembolism: a multicenter study of how real-world practice mirrors guideline recommendations [^112o1YVh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Most patients in our real‐world multicenter cohort study with provoked VTE received longer duration of anticoagulation therapy than recommended by ACCP guidelines. Patients taking DOACs with a history of recurrent VTE and a history of myocardial infarction were more likely to received longer treatment than what was guideline recommended. This study identifies a group of patients with provoked VTE who were more likely to receive prolonged anticoagulation and may be at increased risk of anticoagulant‐related bleeding complications. Further study will be necessary to investigate how the duration of anticoagulation therapy changes with evolving guidelines and increasingly widespread DOAC use.

### Long-term risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism among patients receiving extended oral anticoagulant therapy for first unprovoked venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112gwswZ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The long-term risk for recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) during extended anticoagulation for a first unprovoked VTE is uncertain.

Objectives

To determine the incidence of recurrent VTE during extended anticoagulation of up to 5 years in patients with a first unprovoked VTE.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL were searched to identify randomized trials and prospective cohort studies reporting recurrent VTE among patients with a first unprovoked VTE who were to receive anticoagulation for a minimum of six additional months after completing ≥ 3 months of initial treatment. Unpublished data on number of recurrent VTE and person-years, obtained from authors of included studies, were used to calculate study-level incidence rate, and random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool results.

Results

Twenty-six studies and 15 603 patients were included in the analysis. During 11 631 person-years of follow-up, the incidence of recurrent VTE and fatal pulmonary embolism per 100 person-years was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.03–1.84) and 0.09 (0.04–0.16), with 5-year cumulative incidences of 7.1% (3.0%-13.2%) and 1.2% (0.4%-4.6%), respectively. The incidence of recurrent VTE was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.77–1.44) with direct oral anticoagulants and 1.55 (1.01–2.20) with vitamin K antagonists. The case-fatality rate of recurrent VTE was 4.9% (95% CI, 2.2%-8.7%).

Conclusions

In patients with a first unprovoked VTE, the long-term risk of recurrent VTE during extended anticoagulation is low but not negligible. Thus, clinicians and patients should be aware of this risk and take appropriate and timely action in case of suspicion of recurrent VTE. Estimates from this study can be used to advise patients on what to expect while receiving extended anticoagulation, and estimate the net clinical benefit of extended treatment to guide long-term management of unprovoked VTE.

### Provoked vs minimally provoked vs unprovoked VTE: does it matter? [^114eY82s]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a multifactorial disease, and its risk depends on exposure to risk factors and predisposing conditions. Based on their strength of association with a VTE episode, risk factors are classified as major or minor and determined using a temporal pattern to be transient or persistent. All patients with VTE should receive anticoagulant treatment for at least 3 months in the absence of an absolute contraindication. Beyond this period, selected patients may be candidates for an extended phase of anticoagulation aimed at secondary VTE prevention. The risk of recurrent VTE if anticoagulation is discontinued is probably the main driver of decision-making regarding extended treatment. The risk of recurrence after VTE associated with major risk factors is low if the risk factor is no longer present. In this case, treatment can be discontinued. If the major risk factor is persistent, anticoagulation should be continued. After VTE occurring in the absence of risk factors, anticoagulation should probably be continued indefinitely if the risk for bleeding is low and preferably with minimal effective doses of anticoagulants. VTE occurring after exposure to minor risk factors is probably the most challenging situation, especially if the clinical manifestation was acute pulmonary embolism. Understanding the actual role of minor risk factors in the occurrence of VTE helps in estimating the risk of recurrence and avoiding the dangers associated with unnecessary anticoagulation. The availability of safer strategies for anticoagulation could allow personalized strategies for secondary prevention of VTE.

### The risk for fatal pulmonary embolism after discontinuing anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism [^111ycsEW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The long-term risk for fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) after treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) may be an important factor in the decision to discontinue this treatment.

Objective

To provide reliable and precise estimates of the annual risk for fatal PE and the case-fatality rate of disease recurrence and to assess these outcomes according to the initial presentation of VTE (deep venous thrombosis [DVT], PE, or both) and its etiology (secondary or idiopathic) in patients who have discontinued anticoagulant therapy.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Academic medical centers.

Patients

Inception cohort of patients with a first episode of symptomatic VTE who discontinued anticoagulant therapy.

Measurements

Incidence rates of any fatal PE (which included sudden death from possible fatal PE) and definite or probable PE per 100 person-years of follow-up and case-fatality rate of recurrent VTE.

Results

Of 2052 patients studied, 1450 had DVT, 310 had PE, and 292 had DVT and PE. The mean duration of previous anticoagulant therapy was 6 months (range, 3 to 39 months), and the mean duration of follow-up after discontinuation of treatment was 54 months (range, 1 to 120 months). The annual risk for any fatal PE and definite or probable fatal PE after discontinuation of anticoagulation was 0.49 events (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.64 events) per 100 person-years and 0.19 events (CI, 0.12 to 0.30 events) per 100 person-years, respectively. The case-fatality rate of recurrent disease was 9.0% (CI, 6.8% to 11.8%) for any fatal PE and 3.8% (CI, 2.4% to 5.9%) for definite or probable fatal PE.

Limitation

The findings are less pertinent to patients with active cancer, permanent immobility, or high-risk thrombophilia.

Conclusion

The risk for fatal PE is 0.19 to 0.49 events per 100 person-years for patients who have finished a course of anticoagulant therapy for a first episode of symptomatic VTE. The case-fatality rate for death from recurrent PE is 4% to 9%. This information helps to inform patient prognosis and may assist clinicians in deciding whether to discontinue anticoagulant therapy for VTE.

### Optimal length of oral anticoagulant treatment for maximum benefit within 5 years after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants in patients with acute pulmonary embolism who require secondary thromboprophylaxis [^1132LoyR]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The results of the current study may yield some clinical implications for clinicians. First, for patients with acute PE who require secondary thromboprophylaxis, it is recommended to use OA for more than 2 years in order to reduce long-term PE-related mortality, although it is futile for the improvement of all-cause mortality. Second, overall OA use for 2 to 3 years after PE diagnosis may be the optimal length to acquire long-term low incidence of VTE recurrence, an acceptable bleeding rates and the best net clinical benefit, for patients with acute PE who require secondary thromboprophylaxis. Third, unfortunately, the cumulative risk of bleeding increases gradually along with the gradual elongation of length of OA use. It is not recommended to use OA for more than 3 years due to the possibly high bleeding risk and inferior net clinical benefit. Of note, notwithstanding the results of the current study suggested that 2 to 3 years of OA use is the optimal length for an outcome 5 years after OA discontinuation in patients with acute PE who require extended anticoagulation, whether the results still hold true longer than 5 years after OA discontinuation is unclear. In addition, due to the inconsiderable number of patients who underwent OA use for more than 3 years, this patient population was not subdivided according to the specific length of OA use. As such, the relationship is unknown between the specific length of OA use in patients who underwent OA use for more than 3 years and the 5-year outcomes after OA discontinuation. Nevertheless, the benefit of an overall OA use for 2–3 years is at least non-inferior to an OA use for more than 3 years with respect to outcomes by and large. Taking into account of the increasing bleeding risk along with the gradual extension of OA use, the OA use for 2 to 3 years should be preferred than that for more than 3 years. Finally, despite a general length of 3 or 6 months of anticoagulation is defined for acute PE patients, it does not mean that they have to neither more nor less undergo 3 or 6 months of anticoagulation without any variation, due to unpredictable change of risk factors for thrombosis or bleeding. OA may be prematurely terminated due to major bleeding or proceed owing to unsolved risk factors for thrombosis. Likewise, the same applies to PE patients requiring secondary thromboprophylaxis. Being similar to the initial 3 or 6 months of anticoagulation for acute PE, the 2–3 years of anticoagulation for secondary thromboprophylaxis is also a general recommendation.

### Optimal follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism: a position paper of the European Society of Cardiology working group on pulmonary circulation and right ventricular function, in collaboration with the European Society of Cardiology working group on atherosclerosis and vascular biology, endorsed by the European Respiratory Society [^111a7vEY]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Since no biomarkers and surrogate measures to refine cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with PE have been established, we propose to perform systematic cardiovascular risk assessment in all PE patients, using validated scores and risk calculators, and according to current guidelines. Patients with PE and a high cardiovascular risk score, especially in case of unprovoked PE and/or obesity, may require urgent attention to controlling risk factors. We propose that a holistic assessment of risk factors is performed at the routine 3-month follow-up visit, while individual risk factors such as smoking and hypertension should be targeted at the earliest convenience.

In PE patients with established cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular drugs may be discontinued or modified during the acute phase of treatment. This is particularly relevant for beta-blockers and antihypertensive drugs, the administration of which should be carefully re-evaluated in acute PE presenting with hypotension and/or severe RV dysfunction. Careful assessment of the expected benefits vs. risks of such drugs should guide management decisions in the individual patient. Similar anticoagulant strategies based on assessment of the risk of bleeding and ischaemic complications as in patients with atrial fibrillation can be followed. Triple therapy for longer than 1 week should be considered when risk of stent thrombosis outweighs the bleeding risk, with the total duration (< 1 month) decided according to assessment of these risks. Triple therapy may be considered for up to 6 months in selected patients with high ischaemic risk. The treatment plan should be clearly specified at hospital discharge, and this strategy should be re-evaluated at regular intervals during follow-up. i.e. with a short period of overlapping antiplatelet therapy after myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting, to mitigate the risk of bleeding. For PE patients with established ischaemic cardiovascular disease, the full dose of anticoagulation should be continued for as long as indicated; a dose reduction in accordance with the label of rivaroxaban and apixaban after a treatment period of 6 months is not applicable in these patients.

### Differences in duration of anticoagulation after pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis: findings from the Swiss venous thromboEmbolism registry (SWIVTER) [^1121GdZ3]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the two manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), vary considerably, the consensus guidelines recommend similar algorithms for therapeutic anticoagulation in both conditions. Real-world data assessing contemporary management strategies in PE and DVT alone may help tailoring future recommendations towards more individualized patient care.

Methods

In the present analysis, we compared demographics, comorbidities, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of PE versus DVT only among 2062 consecutive patients with confirmed VTE enrolled by 11 acute care hospitals between November 2012 and February 2015 in the SWIss Venous ThromboEmbolism Registry (SWIVTER).

Results

Overall, 1246 (60%) patients were diagnosed with PE. In comparison to DVT alone, PE patients were older (66 vs. 59 years; p < 0.001), more frequently had acute and chronic comorbidities, less frequently had prior VTE and hormone replacement, and were less often pregnant. VTE was considered similarly often provoked in patients with PE and DVT alone (33.8% vs. 33.5%; p = 0.88). Anticoagulation for an indefinite duration was more often prescribed to patients with PE than those with DVT alone (45.7 vs. 19.6%; p < 0.001), and PE diagnosis was the strongest independent predictor of indefinite anticoagulation (OR 3.21; 95% CI 2.55–4.06; p < 0.001). Diagnosis of PE was associated with both increased risk of 90-day mortality (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.44–3.71; p = 0.001) and major bleeding (HR 3.88, 95% CI 1.63–9.22; p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Our analysis affirms differences in demographics, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of PE versus DVT alone. In routine clinical practice, duration of anticoagulation is being managed differently between the two manifestations of VTE, in contrast to recommendations of the current consensus guidelines.

### What is the optimal duration of treatment for DVT? An update on evidence-based medicine of treatment for DVT [^114QCH9i]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represent a major source of morbidity and mortality today. Incidence of DVT is estimated to be 56 to 160/100,000 population per year. Systemic anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin with initiation of oral vitamin K antagonist therapy has been shown to be beneficial in preventing pulmonary embolism and reducing extension and recurrence of DVT. The duration of anticoagulation following an episode of DVT is determined by the greatest predictors of recurrence. These include the presence of reversible risk factors, nonreversible risk factors, and no risk factors (idiopathic or unprovoked DVT). Short durations of anticoagulation are only appropriate for calf DVTs in patients with reversible risk factors. Patients with nonreversible risk factors, such as malignancy and certain inherited thrombophilias with a strong family history of venous thromboembolism will require lifelong anticoagulation. Those with proximal DVT due to reversible risk factors require 3 to 6 months of anticoagulation. Patients with idiopathic DVT require reassessment of risk-to-benefit ratio of hemorrhage from oral vitamin K antagonist therapy compared to reducing risk of recurrence and frequently require prolonged oral anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring with d-dimer and serial ultrasounds may offer an individualized approach to therapy.

In practice, determining an individual patient's risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) without warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists is difficult. However, there are many factors (both intrinsic and environmental) that can alter the risk of VTE recurrence. This paper will discuss evidence and considerations (including the issue of bleeding risk) that may be relevant to decisions about duration of anticoagulant therapy for patients with VTE.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115W9g7j]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Duration of anticoagulant therapy and recurrence risk — AT9 compared four treatment durations: "(1) 4 or 6 weeks; (2) 3 months; (3) longer than 3 months but still a time-limited course of therapy (usually 6 or 12 months); or (4) extended (also termed "indefinite"; no scheduled stopping date) therapy". Recurrence risk after stopping therapy was assessed in four subgroups: surgery-provoked VTE with "3% recurrence at 5 years"; VTE provoked by a nonsurgical transient risk factor (e.g., "flight of > 8 h") with "15% recurrence at 5 years"; unprovoked VTE with "30% recurrence at 5 years"; and cancer-associated VTE with "15% annualized risk of recurrence", with 5-year recurrence not estimated. The text also notes that risk after "an isolated distal DVT was half that after a proximal DVT or PE".
